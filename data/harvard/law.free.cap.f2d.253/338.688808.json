In early 1954, after some three years of employment, he was suspended by the Secretary of the Interior on charges (among other things) (1) that he was a member of, affiliated with, or in sympathetic association with, the Communist Party, (2) that his behavior, activities and associations tended to show that he was not reliable or trustworthy, and (3) that he had \u201cdeliberately misrepresented, falsified or omitted material facts\u201d in answering, under oath, questions addressed to him in 1952 by the Interior Department Loyalty Board. The charges were purportedly made pursuant to the Act of August 26, 1950, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 22-1 (1952), and Executive Order No. 10450, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 631 note, 18 Fed.Reg. 2489 (1953). Plaintiff-appellant filed an answer, together with some forty-four affidavits. He was given a hearing before a Security Hearing Board. Appellant was present in person, and had the services of counsel. He was not confronted with any witnesses. Certain confidential information was not disclosed to him. At the hearing, the Government attorney stated that appellant was not charged with disloyalty, and that the \u201cquestion is only whether he is a security risk.\u201d Some weeks after the hearing, the Secretary of the Interior made findings sustaining the charges, and dismissed appellant. A rehearing was granted, and additional testimony taken. Reinstatement, however, was refused. Suit was then commenced in the District Court. The Government, as explained in the concluding paragraph of this opinion, thereafter issued a new notice of termination of appellant\u2019s employment, and expunged its records of adverse findings. Summary judgment was requested by the Government, and granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention is that he must be reinstated because \u2014 as the Government admits \u2014 the position he occupied was not a sensitive one, and accordingly the Act of 1950 and Executive Order No. 10450 could have no application to him, under the doctrine of Cole v. Young, 1956, 351 U.S. 536, 76 S. Ct. 861, 100 L.Ed. 1396. The question is, then, whether Cole requires his reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-17\">The decision of the Supreme Court in Cole was based on the traditional responsibility of the courts to insure that Government employees sought to be dismissed are given the. benefit of all procedural protections required by statute or regulation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court laid down no general prohibition of dismissals on security or loyalty grounds. On the contrary, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-18\">\u201cIn interpreting the 1950 Act, it is important to note that the Act is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>not the only, nor even the primary, source of authority to dismiss Government employees. The general personnel laws \u2014 the Lloyd-LaFol-lette and Veterans\u2019 Preference Acts [5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 652, 863] \u2014 authorize dismissals for \u2018such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service\u2019, and the ground which we conclude was the basis for petitioner\u2019s discharge here \u2014 a reasonable doubt as to his loyalty \u2014 was recognized as a \u2019cause\u2019 for dismissal under those procedures as early as 1942. * * * Thus there was no want of substantive authority to dismiss employees \u25a0on loyalty grounds, and the question for decision here is not whether an employee <em>can </em>be dismissed on such grounds but only the extent to which the summary <em>procedures </em>authorized by the 1950 Act are available in such a case.\u201d 351 U.S. at pages 543-544, 76 S.Ct. at page 866. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The inquiry in Cole was, therefore, a procedural one. The plaintiff in that case was a veteran. Notwithstanding that fact he was denied the protections and procedures of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. The Supreme Court held that he should have been given the benefits of that Act and remanded the case to the District Court for appropriate proceedings. Similarly, in Service v. Dulles, 1957, 354 U.S. 363, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403, the dismissed employee was an officer in the Foreign Service of the United States \u201cand as such was entitled to the protection of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, as amended. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq. [22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801 et seq.]\u201d 354 U.S. at page 371 note 12, 77 S.Ct. at page 1156. As the Supreme Court pointed out, the procedures required by that Act were not afforded to him. When the Supreme Court held that the action which the Government had taken in an effort to dismiss Service was invalid, it thus became clear (as was true in Cole) that if the Government wished to press its charges once more it must do so under the required statutory procedure. In the case at bar the petitioner had no prescribed tenure of office and is not a veteran, nor a member of the Foreign Service, nor in any other specially-protected group. He is not a member of the classified civil service and accordingly is not entitled to such protection as the Lloyd-LaFollette Act gives. 37 Stat. 555 (1912), 5 U.S. C. A. \u00a7 652 (1952). Nor, of course, is he entitled to the procedural protections provided by the Act of August 26, 1950, which has no application to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">Persons situated as was the appellant are, we may assume, entitled to be free from dismissal on unconstitutional or flagrantly arbitrary grounds. Wieman v. Updegraff, 1952, 344 U.S. 183, 191, 192, 73 S.Ct. 215, 97 L.Ed, 216; McGinty v. Brownell, 1957, 101 U.S.App. D. C. 368, 249 F.2d 124. But no such dismissal occurred here. Dismissal on loyalty or security grounds certainly is not unconstitutional <em>per </em>se; the Supreme Court\u2019s language in Cole refutes any contention of that sort.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And the treatment accorded appellant was in no way arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>trary, or lacking in due process. See Bailey v. Richardson, supra note 3, 86 U.S.App.D.C. at page 260, 182 F.2d at page 58. He was given written charges, and an opportunity to answer them, together with a hearing. This was more than he was entitled to under any statute or regulation applicable to persons of his employment status.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"> It is true, as appellant urges, that an administrative order \u201ccannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained.\u201d Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 1943, 318 U.S. 80, 95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 462, 87 L.Ed. 626.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But, as the Supreme Court made clear in the second Chenery case, the courts will disturb the agency\u2019s conclusion \u201conly if it lacks <em>any </em>rational and statutory foundation.\u201d Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 1947, 332 U.S. 194, 207, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1582, 1760, 91 L.Ed. 1995. (Emphasis supplied.) In this case there was clearly a \u201crational\u201d foundation for the Secretary\u2019s dismissal of appellant. There was also a sufficient \u201cstatutory\u201d foundation\u2014 the constitutional power of the Executive to dismiss subordinates: a power not limited in the present instance by statute or regulation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">For these reasons, we find that appellant was legally discharged, even though the proceedings were improperly labelled as being brought under the authority of the Act of 1950 and Executive Order No. 10450. He was not deprived \u2014in contrast to the situation in Cole and Service \u2014 of any procedural right or protection to which he was entitled. It may be noted, too, that one of the grounds of dismissal furnishes a clear basis for the Secretary\u2019s action, quite apart from the questions raised by the appellant. Charge 3 against appellant reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">\u201c3. Your behavior, activities and associations tend to show that <em>you are not reliable or trustworthy, </em>and the facts above alleged furnish reason to believe that <em>you have deliberately misrepresented, falsified or omitted material facts </em>in connection, with your said behavior, activities, and associations, and these facts also-furnish reason to believe that you. may be subjected to coercion, influence, or pressure which may cause: you to act contrary to the best interests of national security.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The charge of untrustworthiness and deliberate misrepresentation was found by the Secretary of the Interior to have been sustained on the evidence before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\"> There is no basis on which we can weigh the evidence, or conclude that the Secretary\u2019s action in dismissing appellant could not properly be rested on that ground. The power of the Executive to discharge for untrustworthiness, or deliberate misrepresentation is beyond dispute, even under the here inapplicable Lloyd-LaFollette and Veterans\u201d Preference Acts. See Williams v. Cravens, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 380, 381, 210 F.. 2d 874, 875, certiorari denied sub nom. Williams v. Robbins, 1954, 348 U.S. 819,. 75 S.Ct. 30, 99 L.Ed. 646; Kohlberg v. Gray, 1953, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 207 F.2d 35, certiorari denied 1954, 346 U.S. 937,. 74 S.Ct. 377, 98 L.Ed. 425. And, so long-as one<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the grounds announced ap\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>pears rational and proper, courts have refused to review the evidence or to examine the merits of the executive officer\u2019s finding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is not our function to decide whether appellant was or was not untrustworthy, or a \u201csecurity risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">An additional point remains. Appellant asserts that the Secretary\u2019s action illegally fastened upon him a \u201cbadge of infamy,\u201d which can be removed only by his reinstatement. We think, however, that the Secretary\u2019s mistaken reliance on the Act of 1950 and Executive Order No. 10450 does not require the relief appellant asks. The record shows that appellant\u2019s notice of termination, as originally issued, stated that action was \u201cbeing taken in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 10450.\u201d But, two years later, after suit had been brought in the District Court, a new notice was issued which omitted the quoted statement. An affidavit was also filed by an official of the Civil Service Commission stating that \u201call records of the said Commission have been expunged of all adverse findings made with respect to Mr. William Vincent Vitarelli under Executive Order 10450.\u201d We think that this voluntary action by the Government is equivalent to the maximum relief a court might have been justified in granting under all the circumstances of the case. See Peters v. Hobby, 1955, 349 U.S. 331, 349, 75 S.Ct. 790, 99 L.Ed. 1129; Service v. Dulles, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 268, 272, 235 <em>F.2d </em>215, 219, reversed on other grounds 1957, 354 U.S. 363, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.

Where the Executive extended \u2014 by Executive Order No. 10450 \u2014 the provisions of the 1950 Act to employees in sensitive positions who might not, under that Act standing alone, be entitled to the procedural protections outlined in the Executive Order, this court held the Government to observance of those protections. Haynes v. Tilomas, supra note 1 (probationary employee in Navy Department held entitled to protections of Executive Order No. 10450). But where, as here, the employee is not in a position declared sensitive, the 1950 Act and the Executive Order are inapplicable to him, under the rule in Cole. The decision in Service v. Dulles, supra note 1, relied on by appellant, is not pertinent unless statutes or regulations \u201cwere indeed applicable and were violated.\u201d 354 U.S. at page 373, 77 S.Ct. at page 1157.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-18\">.
