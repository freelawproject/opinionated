After examining that testimony, the district court denied the motion to dismiss the indictment; but at the same time, on its own motion, ordered another hearing and requested counsel to stipulate to answers to the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-16\"><em>\u201c1. </em>Did the defendant understand English at the time he was before the Grand Jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-17\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Was the defendant warned, outside of the transcript of testimony, of his constitutional right to refuse to answer questions which might tend to incriminate him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-18\">\u201c3. Did the defendant have legal counsel prior to testifying before the Grand Jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-19\">\u201c4. Irrespective of legal counsel, did the defendant understand his constitutional rights, himself?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-20\">The United States attorney advised that the Government was not in position to answer any of the four questions either in the affirmative or the negative. A hearing was held at which Orta and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>three witnesses testified to Orta\u2019s ignorance of his rights and unfamiliarity with the English language. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court ordered and adjudged that Orta\u2019s testimony taken before the Grand Jury be suppressed and that the indictment be dismissed. The United - States appeals from that judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The district court did not state its findings or issue an opinion as to its reasons for suppressing the testimony and dismissing the indictment. Both parties assume that the judgment was based on the court\u2019s opinion that the appellee\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment had been infringed. Upon appeal, however, we think that the issues should extend to whether the judgment was proper for any reason. Rule 41(e),- Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U. S.C.A., provides for a pretrial hearing on a motion to suppress evidence in search and seizure cases only; and several cases have held that evidence may be suppressed <em>prior to indictment </em>only in cases where constitutional rights have been violated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clearly, however, the district court might properly conduct a pretrial hearing in this case to determine the collateral issue as to whether the evidence should be suppressed because wrongfully obtained for any reason.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\"> It is clear that the protection of the Fifth Amendment relates to crimes alleged to have been committed before the time when the testimony is sought. A witness, ignorant and uninformed of his constitutional rights, would not intelligently waive them if he testified, thinking that he was compelled to do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He might answer truthfully and thereafter assert the constitutional guaranty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under no circumstances, however, could he commit perjury and successfully claim that the Constitution afforded him protection from prosecution for that crime. As said in Glickstein v. United States, 1911, 222 U.S. 139, 142, 32 S.Ct. 71, 73, 56 L.Ed. 128; \u201c* * * the immunity afforded by the constitutional guaranty relates to the past, and does not endow the person who testifies with a license to commit perjury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">The only debatable question is one of the supervision of the conduct of Government representatives in the interest of fairness. In United States v. Scully, 2 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 113, 116, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-15\">\u201c * * * the mere possibility that the witness may later be indicted furnishes no basis for requiring that he be advised of his rights under the Fifth Amendment, when summoned to give testimony before a Grand Jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">That holding is applicable to the present record. There is no showing that the Grand Jury before which Orta testified was seeking to indict him or any other person already identified. An opening statement had been made to the Grand Jurors as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-18\">\u201cMr. Lenvin: My name is Nathan Lenvin and I am the Chief of the Registration Section of the Internal Security Division of the Department of Justice. My main responsibility is the enforcement and administration of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended, and the Voorhees (sic) Act. The Foreign Agents Registration Act requires the registration with the Attorney General of any person who acts within the United States as an agent of a foreign principal, and the Voorhees (sic) Act requires the reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>istration with the Attorney General of an organization which advocates the overthrow of a government, not necessarily the government of the United States, by the use of force or violence, or which advocates the use of such means for the overthrow of a government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">\u201cWe have received information that there are individuals and organizations within the United States who had been acting as agents of an underground movement in Cuba and who had advocated the violent \u25a0overthrow of the Batista Government in Cuba. At this time this information is not sufficiently specific to warrant a request of the grand jury for the return of an indictment, but we are anxious to conduct an investigative proceeding before this grand jury to determine exactly, if we can, what these groups and individuals have been doing within the United States which may be in violation of federal statutes. It may be that at the close of this proceeding the evidence will be sufficient to warrant submitting this matter for your consideration for the return of an indictment, but at this stage of the proceeding we are simply engaged in an exploratory procedure.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj-\">An almost identical factual situation was faced by the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Parker, 1957, 244 F.2d 943, and in an able opinion by Judge Finnegan it was held that the failure to apprise the witness of his privilege against self-incrimination did not make his perjurious testimony illegally obtained evidence. The views there expressed, with which we are <em>in </em>full agreement, make further discussion in this case unnecessary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Perjury is one of the most elemental of all crimes. Every sane person from the beginning of time has recognized its moral iniquity. No one can fail to know that any civilized system of laws must denounce perjury because it pollutes the very fountainhead of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> . \u201c\u00a7 1621.
