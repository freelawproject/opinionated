Jurisdiction was in the lower court. 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 22. This Court has jurisdiction of the timely appeal. 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-20\">The trade-mark in question consists of the words \u201cWonder Chair,\u201d (with a disclaimer as to the word \u201cChair\u201d apart from the mark) as applied to \u201cReclining Chairs and Convertible Chair Beds\u201d in Class 32, Furniture and Upholstery.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-21\">The court, trying the case without a jury, made findings which stated that appellants adopted and used the words \u201cWonder Bed\u201d for a lounge or contour bed, which is capable of being adjusted for use as a bed, a lounge, or a reclining chair. (Finding 11.) Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-22\">\u201cThe said lounges or contour beds thus sold and distributed by the Defendants are embraced within the product line of goods specified in Plaintiff\u2019s Trade-mark Certificate and have substantially the same descriptive properties as Plaintiff\u2019s reclining chairs and/or convertible Patent Office classification, namely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Class 32 (Furniture and Upholstery).\u201d <em>(Finding </em>12.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The Conclusion of the District Court was that appellee\u2019s trade-mark was valid, and infringed by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Appellants object to the Findings and Conclusions hereinabove mentioned, and to (a) the injunction granted; (b) the damages of $1000.00 awarded; and (c) the attorneys\u2019 fees of $500.00 awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Since our determination on the question of infringement is dispositive of this appeal, we find no occasion to pass upon the propriety of the finding below that appellee\u2019s trade-mark was valid. We, therefore, refrain from consideration of the validity of the trade-mark sued upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The primary question, then, is whether the appellant has in any way infringed the trade-mark claimed by appellee. We understand that there are three tests readily applied to any trademark to determine if there has been \u201cidentification.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-8\">(1) Is there similarity of sound?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">(2) Is there similarity of sight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-10\">(3) Is there similarity of meaning?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"afm-dedup-0\">Let us examine the respective marks actually used by the parties. Appellee trade-marked the words \u201cWonder Chair.\u201d It most frequently, though not always, used the words \u201cBell\u2019s Wonder Chair\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 19), or, \u201cBell Wonder Chair\u2014 (not a bed)\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 6), or, \u201cThe Bell Wonder Chair-Bed\u201d (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 9), or, \u201cWonder Love Seat\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 9), or, \u201cWonder Cushioned Divan\u201d (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">Appellants used the words \u201cSleeper Lounge, The Wonder Bed\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 13 to 18, inch; Defendants\u2019 Exhibits B and E), or, \u201cElectrical Wonder Bed\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 20), although, originally it used merely \u201cSleeper Lounge Bed\u201d (Defendants\u2019 Exhibits A, F, G, H, and J), or, \u201cSleeper Lounge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-18\"><em>I </em>\u2014 Was <em>the Trade-mark Infringed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AR5\">Appellee urges that any use of the word \u201cwonder\u201d <em>is an exact copy </em>of the mark used by appellee. Appellee, to be logical, must assume that use of the phrase \u201cWonder Bed\u201d is so similar to \u201cWonder Chair\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in meaning as to be an exact copy. And that \u201cWonder Bench\u201d or \u201cWonder Car\u201d (on each of which one sits) would be a colorable imitation of this trade-mark. This seems illogical, particularly when the evidence discloses the Patent Office has issued, prior to plaintiff\u2019s application, trademarks as follows: (a) \u201cWonder-Bar,\u201d No. 554,367, (b) \u201cWonder Bar,\u201d No. 572,430, (c) \u201cWonder Value,\u201d No. 359,027, and, (d) \u201cWonderfoam,\u201d No. 585,899, <em>all being in Class 32, \u201cFurniture and Upholstery.\u201d </em>(Defendants\u2019 Exhibit D.)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-21\">But we have seen appellants have not used simply \u201cWonder Bed,\u201d but \u201cSleeper Lounge, The Wonder Bed\u201d while appel-lee has used not simply \u201cWonder Chair,\u201d but \u201cBell\u2019s Wonder Chair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">We are required to consider the composite trade-mark in its entirety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-23\">Is there any likelihood of confusion or mistake in such use? Would the ordinary purchaser, buying with ordinary caution, be misled? It is true that the question of any likelihood of confusion or mistake depends on many factors, including type of product involved, the manner of distribution of the product, the market for the product, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>product\u2019s function, and the similarity between the registered marks, and the alleged infringing word or phrase. But the latter is the one essential feature, without which the others have no probative value. And in this case there has been not a word of testimony relating to any actual mistake, nor of a single purchaser mistaking the Bell Chair for a Sleeper Lounge Bed, or vice versa. There has been no missent mail, and no mistaken phone calls.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACN1\">We do not see how any intent to confuse or deceive can be laid at appellants\u2019 door. There is use of entirely different format; there is no similarity of sight or sound; there is no more similarity of meaning than if appellee advertised a \u201cWonderful Chair\u201d and the appellants a \u201cWonderful Bed;\u201d one a \u201cBeautiful\u201d or \u201cBeauty Bed;\u201d the other a \u201cBeautiful\u201d or \u201cBeauty Chair.\u201d Without proof of secondary meaning there can be no confusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Since the trial court rested its finding of infringement primarily on the similarity of meaning between the trademarks, \u201cBell\u2019s Wonder Chair\u201d and \u201cSleeper Lounge, The Wonder Bed,\u201d we are \u201cin as good a position as the trial judge to determine the probability of confusion.\u201d Miles Shoes, Inc., v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 1952, 199 F.2d 602, certiorari denied 345 U.S. 909, 73 S.Ct. 650, 97 L.Ed. 1345; Warner Brothers Co. v. Jantzen, 2 Cir., 1957, 249 F.2d 353, 355 (dissent).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">In McCormick &amp; Co., Inc. v. B. Manischewitz Co., 6 Cir., 1953, 206 F.2d 744, the court holds at page 746: See, also, Best &amp; Co. v. Miller, 2 Cir., 1948, 167 F.2d 374; California Fruit Growers Exchange v. Sunkist Baking Co., 7 Cir., 1948,166 F.2d 971.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">\u201c* * * It also follows that while extrinsic facts are significant, the likelihood of confusion may as readily be perceived by a reviewing court upon visual comparison as by a court of first instance, unless extrinsic facts compel determination one way or the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Appellee manufactured a chair capable of assuming the position and appearance of a, bed; appellants manufactured only beds, incapable of assuming the position or appearance of a chair. In using either product, an occupant could so arrange the piece of furniture that he could \u201clounge\u201d in it. Appellee\u2019s chair was sold for, and as, a bed, but appellants\u2019 bed was not sold for, or as, a chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">We can find no evidence of confusion in the record, nor any evidence of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">We find no infringement. Judson-Dunaway Corp. v. Hygienic Products, 1 Cir., 1949, 178 F.2d 461; 3 Callmanp, Unfair Comp. and Trade-Marks (2nd Ed. 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\"><em>II </em>\u2014 The <em>Damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">No actual damages were proved at the trial. No loss of business was proved. There was no showing of fraud or palming off. Good faith is a defense. So is the <em>de minimis </em>rule. Had there been infringement here, injunctive provisions would have satisfied all the equities of the case. Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 1900, 179 U.S. 42, 21 S.Ct. 16, 45 L.Ed. 77; Golden West Brewing Co. v. Milonas &amp; Sons, 9 Cir., 1939, 104 F.2d 880, 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">The statute authorizing recovery of damages does not require such an award in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-18\">In view of our conclusion of lack of infringement, there can be no damages awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-19\"><em>Ill </em>\u2014 Attorneys\u2019 <em>Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-20\">We find no authority for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case, even had there been infringement. None has been cited to us. There was no basis proved for punitive damages. Perhaps some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>day Callmann\u2019s suggestion and advice will be incorporated into statute or judicial legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We will not do so here, for this is not the case, factually, in which to innovate.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The judgment is reversed, with instructions to the lower court to enter a decree establishing the validity of the mark; that there has been no violation thereof; with no damages awarded, and no attorneys\u2019 fees in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-13\">. Disclaimed material forming part of a registered trade-mark cannot be ignored. It is still part of the composite trademark which must be considered in its entirety. P. D. Beckwith\u2019s Estate v.
