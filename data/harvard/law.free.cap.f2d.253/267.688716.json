This amount was to b,e held as security pending disposition of Steckel\u2019s appeal from a judgment of around $190,000, attorneys\u2019 fees due by him to Lurie and Alper, which judgment was affirmed and paid, with the balance of the $225,000 being paid to Steckel in 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">We concur in the reasoning that Steck-el\u2019s realization of gain on the disposition of stock should not be. deferred for the sole reason that the proceeds are deposited with a third party who would ultimately either pay the money to the taxpayer, or use it in whole or in part to discharge the taxpayer\u2019s lawful debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-18\">We concur further in the Tax Court\u2019s holding that any capital losses or non-business expense deductions to which Steckel was entitled upon payment of the judgment in 1951 cannot properly be related back to 1949'.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-19\">Accordingly, the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
