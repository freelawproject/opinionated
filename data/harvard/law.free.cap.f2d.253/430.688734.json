D-165,346 Dec. 4, 1951</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aop-dedup-0\">Wark et al. D-172,912 Aug. 24,1954</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-20\">Becken Book, 1942, page 301, Item 301 H 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyA\">National Carbon Co., May 1, 1926, pages 1 and 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">It became belatedly apparent at the oral argument in this court that the Wark et al. reference may not legally be used as a reference to show prior art since the application for that patent was not filed until November 20, 1953, nearly three months <em>after </em>the filing of appellant\u2019s application. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102. The Patent Office solicitor conceded at the argument that this legal error had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-22\">Since it is evident that both the examiner and the Board of Appeals proceeded under a misunderstanding, the examiner definitely relying on Wark et al. and the board finding that \u201cthe examiner\u2019s action is without reversible error,\u201d and the parties having briefed the case on the same misunderstanding, we are reversing the decision of the board and remanding the case to the Patent Office with instructions to reexamine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>application without regard to the Wark et al. patent. We express no opinion on the merits at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
