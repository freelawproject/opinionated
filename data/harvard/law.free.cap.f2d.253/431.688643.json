(Edlo, Inc., as-signee, substituted) to the registration by appellee, Hawthorn-Mellody Farms Dairy, Inc., of the trade-mark \u201cVita-Slim\u201d for fluid milk. The opposition was based on appellant\u2019s alleged prior use of \u201cSlim\u201d as a trade-mark for fluid milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The record shows continuing use of the word \u201cslim,\u201d in large letters, on- skim milk cartons by appellant and its licensees, beginning in July 1949. Such use antedates appellee\u2019s alleged date of first use, May 1950. Accordingly, no issue of priority is presented, and the only question to be determined is whether the concurrent use by the parties of their respective marks on identical merchandise would be likely to result in confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The Examiner of Interferences held that since \u201cVita-Slim\u201d consists merely of \u201cSlim\u201d with the addition of the descriptive term \u201cVita,\u201d confusion in trade was likely to result from concurrent use of the respective marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The Assistant Commissioner held, however, that there was no likelihood of such confusion. She based that holding on \u201cthe highly suggestive significance of \u2018Slim\u2019,\u201d and the fact that appellant and its licensees did not use that word alone, but in combination with other words indicating origin, such as \u201cBellbrook,\u201d \u201cMayflower,\u201d \u201cPages,\u201d or \u201cEmbassy,\u201d which practice \u201chas probably led the purchasing public to think of \u2018Slim\u2019 as a skim milk product put on the market by a dairy in their area, rather than as a trade-mark identifying the skim milk of opposer and distinguishing it from the skim milk of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">As we understand the decision of the Assistant Commissioner, she does not hold that appellant\u2019s use of \u201cSlim\u201d has not been a trade-mark use; and appellee could not well contend for such a proposition since, as correctly stated by the Assistant Commissioner, appellee \u201cuses \u2018Vita-Slim\u2019 in substantially the same way as opposer and its \u2018franchisees\u2019 use \u2018Slim\u2019 \u2014 i. e. with the word mark \u2018Hawthorne Mellody\u2019 above the word \u2018Vita-Slim\u2019.\u201d Apparently, it was the view of the Assistant Commissioner that \u201cSlim\u201d as used by appellant was a weak mark, and that the addition of the notation \u201cVita\u201d to it was sufficient to avoid any likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">As was pointed out by the Examiner of Interferences, it is the general rule \u201cthat one may not appropriate the entire mark of another and avoid a likelihood of confusion by the addition thereto of descriptive or .otherwise subordinate matter.\u201d This court has made holdings to that effect in each of the following cases: Miller Becker Co. v. King of Clubs, Inc., 56 F.2d 883, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1024 (Ace and Ace-of-Clubs); National Biscuit Co. v. Sheridan, 44 F.2d 987, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 720 (American Beauty and American Beauty Rose); E-Z Mills, Inc. v. Martin Brothers Company, 95 F.2d 269, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 992 (E-Z and Klad-ezee); In re Cohen, Goldman &amp; Co., Inc., 119 F.2d 599, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1141 (Knockabout and British Knockabout Model); Vi-Jon Laboratories, Inc. v. Lentheric Inc., 133 F.2d 947, 30 C.C.P.A., Patents, 916 (Shanghai and Night in Shanghai); In re Wings Publishing Co. Inc., 148 F.2d 214, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 926 (Wings and Wings Comics); and Penrith-Akers Manufacturing Co. v. Ju-C-Orange of America, 182 F.2d 211, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1056 (Ju-See and Ju-C-Orange).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">As shown by appellee\u2019s evidence, its skim milk is fortified by the addition of vitamins, and the use of the notation \u201cVita\u201d on such a product obviously has a descriptive connotation. The use of that notation on vitamins and products which contain them is conventional. Vitab Corporation v. Knox Company and Endo Products Inc., 143 F.2d 883, 31 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1205; Miles Laboratories, Inc. v. Foley &amp; Co., 144 F.2d 888, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 714; Vital Foods Corporation v. Miles Laboratories Inc., 156 F.2d 77, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1136. Moreover, appellee\u2019s application contains a disclaimer of all rights to the expression \u201cVita\u201d separate and apart from its combination with \u201cSlim.\u201d It seems evident, therefore, that \u201cVita\u201d cannot properly be regarded as the principal or dominant part of appellee\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">While the word \u201cSlim\u201d is suggestive of the intended effect of skim milk on the purchaser, as indicated by the fact that both parties have used it in association with the notation \u201cnon-fattening,\u201d it would not be thought of as relating to the physical properties of the milk itself, and hence is not descriptive in the same sense as \u201cVita.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In our opinion \u201cSlim,\u201d forms the dominant part of appellee\u2019s mark \u201cVita-Slim,\u201d and the concurrent use of those two marks on identical goods would be likely to lead to confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The fact that each of the parties applies an additional name or trade-mark to its product is not sufficient to remove the likelihood of confusion. The right to register a trade-mark must be determined on the basis of what is set forth in the application rather than the manner in which the mark may be actually used. Intercontinental Mfg. Co. v. Continental Motors Corp., 230 F.2d 621, 43 C.C.P.A., Patents, 841; Kiekhaefer Corp. v. Willys-Overland Motors, Inc., 236 F.2d 423, 43 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\"> Appellee notes that an application by appellant for registration of \u201cSlim\u201d as a trade-mark was dropped after the filing of an opposition based on the mark \u201cKlim.\u201d However, it is not necessary that an opposer shall be the registrant or exclusive owner of the mark on which it relies. It is sufficient to show that the opposer would probably be damaged by the registration which it opposes. Vi-Jon Laboratories, Inc. v. Lentheric Inc., 133 F.2d 947, 30 C.C. P.A., Patents, 916. Likelihood of confusion affords sufficient evidence of probable damage, even though the opposer may not have used its mark as a technical trade-mark. George H. Ruth Candy Co. v. Curtiss Candy Co., 49 F.2d 1033, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1471; Virginia Dare Extract Co. Inc. v. Dare, 70 F.2d 118, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1086, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">Appellee contends that, in view of the suggestive nature of \u201cSlim,\u201d appellant should not be allowed to prevent others from using that word, at least in its descriptive sense. However, the issue here is not whether appellee is entitled to use the mark \u201cVita-Slim,\u201d but whether it is entitled to register that mark. Since we are of the opinion that concurrent use of \u201cSlim\u201d and \u201cVita-Slim\u201d by the respective parties on identical merchandise would be likely to result in confusion in trade, we conclude that the latter mark is not registrable to appellee in view of appellant\u2019s prior use of the former, and the decision of the Assistant Commissioner is accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
