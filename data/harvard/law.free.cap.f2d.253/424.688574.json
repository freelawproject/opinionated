There is ample evidence in the record to support these conclusions of the Tax Court. This being so, we cannot conclude that the Tax Court was in error in holding that the taxpayer did not receive a long term capital gain in 1946 when she received $2250 from the partnership in that year. The Tax Court has correctly applied the law as we see it. Accordingly the decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
