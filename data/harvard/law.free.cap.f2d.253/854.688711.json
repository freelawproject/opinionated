See Boettger v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company,. 3 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 455. The present, appeal raises two issues. The first relates to two special interrogatories submitted by the trial court to the jury. The plaintiff-appellant asserts that the-trial court committed error in this submission but we can perceive no sound' basis for this contention. The second' ground asserted as error by the plaintiff-appellant is that references to \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation\u201d were made by the-defendant\u2019s counsel in his opening and' closing speech and by the Court in its charge and that this prejudiced the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>plaintiff-appellant\u2019s case. No objection was taken when the references were made and therefore there is no ground for reversal here. Moreover, the answers given by the jury to the special interrogatories, 1(a) and 1(b), show that the jury decided that the defendant was not the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s employer and therefore the references to \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation\u201d could not have harmed the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
