Belvoir, Virginia, brought this suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 1346. His claim was for injuries to his heel, sustained in alighting-from the rear of a truck which had transported him and a number of others to McKensie Hall, on the post.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-23\">Plaintiff\u2019s version is that when the-truck came to a stop the driver announced, \u201cThis is the end of the line; all out.\u201d The tailgate of the truck was up, but the plaintiff says that he let himself' down as gently as possible. Other witnesses gave a different story, and one-whom the plaintiff summoned testified that before the driver had an opportunity to lower the tailgate, if he had seen fit to do so, the plaintiff \u201cleaped\u201d from the top of the tailgate to the road, thus, injuring himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>The District Judge accepted the version of the witnesses who testified that the plaintiff jumped, and commented that the opening of the tailgate was a simple operation which the plaintiff could have performed if he wished. The Judge declared that the plaintiff was aware of the hazard of jumping over the edge of the closed tailgate and willingly exposed himself to it. The Judge thereupon dismissed the case on the ground of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">We perceive no error in this ruling, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
