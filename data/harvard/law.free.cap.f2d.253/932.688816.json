The deportation order was entered after an administrative hearing at which the appellant declined to testify, and was based upon a finding that the appellant was an alien who after entry had been a member of the Communist Party of the United States. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a) (6) (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-23\">Three contentions were advanced in the appellant\u2019s brief and oral argument: that the evidence was insufficient to prove alienage, that the evidence was insufficient to prove Communist Party membership, and that the statute under which the appellant was ordered deported was unconstitutional. Disposition of this appeal was deferred pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Rowoldt v. Perfetto, 1957, 355 U.S. 115, 78 S.Ct. 180, 2 L.Ed. 2d 140, and thereafter pending submission by counsel of supplemental memo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>randa presenting their views as to the effect of the Rowoldt decision upon this case. A review of the record in the light of the relevant authorities convinces us that the district court\u2019s order must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\"> As to the Constitutionality of the deportation statute in question, there can be no present doubt. Galvan v. Press, 1954, 347 U.S. 522, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911; Rowoldt v. Perfetto, supra. Upon the issue of alienage, the administrative record contains substantial and probative evidence to support a finding that the appellant was born on or about March 25, 1912, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, of parents who were not citizens of the United States. Cf. Williams v. Mulcahey, 6 Cir., 1957, 250 F.2d 127. The only substantial question, therefore, is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the administrative finding that the appellant had been a member of the Communist Party of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">Upon this issue a witness testified that she had attended over a hundred closed Communist Party meetings with the appellant between 1947 and 1950, and that she had issued a Communist Party membership card to the appellant and collected dues from her during the same period. The witness further testified that the appellant had served as \u201cEducational Director\u201d and later as a group leader in a Communist Party club, that she had on various occasions acted as chairman of the club\u2019s meetings and had taught classes on \u201cMarxism\u201d and \u201cLeninism\u201d at these meetings. This testimony was uncontradicted and was partially corroborated by another witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">In our opinion the foregoing evidence was sufficient to show a \u201cmeaningful association\u201d with the Communist Party of the kind referred to in the Rowoldt case, and to establish that the appellant joined the party, aware that she was \u201cjoining an organization known as the Communist Party which operates as a distinct and active political organization * * Galvan v.
