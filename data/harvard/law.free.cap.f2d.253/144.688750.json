Williams. That in this prior appeal, this same defendant was indicted on January 8, 1957, charged with violations of federal narcotic laws, and on Novem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>her 14, 1957, following conviction he was sentenced for a period of ten years by the same trial judge who presided in the instant case, Honorable Joseph Sam Perry. That in this prior case defendant was released on bail pending appeal in the sum of $10,000, \u201con condition that the defendant do not knowingly associate with anyone engaged in the narcotics traffic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">(2) The facts relating to the indictment and conviction in the instant case, and that the sentence of 25 years is to run concurrently with the sentence in the prior case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">(3) That \u201cDefendant-appellant has a history of narcotic violations going back to 1928. He is an uncontrollable recidivist, as is demonstrated by the 25-year sentence he received under the multiple-offense provisions of the Federal Narcotic Control Act [21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174]. The prior history of the defendant does not warrant his release on bail pending appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The foregoing is the meager record before us and on which we are asked to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The applicable part of Rule 46(a)(2), as amended in 1956, follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201c * * * Bail <em>may </em>be allowed pending appeal or certiorari <em>unless </em>it appears that the appeal is frivolous or taken for delay. * * * \u201d (Our emphasis.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The government does not deny defendant\u2019s showing that the appeal is not frivolous or taken for delay, and that part of the rule is, therefore, not in issue at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Mr. Justice Frankfurter, as Circuit Justice, in Ward v. United States, 1956, 76 S.Ct. 1063,1064,1 L.Ed.2d 25,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-11\">\u201cWhen the Court of Appeals disposed of the motion for bail, on June 4, 1956, the Rule then in force for admission to bail after conviction was as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-13\">\u201c \u2018Bail may be allowed pending appeal or certiorari only if it appears that the case involves a substantial question which should be determined by the appellate court. * * * Rule 46(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. But on April 9, this Court had submitted to Congress a new Rule 46(a) (2), to take effect on July 9, 1956. It reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-14\">\u201c \u2018Bail may be allowed pending appeal or certiorari unless it appears that the appeal is frivolous or taken for delay. * * * \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-15\">\u201cObviously, as the Government recognizes, the amendment has greatly liberalized the basis for admission to bail in the federal courts pending an appeal from a conviction. By the time the matter first came before me, the new Rule was law. Since the Court of Appeals had denied bail without giving reasons, I could not tell whether they took into account the changed situation presented by the Rule which was then in process of becoming, though it was not formally, effective. Accordingly, it seemed to me appropriate that the lower courts should have an opportunity to pass upon the petition for bail under the standards that now govern. I therefore remanded the matter to the Court of Appeals for direct disposition by it, or for further consideration by the District Court. The Court of Appeals took the latter course and on July 17 determined that the request for bail should again be passed on by the trial judge. After further hearing, the trial judge again denied bail, supporting his denial by what the Court of Appeals has characterized as \u2018a carefully reasoned and detailed opinion.\u2019 The motion for bail by Bowers and Ward was thereupon renewed before the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>That court, in a per curiam opinion, denied the renewed motion, whereupon the petitioners again asked me to allow bail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">\u201cBoth the lower courts have set forth the grounds for their denial. They have expressed themselves to be duly mindful of the controlling force of Rule 46(a)(2), as amended. The issues that are raised here have been fully canvassed in the briefs filed by the petitioners and the Government. Both sides have addressed themselves to the proper scope of the amended Rule and its appropriate application to the specific circumstances of this prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201cIt is common ground that the amended Rule 46 has made a decided change in the outlook on granting bail after conviction. The Government, as I have already indicated, accepts the statement in my memorandum of July 13, 1956, that the old Rule 46(a) (2) has by the amendment \u2018been greatly liberalized.\u2019 Putting to one side its qualifications, I think the Government is right in saying that the granting of bail is called for more readily under the new standard than it was under the old concept of \u2018substantial question.\u2019 It is also right in indicating that the new Rule effectuates a shift from putting the burden on the convicted defendant to establish eligibility for bail, to requiring the Government to persuade the trial judge that the minimum standards for allowing bail have not been met. The authoritative interpretation of the amendment must, of course, await a decision by the Supreme Court. In the meantime, however, one cannot escape his individual responsibility in passing on a petition like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201cThe Government commendably acknowledges that the new Rule has made an important change. The Rule expresses a general attitude, the significance of which is that inasmuch as an appeal from a conviction is a matter of right, the risk of incarceration for a conviction that may be upset is normally to be guarded against by allowing bail unless the appeal is so baseless as to deserve to be condemned as \u2018frivolous\u2019 or is sought as a device for mere delay. The Government suggests, however, that there may be considerations other than frivolity or delay, which may conscientiously move a trial judge to deny bail without disloyalty to the amended Rule. I am bound to say that the Government is rightly cautious in suggesting the extent of the area of discretion that still remains under the amended Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">\u201cElaboration of whatever occasions for discretion may remain had better be left to the specific occasions which may give rise to such claims. The present situation presents one consideration that suffices for disposition of this case. The granting of bail certainly presupposes confidence that a defendant will respond to the demands of justice. In fixing the amount of bail, Rule 46(e) explicitly adverts to the trustworthiness of a defendant. The bail must be of an amount to \u2018insure the presence of the defendant.\u2019 Impliedly, the likelihood that bail within tolerable limits will not insure this justifies denial of bail. One of the reasons that led the District Court to deny bail to Bowers and Ward was \u2018that there is considerable motivation for these defendants to flee the Court\u2019s jurisdiction and that they have ample means to accomplish this purpose.\u2019 I read this to mean that the District Judge felt that the likelihood of a flight was a danger not to be disregarded. I cannot reject this conclusion of the District Court because it was based on confidential probation reports. See Williams v. People of State of New York, 337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337. Such a judgment is, to be sure, a prophecy but I cannot sit as the district judge and make my own. Presumably, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>reason of the District Court in denying bail was one of the considerations included in the \u2018reasons\u2019 for the action taken by the District Court which the Court of Appeals respected in not overruling \u2018the exercise of sound judgment\u2019 by the District Court. On this ground, I must deny the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">\u201cAsking a Circuit Justice to grant bail pending appeal in the Court of Appeals, after denial by the two lower courts, presents a difficult dilemma. An error of principles in the denial of bail, an indisputable question of law, calls for correction, whether the matter comes before the whole Court, as in Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 72 S.Ct. 1, 96 L.Ed. 3, or before an appropriate Circuit Justice. But when it is a question of the application of duly recognized standards, and such application turns on what may fairly be called \u2018facts,\u2019 or on a necessarily prophetic judgment like the trustworthiness of a convicted defendant, I do not conceive it to be the function of a Circuit Justice to exercise an independent judgment as though he were sitting in the district court. And yet, even where \u2018facts\u2019 are involved, a standard may be recognized in principle but honored, however unconsciously, in the breach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In Blassingame v. United States, 9 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 313, 314, the defendant was denied admission to bail pending appeal, where it was found from the affidavit of his counsel that, the appeal was not frivolous and was not taken for delay. In that ease, the court went on to say, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201cIt appears, however, that the district judge denied bail on quite another ground. The district judge had before him a confidential probation report which revealed, according to the judge\u2019s remarks .at the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion for bail, that appellant is a highly unstable individual who has no family in the Seattle area, no visible means of support and no home or property. It also appeared that appellant had been most uncooperative with the probation officials in giving information about himself, and that, he \u2018had been well known to the narcotics officers for some period of time.\u2019 The judge further noted that appellant apparently had ample funds to provide him with means for absconding. In view of these considerations the trial judge decided that a bail bond would not adequately protect against the possibility of appellant\u2019s flight pending appeal, and denied bail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">In this case, Judge Perry first denied defendant\u2019s motion \u201cto fix bond\u201d pending appeal, and later, on defendant\u2019s motion, reconsidered this motion and denied it again. 'We are not favored with his reasons for this action. We can assume that he had a confidential probation report before him, and we know that he had presided in two trials in which defendant was convicted of' violations of the narcotic laws. We do not have his views on other facts which might relate to a determination of whether a bail bond would adequately protect against the possibility of defendant\u2019s flight pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">In Roth v. United States, 1956, 77 S.Ct. 17, 1 L.Ed.2d 34, Mr. Justice Harlan, after noting that it was not urged that there was likelihood of the petitioner\u2019s fleeing, allowed bail pending certiorari where it had been denied by a circuit judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">It is obvious that where there is no showing that the appeal is frivolous or taken for delay, and under the plain language of the Rule that bail <em>may </em>be allowed, there are some cases where, under the facts, the court is allowed to exercise some discretion in passing upon such a motion as before us here. However, on the bare showing in defendant\u2019s motion and the government\u2019s answer, we do not have sufficient information to enable us to exercise this discretion and rule upon this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>In view of the nature of the violations of which defendant stands convicted and where the trial judge has twice denied defendant\u2019s motion \u201cto fix bond\u201d pending appeal, on the present posture of this matter before us we cannot say that the defendant should or should not be admitted to bail pending appeal without a further hearing and consideration of the matter. We think that the cause of justice will be served best by following the course pointed out in Ward v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">It is, therefore, ordered that the defendant\u2019s motion to be admitted to bail pending appeal be denied at this time, and that this matter be remanded to the district court below for further hearing, finding and determination not inconsistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-12\">. The statement of Mr. Justice Frankfurter is set out at some length for the reason that it does not appear in the United States Reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
