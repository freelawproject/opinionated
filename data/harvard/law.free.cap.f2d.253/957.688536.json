In granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, Judge Bryan wrote a cogent opinion, D.C.S.D. N.Y., 154 F.Supp. 863, pointing out that, while there were decisions the other way, this Court was committed to the majority view that a period of limitation, \u201cbuilt in\u201d the statute as is the three-year bar here, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56, could not be tolled by the defendant\u2019s fraud or misrepresentations. See the opinions of the late Judge Frank in Osbourne v. United States, 2 Cir., 164 F.2d 767, and Sgam-bati v. United States, 2 Cir., 172 F.2d 297, certiorari denied 337 U.S. 938, 69 S.Ct. 1514, 93 L.Ed. 1743. For the reasons well stated by Judge Bryan, we think we should not attempt to retrace our footsteps now, but may well await resolution of the conflict by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-12\">We are the more content to follow this course because the barrenness of the allegations here suggests a doubt as to any real fraud. Notwithstanding the explicit mandate of F.R. 9(b) that in all averments of fraud or mistake \u201cthe circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity,\u201d the plaintiff says only that \u201csubsequent thereto\u201d \u2014 the accruing of the cause\u2014 \u201cdefendant\u2019s agents, servants and employees fraudulently or unintentionally misstated to plaintiff that he had seven years within which to bring an action against said defendant as a result of his industrial disease and in reliance thereon plaintiff withheld suit until the present time.\u201d This could be merely an unintentional misstatement or expression of opinion on a matter of law. It lacks the equitable appeal of circumstances disclosed in decisions or discussions reaching the opposite conclusion. The order of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
