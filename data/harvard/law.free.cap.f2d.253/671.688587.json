As a male alien residing in the United States, he registered under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, 50 U.S.C.App., former \u00a7 301 et seq., 54 Stat. 885, 55 Stat. 844. He was classified 1 \u2014 A. Thereafter, on July 6, 1943, while Iran was still a neutral nation in World War II, appellee by executing DSS Form 301 applied to be relieved of military service because of his alienage. However, his application was not reached for processing until three months later and by that time Iran had become a cobelligerent. The appellee was then classified l-A(L) as available for limited service only. In November 1943 he was rejected for induction because of an insufficient quota for limited service registrants. In November 1944 he was classified IV-F because limited service registrants were no longer being inducted. In September 1945 he was classified IV-A, because then overage for any military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">The appellee was never classified IV-C as a neutral alien who sought relief from military service and never in fact obtained such relief because of his alienage.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">The appellee filed a Declaration of Intention to become a citizen on November 4, 1944. On March 24, 1947 he filed his petition for naturalization under the Nationality Act of 1940, former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(a), 54 Stat. 1137.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In 1956, when the petition came on for hearing, the Government opposed on the ground that the appellee was permanently debarred from citizenship under \u00a7 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, the provisions of which had been re-enacted in the Universal Military and Training Act of 1948, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 454, 62 Stat. 605. The petition was granted on June 27, 1956 in an opinion reported in 143 F.Supp. 177 and the Government has brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-16\">It is true that \u00a7 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided that one who in the manner prescribed made an application for relief from liability for military service became \u201cthereafter * * * debarred from becoming a citizen,\u201d irrespective of whether he was ever classified as exempt or in fact relieved from service because of alienage. Ceballos v. Shaughnessy, 352 U.S. 599, 77 S.Ct. 545, 1 L.Ed.2d 583. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>However, as was pointed out in the opinion below, this provision of the Selective Training and Service Act is in conflict with \u00a7 315(a) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1426(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provided that ineligibility for citizenship should attach to aliens who (1) had applied for exemption and (2) had actually been relieved from such service. This two-pronged bar to citizenship, although in certain respects more broadly stated than \u00a7 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act, In re Skender\u2019s Petition, 2 Cir., 248 F.2d 92, certiorari denied, Skender v. U. S., 355 U.S. 931, 78 S.Ct. 411; cf. Ballester v. United States, 1 Cir., 220 F.2d 399, certiorari denied 350 U.S. 830, 76 S.Ct. 62, 100 L.Ed. 741, was in substance less drastic. And \u00a7 315 (a) spoke in the past, as well as the future, tense thus disclosing an intent that its two-pronged bar should apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The Act of 1952, in \u00a7 403(b), 66 Stat. 280, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 note, provided that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in section 405, all other laws, or parts of laws, in conflict or inconsistent with this Act are, to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency, repealed.\u201d We think that \u00a7 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act was thereby repealed to the extent that it contained a more drastic bar to naturalization than that of \u00a7 315(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Our conclusion that the two-pronged bar of \u00a7 315(a) of the 1952 Act was intended to apply to this case is fortified by its prefatory phrase which gives it application \u201c[notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(h)\u201d of the 1952 Act. For by \u00a7 405(b), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 note, it was provided generally that \u201cExcept as otherwise specifically provided in title III, any petition for naturalization heretofore filed which may be pending at the time this Act shall take effect shall be heard and determined in accordance with the requirements of law in effect when such petition was filed.\u201d Thus under \u00a7 405(b), standing alone, the appellee, whose petition had been pending since 1947, would have been debarred from naturalization under \u00a7 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended. Benzian v. Godwin, 2 Cir., 168 F.2d 952, certiorari denied 335 U.S. 886, 69 S.Ct. 235, 93 L.Ed. 425. But the provision of \u00a7 315 (a) that it should apply <em>notwithstanding </em>\u00a7 405(b) quite clearly manifested an intent that a petition for naturalization filed before, but determined after, the enactment of the 1952 Act should be dealt with under the law in effect when the petition should be decided. Cf. Shomberg v. United States, 348 U.S. 540, 75 S.Ct. 509, 99 L.Ed. 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">Our conclusion is not in conflict with the definition contained in \u00a7 101(a) (19) of the Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101(a) (19).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At first glance this definition might seem to imply the continuing vitality of \u00a7 3(a) of the Selective Training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>and Service Act as a bar to naturalization. A closer reading of the paragraph, however, shows it to recognize that a mere application for relief from military service under the Selective Training and Service Act might not constitute a literally permanent bar to naturalization. For the definition attaches to the \u201cindividual who is, <em>or was at any time</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>permanently debarred from becoming a citizen.\u201d The italicized phrase imports that a mere application for relief under the Selective 'Training and Service Act, although a bar when made, may thereafter cease to be a bar to naturalization. That is just what happens under \u00a7 315(a) of the 1952 Act when, as in this case, the application for relief did not result in the granting of relief. It well may be that \u00a7 101(a) (19) of the 1952 Act manifests the continuing vitality of \u00a7 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act, not for purposes of \u00a7 315(a) of the 1952 Act with which it is in conflict, but only for purposes of other provisions of the 1952 Act with which it is not necessarily in conflict. Thus Congress in 1952, for purposes of \u00a7 212(a) (22) of the 1952 Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(a) (22), which provides that one ineligible for citizenship under \u00a7 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act shall be excluded from admission to the country, may have thought that the drastic war-time bar of the 1940 Act was still appropriate even though, by 1952, for purposes of naturalization a less drastic bar was considered consistent with public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The decision below was in accord with United States v. Bazan, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 108, 228 F.2d 455, and Ballester v. United States, supra. It was not inconsistent with Ceballos v. Shaughnessy, supra. Nor is the disposition which we reached in conflict with Petition of Coronado, D.C.E.D.N.Y. 132 F.Supp. 419, affirmed 2 Cir., 224 F.2d 556. Although that case, like this, was decided after the effective date of the 1952 Act, the petitioner there, unlike Mirzoeff, not only had applied for relief but also had obtained relief. Consequently his petition was barred even under the 1952 Act and was rightly der nied.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b784-9\"> Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1427(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-11\">.

In view of the clearly expressed national policy with regard to those who enjoyed what our country had to offer and at the same time chose not to render military service at a time before 1952 when such service was generally far more hazardous and necessary, I would rest on the definition of those \u201cineligible to citizenship\u201d as controlling.

In the absence of an unambiguous expression by the Congress of an intention to lift the bar which clearly lay across Mirzoeff\u2019s path to citizenship for nine years, I think what he did in the dark days of July 1943 disposes of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">I would reverse the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
