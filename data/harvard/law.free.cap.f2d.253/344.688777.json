Both registrations had issued on the Supplemental Register under the Trade-Mark Act of 1946. Schol-ler Brothers, Inc., W. F. Fancourt Co., both of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Onyx Oil &amp; Chemical Co. of Jersey City, New Jersey, filed cancellation petitions in the Patent Office where, finally, the Assistant Commissioner of Patents held that appellant had not been entitled to register the word \u201cNylonized\u201d at the time it filed its application and that Registration No. 557,776 should therefore be cancelled. It was further held that \u201cNylonized\u201d is merely descriptive, that the Examiner\u2019s decision to that effect should be affirmed and that Registration No. 557,443 should be cancelled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commissioner moved to dismiss the complaint in the District Court on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter and because the petitioners for cancellation were \u201cindispensably necessary to a full and final adjudication of the controversy and none of them has been made a party hereto.\u201d The Commissioner\u2019s motion having been granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>and the complaint having been dismissed, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The Commissioner here mistakenly relies upon Chris Laganas Shoe Co. v. Watson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Laga\u00f1as had filed its application for registry on the Principal Register of the term \u201cAir Stride\u201d for women\u2019s shoes. Brown Shoe Company, Inc., prior user of the registered mark \u201cAir Step\u201d successfully opposed; the Laga\u00f1as appeal to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was dismissed after Brown exercised its election<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to have further proceedings in the District Court. Thus, the complaint was thereafter filed against the <em>Commissioner and </em>against Brown Shoe Company, Inc., and the case went forward in the District Court, as it must, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 146 which specifically provides that the Commissioner shall not be a necessary party to an <em>inter partes </em>proceeding under that section. We pointed out that the action was plainly <em>inter partes, </em>and that the District Court correctly dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Here the provisions of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> found in \u201cTitle II \u2014 Supplemental Register\u201d primarily apply. Cancellation was to be accomplished necessarily, if at all, under section 24. The instant registrations were not subject to the provisions of sections 13 to 18, inclusive, but, as provided by section 26, were to receive the advantages of section 21,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and since the marks had been registered, section 37 also applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-17\">The 1946 Act reversed the former practice so that the Commissioner could no longer be made sole defendant in an action under section 4915, Revised Statutes,5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 7\u201cwhere there was an opposing party.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It was clear enough that the Commissioner thereafter was not to be a \u201cnecessary party to an inter partes proceeding\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> under section 4915, Revised Statutes, but controversy developed as to what proceedings were to be deemed \u201cinter partes\u201d and as to the Commissioner\u2019s status in an \u201cex parte\u201d situation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-18\">Congress in 1952 codified Title 35<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> United States Code, with marked effect on section 21 of the 1946 Trade-Mark Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Substituted for the first reference \u201csection 4915, Revised Statutes\u201d was the inserted \u201c35 United States Code, sections 145 and 146.\u201d In lieu of \u201cRevised Statutes 4915\u201d appearing twice in former section 21, the revisers inserted \u201c35 United States Code, section 146.\u201d The new section 145,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provides now, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>prior to the 1946 Trade-Mark Act, that the dissatisfied applicant may \u201chave remedy by civil action against the Commissioner in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\u201d As to <em>inter partes </em>actions, a dissatisfied party may have remedy by civil action against the party in interest, and in such actions, \u201cThe Commissioner shall not be a necessary party * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The \u201cremedy\u201d prescribed has been identified by this court. \u201cPutting this in terms of legal \u2018right\u2019 and legal \u2018duty\u2019 the Trade-Mark Act creates a statutory right of registration of a mark * * * it is this right which Gold Seal seeks to vindicate. The Act imposes a correlative duty upon the Commissioner * * * to register a mark if the statutory conditions are complied with. It is this duty a wrongful breach of which Gold Seal seeks to remedy.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Act provides that if after examination of an application for registration on the Supplemental Register it shall appear that the applicant is entitled to registration, the registration shall be granted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Clearly, the Examiner in charge of registrations must examine the application and be satisfied that the statutory requirements have been met and that the mark is entitled to registration. If it be so found, it is the duty of the Commissioner to register the mark so qualified.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">To summarize, the only issue presented by the Commissioner\u2019s decision and] the complaint is whether the initial registrations of appellant\u2019s mark were erroneously granted as a matter of law because the mark was descriptive in character and without trade-mark significance and because, as to one registration, the mark had not been used by the appellant prior to registration. Such a dispute clearly is primarily between the appellant and the Commissioner and was-properly instituted under Section 145. The petitioners for cancellation have never used or registered the appellant\u2019s-mark or a mark claimed to be similar. Their only claim to damage was that reg-istation of the mark would in the future be \u201clikely to interfere with their freedom to use\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the descriptive registered word, a claim which is irrelevant where the issue before the Commissioner is-only registrability, <em>vel non. </em>In the circumstances it would be pointless to require the appellant to sue only the petitioners rather than the Commissioner,, and we do not believe that Congress so-intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">We conclude that appellant was entitled under Section 145 to seek his remedy \u201cby civil action against the Commissioner\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The court has-jurisdiction, and if the facts and law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u2022shall so warrant, it has power to restore the cancelled registrations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Of course, we express no opinion on the merits. We say only that the action \u25a0should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-21\">. Scholler Brothers, Inc. v. Hans O.

The proceedings accordingly were <em>inter partes. </em>In my view neither the fact that the ground urged for cancellation was the original nonregistrability of the mark, nor the fact that the decision of the Commissioner granting the petitions rested also on a ground not asserted in the petitions, gave the Patent Office proceedings an <em>ex parte </em>character. If this be so, then the proceedings in the District Court should retain the same <em>inter partes </em>character they had in the Patent Office. While the problem is susceptible of a different solution under the complexities of the existing statutes, the more easily followed rule would be to permit proceedings in court to retain the character they had in the Patent Office; and this appears more likely to have been the Congressional intent. Sections 145 and 146 of 35 U.S.C., originally enacted for patent cases, and section 21 of the Lanham Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which makes those sections applicable to trade-mark cases under the same conditions, rules, and procedures as in patent cases \u201cso far as they are applicable,\u201d should be construed together to mean that the Commissioner shall not be a necessary party in the District Court action contesting the outcome of <em>inter partes </em>cancellation proceedings in the Patent Office. The Commissioner would be notified and have the right to intervene and protect the public interest if so advised. But, except for this, the parties should be left to contest between themselves in court as they did in the Patent Office. The selection of parties in the District Court would not depend upon the ground of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, which might be plural or uncertain and furnish an indefinite guide. The question of necessary parties would depend rather upon the <em>inter partes </em>nature of the proceedings in the Patent Office. This view is also consistent with our decision in Chris Laganas Shoe Co. v. Watson, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 324, 221 F.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AJB\">. 60 Stat. 435, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071 (1952), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1071.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
