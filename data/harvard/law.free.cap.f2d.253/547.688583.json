(5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009; 66 Stat. 208, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252.) The District Court had original jurisdiction to review (Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U. S. 48, 75 S.Ct. 591, 99 L.Ed. 868), and appeal lies here. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-22\">Appellant entered this country unlawfully on April 25th, 1923. On August 28th or 29th, 1949,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his status was adjusted and he was granted a Certificate of Registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-23\">On January 25th, 1952 a jury convicted appellant of both counts of a two count indictment charging him with violation of \u00a7 145(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 145(b)),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>which charged him with wilfully attempting to defeat and evade his income tax for the years 1946 and 1947 by filing two separate \u201cfalse and fraudulent income tax returns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Thereafter appellant\u2019s Certificate of Registry adjusting his status was rescinded, and in subsequent proceedings he was found deportable as having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a) (4)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court affirmed the order of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The issue is simple. Was appellant, \u201cafter entry, * * * convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Two questions must be answered. Does conviction of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 145(b) involve moral turpitude ? If so, does the evidence disclose that the two convictions arise from a single scheme?</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">This Court has already answered the first question affirmatively where, as here, intent to defraud the government is charged in the indictment and found by the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">\u201cWe follow the rule laid down in the De George case (Jordan v. De George, 1951, 341 U.S. 223, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886 and Bloch v. United States, 9 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 786, 788) that an intent to defraud the government is a prerequisite to conviction under Sec. 145(b), and hence, a conviction thereof where such fraud is charged in the indictment, is conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d Tseung Chu v. Cornell, etc., 9 Cir., 247 F.2d 929, 936, certiorari denied 1957, 355 U.S. 892, 78 S.Ct. 265, 2 L.Ed. 2d 190.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-17\">This has long been the rule. Reyes v. Neely, 5 Cir., 1956, 228 F.2d 609; Maita v. Haff, 9 Cir., 1940,116 F.2d 337; Ponzi v. Ward, D.C.D.Mass., 1934, 7 F.Supp. 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-18\">The second question is slightly more difficult. Appellant points to no facts in the record supporting his assumption that the two years of evasion <em>could </em>have been the result of a single plan or scheme. In fact, he assumes they were \u201cfor purposes of argument only.\u201d Fraudulent returns in two different years could, or could not, be one plan or scheme. But we have no facts to prove such a scheme. We have here two different returns involving transactions a year apart. The evidence required on each count was necessarily different, and referred to acts occurring a year apart. This, alone, is persuasive that two unrelated crimes were charged. In the absence of all evidence to the contrary, complete crimes committed on differing dates or in differing places are considered separate and different crimes, and support separate charges. Could the defendant in this case urge that there was but one substantive offense charged against him, and hence that the government was required to choose for which year it desired to prosecute defendant? Obviously not.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-19\">The mere assumption that evidence of a crime alleged in the first count might be admissible in a prosecution under the second count does not necessarily prove that if two somewhat similar crimes are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>committed a year apart, they are part of a common scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">To reduce appellant\u2019s position to an absurdity, he must urge that once an alien is convicted of fraudulently evading an income tax for one year, any subsequent attempt to evade income tax and convictions thereof <em>must </em>be presumed part of a single scheme or plan dating back to the original charge. If this were so, the alien could never be deported, even though the convictions were twenty years apart. We cannot conceive this to be the meaning of the statute..</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\"> We fully'understand that deportation is .a drastic- measure, a. forfeiture of residence, and.a penalty. For that reason,. the statutory provision should' be generously construed. Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 1948, 333 U.S. 6, 10; 68 S.Ct. 374, 92 L.Ed. 433. But this does not require us to adopt a ridiculous interpretation favoring the alien at all events.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Appellant\u2019s proposed \u201ccommon sense\u201d test is whether evidence of the crime alleged- in the first count 'Of the indictment would be admissible in a prosecution under the-second count, and \u201csince the, theory ,of admissibility would -be whether there was a plan or scheme, if such evidence c.ould be admitted this would show that there was in fact only a-single scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Appellant\u2019s premise is. false. There are theories of admissibility of a previous similar act other than to show a plan- or scheme. For example, previous similar acts may be introduced -to establish constituent-elements of-the crime charg-' ed, such as intent or motive, and may have no direct or apparent connection. Fall v. U. S., 60 App.D.C. 124, 49 F.2d 506; Witters v. U. S., 70 App.D.C. 316, 106 F.2d 837, 125 A.L.R. 1031; Weiss v. U. S., 5 Cir., 122 F.2d 675, 680, 682. Or, they may show malice. People v. Chaves, 122 Cal. 134, 54 P. 96. Or, it may be to show guilty knowledge, Johnston v. U. S., 9 Cir., 1927, 22 F.2d 1, and this rule is applicable in tax cases. Tink-off v. U. S., 7 Cir., 1936, 86 F.2d 868, 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Finally, appellant urged at oral argument a matter not raised below nor in his brief, namely: that appellant was convicted of income tax evasion in January 1952, and that the Walters-McCarran Immigration Act was passed June 27th, 1952; that the Act cannot be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah2\">8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahb-dedup-0\">.\u201cAnyalien * * --.shall * * * be deported who * '* * (4) * * at any time after entry is <em>convicted, </em>of two crimes involving moral turpitude, .not arising out of a single scheme of. criminal misconduct * * * \u00bb [Emphasis..added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aow-dedup-0\">Appellant urges \u201cis convicted\u201d can only refer to events occurring after passage of the Act, particularly b\u00e9caus'\u00e9 \u00a7 1251 (a) . (3) uses the phrase \u201chereafter\u201d and \u00a7 1251(a) (6) uses the phrase \u201cis or at any' time has been, after entry, a member of any\u201d of certain classes of aliens. The'very inclusion in \u00a7 1251(a) (4) of the words \u201cat any time after entry\u201d makes the Act applicable to any conviction occurring after entry. \u2018 These same words were in the previous -1940 Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Congress, examining each section with great care, chose to use the same words, making the penalty applicable to any alien being twice convicted of certain' crimes <em>committed at any time after entry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">This Court reaffirms the finding of the District Court that the appellant was given a fair hearing and that the decision of deportkbility is based upon reasonable, substantial and probative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">The judgment is aifir'med.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-12\">.
