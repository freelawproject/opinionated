Zion State Bank, appellee. The government\u2019s sole ground of attack is, in the' words of its brief, \u201cbecause the acknowledgment of the chattel mortgage by the' corporate officers instead of the corporation itself was not in compliance with, the applicable Illinois law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-22\">The mortgage (which is a printed: form with typed matter in blank spaces) identified the parties thereto as: \u201cDecatur Tool &amp; Engineering Corporation, By their Officers,\u201d and said bank, and recited that party of the first part didi grant, sell, convey and confirm unto party of the second part, certain described chattels. The mortgage set forth <em>t</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aag\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201cSaid mortgagor * * * represent * * * that they are the sole and lawful owner * * * of said chattels;\u201d and that \u201cif said mortgagor * * * or assigns shall pay * * * note * * * payable * * * to the order of said mortgagee for Six Thousand * * * Dollars,\u201d etc. \u201csigned by C.

Fundy Treasurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgN\">Illinois substantive law governs the decision of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"A7a\">We agree with the government that the Illinois decisions require a strict compliance with the statutory requirements in regard to the execution and acknowledgment of chattel mortgages. National Cash Register Co. v. Clyde W. Riley Adv. System, 329 Ill. 403, 407-408, 160 N.E. 545; Lyons v. People\u2019s Bank of Lexington, 317 Ill. 44-46, 147 N.E. 398; Kimball Co. v. Polakow, 268 Ill. 344, 348, 109 N.E. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">The applicable statutory provisions in effect when the mortgage in question was acknowledged (\u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, ch. 95, R.S. Ill.1957) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhZ\">\u201c\u00a7 1. No mortgage, * * * of personal property * * * shall be valid as against the rights and interests of any third person, unless * * * the instrument is acknowledged * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATF\">\u201c\u00a7 2. Such instrument shall be acknowledged before any officer authorized by law to take acknowledgment of deeds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIU\">\u201cThe certificate of acknowledgment shall be in substantially the following form:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5G\">\u201cState of Illinois, 1 County of-j SS\u2018</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArX\">\u201cThis Chattel mortgage was acknowledged before me, by - this --- day of-19-.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A34\">\u201cWitness my hand and official seal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArR\">\u201cOfficial Character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APl\">It was held in Johnson v. Ottawa Coop. Grain Co., 294 Ill.App. 523, 544, 14 N.E. 2d 289, 298, that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAR\">\u201c x x x Under the authorities the certificate of acknowledgment may be supported by referring to the instrument to which it relates. 1 R.C.L. 282; 1 Am.Jur. 347. In our opinion when this certificate of acknowledgment is read in connection with the recitals in the body oi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the instrument and with the attestation clause and the signatures of those who signed the instrument, it must be held that this instrument was duly acknowledged by the mortgagor and the certificate of acknowledgment held to be a sufficient certificate thereof. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The chattel mortgage now before the court on its face recites that it is between \u201cDecatur Tool &amp; Engineering Corporation, by their Officers\u201d etc. This recital must be considered with the recitals in the certificate of acknowledgment where it is certified that C. G. Fundy, President, A. H. Pfotenhauer, Secretary, and Dorothy J. Fundy, Treasurer, acknowledged that they signed, sealed and delivered the said instrument as their free and voluntary act, for the uses and purposes therein set forth. There is no question but what they were the officers of the corporation and the testimony of Robert M. Rich, cashier of the, bank and the notary public who executed the certificate of acknowledgment, shows that he, acting for the bank, made the loan to the named corporation. It further shows that Pfotenhauer asked for the loan in the name of the corporation and not in his own name and that it was Rich\u2019s understanding that Pfotenhauer was acting on behalf of the corporation and that at the time of the execution and acknowledgment of the chattel mortgage and the note secured thereby, the officers were acting in behalf of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The government relies heavily on First Nat. Bank of Chicago v. Baker, 62 Ill.App.- 154, where a certificate of acknowledgment of a chattel mortgage was under attack. It was executed to further secure a debt of Corey Car &amp; Manufacturing Company to the bank. A receiver having sold the assets of the Corey Company, the trial court held the bank\u2019s mortgage invalid. The certificate of acknowledgment thereon read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201cState of Illinois, ss \u201cCounty of Cook, J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">\u201cI, Jarvis Blume, a justice of the-peace in the town of West Chicago, in and for said county, do hereby certify that this mortgage was duly acknowledged before me by the-above named James B. Rielly, Sect\u2019y, and Francis W. Corey, Pres't, the mortgagors therein named, and entered by me this 6th day of February, A.D. 1894.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">\u201cWitness my hand and seal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">\u201cJarvis Blume, (Seal)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">\u201cJustice of the Peace\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">The Illinois court there pointed out. that the statutory language at that time was: \u201cThe certificate of acknowledgment may be in the following form: This (name of instrument) was acknowledged before me by <em>(name of grantor),. </em>etc. Rev.Stat. of Illinois, Ch. 95, Sec. 2.\u201d' (Italics supplied by us.) The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-16\">\u201cIt is the <em>grantor only </em>who can acknowledge a chattel mortgage, and the certificate must set forth that the <em>grantor did acknowledge. </em>The certificate in the present ease is not that the grantor acknowledged but that the mortgage was acknowledged \u2018by the above named James B. Rielly, Secretary, and Francis W. Corey, President, <em>the mortgagors therein named.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-17\">\u201cNeither James Rielly, Sect\u2019y, or Francis W. Corey, Pres\u2019t, were \u2018above named,\u2019 nor were they \u2018the mortgagors therein named.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-18\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-19\">\u201cThe question here presented is, whether this certificate of acknowledgment of a chattel mortgage which does not purport to be an acknowledgment <em>by the grantor, </em>is to be held to be by the <em>grantor.\u201d </em>(Italics supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-20\">Conceding for the purpose of this opinion that the Baker case is an authoritative statement of Illinois law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it is no support for the government\u2019s posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>tion in the case at bar. The statutory language in effect when the Baker case mortgage was executed required the certificate of acknowledgment to state therein the name of the grantor and the fail-lire to comply with that requirement was the express ground of decision in the Baker case.</p>\n<p id=\"AaU\">By way of contrast, the pertinent statute in this case does not require that a certificate of acknowledgment of a chattel mortgage shall set forth that the <em>grantor did acknowledge. </em>It requires that the certificate of acknowledgment shall be in substantially the form above quoted, supra, 253 F.2d 119. While there must be strict compliance with the requirement of the statute, that does not prevent the court from ascertaining from the mortgage itself the identity of the mortgagor. Where it further appears from the mortgage that it was entered into by the mortgagor, \u201cby their officers\u201d, whose signatures are a part of the mortgage, and, from the certificate \u25a0of acknowledgment, that the named officers of that corporation acknowledged that they executed the mortgage for the uses and purposes therein set forth, the statute is complied with. This is especially true where the testimony of the bank\u2019s officer, who was also the notary public, confirms the facts recited in the mortgage and the acknowledgment,</p>\n<p id=\"A65\">We hold that the district court was correct in sustaining the chattel mortgage and, therefore, its order is affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">Affirmed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\">. At the time the Illinois Appellate Court decided First Nat. Bank of Chicago v. Baker, 62 Ill.App. 154, \u00a7 41, eh. 37, B..S. Ill., provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201cAll opinions or decisions of said court upon the final hearing of any cause, shall be reduced to writing by the court, briefly giving therein the reasons for such opinion or decision, and be filed in the case in which rendered: Provided, That such opinion shall not be of binding authority in any cause or proceeding, other than in that in which they may be filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5A\">In Turner v. Alton Banking &amp; Trust Co., 8 Cir., 181 F.2d 899, 903, it was said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_N\">\u201cIt is true that the Hoyt [Hoyt v. Morris, 216 Ill.App. 321] and Vandersall [Vandersall v. Goldsmith, 231 Ill.App. 165] eases are not binding upon the federal courts since they were decided by Appellate Courts of Illinois which are inferior tribunals, and a statute of Illinois in effect at the time they were decided provided that the opinions of such courts \u2018shall not be of binding authority in any cause or proceeding, other than that in which they may be filed.\u2019 * * Nevertheless they are persuasive; * *. Ordinarily where the applicable rule of decision is the state law, the duty of the federal court is to ascertain and apply that law even though it has not been expounded by the highest court of the state. Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Field, 311 U.S. 169, 177, 61 S.Ct. 176, 85 L.Ed. 109. We are of the opinion that the construction of the statute by the Appellate Court of Illinois is the correct construction, and that it should be followed by the federal courts until the Supreme Court or some other Illinois court of general jurisdiction holds otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMU\">The holding of the Illinois Appellate Court in the Baker case was not affirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court, although its judgment was affirmed on <em>other </em>grounds. 161 Ill. 281, 43 N.E. 1074. However, we do in this opinion, consider the reasoning of the Appellate Court decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
