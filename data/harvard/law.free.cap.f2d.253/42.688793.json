The transfer was based only on the record as it stood at the date of the order, with medical reports then many months old. Of course the plaintiff will be permitted to offer proof of all factors which may give rise to damages in excess of $3,000. D. C.Code, \u00a7 11-756 (Supp. V 1957) expressly provides for such situations in that the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court \u201cshall extend to the amount claimed in such action, even though it exceed the sum of $3,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-18\">Appellant\u2019s counsel complains that defense counsel frequently argue in transferred cases that damages in excess of $3,000 should not be awarded and point to the District Court\u2019s order as indicating that such is the already established opinion of a District Judge. The order of transfer should be irrelevant in any situation where as to damages the plaintiff offers evidence which was not before the District Judge at the date of the order. We would suppose that upon request, the plaintiff should be entitled to receive an instruction that the jury should disregard any such argument and may award damages in such amount as it shall find the plaintiff is entitled to receive up to the amount claimed in the action. In the circumstances mentioned, what shall have appeared \u201cto the satisfaction\u201d of the District Judge should have no bearing upon the jury\u2019s consideration of the transferred case.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-19\">On the record before us we find no <em>,9 </em>abuse of discretion. Barnard v. Schneider, 1957, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 152, 243 F. 2d 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
