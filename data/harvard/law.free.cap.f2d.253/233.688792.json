The appeal is from the District Court for the District of Delaware sitting in admiralty. That Court refused a motion by attorneys for the appellants here to dismiss a petition for exoneration from or limitation of liability or, in the alternative, to transfer the action from Delaware to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The argument in support of this motion is that the refusal is not appealable either \u00e1s a final decision under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 or, in the words of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(3), an interlocutory order determining \u201cthe rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases.\u201d That may well be. But there was also granted by the Delaware court the injunction usual in these cases,, against suits outside that District. We have, therefore, a case directly within 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(1). Squarely in point is Blackler v. F. Jacobus Transportation Co., 2 Cir., 1957, 243 F.2d 733, 734. See also Curtis Bay Towing Co. v. Tug Kevin Moran, Inc., 2 Cir., 1947, 159 F.2d 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-20\">The motion to dismiss will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
