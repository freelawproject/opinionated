Charellen Corp., 5 Cir., 120 F.2d 984 and Dick-Cleland v. 800 Washington Ave., Inc., 5 Cir., 143 F.2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-23\">Insisting that the district judge was wrong in denying the effect claimed for that amendment, appellants are here urging upon us that the judgment was wrong and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-24\">We do not think so. On the considerations and for the reasons stated in the thorough opinion of the district judge, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-25\">.
