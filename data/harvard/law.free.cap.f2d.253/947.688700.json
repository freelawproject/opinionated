On his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) the court accorded him a full hearing of the issue as to his representation by counsel and eventually found that he had been duly represented at the time of his sentence on plea of guilt. There was sharply conflicting evidence, from the defendant himself, the lawyer in question, and a deputy court clerk, together with certain records \u2014 all as discussed in Judge Rayfiel\u2019s opinion, D.C.E.D.N.Y., 151 F.Supp. 160. The judge accepted the testimony of the deputy clerk. We find nothing clearly erroneous in this judgment on the facts and accordingly affirm. United States v. Di Martini, 2 Cir., 219 F.2d 807; and see United States v. Di Martini, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 120 F. Supp. 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
