The time for compliance having expired, the appellees on July 30, 1956, filed their timely motion to dismiss the original complaint. Some two months later, the appellants filed an amended complaint on October 1, 1956. Cutting through the maze, and after oral argument, the District Court, on October 3, 1956, granted the appel-lees\u2019 motion to dismiss, and struck the appellants\u2019 amended complaint because of their failure to comply with the earlier order of the court. We have been shown no error in the disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
