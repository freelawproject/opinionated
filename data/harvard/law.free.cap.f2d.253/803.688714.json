Tiedman, against the American Pigment Corporation, on a contract of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">Tiedman\u2019s co-plaintiff, Mercaldi, had no participation in the events here reviewed, and joined in the suit as as-signee of an interest in Tiedman\u2019s claim. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">The contentions raised on the appeal are that the Court erred in its decision upon the merits and in denying certain of the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for the inspection of documents and premises in defendant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">In 1941, and for some years earlier, the defendant had been engaged at Pulaski, Virginia, in manufacturing natural iron pigments from raw materials which it mined nearby. It had also been buying synthetic iron oxides, known as fer-rites, from Northern Pigment Company, of Toronto, Canada, particularly two shades designated by Northern as Nos. 300 and 307. As the patents on processes for manufacturing synthetic iron oxides had expired in 1938, they were rapidly replacing natural materials which had theretofore been imported from abroad to tint mined pigments used in paint making. American Pigment\u2019s chemist had, before entering military service, succeeded in producing in its laboratory only small quantities of synthetic iron oxides. The company had not produced them commercially and had no facilities for their large scale production. It was desirous, however, of entering that branch of the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">In the fall of 1941, American Pigment Corporation learned that Tiedman, plant manager of the Northern Pigment Company, was available for employment. After negotiations, American and Tied-man entered into a contract dated January 10, 1942, for his employment for a period of ten years, renewable for additional periods up to forty years. The defendant agreed to set up facilities in accordance with Tiedman\u2019s advice and assistance, and the latter promised to serve the former \u201cwith all of the knowledge and skill at his command in the manufacture of synthetic oxides.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>further agreed \u201cto reveal the secrets and methods <em>in toto </em>known to him or that may become known to him in the manufacture or process of synthetic iron oxides during the term of his employment.\u201d Specifically he agreed that he could and would manufacture synthetic iron oxides of a quality equal or superior to \u201cNorthern pigments Nos. 300 and 307.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">In addition to an agreed salary, Tied-man was promised a \u201croyalty\u201d of two dollars per ton on all synthetic iron oxides manufactured. The royalty was to be paid, irrespective of the duration of the employment, to Tiedman and his heirs, etc., during his lifetime and for a period of fifty years after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Commercial production of synthetic iron oxides began at Pulaski in August, 1942, but according to the defendant, the product did not measure up to the standards of the trade or of competing products, particularly Northern\u2019s Nos. 300 and 307, as promised in the contract. Tiedman, however, testifying as a witness, insisted that such failures as occurred were due either to the strain of wartime conditions or to breaches of the defendant\u2019s contractual duty to supply him proper facilities and labor; that while there had been some differences between him and his employers, they had made no major complaints against him; and that the company abruptly fired him on November 19, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Emphatically, he testified that he had disclosed fully and in good faith all secrets and methods known to him regarding the manufacture of synthetic iron oxides, as required by the contract, and that if the employers were unable to practice the art, it was not because he withheld anything, but because deficient training limited their ability fully to utilize the disclosures made to them. He asserted, however, that the company had actually been successful as a result of the \u201cknow how\u201d skills, and methods he communicated to its employees; that American had suffered no losses; that all of its product was absorbed by the market or used by the defendant. The response of the defendant was that much that was disposed of in wartime was inferior to the standard promised by Tiedman and could not possibly have satisfied normal requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">The testimony presents irreconcilable conflicts, which need not be further elaborated. It raises essentially issues of credibility, and the case illustrates the reason for the rule (No. 52, F.R.C.P., 28 U.S.C.A.) requiring appellate courts to give due regard to the trial court\u2019s opportunity, which is denied them, to see and hear the witnesses, and to accept findings of fact unless convinced that they are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">The Judge\u2019s findings determined the facts substantially as contended by the defendant. He found that the plant was erected in accordance with Tiedman\u2019s directions as to layout, selection and installation of machinery and equipment, and that Tiedman made no complaint then as to the plant or its equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">The Judge\u2019s opinion points out that Tiedman failed to install equipment that had been furnished at his instance, and that he permitted it to lie idle during the entire period of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">The District Judge concluded that according to the weight of the credible evidence, Tiedman did not as a rule during the three years of his employment succeed in producing a product of the required standards of quality to meet the competition of the market. There was also an explicit finding that Tiedman did not perform his obligation to impart his knowledge or skill and to disclose his methods to anyone connected with the defendant. On the contrary, the Court was convinced that Tiedman studiously avoided passing on information to those employees who did possess sufficient training to utilize it in the production of the required product independently of Tiedman; that he hoarded his secret knowledge, persistently rejecting the company\u2019s suggestions for the employment of a trained assistant to whom he could impart his methods and secrets. There was evidence that Tiedman boasted of driving away the company\u2019s gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>eral manager for \u201cnosing in my business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The circumstances under which Tied-man\u2019s employment ended were minutely inquired into in the District Court. They are enlightening on the questions of credibility in other aspects of the testimony, and obviously were given consideration by the Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Over a considerable period the defendant had been seeking a method of producing synthetic sienna. By the summer of 1945, with Tiedman\u2019s assistance, it believed that it had achieved a patentable process. A contract was prepared for assignment by Tiedman to the company of any patent that might be granted, upon payment of certain cash considerations. Tiedman declined to execute the contract without first seeking advice from Mr. Constable, his father-in-law, an attorney in Toronto. For this declared purpose, Tiedman left Pulaski October 4, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">It appears from testimony offered by the defendant that as Tiedman was expected to return in about a week, an appointment was arranged for him for October 15, to meet a Mr. Garrett, a mechanical engineer who had recently been discharged from military service and was under consideration for employment as an assistant to Tiedman. Asked on cross examination why he did not return for this interview, Tiedman replied he had no such appointment \u201cthat [he] knew of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">About the 15th of October, Mr. Tied-man, instead of returning to Pulaski, wired from White Plains, New York, to his secretary at the plant, without disclosing where he could be reached, requesting her to deposit his semi-monthly salary in his bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">There was no further communication from Tiedman, but on November 13, 1945, his father-in-law as his attorney, wrote the defendant\u2019s attorney advising that Tiedman had consulted him \u201cabout four weeks ago\u201d concerning their contract and that \u201cas I did not hear from him I left the matter in abeyance.\u201d Mr. Constable\u2019s letter also announced to the defendant, \u201cIt now appears that Mr. Tiedman remained over in New York to look after certain interests and in the belief that he was entitled to a reasonable vacation.\u201d Mr. Constable suggested that the defendant forward to Mr. Tiedman his salary for one month by way of vacation \u201con his undertaking to return at once to the company for further instructions.\u201d He added that he did not know Mr. Tiedman\u2019s address in New York but that a communication would reach him if sent in care of Miss Constable, a daughter of the writer and a sister of Mrs. Tiedman, at a given address in White Plains, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Defendant\u2019s attorneys promptly informed Mr. Constable that their client was unwilling to make the requested advance, and on November 19, wrote Mr. Constable, recounting the circumstances of plaintiff\u2019s departure on October 4, and his failure to return. They also recited the defendant\u2019s version of its disagreements with Tiedman and his alleged failures in his duty under the contract, and gave notice of termination of the contract of employment. The company addressed a letter to Tiedman at his Pulaski apartment, instructing him not to visit the ferrite plant until he had conferred with its Executive Vice-President.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Tiedman did return to Pulaski later in November and was requested to attend a conference with company officials at its attorney's office. He put in an appearance at the designated time and place but declined to remain for the conference and walked out. He testified that when he left on October 4, he intended to return, but that he was summarily dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">The District Judge found that Tied-man abandoned his job on October 4, 1945, disrupting the defendant's operations. The defendant made diligent effort to overcome these handicaps and to produce synthetic oxide. Not until the government made available to the defendant information obtained from German sources after the war, was the defendant\u2019s problem solved.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>For several years defendant heard nothing from Tiedman. His first claim against it was asserted in a letter dated May 3, 1948, demanding royalties on the theory that it was continuing to use methods disclosed by him. Defendant denied the assertion and the claim. Then followed another silence of four years. Tiedman filed suit in August, 1952, nearly seven years after the termination of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">An examination of the record discloses ample support for each of the findings of fact, and an appellate court would not be warranted in upsetting such findings unless convinced that the trial Judge was clearly erroneous. Rule 52, F.R.C.P. (28 U.S.C.A.). Our study of the record leaves us with no such conviction; we think on the contrary that the facts were correctly found. See: Walling v. General Industries Co., 1947, 330 U.S. 545, 550, 67 S.Ct. 883, 91 L.Ed. 1088; Banks v. Siegel, 4 Cir., 1950, 181 F.2d 309; Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York v. Commander, 4 Cir., 1956, 231 F.2d 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention that any failures in the quality of the product for which Tiedman was accountable were waived by the defendant, requires no extended discussion. A laudatory letter written by the defendant company in April, 1943, a few months after the plant was built but two and one-half years before Tiedman\u2019s services were terminated, was much relied on by him to show the company\u2019s satisfaction with his performance, or waiver of any default.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\"> A default unquestionably may be waived, but where the performance due is of a continuing nature, the promisee need not at once terminate the agreement. If he brings home to the promisor the complaints registered against the promisor\u2019s product, and if he continues the relationship on the assurance of better future performance, he is not barred from asserting his rights. In such a case, the successive acceptances of the defective performance would not justify the belief that performance of the character tendered was satisfactory to the promisee, and a waiver of the right to the promised performance cannot be found. See: 3 Williston, Contracts (Rev.Ed., 1936), Sec. 741, p. 2100, et seq.; Restatement, Contracts, Secs. 297, 300 (cf. Ill.B., Sec. 300); Cf. 3 Cor-bin, Contracts (1951), Sec. 755, p. 918; Smith\u2019s Ex\u2019x v. Profitt\u2019s Adm\u2019x, 1887, 82 Va. 832, 1 S.E. 67; Gibney &amp; Co. v. Arlington Brewery Co., 1911, 112 Va. 117, 70 S.E. 485, 487; Orr Felt, etc., Co. v. Sherwin Wool Co., 1924, 248 Mass. 553, 143 N.E. 541; Conoco Oil Co. v. Union Oil Co., 6 Cir., 1936, 83 F.2d 491; Hein v. Fox, 1953, 126 Mont. 514, 254 P.2d 1076; National School Studios v. Mealey, 1956, 211 Md. 116, 126 A.2d 588; Welsh v. Hume, La.App. 1956, 86 So.2d 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The plaintiff has not performed the basic conditions precedent to the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay royalties. The contract expressly provides that the manufacture by Tiedman of synthetic iron oxides of a quality equal to or superior to the Northern pigments Nos. 300 and 307 is \u201ca condition precedent herein.\u201d Also, performance of Tiedman\u2019s promise to reveal his secrets and methods is a constructive condition precedent to the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay royalties after Tiedman\u2019s employment ceased. And so, for the breach of both the express and constructive conditions, the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay the royalties never arose, and plaintiffs\u2019 claim as to them must fail. 3 Williston, Contracts (Rev.Ed., 1936), Sec. 829, p. 2318, et seq.; Restatement, Contracts, Secs. 269, 270. See also, Restatement, Contracts, Sec. 250; Freeman Stone &amp; Gravel Co. v. Wight &amp; Co., 1930, 154 Va. 306, 153 S.E. 701; 3 Corbin, Contracts (1951), Sec. 657, p. 621, Sec. 676, p. 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Tiedman moved, under rule 34 (28 U.S.C.A.), for an order directing the defendant to permit him to examine all of its books, records, and communications, \u201cin any way pertaining to the contract between the plaintiff and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>defendant * * * \u2022 or to the operations of defendant under said contract from December, 1941, to date,\u201d or \u201cin anyway pertaining to the business relations between the plaintiff and the defendant from December, 1941, to date.\u201d Tied-man also sought permission to enter the defendant\u2019s plant to inspect, measure, survey, or photograph \u201cthe land, the plant, facilities, and all equipment * * in any manner related\u201d to the production of synthetic iron oxides.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The District Judge denied each request, except that he permitted an accountant to determine the volume of defendant\u2019s sales of synthetic iron oxides. The plaintiffs contend that denial of the rest was reversible error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">It is, of course, true that a trial is not a' sporting event, and discovery is founded upon the policy that the search for truth should be aided. Comercio E Industria Continental, S.A. v. Dresser Industries, Inc., D.C.N.Y. 1956, 19 F.R.D. 513; Rule 34 is, therefore, to be liberally construed. June v. George C. Peterson Co., 7 Cir., 1946, 155 F.2d 963; Karlsson v. Wolfson, D. C.Minn.1956, 18 F.R.D. 474. An appellate court does not, however, decide whether it would, in the first instance, have permitted the discovery prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\"> Granting or denying a request under rule 34 is a matter within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and it will be reversed only if the action taken was improvident and affected substantial rights. Carter v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 1945, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 257, 152 F.2d 129, 130; Atlantic Greyhound Corporation v. Lauritzen, 6 Cir., 1950, 182 F.2d 540; Sher v. DeHaven, 1952, 91 U.S. App.D.C. 257, 197 F.2d 777, 781, 36 A. L.R.2d 937; Bank of America National Trust <em>&amp; </em>Savings Ass\u2019n v. Hayden, 9 Cir., 1956, 231 F.2d 595, 606; 2 Barron &amp; Holtzoff (1950), Sec. 803, p. 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Tiedman made no effort, either in his motion or by affidavit, to show good cause, as required by the rule, for the production of the records and documents, or the proposed inspection of the plant. Martin v. Capital Transit Co., 1948, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 239, 170 F.2d 811, 814; United Mercantile Agencies v. Silver Fleet Motor Express, D.C.Ky.1941, 1 F.R.D. 709. See: Victory v. Manning, 3 Cir., 1942, 128 F.2d 415. Seven years were permitted to elapse after he had left the defendant\u2019s employ before he filed his suit and the motion. In the meantime, doubtless, changes had been made in the plant. Because of the competitive nature of the pigment industry, the defendant sought to keep secret from him improvements which it had developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">Recognizing the extensive scope of the production and inspection which his motion called for, plaintiff, upon denial of his motion, stated that he might want to renew it later to meet some of the objections that the court raised, \u201cparticularly that of generality.\u201d See: 4 Moore, Federal Practice (1950), Sec. 34.07, p. 2442 et seq., Consolidated Rendering Co. v. State of Vermont, 1908, 207 U.S. 541, 28 S.Ct. 178, 52 L.Ed. 327; Brown v. United States, 1928, 276 U.S. 134, 48 S.Ct. 288, 72 L.Ed. 500. This the plaintiff never did. See: Bank of America National Trust &amp; Savings Ass\u2019n v. Hayden, 9 Cir., 1956, 231 F.2d 595, 605. Seemingly abandoning his motion under rule 34, Tiedman utilized the deposition procedure under rule 26 (28 U.S.C.A.) to question the defendant\u2019s employees, and also availed himself of subpoena duces tecum under rule 45 (28 U.S.C.A.) both of which are in pari materia to rule 34. 4 Moore, Federal Practice (1950), Sec. 34.02, p. 2424; U. S. v. Schine Chain Theatres, D.C. N.Y.1942, 2 F.R.D. 425; North v. Lehigh Valley Transit Co., D.C.Pa.1950, 10 F.R.D. 38. His motion under rule 34 was not further pressed in the two years before trial, and the matter is raised on appeal apparently as an afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">We cannot say that the action of the trial court was in the circumstances so improvident as to amount to an abuse of discretion or that plaintiff\u2019s substantial rights were prejudicially affected. See: Sher v. DeHaven, 1952, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>91 U.S.App.D.C. 257, 199 F.2d 777, 781, 86 A.L.R.2d 937; Lever Bros. Co. v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., D.C.Md. 1941, 38 F.Supp. 680; Michel v. Meier, D.C.W.D.Pa.1948, 8 F.R.D. 464, 476; Kurt M. Jachmann Co. v. Marine Office of America, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1955, 17 F.R.D. 41, 42; Cf.
