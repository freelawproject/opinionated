The complaint was dismissed for failure to make out a claim under the F.E.L.A. Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C. sec. 51 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Plaintiff, an employee of defendant Erie Railroad, seeks to recover damages for personal injuries suffered when a passenger on one of defendant\u2019s trains struck her leg with something like a suitcase which he was carrying. Plaintiff\u2019s theory is that because of defendant\u2019s failure to afford her toilet facilities she was forced to and did use for that purpose the lavatory in the car in which she was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s post of duty was in the Jersey Avenue Car Shops in the Jersey City yards. She lived in Bloomfield, N. J., and was accustomed to travel back and forth on defendant\u2019s trains, using the Jersey City station. She was the only woman employee in the shops and there was no women\u2019s toilet so that she was accustomed to use the lavatory in any one of the cars standing on tracks adjoining the shop awaiting use. If there were no cars there she would \u201cgo to Eleventh Street, where 519 was \u2014 go down and use the toilet facilities in there.\" She had protested against this state of affairs but it had obtained all of the twenty-nine years while she had been employed there. On December 31, 1947, she was excused early at 2:30 p.m. She would have taken \u2022a bus to the station from whence her train would leave except that she wanted to use the toilet and so she went into the yard where she knew there were trains. The foreman of the yard brought her to empty train 27 and told her that it was going right down to the station. The train would thus serve a double purpose for her. She got into one of the cars, left her pocketbook and bag on a seat opposite the lavatory and went in. By the time she came out the train had started and reached the station and passengers were jumping on while it was going. She waited until the train had stopped and no more passengers were coming in and then reached across for her pocketbook and bag and was then struck by something carried by one of the passengers who had previously boarded the train. She fell and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">To render defendant liable it must have violated some duty. The violation of duty here claimed to exist is the failure to supply women\u2019s toilet facilities in the shop. If we were to apply the conventional law of negligence plaintiff would clearly be without right of recovery. At common law, in a case such as this, a defendant is negligent only when his conduct involves an unreasonable risk of subjecting the plaintiff to the hazard from which the harm results. Restatement, Torts \u00a7 281(b), Comment e.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">We are of opinion that, even if there was evidence sufficient to take the question of negligence to the jury under the F.E.L.A. \u2014 which we do not decide \u2014 still the court below was correct in dismissing at the close of the evidence. The causation requisite for recovery under the F.E.L.A. is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-13\"> It is true that, to impose liability on the defendant, the negligence need not be the proximate cause of the injury. The F.E.L.A. has its own rule of causation. The injury need only be one \u201cresulting in whole or in part\u201d from the negligence. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 52. The question of causation is one for the jury if \u201cthe proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury.\u201d Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 506, 77 S.Ct. 443, 448,1 L.Ed.2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>The case of Ringhiser v. Chesapeake &amp; O. R. Co., 354 U.S. 901, 77 S.Ct. 1093, 1 L.Ed.2d 1268, which involved an injury to a railroad employee while using a gondola car as a toilet, is of no help on this question of causation because there the court found that negligence of a yard crew in bumping the gondola car was a sufficient cause under the F.E.L.A. and did not find it necessary to pass on the question whether the failure to supply toilet facilities was such a cause. In the Ringhiser case an engineer had left his cab to use the gondola car as a toilet. While he was doing so a yard crew made normal contact between two cars and the gondola and caused its contents to slip and injure him. There was evidence that the railroad knew that its employees used gondola cars for toilet purposes. Referring to that, the Supreme Court said, 354 U.S. page 901, 77 S.Ct. at page 1094. \u201cIn that circumstance there were probative facts from which the jury could find that respondent was or should have been aware of conditions which created a likelihood that the petitioner would suffer just such an injury as he did.\u201d The basis of liability there was thus negligence of the yard crew who caused the contact in not looking out for .someone who they should have known might be using the gondola for toilet purposes rather than negligence of the railroad in not supplying toilet facilities for the plaintiff on his engine. The question whether the failure to supply toilet facilities was a cause of the injury was therefore not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Speaking literally it cannot be denied that in the case at bar failure to .supply toilet facilities \u201cplayed a part\u201d in producing plaintiff\u2019s injury. If defendant had supplied indoor toilet facilities plaintiff would not have been where the passenger\u2019s baggage struck her. It is not enough, however, that the injury would not have happened \u201cbut for\u201d the negligence. Assume that plaintiff here, because of the delay incident to her long way around via the car\u2019s lavatory, took a train that arrived at Bloomfield fifteen minutes later than the one which she would have taken if toilet facilities had been furnished at her place of employment and that she was struck by an automobile in the street in Bloomfield on her way home from the station. She would have escaped injury \u201cbut for\u201d the failure to supply toilet facilities, yet the causation certainly would not even meet the modest requirements of the terms of the F.E.L.A. The fault would be too far removed both in space and time from the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">The courts must work out case by case the F.E.L.A. causation rule just as they worked out, case by case, the common law causation rule; until we have more precedents it is difficult to formulate such a rule. We believe that in the course of this process we ought to hold that the cause and effect here were too far removed from one another in space and time to satisfy the requirements of the F.E.L.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
