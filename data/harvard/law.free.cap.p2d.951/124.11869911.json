Bauer (Employee), and reinstating Employee to his former grade/position. In this appeal, OCC contends its actions vis-a-vis Employee were in conformity with the law and rules concerning employee reallocation and demotion, and that the MPC (and, subsequently, the trial court) exceeded its authority in ordering OCC to reinstate Employee. Employee cross-appeals the denial of his full prayer for attorney fees below. Finding no reversible error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-18\">\u00b6 2 Employee worked for OCC in several different capacities, achieving the class of Administrative Officer II. As such, Employee could and did fill a number of different positions within OCC. However, Employee complained to MPC on several occasions regarding OCC\u2019s allocation of his class and position. Subsequently, OCC submitted the requisite documents to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to determine allocation or reallocation of Employee\u2019s class/position. OPM originally reallocated Employee to a Senior Public Utility Specialist then to a Public Utility Specialist after OCC had changed Employee\u2019s duties to those of a public utility specialist. OCC then exercised its option to demote Employee to Public Utility Specialist, resulting in a drop of 14 grades from that of Administrative Officer II and a decrease in annual salary of approximately $9,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-19\">\u00b63 Employee appealed his demotion to the MPC on the grounds OCC\u2019s actions were arbitrary and capricious. After hearing, the ALJ agreed, specifically finding, inter aha:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afr\">OCC had Administrative Officer II positions available to which Employee could have been transferred without loss in pay or class,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>OCC\u2019s practice has been to minimize salary loss to demoted employees,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">No other OCC employee had ever experienced the severity of pay and class loss as Employee,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">The decision of OCC to demote Employee so severely was made without the advice\u2014 or contrary to the advice\u2014of OCC\u2019s Personnel Director, Senior Personnel Officer, nor were the procedures of OCC\u2019s Human Resources Department followed,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">Had the internal personnel resources of OCC with expertise in the area of employees been utilized vis-a-vis Employee\u2019s situation, \u201cthis entire matter could have been fairly and equitably resolved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The ALJ concluded that OCC\u2019s actions \u201ccan only be deemed arbitrary, capricious, and frivolous, wasting not only the time and obvious expense of the OPM but that of [OCC] and [MPC],\u201d ordering Employee reinstated and awarding Employee limited attorney fees. OCC appealed to the trial court which found \u201cample\u201d evidence to support the MPC\u2019s order and affirmed Employee\u2019s reinstatement to his previous grade/position but denied Employee\u2019s request for additional attorney fees. Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b6 4 OCC argues its demotion of Employee merely resulted from following OPM\u2019s reallocation of Employee\u2019s position and, as such, consistent with MPC rules. In this regard, MPC Rule 530:10-5-91 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Other position reallocations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">(a) If a position is reallocated ... and the class of an incumbent employee does not match the new allocation of the position, the Appointing Authority must take action within 60 calendar days after the effective date of the final allocation to ensure that the employee is properly classified. The Appointing Authority may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">(1) transfer a permanent employee in-class to another position in the agency allocated to the class matching the classification of the employee in accordance with the Merit Rules governing in-class transfers; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-13\">(2) change the duties of the position to the extent necessary to reflect the classification of the employee and initiate another audit of the positions; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-14\">(3) reclassify a permanent employee to the class to which the position occupied by the employee was reallocated in accordance with the merit rules governing promotions, demotions and in-class transfers; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">Stated otherwise, OCC had the option to place Employee in a vacant Administrative Officer II position, change the duties of the position to reflect Administrative Officer II classification held by Employee and seek reaudit, or demote Employee. However, the record clearly shows that OCC in the past had generally chosen the option impacting its employees the least, and OPM\u2019s audit and reallocation of Employee\u2019s position subsequent to Employee\u2019s transfer by OCC to the duties of a public utility specialist in no way directed or even suggested a demotion or affected OCC\u2019s ability to implement an option less severe than demotion. Considering OCC\u2019s history of choosing the option having the least impact on its employees, and considering the ALJ\u2019s findings that OCC decided to demote Employee either without or contrary to the advice of its own personnel director and apparently contrary to its own Human Resources Department procedures, we accordingly reject this argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-16\">\u00b6 5 An order of an administrative agency may not be disturbed unless erroneous under 75 O.S.1981 \u00a7 322. On appeal from an administrative decision, the appellate courts, whether the District Court, the Court of Civil Appeals or the Supreme Court, apply the same standards of review directly to the administrative record. 75 O.S.1981 \u00a7 322(1); <em>Seely v. Okla. Horse Racing Commission, </em>1987 OK CIV APP 61, 743 P.2d 685, 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-17\">\u00b6 6 In the present ease, Employee availed himself of MPC rule 455:10-3-7 regarding appeals of demotions. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWO\">(a) Involuntary demotion\u2014position audit. In appeals from involuntary demotions occurring after a position has been audited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>by the Office of Personnel Management, <em>the issue shall be limited to the action of the appointing authority. No hearing will be scheduled unless an investigation by the [MPC] indicates the decision of the agency to demote the employee was arbitrary in lieu of other options </em>or for disciplinary reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">(Emphasis added.) Further, MPC rule 455:10-5-5 requires such eases to be decided by a preponderance of the evidence, and the burden of proof is on the appointing authority, in this case OCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b6 7 At the conclusion of hearing, the AL J specifically found OCC\u2019s course of conduct up to and including Employee\u2019s demotion arbitrary, capricious, and frivolous. We have reviewed the record and cannot say this conclusion is erroneous under any of the grounds set out in 75 O.S.1991 \u00a7 322. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s order affirming the order of the MPC reinstating Employee to his former grade/position is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b6 8 Finally, Employee challenges the denial of attorney fees incurred pursuing his prior complaints to MPC, although Employee was awarded attorney fees for the instant MPC complaint. In this regard, the record reflects OCC sought judicial review of this matter on August 2, 1995, within thirty days of the MPC order of July 3, 1995. The MPC issued an Addendum Order on August 15,1995 awarding Employee some but not all of his requested attorney fees. On August 25, 1995, OCC amended its petition for review to challenge the award of attorney fees, and Employee filed his petition for review of the same order on September 25,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u00b6 9 A party aggrieved by an MPC decision must <em>in all instances </em>file a petition for judicial review in the district court within thirty days of that decision pursuant to 75 O.S.1991 \u00a7 318(B)(2). We find no authority for Employee\u2019s assertion that he is allowed forty days in which to file a \u201ccross-appeal\u201d when seeking judicial review of an agency order in the district court as opposed to this Court. We therefore decline to review or disturb the MPC order awarding limited attorney fees to Employee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, Employee\u2019s request for attorney fees in this review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\u00b6 10 The order of the trial court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-11\">HANSEN, P.J., and BUETTNER, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-12\">. We also hold this analysis dispositive of OCC\u2019s argument that the MPC lacked jurisdiction to \"order\" OCC to \"ignore OPM's reallocation and the applicable law,\u201d further finding no factual basis in the record for this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">. Although it is unclear to which review proceeding Employee refers, he apparently also challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to award \"appeal-related\u201d attorney fees for defending himself against OCC's actions. However, such award is entirely discretionary with the trial court. 75 O.S.1991 \u00a7 318(D)(2). Finding no abuse of that discretion, we reject this proposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
