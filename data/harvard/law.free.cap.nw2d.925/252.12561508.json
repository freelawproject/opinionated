R. Prof. Conduct 1.2, 1.3, 1.4(a)(3), 1.16(d), 3.2, 3.4(c), 3.4(d), 8.1(b), and 8.4(d), and Rules 25 and 26, Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   By order dated December 17, 2018, the court deemed the allegations in the petition admitted because respondent failed to file an answer to the petition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rule 13(b), RLPR, and directed the parties to file memoranda regarding the appropriate discipline to impose in this case. Only the Director filed a memorandum. The Director recommends that the court indefinitely suspend respondent with no right to petition for reinstatement for 6 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The court has independently reviewed the file and approves the Director's recommended discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Respondent Daniel Thomas Westerman is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law, effective from the date of filing of this order, with no right to petition for reinstatement for 6 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Respondent may petition for reinstatement pursuant to Rule 18(a)-(d), RLPR. Reinstatement is conditioned on successful completion of the written examination required for admission to the practice of law by the State Board of Law Examiners on the subject of professional responsibility and on satisfaction of continuing legal education requirements pursuant to Rule 18(e), RLPR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3. Respondent shall comply with Rule 26, RLPR (requiring notice of suspension to clients, opposing counsel, and tribunals) and shall pay $900 in costs pursuant to Rule 24, RLPR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    /s/ David L.
