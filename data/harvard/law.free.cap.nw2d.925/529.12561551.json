Grass, Respondent.\n </docketnumber>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-3\">\n  No. 2018AP2460-D\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-4\">\n  Supreme Court of Wisconsin.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-5\">\n  Opinion Filed: April 16, 2019\n </decisiondate>\n <disposition id=\"p-6\">\n  ATTORNEY disciplinary proceeding.\n  <em>\n   Attorney's license suspended.\n  </em>\n </disposition>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   PER CURIAM.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b61 We review a stipulation filed pursuant to Supreme Court Rule (SCR) 22.12 by the\n   Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR) and Attorney Gary E. Grass. In the stipulation, Attorney Grass admits that he committed professional misconduct, and he agrees with the OLR's request that his license to practice law in Wisconsin be suspended for a period of 60 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 After careful review of the matter, we accept the stipulation and impose the requested\n   discipline. Because Attorney Grass entered into a comprehensive stipulation before the appointment of a referee, we do not require him to pay the costs of this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Attorney Grass was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 2003. He has no prior disciplinary history. Effective May 22, 2018, his Wisconsin law license was suspended for failure to comply with mandatory continuing legal education reporting requirements. Effective October 31, 2018, his license was suspended for failure to pay state bar dues and provide OLR trust account certification. On November 13, 2018, his law license was temporarily suspended by this court for failure to cooperate with three OLR investigations into his conduct. His law license remains suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 On December 27, 2018, the OLR filed a complaint alleging that Attorney Grass had engaged in 14 counts of misconduct arising out of his representation of five clients. On February 15, 2019, the OLR and Attorney Grass filed their stipulation. We take the following facts from that stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Client W.H.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 In or about November 2009, Attorney Grass was appointed by the public defender's office to appear as appellate counsel on behalf of W.H. in a criminal\n   matter in Waukesha County. Attorney Grass filed an appeal on behalf of W.H. relating to modification of the original sentence and a re-confinement sentence as well as raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 In June 2012, the court of appeals issued an order finding that W.H. was entitled to a resentencing hearing and remanding the matter for a hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The court of appeals held that the motion to modify the original sentence could not properly be decided in the context of that appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 In September of 2016, W.H. retained Attorney Grass to represent him regarding a motion to modify the original sentence. Attorney Grass received a $1,000 fee from W.H., some of which was applied to work Attorney Grass had already performed and some of which was to be for future services. Attorney Grass did not place the $1,000 into his trust account. It is unclear how much of the fee was applied to work already performed and how much was paid in contemplation of future services. Attorney Grass did not have a written fee agreement with W.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 W.H. filed a grievance with the OLR against Attorney Grass on June 23, 2017. On June 26, 2017, Attorney Grass filed a motion to modify the original sentence. The circuit court denied that motion in March 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69 In a letter dated January 29, 2018, an OLR investigator requested that Attorney Grass provide additional information relating to W.H.'s grievance. The OLR gave Attorney Grass several extensions of time to respond to the request for information but he never responded. The OLR filed a motion with this court seeking an order that Attorney Grass show cause\n   why his Wisconsin law license should not be temporarily suspended for his failure to cooperate in this and two other OLR investigations. On November 13, 2018, this court issued an order temporarily suspending Attorney Grass' Wisconsin law license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b610 By virtue of entering into the stipulation, Attorney Grass admitted the following counts of misconduct with respect to his representation of W.H.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 1:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to place the portion of W.H.'s $1,000 constituting an advanced\n   fee into his trust account, Attorney Grass violated SCR 20:1.5(f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 2:\n   </strong>\n   By willfully failing to respond to the OLR's request for additional information relating to W.H.'s grievance, Attorney Grass violated SCR 22.03(6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Client M.E.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 In April 2016, M.E. hired Attorney Grass as postconviction counsel in a criminal matter in Milwaukee\n   County. Attorney Grass agreed to review M.E.'s criminal conviction and prepare a motion challenging it. Pursuant to the terms of the fee agreement, M.E. agreed to pay a $1,000 advanced fee. Attorney Grass agreed to provide M.E.'s mother, E.E., with monthly billing statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Attorney Grass did not file any postconviction motions on behalf of M.E., nor did he provide E.E. with monthly billing statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 In November 2017, M.E. and E.E. both filed grievances with the OLR about Attorney Grass' handling of the postconviction matter. In April 2018, Attorney Grass told M.E. and E.E. that a motion would be fully completed in two or three weeks, but he failed to follow through.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 In a letter dated May 30, 2018, M.E. wrote to the OLR regarding the status of his case and Attorney Grass' law license. Attorney Grass had failed to notify M.E. of his suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 In a letter dated February 2, 2018, the OLR forwarded the grievances of M.E. and E.E. to Attorney Grass and requested a response. In spite of being given several extensions of time to provide a response, Attorney Grass failed to do so. This court's November 13, 2018 order temporarily suspending Attorney Grass' law license was based in part on his failure to respond to the grievances filed by M.E. and E.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b616 By virtue of entering into the stipulation, Attorney Grass admitted the following counts of misconduct with respect to his representation of M.E.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 3:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to file a postconviction motion on M.E.'s behalf prior to the May 22, 2018 administrative suspension of his law license, Attorney Grass violated SCR 20:1.3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 4:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to notify M.E. of the May 22, 2018 suspension of his law license and his consequent inability to practice law, Attorney Grass violated SCR 22.26(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforceable via SCR\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   20:8.4(f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 5:\n   </strong>\n   By willfully failing to respond to the OLR's February 2, 2018 letter seeking a response to the\n   grievances by M.E. and E.E., Attorney Grass violated SCR 22.03(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and SCR 22.03(6), enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Client D.P.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 On or around August 31, 2016, D.P., through his grandmother, hired Attorney Grass as postconviction counsel in a Milwaukee County criminal\n   matter. D.P. wanted Attorney Grass to appeal his conviction or seek a reduction of his sentence or a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 On September 8, 2016, Attorney Grass appeared on D.P.'s behalf in the criminal matter in the court of appeals district I. On October 18, 2016, Attorney Grass filed a motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal or a postconviction motion. The court of appeals granted the motion and extended the deadline to November 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 Between October 18, 2016 and February 14, 2018, Attorney Grass filed 14 motions for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal or a postconviction motion. The court of appeals granted all of the requests but stated, \"it appears that counsel\n   has not made a meaningful assessment of his ability to complete the postconviction motion within the requested extended deadline. Multiple requests for extension which counsel is unable to meet are burdensome to the court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 Attorney Grass failed to file a notice of appeal or a postconviction motion by the last extended deadline. He also failed to communicate with D.P. and failed to return phone calls from D.P.'s family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 In May 2018, D.P. filed a pro se request for a hearing to discharge Attorney Grass as his counsel and appoint new appellate counsel. The court of appeals denied D.P.'s request and directed him to address his complaint against Attorney Grass to the OLR and/or to the State Public Defender's office. On June 11, 2018, the public defender's office notified D.P. that Attorney Grass' license had been suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 D.P. filed a grievance with the OLR against Attorney Grass. Attorney Grass failed to file a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b623 By virtue of entering into the stipulation, Attorney Grass admitted the following counts of misconduct with respect to his representation of D.P.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 6:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to advance D.P.'s interests in the matter of an appeal or postconviction motion, including failing to file a notice of appeal or postconviction motion in D.P.'s matter by the April 5, 2018 deadline, Attorney Grass violated SCR 20:1.3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 7:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to communicate with D.P. or D.P.'s family from March 2017 until August 16, 2017 regarding the status of his case, Attorney Grass violated SCR 20:1.4(a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 8:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to notify D.P. of the May 22, 2018 suspension of his law license and his consequent inability to practice law, Attorney Grass violated SCR 22.26(1), enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(f).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 9:\n   </strong>\n   By willfully failing to timely respond to the OLR's July 26, 2018 letter seeking a response to D.P.'s grievance, Attorney Grass violated SCR 22.03(2) and SCR 22.03(6), enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Client V.C.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b624 On October 29, 2016, V.C. hired Attorney Grass as his appellate counsel in a criminal matter in Milwaukee County regarding his conviction and conditions of confinement. He also hired Attorney Grass to respond to potential harassment by V.C.'s alleged co-actor. Attorney Grass told the OLR he received $1,000 in fees from V.C. for four hours of work with no expenses. Attorney Grass also told the OLR he agreed to provide six hours of work without charge to V.C., but\n   had performed over ten hours of work on the case. Attorney Grass told the OLR he was unable to locate his written fee agreement with V.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 On December 5, 2016, Attorney Grass filed a motion to request transcripts and the circuit court record. The court of appeals granted the motion and established a deadline of December 23, 2016 to obtain the transcripts and circuit court record. Attorney Grass filed a second motion to extend the time to request transcripts on December 27, 2016. The court of appeals granted the motion and extended the deadline to January 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b626 On November 19, 2017, Attorney Grass wrote to the court of appeals saying\n   that he had not ordered the transcripts and failed to realize that V.C. was indigent and was entitled to a waiver of the transcript fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b627 In the meantime, on August 23, 2017, V.C. had filed a grievance with the OLR against Attorney Grass. Attorney Grass failed to respond to the OLR's request for information about the grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b628 On December 1, 2017, the court of appeals ordered that the deadline for requesting copies of the transcripts would be January 29, 2018 and directed Attorney Grass to file a status report no later than January 2, 2018. Attorney Grass failed to meet both deadlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b629 Attorney Grass failed to respond to the OLR's repeated requests for information about the grievance. This court's November 13, 2018 order temporarily suspending Attorney Grass' law license was based in part on his failure to respond to the OLR's investigation of V.C.'s grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b630 By virtue of entering into the stipulation, Attorney Grass admitted the following counts of misconduct with respect to his representation of V.C.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 10:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to obtain transcripts or seek a waiver of court reporter's fees or otherwise take steps to advance V.C.'s case in a timely manner, Attorney Grass violated SCR 20:1.3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 11:\n   </strong>\n   By willfully failing to respond to the OLR's request for additional information relating to V.C.'s grievance, Attorney Grass violated SCR 22.03(6), enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Client S.B.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b631 On or about May 29, 2017, S.B. hired Attorney Grass as his appellate counsel in a criminal matter in Milwaukee County to evaluate the prospect of filing a postconviction motion. Attorney Grass' written fee agreement with S.B. stated that work would be performed according to the following pay schedule: $250 per hour for the first four hours, $0 for the following six hours, $100 per hour for the following ten hours, $50 per hour for the following forty hours, and $20 per hour for any further work until completion. Attorney Grass agreed to provide S.B. monthly billing statements itemizing the work performed on S.B.'s behalf. S.B. paid Attorney Grass approximately $1,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b632 On June 1, 2017, S.B.'s previous appellate counsel delivered S.B.'s appeal file to Attorney Grass and informed him that the date for filing a notice of appeal or postconviction motion was July 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b633 In a letter dated December 6, 2017, S.B. wrote to Attorney Grass identifying issues he believed relevant to his postconviction motion. Attorney Grass failed to respond to the letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b634 Attorney Grass requested, and was granted, three extensions of time for filing a notice of appeal or a postconviction motion on S.B.'s behalf. He never filed either a notice of appeal or a postconviction motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b635 In a letter dated May 9, 2018, S.B. requested that the public defender's office appoint new counsel for him. Attorney Grass failed to notify S.B. of the May 22, 2018 suspension of his law license. S.B. learned about Attorney Grass' suspension when he was copied on a letter from the public defender's office to Attorney Grass, dated May 30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b636 On May 22, 2018, S.B. filed a grievance with the OLR against Attorney Grass. Attorney Grass failed to respond to the OLR's request for information about the grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b637 On July 3, 2018, S.B.'s prior appellate counsel, who was still an attorney of record for S.B. in the Milwaukee case,\n   requested an extension of time for S.B. to file a postconviction motion or a notice of appeal. The court granted that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b638 On July 6, 2018, Attorney Grass informed the court of appeals, district I that his law license had been suspended. In a letter dated August 8, 2018, Attorney Grass informed the OLR and the clerk of this court that he was unable to provide responses to the OLR's requests for information and that he was \"in no present condition to practice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b639 By virtue of entering into the stipulation, Attorney Grass admitted the following counts of misconduct with respect to his representation of S.B.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 12:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to advance S.B.'s interests in the matter of an appeal or postconviction motion, Attorney Grass violated SCR 20:1.3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 13:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to notify S.B. of the May 22, 2018 suspension of his law license and his consequent inability to practice law, Attorney Grass violated SCR 22.26(1), enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(f).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 14:\n   </strong>\n   By willfully failing to timely respond to the OLR's June 25, 2018 letter seeking a response to S.B.'s grievance, Attorney Grass violated SCR 22.03(2) and SCR 22.03(6), enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b640 The parties' stipulation states that the terms of the stipulation were not bargained for or negotiated between the parties. Attorney Grass avers that he admits the facts of the misconduct alleged by the OLR and agrees to the level of discipline sought by the OLR, a 60-day suspension of his license to practice law in Wisconsin. Attorney Grass represents that he fully understands the misconduct allegations, fully understands the ramifications should the court impose the stipulated level of discipline, fully understands his right to contest the matter, fully understands his right to consult with and retain counsel, and states that his entry into the stipulation is made knowingly and voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b641 The OLR filed a memorandum in support of the stipulation, citing a number of cases that it claims supports its request for a 60-day suspension:\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Bartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258094\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/362/752/\">\n    2015 WI 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258094\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/362/752/\">\n    362 Wis. 2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258094\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/362/752/\">\n    864 N.W.2d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (60-day suspension for five counts of misconduct related to one client matter; attorney had one prior private reprimand);\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Briggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091519\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/358/493/\">\n    2014 WI 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091519\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/358/493/\">\n    358 Wis. 2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=861%20N.W.2d%20528\">\n    861 N.W.2d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (90-day suspension for 12 counts of misconduct related to two client matters; attorney had no prior disciplinary history);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Kasprowicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010918\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/277/96/\">\n    2004 WI 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010918\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/277/96/\">\n    277 Wis. 2d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010918\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/277/96/\">\n    690 N.W.2d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (public reprimand for 16 counts of misconduct related to six client matters; referee found multiple mitigating factors, including medical and emotional problems found to have a causal connection with the misconduct at issue.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b642 Although no two attorney disciplinary matters are precisely the same, we find that the misconduct at issue here is somewhat analogous to that at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   .
