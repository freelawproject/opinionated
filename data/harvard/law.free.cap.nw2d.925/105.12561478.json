The circuit court sentenced him to forty years in the state penitentiary, with five years suspended, to run consecutive to the prison term Yeager is currently serving in Iowa for offenses involving the same victim. Yeager appeals, alleging the sentence was cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment and an abuse of discretion. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b62.] In 2008, Yeager pled guilty to five counts of third-degree sexual abuse in Iowa district court for conduct involving his fourteen-year-old daughter M.Y. The court sentenced Yeager to thirty years in prison in early 2009. In 2016, Yeager's ex-wife contacted the Pennington County Sheriff's Office and reported that Yeager had also abused M.Y. in August 2008 while their family vacationed in the Black Hills. An investigation ensued and, while Yeager was still serving his Iowa sentence, the Pennington County grand jury indicted him for ten counts of rape, sexual contact, and incest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 14, 2017, pursuant to a plea agreement, Yeager pled guilty to one count of second-degree rape as defined in SDCL 22-22-1(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in exchange for dismissal of the remaining nine charges and an agreement that the State would forego future prosecutions in Custer County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b63.] At a subsequent sentencing hearing, the court considered numerous factors when fashioning Yeager's sentence, including: (1) statements from the victim and her mother; (2) Dr. Donald Janz's evaluation of Yeager concluding he posed a low risk of reoffending; (3) protection of the public; (4) Yeager's pre-sentence investigation, including his lack of criminal history; (5) retribution; and (6) the significant lapse of time between the offense and its prosecution. The court sentenced Yeager to forty years in prison with five years suspended and ordered that his South Dakota sentence run consecutive to his prison term in Iowa. Yeager appeals, raising two issues for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Whether Yeager's sentence is excessive under the Eighth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion in sentencing Yeager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    1. Whether Yeager's sentence is excessive under the Eighth Amendment.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64.] Yeager asserts that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. U.S. Const. amends.

Rape is a heinous crime, especially so when the victim is the perpetrator's child.

Based on the enormity of the harm to the victim and the community, the gravity of Yeager's crime is comparatively high when weighed against other criminal acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67.] As to the harshness of Yeager's sentence, the circuit court imposed a forty-year sentence, with five years suspended, to run consecutively with his sentence in Iowa. Second-degree rape is a felony punishable by up to fifty-years imprisonment, a maximum $50,000 fine, or both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDCL 22-6-1(4). The circuit court's sentence is ten years below the statutory maximum available for the crime, with five additional years of Yeager's sentence suspended. When viewed on the spectrum of all permitted punishments, which includes the possibility of death for Class A felonies and mandatory life imprisonment for Class A and Class B felonies, Yeager's penalty for raping M.Y. in South Dakota is well below the harshest possible punishment permitted. Therefore, Yeager's \"sentence does not appear to be grossly disproportionate.\"\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808553\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/877/75/\">\n    2016 S.D. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808553\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/877/75/\">\n    877 N.W.2d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b68.] Notwithstanding the foregoing, Yeager argues the circuit court's imposition of a forty-year sentence for one offense was cruel and unusual because it was grossly disproportionate to the sentence he received in Iowa for virtually the same criminal conduct. The Iowa district court imposed a thirty-year sentence upon Yeager for five counts relating to the sexual abuse of M.Y. Yeager also argues that he was prejudiced by his ex-wife's delay in reporting the offense because if he had been charged in South Dakota at the same time as his prosecution in Iowa, he could\n   have explored a global plea agreement involving concurrent sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b69.] Although Yeager's sentence in South Dakota involves a longer prison term than he is serving in Iowa, his arguments are meritless. Our legislature has vested circuit courts with the authority to hand down consecutive sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Red Kettle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10603839\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/452/774/#p777\">\n    452 N.W.2d 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 777 (S.D. 1990) ; SDCL 22-6-6.1 (\"If a defendant is convicted of two or more offenses, [the] ... sentence may ... run concurrently or consecutively at the discretion of the court.\"). While harsher than a concurrent sentence, the mere fact that Yeager's sentence was imposed consecutively does not make it grossly disproportionate. Further, Yeager's argument that the delay in reporting somehow prejudiced him because he could have negotiated a more favorable multi-jurisdictional plea agreement is speculative at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b610.] After weighing the gravity of the offense against the sentence Yeager received, the circuit court did not violate Yeager's constitutional rights when it imposed a sentence within the authorized fifty-year maximum. \"If the threshold requirement of gross disproportionality is not met, the analysis under the Eighth Amendment ends.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Traversie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810657\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/877/327/\">\n    2016 S.D. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810657\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/877/327/\">\n    877 N.W.2d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332.

Yeager's convictions in South Dakota and Iowa did not arise from a single act. Rather, every instance of rape involved different facts and constituted a separate crime, albeit against the same victim.
