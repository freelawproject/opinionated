On January 14, 2019, the Office of Lawyer\n   Regulation (OLR) filed a complaint and motion pursuant to Supreme Court Rule (SCR) 22.22,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   requesting\n   this court suspend\n   Attorney B.C. Fischer's license to practice law in Wisconsin for a period of 90 days, and direct him to comply with the terms of a Minnesota court order, as reciprocal discipline identical to that imposed by the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Attorney Fischer and the OLR executed a stipulation, in which Attorney Fischer agrees that he should be suspended for a period of 90 days as discipline reciprocal to that imposed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, and directed to comply with the conditions imposed by the Minnesota court. Upon our review, we accept the stipulation and we suspend Attorney Fischer's license to practice law in Wisconsin for a period of 90 days and order him to abide by the terms imposed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota. The OLR does not seek costs. Because the parties were able to resolve this matter without appointment of a referee, no costs will be imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Attorney Fischer was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 2002. His Wisconsin law license is currently suspended for failure to comply with continuing legal education reporting requirements, for failure to pay annual bar dues, and for failure to provide a required trust account certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 Attorney Fischer is also admitted to practice law in Minnesota under the name Brian Campbell Fischer. He presently resides in Duluth, Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 Attorney Fischer's professional disciplinary history in Wisconsin consists of a 2014 public reprimand imposed as discipline reciprocal to that imposed in Minnesota for professional misconduct. That misconduct involved failing to supervise a suspended attorney and assisting a suspended\n   attorney in the unauthorized practice of law; failing to provide the Minnesota Director of the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility with timely notice of employment of a suspended attorney; using misleading advertising and law firm signage and letterhead; neglecting and failing to communicate with two clients; failing to comply with a court order; failing to return client files; failing to expedite litigation; and noncooperation in disciplinary investigations.\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Fischer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WI%20107\">\n    2014 WI 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , --- Wis. 2d ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=852%20N.W.2d%20487\">\n    852 N.W.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Action Against Fischer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7060423\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/836/525/\">\n    836 N.W.2d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Minn. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 On May 3, 2017, the Supreme Court of Minnesota suspended Attorney Fischer for a minimum of 90 days, and imposed numerous conditions in response to professional misconduct that included neglecting six client matters, failing to communicate with those clients, making false statements to a client, failing to return a client's file, and failing to cooperate with disciplinary investigations. The Minnesota court concluded that Attorney Fischer violated Minn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d), 3.2, 4.1, 8.1(b), and 8.4(c)-(d), and Rule 25, Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b67 Fischer did not notify the OLR of the Minnesota suspension within 20 days of its effective date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b68 On September 12, 2017, the Minnesota Court conditionally reinstated Attorney Fischer from the 90-day suspension, and placed him on probation for two years, with conditions.\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Action Against Fischer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335023\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/901/155/\">\n    901 N.W.2d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Minn. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b69 In its complaint, the OLR alleged that Attorney Fischer is subject to reciprocal discipline and that, by failing to notify the OLR of his suspension in Minnesota for professional misconduct within 20 days of the effective date of its imposition, Attorney Fischer violated SCR 22.22(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b610 On February 22, 2019, Attorney Fischer and the OLR filed a stipulation, agreeing that by virtue of his Minnesota suspension as described in the complaint and motion, Attorney Fischer is subject to reciprocal discipline in Wisconsin. Attorney Fischer agrees that it would be appropriate for this court to suspend his law license for a period of 90 days and order that he comply with the terms of the Supreme Court of Minnesota's reinstatement order dated September 12, 2017. The parties state that the stipulation did not result from a plea bargain. Attorney Fischer does not contest the facts and misconduct alleged by the OLR and he agrees to the level of discipline sought by the OLR. Attorney Fischer represents and verifies that he fully understands the misconduct allegations, he fully understands the ramifications should the court impose the stipulated level of discipline, he fully understands his right to contest this matter, he understands his right to consult with and retain counsel, and states that his entry into the stipulation is made knowingly and voluntarily. Attorney Fischer also stipulates that he does not claim any of the potential defenses set forth in SCR 22.22(3)(a)-(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b611 Upon our review of the matter, we accept the stipulation and impose a 90-day suspension, reciprocal to that imposed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, and we order Attorney Fischer to comply with the terms of the Minnesota court's September 12, 2017 reinstatement order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SCR 22.22(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b612 Because this matter was resolved by\n   stipulation without the appointment of a referee, no costs are imposed.\n   \u00b613 IT IS ORDERED that the license of B.C. Fischer to practice law in Wisconsin is suspended for a period of 90 days, effective the date of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b614 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that B.C. Fischer is directed to comply with the terms of the Supreme Court of Minnesota's September 12, 2017 reinstatement order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b615 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the administrative suspension of B.C. Fischer's license to practice law in Wisconsin, due to his failure to pay mandatory bar dues, failure to comply with continuing legal education requirements, and failure to complete trust account certification, will remain in effect until each reason for the administrative suspension has been rectified, pursuant to SCR 22.28(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b616 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, to the extent he has not already done so, B.C. Fischer shall comply with the provisions of SCR 22.26 concerning the duties of a person whose license to practice law in Wisconsin has been suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b617 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no costs are imposed on B.C. Fischer.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    SCR 22.22 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    (1) An attorney on whom public discipline for misconduct or a license suspension for medical incapacity has been imposed by another jurisdiction shall promptly notify the director of the matter. Failure to furnish the notice within 20 days of the effective date of the order or judgment of the other jurisdiction constitutes misconduct.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    (2) Upon the receipt of a certified copy of a judgment or order of another jurisdiction imposing discipline for misconduct or a license suspension for medical incapacity of an attorney admitted to the practice of law or engaged in the practice of law in this state, the director may file a complaint in the supreme court containing all of the following:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    (a) A certified copy of the judgment or order from the other jurisdiction.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    (b) A motion requesting an order directing the attorney to inform the supreme court in writing within 20 days of any claim of the attorney predicated on the grounds set forth in sub. (3) that the imposition of the identical discipline or license suspension by the supreme court would be unwarranted and the factual basis for the claim.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    (3) The supreme court shall impose the identical discipline or license suspension unless one or more of the following is present:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    (a) The procedure in the other jurisdiction was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    (b) There was such an infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct or medical incapacity that the supreme court could not accept as final the conclusion in respect to the misconduct or medical incapacity,\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    (c) The misconduct justifies substantially different discipline in this state.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    (4) Except as provided in sub.

(2) to a referee for a hearing and a report and recommendation pursuant to SCR 22.16. At the hearing, the burden is on the party seeking the imposition of discipline or license suspension different from that imposed in the other jurisdiction to demonstrate that the imposition of identical discipline or license suspension by the supreme court is unwarranted.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    (6) If the discipline or license suspension imposed in the other jurisdiction has been stayed, any reciprocal discipline or license suspension imposed by the supreme court shall be held in abeyance until the stay expires.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The Minnesota court reinstated Attorney Fischer subject to his successful compliance with the following conditions during a two year period of probation:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    a.
