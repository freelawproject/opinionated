R. Prof. Conduct 1.1, 1.3, 1.5(a), 1.5(b), 1.5(b)(3), 1.15(c)(3), 1.15(c)(5), 3.1, 3.4(c), 4.4(a), and 8.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Respondent and the Director have entered into a stipulation for discipline. In it, the parties stipulate that the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law are conclusive, and respondent waives his procedural rights under Rule 14(g), Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR). The parties jointly recommend that the appropriate discipline is a public reprimand followed by 2 years of supervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This court has independently reviewed the file and approves the jointly recommended disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Respondent Joseph Charles Irby is publicly reprimanded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2.

Respondent shall abide by the Minnesota Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   c. Respondent shall be supervised by a licensed Minnesota attorney, appointed by the Director to monitor compliance with the terms of this probation. Within 2 weeks of the date of this order, respondent shall provide to the Director the names of four attorneys who have agreed to be nominated as respondent's supervisor. If, after diligent effort, respondent is unable to locate a supervisor acceptable to the Director, the Director will seek to appoint a supervisor. Until a supervisor has signed a consent to supervise, the respondent shall on the first day of each month provide the Director with an inventory of active client files described in paragraph (d) below. Respondent shall make active client files available to the Director on request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   d. Respondent shall cooperate fully with the supervisor in his/her efforts to monitor compliance with this probation. Respondent shall contact the supervisor and schedule a minimum of one in-person meeting per calendar quarter. Respondent shall submit to the supervisor an inventory of all active client files by the first day of each month during the probation. With respect to each active file, the inventory shall disclose the client name, type of representation, date opened, most recent activity, next anticipated action, and anticipated closing date. Respondent's supervisor shall file written reports with the Director at least quarterly, or at such more frequent intervals as may reasonably be requested by the Director.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   e. Within 30 days from the date of this order, respondent shall provide to the Director and to the probation supervisor, if any, a written plan outlining office procedures designed to ensure that respondent is in compliance with probation requirements.

The Director, at her sole discretion, may elect to terminate respondent's probation after 1 year if respondent complies with the terms of his probation and receives no additional complaints of misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    /s/ David L. Lillehaug\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   David L. Lillehaug\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Associate Justice\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
