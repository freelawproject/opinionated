Stone argues the circuit court committed multiple errors in pretrial rulings and at trial, including: denying his motion to sever, allowing other acts evidence and certain opinion testimony to be introduced at trial, denying his motion for a mistrial, and denying his motions for judgment of acquittal. Stone further argues that the cumulative effect of these errors justifies a new trial. We affirm the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62.] On April 22, 2016, Stone and Lachara Bordeaux drove to the Lucky Lady Casino in Sioux Falls. Stone entered the casino and Bordeaux entered another nearby business. While Stone was playing video lottery, Baptise White Eyes entered the casino. White Eyes and Stone had an antagonistic history arising from a romantic relationship Stone had with White Eyes's former girlfriend while White Eyes was in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63.] Shortly after White Eyes entered the casino, the two began arguing and were asked to leave. After leaving the casino, White Eyes hit Stone in the face. Stone retaliated by punching White Eyes. Stone then began moving away from White Eyes, but White Eyes continued to follow Stone. Stone drew a handgun and told White Eyes to stay away or he would be shot. White Eyes continued to move toward Stone and Stone fired two shots at White Eyes. The first shot hit White Eyes in the head knocking him to the ground. The second shot was fired after White Eyes fell, and missed White Eyes. White Eyes was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b64.] Bordeaux witnessed the shooting. She told Stone to get in her car and they left the scene. Shortly after the shooting, Stone sent a text message to his girlfriend Claressa Calderon stating, \"I just killed someone I'm sorry.\" Law enforcement obtained the casino's surveillance footage of the shooting and distributed still shots of the shooter to the local media. Stone was identified and law enforcement received a tip that he rented a room at a Sioux Falls hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b65.] The day after the shooting, a search warrant was executed for the hotel room registered to Stone. During the search, law enforcement found a cup containing several .380 caliber cartridges matching the manufacturer and caliber of the shell casings found at the scene of the shooting. On a table in the room, law enforcement also found a hotel receipt with Stone's name on it, stationery bearing Bordeaux's name, and three glass pipes, one of which contained white residue later identified as methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b66.] On April 26, 2016, Bordeaux was located in Le Mars, Iowa and interviewed by Detective Montgomery of the Sioux Falls Police Department. Bordeaux explained that after the shooting, she and Stone obtained a different car and drove to Minnesota. They then returned to South Dakota and again replaced their vehicle before traveling to Minnesota, Illinois, and Iowa where Stone left Bordeaux.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b67.] The next day, Stone was stopped by law enforcement in South Dakota, but evaded capture after providing false information of his identity. Stone's vehicle was later found abandoned on Interstate 90 near Presho. A search of the vehicle revealed a receipt from Wisconsin, a wig, and Stone's South Dakota identification card. Later that evening, Nebraska State Patrol stopped a vehicle traveling on Interstate 80 with Stone in the back seat. After the other passengers exited the car, Stone entered the driver's seat and drove away. Law enforcement followed Stone, leading to a high-speed pursuit across western Nebraska. Stone's vehicle was eventually stopped after crossing into Wyoming and Stone was taken into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b68.] Stone was interviewed the next day by Sioux Falls detectives including Detective Montgomery. Stone admitted to shooting White Eyes and firing two shots. When discussing the second shot, Detective Montgomery suggested the second shot could have been an involuntary reflex. Stone agreed the second shot was unintentional. Stone stated he believed White\n   Eyes was reaching for a gun prior to the shooting. Stone also told law enforcement that he left the scene of the shooting because he had \"dope\" in his pocket. Stone was asked about the location of the handgun used to kill White Eyes. Stone said he discarded the handgun a few blocks from the casino after he fled the scene. The handgun was never recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b69.] Stone was indicted for first-degree murder, second-degree murder, three counts of first-degree manslaughter (heat of passion, dangerous weapon, and commission of a felony), unauthorized possession of a controlled drug or substance, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felony drug offender. He pleaded not guilty on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b610.] Stone moved to sever the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felony drug offender (Count VII) from the other charges in the indictment. He argued the use of his prior conviction for possession of a controlled substance to prove the status offense in Count VII was prejudicial. The circuit court denied the motion to sever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b611.] Prior to trial, Stone also moved to exclude other acts evidence consisting of his criminal record and his actions following the shooting. Stone argued this evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial. Stone also argued the evidence infringed on his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. The circuit court denied the motion, except as to evidence of any crimes committed by Stone after he left the scene of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b612.] At trial, the State asked Detective Montgomery about Stone's interstate journey and the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [State:] And so on April 27th of 2016, was there finally a sighting of Mr. Stone?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Detective Montgomery:] Yes. Mr. Stone had gotten back into South Dakota and he was around the Presho exit here in South Dakota, and he had contact with a South Dakota State Trooper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [State:] And so based on this information, did Sioux Falls send a team out to that location?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Detective Montgomery:] We did. Mr. Stone was sent on his way at that point in time. He did not reveal his true identity. And he was sent on his way. And the car was eventually seized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Stone objected, arguing Montgomery's answer violated the court's prior order excluding evidence of other crimes and moved for a mistrial. The circuit court denied the motion for mistrial determining the testimony did not violate the court's pretrial order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b613.] Later during Detective Montgomery's testimony, the State asked if the second shot fired by Stone was a sympathetic reflex. Stone objected arguing a lack of foundation and failure to disclose an expert opinion. The circuit court overruled the objection, and Detective Montgomery answered,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [l]ooking at the video now and looking at the evidence, it does not seem likely .... One of the things with witnesses and from the investigation, was the rounds went off fairly close together when fired and so ...\n   <em>\n    it makes it unlikely that it went that way as a sympathetic reflex shot\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b614.] At the conclusion of the State's evidence, Stone moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts. The circuit court entered a judgment of acquittal on first-degree manslaughter, but denied the motion on all the other counts. The jury found Stone not guilty of first-degree murder, but guilty on the remaining counts. Stone was sentenced to life in prison on the conviction for second-degree murder. A\n   five-year concurrent sentence was imposed on the drug conviction, and a two-year consecutive sentence was imposed on the firearm conviction. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b615.] Stone raises a number issues in this appeal that we state as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1.

Stone also claims prejudice from the State's refusal to accept his offer to stipulate to the prior conviction to prove Count VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b618.] Stone relies heavily on a theory that the circuit court misapplied\n   <em>\n    Old Chief v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/\">\n    519 U.S. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/\">\n    136 L.Ed.2d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   was charged with felony assault and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. At trial, the prosecution refused the defendant's offer to stipulate that defendant had been convicted of a felony, as proof of the status offense, and instead introduced evidence showing the defendant had previously been convicted of felony assault.\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   did not involve a\n   severance issue, but rather held that the prejudice considerations under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence substantially outweighed the probative value of evidence disclosing the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the prior felony conviction. The court reaffirmed \"the accepted rule that the prosecution is entitled to prove its case free from any defendant's option to stipulate the evidence away,\" but emphasized the rule has \"virtually no application when the point at issue is a defendant's legal status, dependent on some judgment rendered wholly independently of the concrete events of later criminal behavior charged against him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/\">\n    at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/\">\n    117 S.Ct. at 654-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b619.] Stone misreads\n   <em>\n    Old Chief's\n   </em>\n   Rule 403 analysis to suggest that evidence of the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the prior conviction to prove Count VII was so prejudicial to the charge of possession of a controlled substance that it required the court to grant the motion to sever Count VII. On the contrary, it was not the degree of prejudice, but the lack of relevance in the first instance that was determinative of the issue in\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   . The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   had offered to stipulate to \"seemingly conclusive evidence of the element\" necessary to prove the status offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/\">\n    519 U.S. at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/\">\n    117 S.Ct. at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the prior felony conviction was wholly irrelevant to proving the status offense, the use of this evidence was unfairly prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b620.] Here, Stone was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted\n   <em>\n    drug\n   </em>\n   offender. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   , evidence of the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the prior felony conviction was a necessary element, and thus highly probative of the State's case. Further, the circuit court minimized the prejudice by limiting the State's evidence and allowing it to present \"only a brief description of the prior charge,\" and the date and location of the prior charge. The State followed the court's directive by asking a single question about the prior conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this regard, the State's evidence was no more prejudicial than the stipulation offered by Stone. The court also instructed the jury that it must consider the evidence on each of the counts separately, and a determination of Stone's guilt or innocence on one count could not influence their decision on other counts. \"We presume the jury follows the trial court's limiting instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record shows that several of the same witnesses would be called to testify concerning the charges joined in the indictment. The court further noted that Stone was charged with a single drug possession charge and the homicide offenses against Stone were dissimilar to the prior drug conviction. Further, Stone does not argue that the prior drug conviction caused any particular prejudice to the homicide charges.

Possession of a controlled drug or substance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b639.] The crime of unauthorized possession of controlled drug or substance is set forth in SDCL 22-42-5 and provides that \"[n]o person may knowingly possess a\n   controlled drug or substance unless the substance was obtained directly or pursuant to a valid prescription or order from a practitioner, while acting in the course of the practitioner's professional practice or except as otherwise authorized ....\" At trial, Stone generally moved for judgment of acquittal on all the charges, including the charge of unauthorized possession of controlled drug or substance. On appeal, Stone argues the State's evidence was insufficient to show that he possessed a controlled substance because he claims he no longer had control of the hotel room where the glass pipe with methamphetamine residue was found and was not physically occupying the room at the time of the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [\u00b640.] To establish possession,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \"[a] defendant's dominion or right of control over a controlled substance does not have to be exclusive and can either be actual-i.e., when the controlled substance is found on the defendant's person-or constructive-i.e., when the defendant 'has dominion or control over ... the premises upon which the [controlled substance was] found[.]' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The pipe was located in a prominent location on a table in the room. A hotel receipt confirming Stone had rented the room was located next to the pipe. A container of cartridges matching the manufacturer and caliber of the casings found at the scene of the shooting was also found in the room. Although Bordeaux's personal stationery was found in the room, there was no evidence she was ever in the room without Stone. On the day of the shooting, Bordeaux testified that she and Stone drove to the casino and left together after the shooting. Within hours after Stone and Bordeaux fled out-of-state together, law enforcement executed the search warrant for the hotel room. This evidence, along with Stone's admission to possessing an illegal substance in his pocket at the time of the shooting, was sufficient to allow a jury to reasonably infer that Stone had dominion and control over the hotel room and knew the illegal substances were in his room. \"No guilty verdict will be set aside if the evidence, including circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, sustains a reasonable theory of guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Laplante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11436757\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/650/305/\">\n    2002 S.D. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11436757\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/650/305/\">\n    650 N.W.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [\u00b642.] Stone's argument incorrectly suggests a jury could find the element of possession only with evidence that he was found with or near the methamphetamine. As argued by Stone, \"the absence of evidence that the Appellant was present when the police entered the hotel room demonstrated a lack of control. Allegations of flight made by the State suggest dominion had been abandoned.\" The amended indictment charged Stone with unlawful possession of a controlled substance \"on or about\" April 22, 2016. Stone does not allege time is an essential element of possession of a controlled substance, and the jury could have determined he possessed the methamphetamine shortly before police officers actually discovered it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDCL 23A-6-9 (\"The precise time at which an offense was committed need not be stated in an indictment or information, but it may be alleged to have been committed at any time before the filing thereof, except when the time is a material element of the offense.\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

Possessing of a firearm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b643.] Possession of a firearm by convicted drug offender is established under SDCL 22-14-15.1, which states, \"[n]o person who has been convicted of a\n   <em>\n    felony\n   </em>\n   under chapter 22-42 or of a felony for a crime with the same elements in another state may possess or have control of a firearm.\" (Emphasis added.) Detective Montgomery testified that Stone was previously convicted of possession of a controlled substance in Minnehaha County, but Stone claims the State presented no evidence that this prior conviction was a felony. While Stone's conviction was never identified as a felony by Detective Montgomery, a Facebook post from Stone's account was introduced at trial admitting to having a felony on his record, but questioning whether that should require him to give up his guns. This message, along with Detective Montgomery's testimony, was sufficient for a jury to infer that Stone's prior drug conviction was a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Second-Degree Murder\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [\u00b644.] Second-degree murder is defined as, \"any act imminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life, although without any premeditated design to effect the death of any particular person, including an unborn child.\" SDCL 22-16-7. Stone argues that since he attempted to retreat from White Eyes and warned him to stay away before firing his gun, the State failed to establish that the killing was committed with a depraved mind or without a regard for human life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [\u00b645.] The State provided evidence showing that Stone intentionally shot White Eyes in the head at close range. This evidence was sufficient for a prima facie case of second-degree murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kleinsasser,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808585\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/877/86/\">\n    2016 S.D. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808585\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/877/86/\">\n    877 N.W.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 ;\n   <em>\n    Laible\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11605872\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/594/328/\">\n    1999 S.D. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11605872\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/594/328/\">\n    594 N.W.2d at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also fully instructed the jury on Stone's self-defense claims. While there was evidence that Stone was retreating from White Eyes, the question of whether Stone was justified in using deadly force against an unarmed man, under all the circumstances, was a question for the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quist\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20S.D.%2030\">\n    2018 S.D. 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555643\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/910/900/#p904\">\n    910 N.W.2d 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904-05 (explaining it was the jury's role to resolve factual conflicts and weigh the credibility of the defendant's and the State's cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    5.
