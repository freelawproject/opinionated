Appellants argue that the district court erred in (1) declining to submit to the jury factual issues concerning snow-and-ice immunity in the first trial (which determined liability), (2) granting respondent's motion for a new trial on damages, (3) failing to apply the statutory offset under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.51, subd. 1, for basic economic loss (no-fault) benefits paid to respondent, and (4) improperly determining the amount of costs and disbursements and prejudgment interest. We affirm the district court's grant of respondent's new trial motion and see no reversible error in the district court's instructions to the jury, but we reverse and remand for the district court to properly apply section 65B.51, subdivision 1, and to properly determine costs, disbursements, and interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 11, 2011, respondent was driving his van southbound on Highway 13 in the city of Burnsville when he was involved in a motor-vehicle collision. As respondent approached the intersection of Highway 13 with Horizon Drive to the east and 117th Street to the west, a snowplow driven by Kalal, an employee of the city, collided with respondent's van when Kalal attempted to cross the intersection by driving from Horizon Drive onto 117th Street, crossing Highway 13 in the process. The snowplow hit the driver's side of respondent's van, separated the driver's seat from the van, and pierced a hole in the side of the van large enough for respondent to crawl out of the van through that hole after the collision. It is undisputed that respondent had the right of way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Respondent sued Kalal and the city, alleging that Kalal was negligent in operating the snowplow (which was not plowing snow at the time), and that the city was vicariously liable for Kalal's negligence. Appellants moved the district court for summary judgment, arguing that: (1) Kalal's acts at the scene of the accident are protected by common-law official immunity; (2) the facts of the accident entitle appellants to statutory snow-and-ice immunity; (3) appellants are protected by statutory discretionary immunity to the extent respondent's claims are based on the city's snow-removal policy; and (4) Kalal had no duty to obey traffic laws at the time of the accident. The district court denied appellants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellants brought an interlocutory appeal, arguing that they were entitled to common-law official immunity and vicarious official immunity, or, in the alternative, snow-and-ice immunity under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20466.03\">\n    Minn.

Respondent introduced the medical testimony of Dr. Wengler, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, who opined that respondent had suffered permanent injuries as a result of the collision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants did not obtain a medical expert, procure any independent medical examination, or produce expert medical testimony at trial. The jury's special verdict found that Kalal's negligence was a direct, and the only, cause of respondent's injuries. The jury found that respondent had not suffered a permanent injury as a direct result of the collision, and calculated that respondent suffered damages of $ 42,178.07. The district court entered judgment accordingly. Respondent moved the district court for judgment as a matter of law (for damages above those awarded by the jury) or, in the alternative, for a new trial. Appellants moved the district court to reduce the amount of the judgment by the amount of no-fault benefits paid to or on behalf of respondent. The district court granted respondent's motion for a new trial on the basis that the jury's verdict was not justified by any reasonable interpretation of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the second jury trial, limited to the issue of damages, the jury's special verdict found that respondent suffered damages of $ 152,810.07 resulting from the collision. Appellants again moved the district court to reduce the award for no-fault benefits paid. Respondents moved the district court for entry of final judgment and applied for taxation of costs and disbursements. The district court declined to reduce respondent's award by the $ 23,000 respondent received from his no-fault insurance provider, and entered final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I.

The district court did not err by declining to submit the question of snow-and-ice immunity to the jury.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court declined appellants' request for questions on the verdict form relating to snow-and-ice immunity. It reasoned that, as a matter of law, appellants were not entitled to such immunity. Appellants argue on appeal that factual questions concerning the conditions of the road remained to be resolved by a jury. Respondent argues that appellants forfeited the right to challenge on appeal the issue concerning snow-and-ice immunity because appellants did not move for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before the first trial, the district court granted respondent's motion in limine to exclude the question of snow and ice conditions from the special verdict form. \"[M]atters such as trial procedure, evidentiary rulings and jury instructions are subject to appellate review only if there has been a motion for a new trial in which such matters have been assigned as error.\"\n   <em>\n    Sauter v.

Although Kalal was driving a snowplow and the city is responsible for maintaining the road, respondent's claim is not based on the city's failure to maintain the roads resulting in snow or ice accumulation (conduct which the statute would protect).

App. 1987). It is with these standards in mind that we review the district court's resolution of the two-part question of whether respondent suffered (a) a permanent injury that was (b) directly caused by appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The district court determined that reasonable minds viewing the evidence in this case could reach only one conclusion-that respondent suffered a permanent injury to his shoulder as a result of this collision. Respondent introduced a February 2014 MRI report, where Dr. Baumgarten noted \"tendinopathy [and] some tearing of his posterior glenoid as well.\" Dr. Baumgarten performed surgery on respondent's shoulder in December 2014. In his postoperative report, Dr. Baumgarten identified a posterior labral tear, impingement syndrome, a tear in respondent's rotator cuff, and a tear in respondent's biceps sling tendon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Concerning whether respondent has suffered a permanent injury, Dr. Wengler testified that he reviewed Dr. Baumgarten's reports, and confirmed that respondent suffered permanent injuries to his shoulder, including impingement syndrome and tears of the glenoid labrum and rotator cuff. Dr. Wengler explained that the tendons in respondent's shoulder will never fully heal and respondent will have a compromised shoulder cuff mechanism. Dr. Wengler also testified that respondent suffered permanent injuries to his hand and biceps tendon as a result of the collision. On cross-examination, appellants did not challenge Dr. Wengler's opinion that respondent has suffered a permanent injury to his shoulder, nor did appellants offer any evidence that would contradict Dr. Wengler's opinion. Accordingly, we see no abuse of the district court's discretion when it determined that the only reasonable conclusion on this record is that respondent suffered a permanent injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The closer question is whether respondent's permanent injuries were directly caused by this collision. Appellants assert that substantial evidence demonstrated that Dr. Wengler's opinion regarding the cause of respondent's conditions was improbable and inconsistent with other evidence. They argue that the pain in respondent's left shoulder was more likely the result of a weightlifting incident that predates this collision and that respondent's left-hand symptoms likewise preexisted this collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Respondent visited Dr. Jessen in April 2011, three months after the January 11, 2011 collision. The medical record from that visit indicates that respondent reported that he had injured his left shoulder about five years earlier when he was lifting\n   weights. Dr. Jessen opined, \"I think it is very likely that he tore some component of the rotator cuff with his weight lifting incident.\" But Dr. Jessen also wrote, \"We will make a referral to Orthopedics for their opinion and let them make the decision of whether or not this young man needs a MRI of his shoulder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dr. Wengler was asked on cross-examination about the weightlifting incident, and he excluded the incident as a possible cause of respondent's permanent shoulder injury. Dr. Wengler testified, \"[Respondent] may have had a partial tear of the cuff when he lifted-when he did the bench press, or whatever he did; but it's not an issue because he never sought medical attention, never had diagnostics, and no one has ever suggested that he have treatment for it.\" Further, Dr. Wengler testified that, if the tears in respondent's shoulder that were diagnosed after the 2011 collision had been caused by the weightlifting incident, respondent would not have been able to continue working full time as a flooring installer between the time of that incident and this collision. And the trial record is clear that respondent continued to work before this collision. The district court, which presided at the first trial over the course of six days, concluded that Dr. Wengler's testimony excludes all doubt concerning the collision being a substantial factor in bringing about respondent's shoulder injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We also observe that appellants did not argue to the first jury that the 2011 collision aggravated a preexisting injury. When preexisting injuries are aggravated by an injury-causing tort, the tortfeasor is responsible only for the damages he or she caused over and above the consequences that would have occurred from the preexisting injury in any event.\n   <em>\n    Rowe v. Munye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8944444\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/702/729/#p736\">\n    702 N.W.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (Minn. 2005). The district court asked appellants' counsel at the first trial if appellants wanted a jury instruction on aggravation of a preexisting medical condition, and appellants' counsel stated, \"I don't think we need that one.\" It is hard to square appellants' arguments on appeal with their trial decision to forgo any argument that this collision aggravated a preexisting condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The first jury must nevertheless have concluded that respondent's shoulder injury was the result of this previous weightlifting incident, not the motor-vehicle collision. The district court, however, determined that for the jury to have found that the 2011 collision was not a substantial factor in causing respondent's permanent injury, it would have had to disregard Dr. Wengler's testimony-something it could not do of an unimpeached witness when the testimony has not been rendered improbable or inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Several cases have addressed whether and when it is proper for the jury to disregard the testimony of medical experts. In\n   <em>\n    Williamson v. Furch\n   </em>\n   , where medical experts testified and medical records were received in evidence, the supreme court held that, because there was no conflicting medical evidence regarding causation, a jury verdict of no damages could not be sustained.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"894998\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/304/558/\">\n    304 Minn. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"894998\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/304/558/\">\n    229 N.W.2d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40 (1975). The supreme court reasoned that cross-examination of the medical witnesses was not sufficient to cast substantial doubt in the minds of the jurors that the collision caused plaintiff's special damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"894998\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/304/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Like\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   , there is no conflicting medical evidence in this case. There is respondent's statement that he hurt his shoulder weightlifting several years before this collision, but the record supports the district court's observation that there is no evidence of earlier tears to respondent's shoulder or biceps that necessitated the 2014 surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Appellants cite\n   <em>\n    Brannan v.

That distinction is important considering the facts of that case.

In\n    <em>\n     Langenberger\n    </em>\n    , the subject automobile accident occurred in 1976, before the no-fault act was amended and while the act still provided a right of subrogation for accidents involving commercial vehicles.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10672268\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/329/69/#p71\">\n     329 N.W.2d at 69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 70 n.1. As the\n    <em>\n     Langenberger\n    </em>\n    court recognized, \"[t]he legislature apparently decided that the offset provision was sufficient to accomplish the readjustment of losses among reparation obligors responsible for the payment of basic economic loss benefits when\n    <em>\n     it repealed the right of subrogation in cases covered by \u00a7 65B.51, subd. 1, in 1977\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10672268\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/329/69/#p71\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10672268\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/329/69/#p71\">\n     at 72\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added) (citing 1977 Minn.

It has no application in a case such as this, as the supreme court expressly recognized.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The district court erroneously concluded that Farmers could assert a subrogation interest here. The right to subrogation in motor-vehicle litigation concerning personal-injury claims exists only where provided by statute, and it matters not whether allowing Farmers to assert a subrogation interest would be good policy.\n    <em>\n     Metro.

It is also irrelevant whether the time and expense of arbitration would be avoided by allowing Farmers to subrogate. \"The right of indemnity provided in subdivision 1 shall be\n    <em>\n     enforceable only\n    </em>\n    through\n    <em>\n     mandatory\n    </em>\n    good faith and binding arbitration procedures established by the rule of the commissioner of commerce.\" Minn.

But the district court erred by failing to deduct from the verdict the amount of no-fault benefits paid by respondent's no-fault insurer to or on behalf of respondent. We therefore reverse the judgment and remand to the district court to properly apply the no-fault offset, to effectuate the parties' agreement concerning costs and disbursements properly taxable, and to recompute the total award with interest from May 29, 2014.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <strong>\n     Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-73\">\n     The more general collateral-source statute,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20548.251\">\n      Minn.
