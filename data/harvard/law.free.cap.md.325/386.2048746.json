ORTH, Jr., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Bruce Edward Void claims that the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County erroneously quashed subpoenas served on three witnesses called to testify in his behalf. He bewails that the court, by quashing the subpoenas, also quashed his defense in the criminal cause being prosecuted against him. In any event, a jury, without hearing from those witnesses, convicted him of kidnapping, robbery with a deadly weapon and a smattering of lesser offenses, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments entered on those convictions in an unreported opinion. Void brought his lament to our attention in a petition for a writ of certiorari, and we granted it. The sole question presented is whether the trial court erred in quashing the subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">The three witnesses subpoenaed were members of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department. Void desired their testimony as to the character of Mark Sherman Steedley, a former member of the Department. Steedley was the State\u2019s key witness. He was the victim of the crimes Void was alleged to have committed, and it was highly unlikely that the jury would convict unless it believed that Steedley\u2019s testimony was credible. Special counsel for the Police Department filed a pre-trial motion for a protective order. The motion named two of the officers summoned and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>third was added by agreement at the time of the hearing on the motion. The grounds of the motion were (1) that the officers had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">no personal knowledge or knowledge of any kind about the facts or circumstances related to the investigation, arrest or prosecution of the defendant, Bruce Edward Void,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALp\">and (2)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">[t]hat any knowledge of [them] that might be used to discredit the character of other witnesses in this matter, came to them while assigned to the Internal Affairs Division of the Police Department and are protected against discovery as confidential police investigations____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Wherefore, the motion requested, the subpoenas be quashed or in the alternative the testimony of the officers \u201cbe strictly limited to personal knowledge about the arrest of Bruce Edward Void.\u201d Appended to the motion was an affidavit from each of the two officers named therein. Each officer swore that he had \u201cno personal or professional involvement in the investigation, arrest or prosecution of [Void]\u201d and that he had \u201cno basis of knowledge about the character or truthfulness of [Void] or any other witness except that may have been obtained during a confidential internal investigation (which did not concern the activities of [Void]).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The hearing on the motion was comprised only of argument of counsel for the officers and for Void. The State\u2019s Attorney did not participate. Counsel for the officers followed the line of her motion and the affidavits. She added that, in the light of the affidavits,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWd\">it would be somewhat burdensome to the department to have these officers on standby or available or whatever to testify in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Void\u2019s counsel, opposing the motion, informed the judge that one of the officers told him that in the officer\u2019s opinion Steedley was a perjurer; he had lied on the witness stand under oath. Defense counsel said that he had reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>believe that the officers would state that, in their opinion, based on their own personal knowledge, Steedley was dishonest and that his reputation in the Police Department was that he was dishonest. Upon query by the judge to the officers\u2019 counsel whether the officers had any personal knowledge that Steedley was dishonest, she replied, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that I can speak for them. However, I do not know that that is the case.\u201d Defense counsel pointed out that \u201cat least one of the officers I have personally spoke with ... told me in his opinion the State\u2019s key witness \u2014 .\u201d The judge interrupted, \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in his opinion,\u201d but then permitted counsel to repeat that \u201c[h]e told me that he believed [Steedley] to be a perjurer and that he\u2019s previously lied on the stand based on information that he observed.\u201d The judge\u2019s position was that Steedley had not been convicted of perjury and \u201cno one is going to stand up in this court and say that Steedley perjured himself. I\u2019m just not going to permit it____ We can forget that.\u201d Defense counsel went on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">[The officers] will also say that Officer Steedley was dishonest because as he took an oath to enforce the laws of this County, he was simultaneously on an ongoing basis committing drug violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The judge declared that he was not going to permit that either because Steedley \u201cwas found not guilty.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s offer to call the officers to testify at the hearing was refused by the judge, even though defense counsel pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">Specifically they were all involved in the investigation of Mr. Steedley. They have taken an oath and testified against him as to the matters which I want to bring out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGY\">The judge quashed all three subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, Void framed his contention, as he does before us, in terms of error in the quashing of the subpoenas. The intermediate appellate court thought that to frame the contention in those terms \u201cfocuses on a secondary consideration, not the primary one.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The real question, and the one that we shall consider, is whether the police officers, had they been in the courtroom, would have been permitted to offer the evidence proffered by [Void].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The intermediate appellate court recognized that \u201c[i]n [Steedley\u2019s] capacity as a witness, ... his truth and veracity were in issue,\u201d but, the court observed, Steedley \u201cwas not a defendant and did not place his character generally in issue in any way.\u201d It seems that the intermediate appellate court did not think that honesty \u201cimpacted\u201d on truth and veracity, and it proceeded on the assumption that the officers \u201chad not discussed and apparently had no knowledge of Mark Steedley\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity.\u201d The intermediate appellate court\u2019s conception of Void\u2019s position at the hearing was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">[t]he sole basis for [calling the officers] as witnesses was that they had investigated charges of drug violations on the part of Steedley. Their investigation led to the indictment and prosecution of Steedley on charges of violating the laws with respect to controlled dangerous substances ... [and] a jury found him not guilty of those charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgB\">On the premise that the officers\u2019 testimony would not be admissible at Void\u2019s trial, the Court of Special Appeals saw no error \u201con the part of [the trial judge] in refusing to permit such testimony, either through the modality of quashing the subpoenas for the witnesses or otherwise.\u201d We do not see the matter in the same way as the officers\u2019 counsel presented it, or the trial court considered it or the Court of Special Appeals decided it.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States designates a number of rights which an accused shall enjoy \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions.\u201d One of those rights assures that an accused \u201chave compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor____\u201d The clause is made obligatory on the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 17-19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 1922-23, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights declares a variety of rights to which \u201cevery man\u201d is entitled \u201cin all criminal prosecutions.\u201d Among them are the rights \u201cto have process for his witnesses,\u201d and \u201cto examine the witnesses for and against him on oath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">At the common law, followed in Maryland, \u201cthe truthfulness of a witness could only be impugned by a character witness by asking the latter if he knew the general reputation in the community for veracity of the witness under attack.\u201d <em>Durkin v. State, </em>284 Md. 445, 448-449, 397 A.2d 600 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Maryland Code (1973, 1989 Rep.Vol.) \u00a7 9-115 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ), being Chapter 760 of the Acts of 1971, modified the common law rule which did not allow a character witness to testify concerning his own personal opinion of the truthfulness of another witness. It prescribed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">Where character evidence is otherwise relevant to the proceeding, no person offered as a character witness who has an adequate basis for forming an opinion as to another person\u2019s character shall hereafter be excluded from giving evidence based on personal opinion to prove character, either in person or by deposition, in any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, in any court or before any judge, or jury of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u201cThe statute permits the admission of a broad range of testimony which may aid the jury in assessing the credibility of a witness____\u201d <em>Kelley v. State, </em>288 Md. 298, 302, 418 A.2d 217 (1980). <em>See Taylor v. State, </em>278 Md. 150, 154-155, 360 A.2d 430 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Void was entitled at the common law to attempt, through his witnesses, to determine the reputation for truth and veracity of a witness against him. And he was entitled under the statute, subject to its restrictions, to elicit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>personal opinion of his witnesses to prove the character of the witness against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">We believe that a fair conclusion can be drawn from the proceedings at the hearing on the motion that the testimony Void sought was directed to the character of Steedley. We are not in accord with the State\u2019s notion that Void was merely attempting to introduce evidence of prior bad acts by Steedley under the guise of character evidence. It may be that defense counsel\u2019s argument could have been articulated in more specific terms. And perhaps some of the reasons he gave for desiring the witnesses\u2019 testimony, and which the judge declared he would not permit, may not have been admissible. But that did not justify precluding Void\u2019s examination of the witnesses. The proper time for the judge to determine the admissibility of their testimony was upon their examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">As we have seen, defense counsel spoke in terms of Steedley lying. Obviously, he hoped to show through the witnesses\u2019 testimony that Steedley was an ananias. Counsel also referred repeatedly to Steedley\u2019s dishonesty. All of which, he posited, was within the knowledge of the witnesses, who had personal opinions to that effect and knew that such was Steedley\u2019s reputation in the community. The trial judge indicated an awareness that defense counsel\u2019s argument opposing a quashing of the subpoenas was directed to the character of Steedley. The judge recognized correctly, that a character trait with respect to honesty</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">would perhaps impact on credibility____ It would go right back to ... whether or not the person is telling the truth. It impacts on veracity.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>We think, however, that the trial judge jumped the gun. We believe that the quashing of the subpoenas was error. Patently, this error may not be deemed harmless in the circumstances. We recognized in <em>McCray v. State, </em>305 Md. 126, 133, 501 A.2d 856 (1985) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9r\">trial judges have broad discretion in the conduct of trials in such areas as the reception of evidence____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">And we said in <em>Durkin v. State, </em>284 Md. at 453, 397 A.2d 600:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">[L]ike other similar requirements for the admissibility of evidence, the trial judge has the threshold function of evaluating the circumstances and making a determination that the personal opinion of the character witness [and his knowledge of the reputation in the community for credibility of the challenged witness,] is relevant and has an adequate basis. And, as is the case with relevancy or similar evidentiary matters, much deference will be paid to his determination, and it will be overturned on appeal only if there is a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-8\"><em>See Taylor v. State, </em>278 Md. at 154-155, 360 A.2d 430. Here, however, the trial judge did not have a sufficient basis for the exercise of sound discretion. He refused to hear from the subpoenaed witnesses. Their affidavits were of no help; the averment that the witnesses had no knowledge of the facts and circumstances of the investigation, arrest or prosecution of Void was of no consequence. Their lack of such knowledge was neither relevant nor material to a determination of the credibility of Steedley. The bare statement that any personal knowledge of the subpoenaed witnesses that might be used to discredit any witness came to the subpoenaed witnesses in a confidential investigation, did not suffice to justify a refusal to permit Void to examine his witnesses. The judge could winnow out on hearing their testimony what was inadmissible as legitimately protected. We do not perceive how he could properly determine, on what was before him, that none of their testimony relating to the credibility of Steedley was admissible without affording Void an opportunity to examine them under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>oath. Certainly, the observation of the witnesses\u2019 counsel that \u201cit would be somewhat burdensome to the [police] department to have these officers on standby or available or whatever to testify in this matter\u201d was no good reason to disregard Void\u2019s rights by quashing the subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The Supreme Court declared in <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 408, 108 S.Ct. 646, 652, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_v\">New rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">The right to compel a witness\u2019 presence in the courtroom could not protect the integrity of the adversary process if it did not embrace the right to have the witness\u2019 testimony heard by the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 409, 108 S.Ct. at. 652. The Court pointed out in <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 57, 107 S.Ct. 989, 1002, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987) (footnote omitted) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqsQ\">[o]ur cases establish, at a minimum, that criminal defendants have the right to the government\u2019s assistance in compelling the attendance of favorable witnesses at trial and the right to put before a jury evidence that might influence the determination of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-9\"><em>See Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1049, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). Of course, in the exercise of the rights, the accused, as is required of the State, must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The short of it is that the trial judge should have heard from the subpoenaed witnesses, either at a pretrial hearing or at the trial out of the presence of the jury. <em>See Durkin v. State, </em>284 Md. at 449, 397 A.2d 600. He could, at that time, determine whether the witnesses had admissible testimony to offer. He erred in short-circuiting the common law and statutory rights of Void by quashing the subpoenas. Void is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTION TO REMAND IT TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b446-10\">1.
