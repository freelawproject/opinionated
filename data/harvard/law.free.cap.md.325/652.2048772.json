(UPS), in the Federal District Court, claiming that her employment was unlawfully terminated because she refused to comply with her employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>directive that she donate part of her time and wages to the United Way Fund (the Fund). In her complaint, Ball contended that this directive violated the public policy of the State, as embodied in \u00a7 562A(a), because the Fund was a social or economic association or organization within the meaning of the statute. As a consequence, Ball contended that she was wrongfully discharged from her employment under <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 432 A.2d 464 (1981), thereby making UPS subject to her claim for monetary damages. UPS contended that Ball\u2019s claim was not founded on a violation of the public policy of this State under <em>Adler </em>because the Fund was neither a social nor economic association nor organization within the ambit of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Deeming the matter before it to present a question of state law, the district court, in certifying the issue to us, outlined the relevant facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u201c(3) On or about March 1, 1977, plaintiff was hired by defendant corporation as a part-time employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">\u201c(4) On or about March 1, 1984, plaintiff was promoted by defendant corporation to the position of \u2018supervisor.\u2019 It is undisputed that plaintiff\u2019s employment in the supervisory position was \u2018at will\u2019 employment as defined by Maryland law: plaintiff had no written contract with defendant corporation nor was her employment defined by a durational term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">\u201c(5) Plaintiff alleges that on or about September 1, 1985, defendant corporation began to require that plaintiff and other employees donate a portion of their wages and \u201cpart of their time\u201d to the United Way Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">\u201c(6) From approximately September 1, 1985, until about October 1, 1986, plaintiff complied with defendant\u2019s alleged requirement that she pledge money and time to the United Way Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">\u201c(7) On or about October 1, 1986, plaintiff refused to authorize defendant corporation to deduct any money from her paycheck for the purpose of making a donation to the United Way Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>\u201c(8) On October 14, 1986, defendant corporation terminated plaintiffs employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">\u201c(9) Plaintiff alleges that her refusal to authorize personal contributions or to donate any of her time to the United Way Fund was the sole reason for her termination by defendant corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Ball maintains that, by definition, a fund is an appropriation, deposit, or collection of money, or other resources, which is set apart for a specific objective. She claims that the United Way Fund necessarily functions as an economic organization in the collection, management, investment, and distribution of monies which it raises. She further contends that the Fund is a social organization because it is concerned with the welfare of human beings as members of society. This is consistent, she says, with the stated purpose of the United Fund of Central Maryland \u201cto obtain and apportion funds to provide for the charitable, philanthropic and social agencies in the area served.\u201d According to Ball, it is clear from these definitions that the Fund is both an economic and social organization encompassed by the provisions of \u00a7 562A(a). She makes no contention that the Fund is a political organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">UPS argues that the Fund is not a social or economic association or organization but rather is a charitable undertaking, not included within the provisions of \u00a7 562A(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Noting that \u00a7 562A(a) is a penal statute, UPS says that there is no basis to construe it more broadly than its plain language permits. Moreover, it argues that the legislature\u2019s silence as to charitable funds in \u00a7 562A(a) supports a narrow construction of the statute, which excludes contributions to charitable organizations. It also suggests that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>any event, \u00a7 562A(a) is unconstitutionally vague and therefore void insofar as the undefined terms, \u201csocial\u201d and \u201ceconomic,\u201d are included in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In determining the questions before us, we turn to the time-honored canons of statutory construction, chief among which is the rule that, in seeking to ascertain the legislative intention, the beginning point is the language of the statute itself. <em>See Bacon v. State, </em>322 Md. 140, 147, 586 A.2d 18 (1991); <em>In re Demetrius J., </em>321 Md. 468, 473, 583 A.2d 258 (1991); <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513-16, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). Thus, in achieving this result, we focus primarily on the words of the statute, which must ordinarily be given their natural and usual meaning in the context of the legislative goals. <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92, 581 A.2d 9 (1990); <em>Webb v. State, </em>311 Md. 610, 618 n. 2, 536 A.2d 1161 (1988); <em>Tucker v. Firemen\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730 (1986). We have said that a statute is not vague \u201cwhen the meaning of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves, if they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 460, 569 A.2d 604 (1990); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 125, 389 A.2d 341 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The parties agree, and we concur, that there is no relevant written legislative history which sheds light on the legislatively intended reach and application of \u00a7 562A(a). We therefore turn to the \u201cusual and natural\u201d meaning of the words used in the statute. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2161-62 (1981) recites a lengthy and multi-faceted definition of the word \u201csocial.\u201d Its five main thrusts are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">\u201c1: involving allies or confederates ... 2: marked by or passed in pleasant companionship with one\u2019s friends or associates ... 3: forming or having a tendency to form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>cooperative and interdependent relationships with one\u2019s fellows ... 4: of or relating to human society ... 5: of, relating to, or based on rank or status in a particular society or community____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The main concepts of the word \u201ceconomic\u201d are defined by the same dictionary, at 720, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201c1 <em>usu. economical, archaic: </em>of or relating to a household or its management: of or relating to a divine dispensation or system of government 2 <em>usu. economical: </em>given to thrift: productive of saving: sparing in quality ... 3 a: of or relating to the science of economics ...: of, relating to the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities ... b: having practical or industrial significance, uses, or application ...: affecting or liable to affect material resources or welfare ... c: operated or produced on a profitable basis: producing an excess of returns over expenditures ...: capable of or liable to profitable exploitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In considering the application of the phrase in \u00a7 562A(a) \u201csocial [or] economic ... association or organization\u201d to the United Way Fund, we note that the record extract before us does not set forth the purposes or charter of the Fund. The record does, however, contain Articles of Amendment and Restatement of the United Fund of Wicomico County, Inc. and the Articles of Incorporation of the United Fund of Central Maryland, Inc. While the relationship, if any, between these entities and the United Way Fund is not disclosed by the record, the parties appear to accept the premise that the Fund, like the other two entities, is a nonprofit organization which raises money for charitable purposes. It is, therefore, not unlike the United Fund of Central Maryland which, according to its charter, is organized and operated \u201cexclusively for charitable and philanthropic purposes,\u201d raising funds \u201cto assist with the operating budgets of such nonprofit organizations as the Corporation may from time to time desire to assist.\u201d In this regard, the Attorney General of Maryland has characterized the United Fund of Central Maryland as a \u201c[federated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>fund-raising organization\u201d under Code (1990 Repl.Vol.), Article 41, \u00a7 3-201(d) <em>(see </em>62 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 155 (1977)), which is thereby defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">\u201ca federation of independent charitable organizations which have voluntarily joined together, including but not limited to a united fund or community chest, for the purpose of raising and distributing money for and among themselves and where membership in the federation does not confer operating authority and control of the individual charitable organizations upon the federation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Section 3-201(b)(l) defines a \u201c[c]haritable organization\u201d as <em>\u201ca </em>benevolent, educational, philanthropic, humane, patriotic, religious, or eleemosynary organization [which] solicits or obtains contributions solicited from the public for charitable purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">As Ball points out, the statutory prohibition of \u00a7 562A(a) criminalizing \u201cconduct for the sole purpose of coercing or intimidating\u201d persons to contribute money or time to an organization is not necessarily inconsistent with the notion that the prohibition could encompass \u201ccharitable organizations.\u201d The legislature, however, did not use that common term in \u00a7 562A(a) but rather focused on social, economic, or political organizations. Because the statute is a penal measure, it must be strictly construed. Thus, \u201ccourts will not extend the punishment to cases not plainly within the language used.\u201d <em>Bacon v. State, </em>322 Md. 140, 149, 586 A.2d 18 (1991); <em>Davis v. State, </em>319 Md. 56, 61, 570 A.2d 855 (1990); <em>Wynn v. State, </em>313 Md. 533, 539-40, 546 A.2d 465 (1988); <em>Jones v. State, </em>304 Md. 216, 220, 498 A.2d 622, 624; <em>Briggs v. State, </em>289 Md. 23, 31-32, 421 A.2d 1369 (1980); <em>State v. Archer, </em>73 Md. 44, 57, 20 A. 172 (1890). As we said in <em>Davis, supra, </em>319 Md. at 61, 570 A.2d 855, quoting <em>Cearfoss v. State, </em>42 Md. 403, 407 (1875):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">\u201c \u2018No man incurs a penalty unless the act which subjects him to it, is clearly, both within the spirit and letter of the statute. Things which do not come within the words are not to be brought within them by construction.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The reason for this policy is clear. It would be manifestly unfair to punish an individual for committing an act that was not known to be criminal when it was performed. We first said in 1885:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">\u201cIt is not consistent with the just and benign spirit of our law to give to a criminal statute an interpretation which can be maintained only by a keen and scholarly ingenuity. The meaning of a law which consigns a man to prison, or deprives him of his property should be plain and obvious, and easily understood by an ordinary capacity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><em>James v. State, </em>63 Md. 242, 253 (1885).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">As we see it, a nonprofit fund-raising entity like the United Way Fund is not, in common parlance, a \u201csocial\u201d organization or association. Plainly, the predominant purpose of the Fund is not a social one in the sense of an organization devoted to social activities, <em>i.e., </em>friendly interaction, communication, recreation, and leisure activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Although presented in a different statutory context, the court in <em>United States v. McIntyre, </em>253 F.2d 728 (4th Cir.1958), considered whether an incorporated community pool was, within the coverage of a federal internal revenue statute, a \u201csocial organization\u201d subject to the payment of excise taxes on dues, initiation fees, and assessments charged against its members. The pool corporation maintained that it was not a social organization because, in part, it used the pool for meetings on the topic of juvenile delinquency and for recreation for underprivileged and handicapped children. The court held that the corporation was a social organization because it was used \u201cas a social center of a suburban community where, by prearrangement and happenstance, members, their families and guests, meet their friends and neighbors, where conversation flows and \u2018informal committee meetings\u2019 are held, until the whole takes on the appearance \u2018of a great big family gathering.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731. The court looked to the organization\u2019s \u201cpredominant purpose.\u201d It contrasted a social organization to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\u201cprofessional society\u201d and to an \u201celeemosynary institution,\u201d noting that eleemosynary organizations are a category separate and distinct from social organizations under the statute. For other cases concerning taxation of a \u201csocial organization,\u201d <em>see Cohan v. United States, </em>198 F.Supp. 591 (E.D.Mich.1961) (nonprofit yacht club incorporated for purpose of engaging in yachting and boating and to promote those objectives was \u201csocial organization\u201d for federal tax purposes); <em>Engineers\u2019 Club of Los Angeles v. United States, </em>173 F.Supp. 934, 936 (S.D.Cal.1959) (where basic purposes of organization were essentially technical and professional, incidental and limited social activities do not alter nonsocial status for purposes of excise tax levies on dues and fees collected by organization); <em>Maryland Country Club, Inc. v. United States, </em>539 F.2d 345 (4th Cir.1976) (country club classified as \u201csocial organization\u201d for purposes of imposing federal excise taxes on dues, membership and initiation fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Even though the Fund may, by its charitable activities, promote the social welfare of the people, the legislature, in our view, did not intend that it be encompassed within the proscription of \u00a7 562A(a) as a \u201csocial\u201d organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Nor do we think that the Fund is an \u201ceconomic\u201d organization or association within the contemplation of the statute. Merely because the Fund may collect, manage, invest, and distribute money in fulfillment of its nonprofit, charitable mission does not import to it the character of an economic organization in the usual and natural sense of that term. Indeed, there is virtually no organization that does not, in some fashion, participate in the economy; hence, whether an organization generates, earns, accepts, or spends money is not, we think, the test which the legislature intended to apply in determining whether an organization is an \u201ceconomic\u201d one under \u00a7 562A(a). While in a broad sense, an economic organization is one related to or connected with commerce or business, and within that definition might include a nonprofit organization, it is our view that had the legislature intended to treat \u201ccharitable orga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>nizations\u201d like the Fund within the ambit of an \u201ceconomic\u201d organization, it would have specifically so provided. As earlier indicated, well before the enactment of \u00a7 562A(a), the General Assembly had given separate recognition and specific definition to a \u201ccharitable organization\u201d under Code, Article 41, \u00a7 3-201(b)(l), and by that definition fully understood that, in the ordinary sense, it was different than a social or economic organization.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so concluding, we find wholly unpersuasive the notion that the legislature intended to include any and all organizations or associations under \u00a7 562A(a) by its use of the phrase, \u201csocial, economic, or political association or organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">CERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED AS HEREIN SET FORTH; COSTS TO BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-14\">.

To the contrary, UPS states that Ball was properly terminated for cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">. That section defines a charitable organization as \"any benevolent, philanthropic, patriotic, or eleemosynary person or one purporting to be such.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b715-6\">ELDRIDGE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AFr\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The General Assembly, by enacting Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 562A(a), made it clear that the public policy of Maryland prohibited a person or organization from \u201ccoercing or intimidating another person to <em>contribute or donate </em>any goods, materials, services, or moneys to <em>any social, economic, or political </em>association or organization.\u201d (Emphasis added). The majority, however, holds that the public policy embodied in \u00a7 562A(a) does not cover the discharge of an employee because the employee refused to comply with her employer\u2019s directive that she donate part of her time and wages to the United Way Fund. The basis for the majority\u2019s holding is its conclusion that the United Way Fund is not a \u201csocial, economic, or political association or organization\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The majority reaches this conclusion by first focussing on the term \u201csocial organization\u201d in isolation and giving the term its narrowest possible meaning, and then dealing with the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>\u201ceconomic organization\u201d in isolation and giving that term a most restrictive meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In my view, the majority violates the very principles of statutory construction which it sets forth, as the majority refuses to give the words of the statute their natural and usual meaning. Moreover, by construing each term \u201csocial organization\u201d and \u201ceconomic organization\u201d in isolation, without regard to their context or other language in \u00a7 562A(a), the majority ignores the principle that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u201cin construing statutes in order to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent, we do not read particular language in isolation or out of context. We construe statutory language in light of the legislature\u2019s general purpose and in the context of the statute as a whole. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513-516, 525 A.2d 628, 632-633 (1987). <em>See Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471, 474-475 (1988).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\"><em>Forbes v. Harleysville Mutual, </em>322 Md. 689, 696-697, 589 A.2d 944, 947-948 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">As the dictionary definitions quoted by the majority demonstrate, the words \u201csocial\u201d and \u201ceconomic\u201d have very broad meanings. For example, one definition of \u201csocial\u201d is \u201crelating to human society.\u201d The word \u201cpolitical\u201d also covers many types of organizations. By grouping these three broad adjectives together in the disjunctive, preceded by the word \u201cany,\u201d the General Assembly obviously intended that the prohibition embodied in \u00a7 562A(a) related to a wide range of organizations or associations. Absent any legislative history indicating that the General Assembly intended something narrower than the normal meaning of the words, the language \u201cany social, economic, or political association or organization\u201d is all encompassing, excluding perhaps only governmental entities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>The crux of the evil at which the General Assembly was aiming in \u00a7 562A(a) was coercing or intimidating persons to make contributions or donations. The statute reflects the principle that donations or contributions to organizations should be voluntary and not coerced. While the Legislature certainly did not want to preclude mere persuasion, it nevertheless believed that contributions and donations should be the product of voluntary action. Giving an ultra narrow construction to the language of the statute designating the recipients of the contributions or donations is inconsistent with this legislative purpose. Neither the statutory language nor reason supports the majority\u2019s conclusion that coerced contributions to some organizations are desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The majority seems to hold that \u201csocial\u201d organizations within the meaning of \u00a7 562A(a) are limited to entities like pool clubs, yacht clubs, and country clubs. It further holds that \u201ceconomic\u201d organizations within the contemplation of the statute are limited to profit making entities. Nothing in the statutory language or purpose supports this restrictive view.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The majority takes the position that if the General Assembly intended that coerced contributions to charitable organizations be forbidden, it should have used the word \u201ccharitable\u201d along with \u201csocial, economic, or political.\u201d Where the Legislature intends to encompass all types of organizations, however, it need not employ a multitude of adjectives and list every specific type of organization covered. The General Assembly clearly can use umbrella terms embracing charitable and many other types of organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Apparently to justify the limitations inserted into \u00a7 562A(a), the majority invokes the principle that \u201c[b]e-cause the statute is a penal measure, it must be strictly construed.\u201d This principle, however, does not authorize a court\u2019s refusal to give effect to plain statutory language simply because the language is broad. <em>See, e.g., Belman v. State, </em>322 Md. 207, 213-214, 586 A.2d 1281, 1284 (1991); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>State v.

Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 422, 348 A.2d 275, 279 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1680, 48 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">\u201cpenal statutes, like other statutes, are to be fairly and reasonably construed and courts should not, by narrow and strained construction, exclude from their operation cases plainly within their scope and meaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al-\">Even if one accepted the majority\u2019s approach of examining each of the terms \u201csocial organization\u201d and \u201ceconomic organization\u201d separately, and even if a restrictive definition of \u201csocial organization\u201d were justified, the United Way Fund is clearly an \u201ceconomic organization.\u201d The Fund is simply a money raising entity. It does not engage in any charitable work itself; instead, the Fund raises money for various charities. Except for its being nonprofit, it is the same as the organization involved in <em>Joseph H. Munson Co. v. Sec. of State, </em>294 Md. 160, 165, 448 A.2d 935, 938 (1982), <em>aff'd, </em>467 U.S. 947, 104 S.Ct. 2839, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984), which was \u201cin the business of fund raising.\u201d To hold that an organization, whose sole purpose is to raise and distribute money, is not an \u201ceconomic organization,\u201d is to distort the plain and normal meaning of words.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is simply no justification in the statutory language or purpose for the majority\u2019s view that the General Assembly intended to exclude non-profit entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Furthermore, other language in \u00a7 562A(a) demonstrates that the General Assembly did not intend to exclude nonprofit entities. \u201cPolitical\u201d organizations are expressly encompassed, but they are non-profit entities. In addition, \u00a7 562A(a) forbids coercing or intimidating another person \u201cto contribute or donate any goods, materials, services, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>moneys.\u201d Contributions and donations are usually made only to non-profit organizations. A construction of \u00a7 562A(a) which excludes contributions and donations to non-profit organizations renders the statute largely ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In sum, I believe that the Court\u2019s unwarranted construction of Art. 27, \u00a7 562A(a), has to a great extent undermined the legislative purpose of protecting individuals from having to make coerced contributions to various organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Judge Bell has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\">. <em>See Lomax v.
