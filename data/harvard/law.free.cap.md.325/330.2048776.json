He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of twelve years and four years. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions. <em>Morales v. State, </em>Unreported, No. 635, September Term, 1990, filed March 12,1991. We granted certiorari to determine whether the trial court, McKee, J., erred in advising Morales, who was representing himself at trial, concerning his right to testify or not to testify, as well as the use of his prior convictions for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Morales waived his right to counsel despite the court\u2019s extensive warning about the dangers in proceeding pro se. The trial court urged Morales to obtain the assistance of an attorney, but Morales assured the judge that he had been to court before and wanted to represent himself. The trial judge went so far as to state \u201cI have done everything, I have done everything except get on my knees and beg you to get a lawyer ... I am begging you to get a lawyer.\u201d Morales still insisted he did not want an attorney, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>trial went forward with Morales representing himself. At the close of the State\u2019s case, the trial court advised Morales of his constitutional right to take the witness stand and testify in his own defense or not to testify and remain silent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">THE COURT: Now, is the time for you to put on your evidence. Call your first witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">THE DEFENDANT: Just me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">THE COURT: Okay. So you will understand, evidence is only what a witness says from there or a physical thing that they \u2014 somebody on the witness stand describes and it\u2019s introduced like this was, or a stipulation and the stipulation is an agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">Now, you remember the State stipulated and they agreed that you didn\u2019t have money, drugs, or a beeper on your person when you were arrested. Isn\u2019t that what you stipulated to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">THE COURT: That is how evidence is taken in. Not what is said down there. What he says from down there is not evidence. What you say from down there is not evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">Do you want to take the witness stand and testify? You may. But I need to tell you that you have a right not to testify. Nobody in this country can be made to take the witness stand and testify against themselves. In fact, if they don\u2019t, the fact that they didn\u2019t, may not be held against them in any way. It may not be considered in any way. In other words, I can\u2019t assume, in my mind, that you are guilty just because you decided not to testify. Okay. It\u2019s your decision, but I don\u2019t want you to say that I better do it, because he is going to think that I am guilty if I don\u2019t do it. That won\u2019t be the case. I will just have to go on the evidence that I have heard but not the fact that he took the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>I will take the stand.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>THE COURT: You want to take the stand? It is up to you. You thought about your right to remain silent, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>That is the only way for me to say what happened.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">THE COURT: That or to call witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t have any witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">THE COURT: <em>I will give you time to think about this. </em>Whichever way you want to go. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if, for instance, <em>if you have ever been convicted of a crime before. And I don\u2019t want to know right now. But if you take the stand and testify and you have been convicted of a crime before, they may ask you, they meaning the State may ask you about that. </em>Not to prove that because you were guilty before that you are guilty now, but they may bring it up to show whether or not you should be believed or not. It goes to what they call veracity, believability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">Does that help you decide whether you should or shouldn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>1 don\u2019t want to go up there.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t want to go up there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">THE COURT: You remember, I tried to tell you, I thought you ought to get a lawyer. I am trying to tell you, I am attempting to tell you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-14\">THE DEFENDANT: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-15\">THE COURT: To do all the things as we move along. Okay. Do you want me to give you until one o\u2019clock to come up with witnesses? I will do that for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-16\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-17\">THE COURT: That wouldn\u2019t help you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-18\">THE DEFENDANT: No. There is no one to call anyway. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-19\">THE COURT: Okay. Defense rests. (Emphasis added). Morales\u2019 record, revealed at sentencing, consisted of convictions of assault and battery, possession of PCP, possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>of PCP with intent to distribute, theft, disorderly conduct, and numerous motor vehicle offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The issue before this Court is whether the trial judge erred in the advice he gave Morales. The trial court informed the defendant, as required, that he had a right to testify or remain silent. We conclude, however, that while the trial court was not required to further inform Morales that he could be impeached by his prior convictions if he took the witness stand, since the trial judge elected to do so, he should have done so correctly. Because the judge may have misled Morales regarding impeachment by prior convictions and, thereby, influenced him not to testify, we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">A trial court is required to inform an unrepresented defendant of the constitutional right to remain silent or to testify. The defendant\u2019s right to remain silent and refuse to testify in order to avoid the possibility of compelled self-incrimination is a fundamental constitutional right. U.S. Const.Amend. V. <em>See also Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964) (holding that the privilege against self-incrimination is made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment). Our State Constitution also grants a defendant in a criminal case the privilege against self-incrimination. Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article 22. No adverse inference can be drawn from the exercise of this privilege. Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 9-107; <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 101 S.Ct. 1112, 67 L.Ed.2d 241 (1981). An equally important corresponding constitutional right is the right of a defendant in a criminal case to testify in his or her own defense. <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The decision whether or not to testify is a significant one and must be made with a basic appreciation of what the choice entails. If a defendant elects to remain silent, he or she waives the constitutional right to testify on his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>own behalf. Conversely, if a defendant testifies, he or she waives the constitutional right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Defendants represented by counsel are presumed to have been informed of their constitutional rights by their attorneys. Therefore, the trial court is not required to advise represented defendants of their right to remain silent or testify. <em>Stevens v. State, </em>232 Md. 33, 39, 192 A.2d 73, 77, <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 886, 84 S.Ct. 160, 11 L.Ed.2d 115 (1963). When, however, it becomes clear to the trial court that a defendant \u201cdoes not understand the significance of his election not to testify or the inferences to be drawn therefrom and where the presumption is rebutted,\u201d the court must advise a represented defendant of the right to testify or to remain silent. <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>320 Md. 637, 652-53, 579 A.2d 744, 751 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014: U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 1024, 112 L.Ed.2d 1106 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Unrepresented defendants can not be presumed to have been advised of, or know of, the existence of the constitutional right to remain silent or to testify in their own defense since they do not have attorneys to so inform them. Without knowledge of a right, a defendant can not waive it. Therefore, the trial court has an affirmative duty, albeit a limited one, to inform an unrepresented defendant of these rights. <em>Hamilton v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 140, 149, 555 A.2d 1089, 1093, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 550, 560 A.2d 1118 (1989); <em>Martin v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 597, 602, 535 A.2d 951, 954 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In the instant case, the trial court advised Morales of his right to remain silent and explained that if he exercised this right no inference of guilt could be drawn from his refusal. In doing so, the trial court provided the defendant with sufficient information necessary to waive his constitutional right to testify or to refuse to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The trial court, however, went further and told the defendant that if he decided to take the stand he would risk being impeached by the State with evidence of prior criminal convictions. The trial court was not required to inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Morales of the possibility of impeachment. When a defendant in a criminal case knowingly and voluntarily elects to proceed without counsel and manage his or her own defense, he or she \u201crelinquishes, as a purely factual matter, many of the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 581 (1975). Counsel would presumably know of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions and could advise the defendant whether these specific convictions could be used to impeach. It would be extremely difficult for the judge to give an unrepresented defendant a meaningful summary of the general law of impeachment by prior convictions and the trial judge should not be in a position of having to inquire about the defendant\u2019s prior convictions in order to give advice about potential impeachment. If the trial judge assumes the responsibility of giving such advice, the judge in effect becomes the defendant\u2019s lawyer. A defendant is not entitled to have the trial judge act as his or her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">We are persuaded by the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Martin v. State, supra, </em>that the trial court was not required to inform the unrepresented defendant that he could be impeached by the State on cross-examination. In <em>Martin, </em>the trial court told the defendant that he had the right to testify or refuse to testify and that it wouldn\u2019t be held against him if he elected to remain silent. The intermediate appellate court noted that this information sufficed and that the defendant should not expect the trial judge to advise him on the law of impeachment or to act as his lawyer. 73 Md.App. at 603, 535 A.2d at 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In <em>Hamilton v. State, supra, </em>the trial court assumed the responsibility of informing a defendant, represented by counsel, of his constitutional right to testify or to remain silent. During the colloquy it became clear that the defendant, who had very limited intellectual capacity, did not understand that no inference of guilt would be drawn from his failure to testify, and the trial judge did not allay the defendant\u2019s confusion. The Court of Special Appeals held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>that the defendant\u2019s decision to testify was not made knowingly and intelligently. Although the trial judge could have relied on the presumption that since the defendant was represented by counsel he had been properly advised of his right to testify or refrain from testifying, once the judge had undertaken to make inquiry and give advice, the judge should have made certain that the defendant understood his rights. 79 Md.App. at 150-51, 555 A.2d at 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Since in the instant case the trial judge elected to inform the unrepresented defendant of the possibility of impeachment by prior convictions, he should have done so correctly. A witness may be impeached by evidence of a prior conviction that tends to show that the witness may not be believed under oath. By statute, a witness may be impeached by prior convictions of \u201cinfamous crimes.\u201d Md. Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 10-905. \u201cInfamous crimes\u201d include treason, common law felonies, and other offenses classified as <em>crimen falsi. Horne v. State, </em>321 Md. 547, 554, 583 A.2d 726, 729 (1991), <em>citing Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 360, 535 A.2d 445, 449 (1988). Prior convictions of lesser crimes that bear on the witness\u2019 credibility may also be used to impeach a witness. <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. at 363, 535 A.2d at 452.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In the instant case as revealed at sentencing, Morales\u2019 record consisted of convictions of assault and battery, possession of PCP, possession of PCP with intent to distribute, theft, disorderly conduct, and numerous motor vehicle offenses. We held in <em>State v. Duckett, </em>306 Md. 503, 512, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>510 A.2d 253, 258 (1986) that a prior conviction of assault and battery is not admissible for impeachment purposes because it is irrelevant to the witness\u2019 credibility. <em>See also State v. Joynes, </em>314 Md. 113, 549 A.2d 380 (1988). Similarly, the convictions for disorderly conduct, motor vehicle offenses, and possession of PCP are not relevant to credibility. These convictions would not be admissible for purposes of impeachment because they are not infamous crimes and do not bear on the witness\u2019 credibility. <em>See Lowery v. State, </em>292 Md. 2, 437 A.2d 193 (1981); <em>Nesbit v. The Cumberland Contr. Co., </em>196 Md. 36, 75 A.2d 339 (1950); 6 Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 609.1 at 84 (1987). The felony of possession of PCP with intent to distribute is also not an infamous crime. We need not decide here whether a prior conviction for possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance may ever be used to impeach a witness, and if so, whether in the instant case the prejudice could outweigh the probative value. At least, Morales should not have been led to believe that conviction would be automatically admitted to impeach him. Theft, however, is a crime relevant to credibility and was the only one of Morales\u2019 convictions that was clearly admissible for impeachment purposes. <em>Horne v. State, </em>321 Md. at 556, 583 A.2d at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">A reasonable inference from the quoted colloquy between the judge and Morales is that Morales intended to testify until the judge advised him to \u201cthink about this\u201d and that his convictions could be brought out to show whether he should be believed or not. Since Morales apparently changed his decision to testify based on the trial court\u2019s incorrect implication that all of his prior convictions could be used to impeach him, the defendant\u2019s decision to waive his constitutional right to testify and to exercise his constitutional right to remain silent was not knowingly and intelligently made. If the trial court \u2014 although not required to do so \u2014 had given the correct information regarding impeachment by evidence of prior convictions, the result would be different. Therefore, we find that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>erred, and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO VACATE THE CONVICTIONS AND REMAND THIS CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\">. Maryland Rule l-502(a) became effective January 1, 1992 subsequent to the trial in the instant case. It provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">\"For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from the witness or established by public record during cross-examination, but only if the crime was an infamous crime or other crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility and the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or the objecting party.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
