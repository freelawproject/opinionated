The question is whether immediate appeals of those orders lie from the District Court of Maryland to a circuit court. As explained below, we shall answer in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Petitioner, Clinton R. Huff (Huff), on February 26, 1990, was operating a motor vehicle on Maryland Route 312 near Ridgely in Caroline County. Huff\u2019s vehicle was involved in a collision with another vehicle. One of his passengers, an adult in the rear seat, died in the collision. Huff was hospitalized. No criminal charges were issued immediately following the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">On April 11, 1990, the Maryland State Police trooper who investigated the accident presented a single application for a statement of charges to a commissioner of the District Court of Maryland. The police officer averred under oath that a consensual blood alcohol test administered to Huff revealed a level of 0.20%. The trooper requested that the commissioner charge Huff with the following offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated in violation of Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1991 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 388A;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">Driving while intoxicated (DWI) in violation of Md.Code (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 21-902(a) of the Transportation Article (TA);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">Driving a motor vehicle on a revoked license in violation of TA \u00a7 16-303;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">Negligently driving a motor vehicle in violation of TA \u00a7 21 \u2014 901.1(b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">Stopping, parking, or leaving a vehicle standing on the traveled portion of a highway outside of a business or residential district, in violation of TA \u00a7 21-1001(a);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">Huffs failure to be restrained by a seat belt in violation of TA \u00a7 22-412.3(b); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">Transporting a child three to five years old without a child safety seat in violation of TA \u00a7 22-412.2(e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">In response the commissioner issued two charging documents and two warrants that same day, one set charging Art. 27 offenses, and the other charging offenses under the Transportation Article. The charging document under Art. 27 charged manslaughter by automobile in violation of \u00a7 388, in addition to homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated under \u00a7 388A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statement of charges alleging negligent driving in violation of TA \u00a7 21-901.1(b) advised that the preset fine for that offense was $45. The next day, April 12, Huff was arrested and, a few days later, released on bail. Trial was set for August 27, 1990, in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">At no time did Huff exercise, or attempt to exercise, his right to a jury trial. See Md.Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 4-302(e)(l) and (2)(i) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>On August 14,1990, this Court decided <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 577 A.2d 795. There we held that Gianiny\u2019s payment of the preset fine for negligent driving operated as a conviction, and that, for double jeopardy purposes, it was \u201cimmaterial that that conviction did not result from a trial or from acceptance of a guilty plea[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 577 A.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Two days after <em>Gianiny </em>was decided and eleven days before trial in the District Court of the charges against him, Huff paid the preset fine on the negligent driving charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The parties appeared in the District Court on the date set for trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At some point during the District Court hearing the State nol prossed the charges of stopping, parking, or leaving a vehicle standing on the highway outside of a business or residential district, failure to use a seat belt, and failure to use a child\u2019s car seat. Huff moved to dismiss the manslaughter and homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated charges. He claimed that his conviction of negligent driving, effected by payment of the preset fine, barred conviction for any of the Art. 27 offenses. The District Court denied Huff\u2019s motion to dismiss. Huff then apparently announced an intent to pursue an immediate appeal to the Circuit Court for Caroline County. The District Court thereupon discontinued proceedings, and did not try any of the charges on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The matter came on before Judge J. Frederick Price in circuit court on October 10, 1990. The State agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Huff\u2019s counsel that the only issue before the court was the effect of the payment of the negligent driving fine on the manslaughter and homicide charges. The court refused to dismiss those charges on double jeopardy grounds. Judge Price then directed that Huff\u2019s appeal be set in for trial on the merits, before a jury, as an appeal from the District Court. Huff objected, without success, to that announced procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Subsequently Huff filed a written motion to dismiss or to remand to the District Court, arguing that only the ruling of the District Court on his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds had been appealed to the circuit court. That motion was heard by Judge J. Owen Wise on December 5, 1990, and denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Trial on the merits was held before Judge Wise on December 28, 1990. The parties had entered into an agreement pursuant to which the State nol prossed the manslaughter charge, and the parties proceeded without a jury on a not guilty, agreed statement of facts. Judge Wise found Huff guilty of homicide, DWI and driving on a revoked license. Subsequently sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Huff petitioned\u201d this Court for the writ of certiorari which we granted. His petition presents three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">\u201c1. Was this case properly before the Circuit Court when Petitioner had neither prayed, a jury trial nor had been tried in the District Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">\u201c2. Was the charge of homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated barred by the principle of double jeopardy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-10\">\u201c3. Was the evidence insufficient to support a finding of homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">In his brief in this Court Huff, agreeing with the position taken by his trial counsel, asserts that the appeal to the circuit court was limited to the double jeopardy issue alone. The State, disagreeing with the position of the State\u2019s Attorney in the circuit court, argues that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Court\u2019s denial of dismissal on double jeopardy grounds was not immediately appealable, primarily because the collateral order doctrine does not apply to de novo appeals from the District Court to a circuit court. At oral argument in this Court Huff seemingly agrees that the immediate appealability of denials of the double jeopardy protection against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction rests on the collateral order doctrine, but Huff has not clearly taken any position on whether the collateral order doctrine applies to de novo appeals from the District Court. Neither party advocates the circuit court\u2019s position, namely that Huff\u2019s notice of appeal brought to the circuit court both the denial of the double jeopardy defense and, if that defense were again denied, then the balance of the cause for trial de novo on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">There is a narrow class of orders from which this Court permits immediate appeals even though the orders are not final judgments. Generally those orders must conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue, be completely separate from the merits of the action, and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>See Bunting v. State, </em>312 Md. 472, 476-77, 540 A.2d 805, 807 (1988). The appealability of orders meeting those requirements is the collateral order doctrine. We have referred to the collateral order doctrine as an \u201cexception to the final judgment rule.\u201d <em>Parrott v. State, </em>301 Md. 411, 414, 483 A.2d 68, 69 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">This Court has \u201crecognized that, under the collateral order doctrine, a defendant may take an immediate appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Bunting v. State, </em>312 Md. at 477-78, 540 A.2d at 807. For that proposition <em>Bunting </em>cited primarily to <em>Parrott </em>and secondarily to <em>Russell v. State, </em>310 Md. 96, 98 n. 1, 527 A.2d 34, 34 n. 1 (1987); <em>Robinson v. State, </em>307 Md. 738, 741 n. 2, 517 A.2d 94, 96 n. 2 (1986); <em>Huffington v. State, </em>302 Md. 184, 187 n. 2, 486 A.2d 200, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>202 n. 2 (1985); <em>Evans v. State, </em>301 Md. 45, 49 n. 2, 481 A.2d 1135, 1137 n. 2 (1984); <em>Bowling v. State, </em>298 Md. 396, 401 n. 4, 470 A.2d 797, 799 n. 4 (1984); and <em>In re Mark R., </em>294 Md. 244, 246 n. 2, 449 A.2d 393, 395 n. 2 (1982). The cases secondarily cited did not articulate the basis for the immediate appealability of orders denying a double jeopardy defense. Their citation in <em>Bunting </em>places appealability on the foundation of the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>Bunting\u2019s </em>primary citation to <em>Parrott </em>is not to <em>Parrott\u2019s </em>precise holding, but to the reasoning which was essential to that holding. In <em>Parrott, </em>we denied an immediate appeal from an order granting removal for trial from one circuit court to another of a capital punishment murder case that had been removed pursuant to the absolute right granted under Maryland Constitution, art. IV, \u00a7 8. Parrott predicated his interlocutory appeal on a line of Maryland cases, going back at least to <em>Condon v. Gore, </em>89 Md. 230, 42 A. 900 (1899), which permitted an immediate appeal from any order that settled a constitutional right. <em>Parrott\u2019s </em>reasoning traced how, following recognition by the Supreme Court of the collateral order doctrine in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), two lines of cases developed in this Court explaining immediate appealability of interlocutory orders, absent an interlocutory appeal statute, one based on the constitutional right doctrine and the other on the collateral order doctrine. With respect to claimed denials of double jeopardy protection, we referred to <em>Neal v. State, </em>272 Md. 323, 322 A.2d 887 (1974), which permitted an immediate appeal from such a denial on the basis that the claimed denial of an absolute federal constitutional right was involved. <em>Parrott </em>noted that, after <em>Neal </em>was decided, the United States Supreme Court applied the collateral order doctrine to the denial of a double jeopardy defense. <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977). We said in <em>Parrott </em>that \u201c[t]he result <em>Neal </em>reached by way of the absolute constitutional right analysis is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>same as <em>Abney </em>reached by applying the collateral order doctrine.\u201d 301 Md. at 422, 483 A.2d at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Turning to appeals from refusals to dismiss charging documents attacked for denial of a speedy trial, <em>Parrott </em>reviewed how this Court had initially permitted immediate appeals in such cases under the constitutional right doctrine, see <em>Jones v. State, </em>241 Md. 599, 217 A.2d 367 (1966) and <em>Harris v. State, </em>194 Md. 288, 71 A,2d 36 (1950), and how, following the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of immediate appealability in speedy trial cases under the collateral order doctrine, see <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 98 S.Ct. 1547, 56 L.Ed.2d 18 (1978), this Court in <em>Stewart v. State, </em>282 Md. 557, 386 A.2d 1206 (1978), similarly used the collateral order doctrine analysis to deny immediate appeal-ability in speedy trial cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\"><em>Parrott </em>concluded by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u201c[I]n <em>Stewart </em>... we applied the collateral order doctrine and overruled contrary earlier holdings of this Court which looked to the absolute constitutional right mode of analysis. <em>Stewart </em>necessarily stands for the proposition that the collateral order doctrine controls and that whether an interlocutory appeal lies is not determined by whether a claimed constitutional right has been denied or settled. Because the order of removal appealed from in this case is not a final judgment and does not fall within the collateral order doctrine exception, we dismiss[ ] Parrott\u2019s appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">301 Md. at 426, 483 A.2d at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">In the matter before us the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is not a final judgment, in the sense that it does not terminate the prosecution. There is no statute which confers the right to appeal from District Court interlocutory orders, as such. <em>Cf </em>CJ \u00a7 12-303. Huff did not remove the case from District Court jurisdiction by a prayer for jury trial. The only basis on which the District Court\u2019s interlocutory ruling might be immediately appealable is if the collateral order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>doctrine applies. All of the cases, however, in which we have recognized immediate appeals of interlocutory orders as final judgments under the collateral order doctrine have involved appeals from circuit courts to the appellate courts. Those appeals were appeals on the record made in a circuit court. Appeals in criminal cases from the District Court to a circuit court are de novo, unless the parties agree to proceed on the record. CJ \u00a7 12-401(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The question here is whether we should recognize the collateral order doctrine as part of the right to appeal de novo from the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Perhaps the strongest argument supporting immediate appealability in the instant case is that the right of appeal from trial courts of general jurisdiction, in both civil and criminal cases, is conferred \u201cfrom a final judgment.\u201d CJ \u00a7 12-301. This Court, in effect, has construed \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in CJ \u00a7 12-301 to include collateral order doctrine appeals. The right of appeal from the District Court is conferred on \u201c[a] party in a civil case or the defendant in a criminal case ... from a final judgment.\u201d CJ \u00a7 12-401(a). Seemingly, the term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in \u00a7 12-401(a) should have the same meaning as it does in \u00a7 12-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">That analysis fails, however, to give due regard to the context surrounding the appeal. CJ \u00a7 12-101(f) defines \u201cfinal judgment\u201d to mean \u201ca judgment, decree, sentence, order, determination, decision, or other action by a court ... from which an appeal, application for leave to appeal, or petition for certiorari may be taken.\u201d The Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, a product of the Code revision project, was enacted by the Acts of 1973, First Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Session, ch. 2. The Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 12-101(f) states that \u201c[t]his definition does not attempt to specify what is an appealable final order. That is left to case law, as at present.\u201d Md.Code (1974), CJ, at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">There is no Maryland case law directly deciding the question before us. That void is understandable. The Maryland Constitution contains no express prohibition against double jeopardy. The prohibition against double jeopardy in the United States Constitution was not expressly recognized by the Supreme Court to extend to the states through the fourteenth amendment until 1969. <em>See Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969). Thus, in the era preceding creation of the District Court of Maryland in 1971, an accused whose double jeopardy defense was denied by a justice of the peace, trial magistrate, people\u2019s court judge, or municipal judge could not have invoked the absolute constitutional right basis for an immediate appeal. Indeed, this Court is not aware of any direct appeal which has been allowed from an interlocutory order of a trial court of limited jurisdiction, on either the constitutional right or the collateral order analysis, until the recent spate of attempted immediate appeals raising double jeopardy issues in Motor Vehicle Law cases that has been promoted by <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990), and by <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 577 A.2d 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">A further explanation for the lack of any practice recognizing interlocutory appeals from trial courts of limited jurisdiction, and a reason why the collateral order doctrine should not be judicially incorporated into \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in CJ \u00a7 12-401(a), is the lack of necessity. Where, as here, the double jeopardy defense of the accused in the District Court is based on a prior conviction of a lesser included offense, the greater inclusive offense likely will permit imprisonment for a period in excess of ninety days, so that the accused will have a right to immediate removal to a circuit court by demand for jury trial. CJ \u00a7 4-302(e)(l) and (2)(i). In the circuit court the accused could move to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>on double jeopardy grounds. If the motion is denied, the ruling would be immediately appealable under the right conferred by CJ \u00a7 12-301, as judicially interpreted to include the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Illustrating the scenario just described is <em>Block v. State, </em>286 Md. 266, 407 A.2d 320 (1979). In that case the District Court found the accused guilty of shoplifting, but deferred sentencing. On reconsideration, the court struck the guilty verdict and entered a finding of not guilty. On further reconsideration the District Court struck the not guilty finding and ordered that the defendant stand for a new trial, instead of reinstating the prior guilty verdict. The defendant then demanded a jury trial, removed the case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, and moved to dismiss on the ground that the District Court\u2019s finding of not guilty on the first reconsideration barred the new trial. The circuit court denied the motion, and the defendant immediately appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court granted certiorari, recognized the appealability of the denial of dismissal, and ruled on the merits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">There is a more fundamental reason not to apply the collateral order doctrine to de novo appeals from the District Court. The trial de novo of District Court appeals means that the case is tried afresh or anew. The State or the plaintiff must produce that party\u2019s evidence a second time. Even if the defendant had the right to remove the case from the District Court by demand for jury trial, and did not do so, the defendant has the right to a jury trial on the de novo appeal. <em>See Kleberg v. State, </em>318 Md. 411, 568 A.2d 1123 (1990); <em>Hardy v. State, </em>279 Md. 489, 369 A.2d 1043 (1977).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the other hand, issues which meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>requisites of the collateral order doctrine are almost universally issues of law. The de novo form of appeal simply is inappropriate for resolution of the kind of issues that trigger the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">A problem analogous to that presented here arose in <em>Kirsner v. State, </em>296 Md. 567, 463 A.2d 865 (1983). After his conviction in the District Court Kirsner there filed a motion for a new trial. At that time no rule of court interrupted the running of the time for appeal during the pendency of the motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When a new trial was denied, the time to appeal from the judgment of conviction had run, but the appeal was in time from the new trial denial. One issue in <em>Kirsner </em>was whether the de novo appeal from the District Court applied to an order denying a motion for a new trial. The circuit court dismissed the attempted appeal. We affirmed, on the following rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201cAppeals in criminal matters from the District Court are heard de novo. There is no way that on such an appeal a judge could review to determine whether or not the District Court trial judge had abused his discretion in denying a motion for a new trial. Given the very narrow holding of the Court in the past as to appeals from denials of motions for new trial in the circuit courts and the fact that appeals in District Court matters are heard de novo, we conclude that there is no right of appeal whatsoever from the denial by a District Court judge of a motion for new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">296 Md. at 571-72, 463 A.2d at 867 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Refusing to apply the collateral order doctrine to appeals de novo from the District Court also has the virtue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>avoiding additional complexities. Maryland Rules, ch. 1300, \u201cAppeals from the District Court,\u201d was adopted effective July 5, 1971, to coincide with the commencement of operations of the District Court. Rules 1370-1382 address the disposition by the appellate <em>(i.e., </em>circuit) court of those civil cases decided on appeal on the record. Under Rule 1314, dealing with de novo appeals, the action or cause is treated as a case instituted in the circuit court. <em>See </em>Rule 1314.a. The result is that the judgment entered in the de novo appeal is not an affirmance of the District Court; it is the judgment of the circuit court in a circuit court case. If the party appealing fails to appear, or abandons the appeal, the circuit court \u201cshall enter as its judgment the same judgment as was entered in the lower court.\u201d Rule 1314.c; <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>318 Md. 148, 567 A.2d 109 (1989). Were we to permit appeals from interlocutory orders entered by the District Court, by applying the collateral order doctrine to cases appealable de novo, cases would be split. One issue would be decided by the judgment of a circuit court and, if that judgment were adverse to the appellant, the balance of the case would be decided on the merits by judgment of the District Court, without any mechanism under the present Rules for bringing the two pieces together for any further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The system of appeals de novo from the District Court is legislatively mandated. Legislation first introduced to implement the constitutional amendment creating the District Court of Maryland proposed that an appeal from a judgment of that district court in a criminal, motor vehicle or civil case would be heard and decided on the record made in the District Court, as designated by the parties. 1970 Md. Laws 1265. By amendments in the course of passage the General Assembly in essence continued the appeal de novo of the preceding era. Acts of 1970, ch. 528. That predecessor system of appeals basically contemplated appeals after judgment on the merits which bring up the entire case for a retrial. The collateral order doctrine does not have a role to play in that system of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Next we consider whether the Maryland or United States constitutions mandate application of the collateral order doctrine to denials of double jeopardy defenses. <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977), does not require that result. The Court\u2019s discussion of the appealability question in <em>Abney </em>opens with the following reminder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201cFirst, it is well settled that there is no constitutional right to an appeal. Indeed, for a century after this Court was established, no appeal as of right existed in criminal cases, and, as a result, appellate review of criminal convictions was rarely allowed____ The right of appeal, as we presently know it in criminal cases, is purely a creature of statute; in order to exercise that statutory right of appeal one must come within the terms of the applicable statute \u2014 in this case, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 656, 97 S.Ct. at 2038 (footnotes and citations omitted). The applicable statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United Statesf.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Prior to <em>Abney </em>the Court had applied the collateral order doctrine to determine whether a given order was a \u201cfinal decision\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>Abney </em>was concerned with whether the denial of a claimed defense of double jeopardy fell within the collateral order doctrine. <em>Abney </em>held that it did. \u201c[TJhere can be no doubt that such orders constitute a complete, formal, and, in the trial court, final rejection of a criminal defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 97 S.Ct. at 2040. \u201c[T]he very nature of a double jeopardy claim is such that it is collateral to, and separable from the principal issue at the accused\u2019s impending criminal trial, <em>i.e., </em>whether or not the accused is guilty of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Court emphasized that double jeopardy is a \u201cguarantee against being twice put to <em>trial </em>for the same offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661, 97 S.Ct. at 2041 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201c \u2018The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 661-62, 97 S.Ct. at 2041 (quoting <em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221, 223, 2 L.Ed.2d 199, 204 (1957)). \u201cConsequently, if a criminal defendant is to avoid <em>exposure </em>to double jeopardy and thereby enjoy the full protection of the Clause, his double jeopardy challenge to the indictment must be reviewable before that subsequent exposure occurs.\u201d <em>Abney, </em>431 U.S. at 662, 97 S.Ct. at 2041.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The last quoted sentence is not the recognition of a mandate under the fifth amendment for immediate appeal of double jeopardy questions. It is an explanation of why double jeopardy issues meet one of the criteria of the collateral order doctrine, because \u201crights conferred on a criminal accused by the Double Jeopardy Clause would be significantly undermined if appellate review of double jeopardy claims were postponed until after conviction and sentence.\u201d <em>Abney, </em>431 U.S. at 660, 97 S.Ct. at 2040-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 317, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (1984), the Court described <em>Abney </em>as involving a claim that \u201cmet the three-part test established in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>[337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) ] because a double jeopardy claim contested the very power of the Government to bring a person to trial, and the right would be significantly impaired if review were deferred until after the trial.\u201d 468 U.S. at 320, 104 S.Ct. at 3083. In <em>Richardson </em>the Court then undertook an analysis of the collateral nature of the double jeopardy claim there presented, and held that it was sufficiently collateral to satisfy the collateral order doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>trine. That analysis would have been unnecessary if the interest under the double jeopardy clause in avoiding the second trial was sufficient, in itself, to mandate a procedure for an immediate appeal of a double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Some state courts, after considering the <em>Abney </em>rationale, have concluded that an immediate appeal from the denial of a double jeopardy defense is not required. <em>Burleson v. State, </em>552 So.2d 186 (Ala.Crim.App.1989); <em>People ex rel. Mosley v. Carey, 74 </em>Ill.2d 527, 25 Ill.Dec. 669, 387 N.E.2d 325, <em>cert. denied, 444 </em>U.S. 940, 100 S.Ct. 292, 62 L.Ed.2d 306 (1979); <em>State v. Fisher, 2 </em>Kan.App.2d 353, 579 P.2d 167 (1978); <em>State v. Joseph, </em>92 N.C.App. 203, 374 S.E.2d 132 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>324 N.C. 115, 377 S.E.2d 241 (1989); <em>State v. Miller, </em>289 S.C. 426, 346 S.E.2d 705 (1986). At least two courts have said that an immediate appeal is constitutionally required. <em>See State v. Choate, </em>151 Ariz. 57, 725 P.2d 764 (Ariz.App.1986) (holding interlocutory appeal constitutionally mandated by citation to <em>Abney, </em>without further discussion) and <em>Ex parte Robinson, </em>641 S.W.2d 552 (Tex.Crim.App. 1982) (premising immediate appeal on fifth amendment). Other courts, after discussing the issue, have concluded that a direct appeal or other form of review was available under state law and did not decide the constitutional question. <em>County Court of El Paso v. Ruth, </em>194 Colo. 352, 575 P.2d 1 (1978); <em>Commonwealth v. Chatfield-Taylor, </em>399 Mass. 1, 502 N.E.2d 512 (1987); <em>State v. Milenkovich, </em>236 Neb. 42, 458 N.W.2d 747 (1990); <em>State v. Janvrin, </em>121 N.H. 370, 430 A.2d 152 (1981); <em>State v. Jenich, </em>94 Wis.2d 74, 288 N.W.2d 114 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">That <em>Abney </em>does not constitutionally mandate interlocutory appeals is confirmed by an opinion by Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, dissenting from the denial of certiorari in <em>Spradling v. Texas, </em>634 S.W.2d 89 (Tex.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 971, 102 S.Ct. 1482, 71 L.Ed.2d 686 (1982). That opinion also suggests an argument for constitutionally mandated immediate appeals on other than fifth amendment grounds. The petitioner in <em>Spradling </em>argued that a Texas procedural rule barring interlocutory review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the denial of a double jeopardy defense, coupled with the denial in petitioner\u2019s case of leave to apply for a writ of prohibition, operated to deny petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights. In opposition to certiorari, Texas argued that <em>Abney </em>was merely an exercise by the Court of its supervisory power over federal criminal prosecutions. Justice Brennan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\u201cIt is true that the Court had no need to reach the constitutional question presented in the instant case when it decided <em>Abney, </em>but the Court\u2019s recognition in <em>Abney </em>that double jeopardy claims not considered prior to trial are rendered, in significant part, moot surely has significant constitutional overtones. We have never held that the Federal Constitution requires that a State provide appellate review. But once such review is provided, it may not be denied arbitrarily without violating the Equal Protection Clause. Fundamental precepts of due process require a right to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time\u2019 before suffering a grievous loss. Thus, there is surely a good deal of force to petitioner\u2019s argument that, if the State provides for appeals to protect other constitutional rights, it runs afoul of the Federal Constitution when it fails to give the same meaningful consideration to a defendant asserting his right not to be subjected to a second trial for the same offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">455 U.S. at 973, 102 S.Ct. at 1483 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">There is a rational basis for allowing appeals under the collateral order doctrine to litigants in the circuit courts while denying that doctrine to litigants in cases appealable de novo from the District Court. Although, as with any legislative body\u2019s determination on an issue, individual legislators may have their individual motives, the historical reason most frequently assigned for perpetuating de novo appeals, following the creation of the District Court of Maryland, is to enable persons who could not afford a transcript of the record the opportunity to have adverse judgments rendered by the District Court subject to a second look. That is a legitimate State interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Nor does due process require the State to provide an immediate appeal in these District Court cases. As we have explained above, in most instances in which the defendant in a criminal case in the District Court wants the availability of an immediate appeal of a ruling on a nonfrivolous double jeopardy defense, that defendant will be able to demand a jury trial, remove the case to the circuit court, obtain a ruling there, and, if adverse, have a right of immediate appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The problem under consideration concerns only the criminal defendant in the District Court who raises a double jeopardy defense there from which the defendant desires an immediate appeal, to be decided by a circuit court, without right to further review, and who, at the same time, seeks to preserve trial in the District Court on the merits if the defense fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The due process reality is that there is no significant motions practice in the District Court. Typically, a pretrial motion, if any, is heard on the date and at the time assigned for trial of the case. The practical result of not providing immediate appeals in District Court cases is that the case ordinarily can be tried and decided on the merits in less time than it would take for the Clerk of the District Court to transmit the case to the Clerk of a circuit court, had the District Court ruling on motion been immediately appeal-able.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Similarly, the defendant\u2019s interest in avoiding a second trial is not unconstitutionally infringed if state procedure does not provide an immediate appeal. In many minor cases a District Court prosecution does not ordinarily subject the defendant to \u201cembarrassment, expense and ordeal,\u201d or compel the defendant \u201cto live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity,\u201d to the degree contemplated in <em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. at 187, 78 S.Ct. at 223. In cases in which the District Court prosecution is for a crime serious enough to approach that degree, the defendant \u201cat any time prior to trial in the District Court\u201d can pray a jury trial and obtain the direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Because we hold that the collateral order doctrine does not apply to de novo appeals from the District Court, Huff\u2019s appeal in the instant cause was not before the Circuit Court for Caroline County. Consequently, there is no legal effect to the circuit court\u2019s denial of Huff\u2019s motion to dismiss the homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated charge. It remained pending against Huff in the District Court. Accordingly, we shall order this cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings on all pending charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">On the same reasoning, there is no legal effect to the judgment of conviction entered against Huff in the Circuit Court for Caroline County. As a result, we are not obliged to decide either the merits of the denials by both trial courts of Huff\u2019s double jeopardy contention, or Huff\u2019s insufficient evidence argument. Nevertheless, because the double jeopardy contention raised here is a recurring issue, we shall express our views on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">\u201c[T]he Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive prosecutions as well as cumulative punishment,\u201d for the same offense. <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 166, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2226, 53 L.Ed.2d 187, 195 (1977) (footnote omitted). Under the Maryland common law of double jeopardy, a defendant \u201ccould not be put in jeopardy again for the same offense \u2014 in jeopardy of being convicted of a crime for which he had been acquitted [the plea of <em>autrefois acquit </em>]; in jeopardy of being twice convicted and punished for the same crime [the plea of <em>autrefois convict].\u201d Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. at 347, 577 A.2d at 800. A \u201cgreater offense is ... by definition the \u2018same\u2019 for purposes of double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>jeopardy as any lesser offense included in it.\u201d <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. at 168, 97 S.Ct. at 2226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Negligent driving is a lesser included offense within the greater offense of homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated under Art. 27, \u00a7 388A. <em>Webber v. State, </em>320 Md. 238, 577 A.2d 58 (1990). Huffs payment of the preset fine for negligent driving constituted a conviction on that charge. <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. at 344-47, 577 A.2d at 798-800. From all of the foregoing Huff concludes, citing <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>that the homicide charge against him is barred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>the defendant had been convicted of \u201cjoy-riding,\u201d or unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Subsequently the defendant was charged with the greater inclusive offense of auto theft. The two offenses were the same for double jeopardy purposes. The Court held that \u201c[w]here the judge is forbidden to impose cumulative punishment for two crimes at the end of a single proceeding, the prosecutor is forbidden to strive for the same result in successive proceedings.\u201d 432 U.S. at 166, 97 S.Ct. at 2226.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In the matter before us the prosecution is not successive. Here there is but a single prosecution for multiple offenses. The application for a charging document was made for all of the charges at the same time. The charging documents and warrants were issued at the same time, and served at the same time. All of the charges were set for trial at the same time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Consequently, Huffs double jeopardy argument fails in the face of <em>Ohio v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 493, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984). Johnson was charged with murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated robbery, and theft in a single prosecution. Over objection by the state, the court accepted Johnson\u2019s pleas of guilty to involuntary manslaughter and theft. Thereupon, the court granted Johnson\u2019s motion to dismiss the murder and aggravated robbery charges on the theory that Johnson had already been convicted of lesser included offenses. The Supreme Court rejected this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Huff seeks to distinguish <em>Ohio v. Johnson </em>on the ground that, here, the State did not object to the prepayment of the negligent driving fine, and the State did not prevent prepayment by nol prossing that charge before Huff paid the preset fine. The opposition of the state, however, to the guilty plea in <em>Ohio v. Johnson </em>was coincidental, and not critical, to the Court\u2019s rationale which we set forth below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">\u201cThe grand jury returned a single indictment, and all four charges were embraced within a single prosecution. Respondent\u2019s argument is apparently based on the assumption that trial proceedings, like amoebae, are capable of being infinitely subdivided, so that a determination of guilt and punishment on one count of a multicount indictment immediately raises a double jeopardy bar to continued prosecution on any remaining counts that are greater or lesser included offenses of the charge just concluded. We have never held that, and decline to hold it now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201cWe do not believe, however, that the principles of finality and prevention of prosecutorial overreaching applied in <em>Brown </em>reach this case. No interest of respondent protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated by continuing prosecution on the remaining charges brought in the indictment. Here respondent offered only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>to resolve part of the charges against him, while the State objected to disposing of any of the counts against respondent without a trial. Respondent has not been exposed to conviction on the charges to which he pleaded not guilty, nor has the State had the opportunity to marshal its evidence and resources more than once or to hone its presentation of its case through a trial. The acceptance of a guilty plea to lesser included offenses while charges on the greater offenses remain pending, moreover, has none of the implications of an \u2018implied acquittal\u2019 which results from a verdict convicting a defendant on lesser included offenses rendered by a jury charged to consider both greater and lesser included offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">467 U.S. at 501-02, 104 S.Ct. at 2541-42. <em>See also Grady v.

State, </em>301 Md. 411, 414, 483 A.2d 68, 69 (1984), and as \u201ctreat[ing] as final and appealable a limited class of orders which do not terminate the litigation in the trial court,\u201d <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. 200, 206, 477 A.2d 759, 762 (1984); thus, in effect, a \u201ccollateral order\u201d is included in the definition of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d, as used in Maryland Code (1973, 1989 Repl.Vol., 1991 Cumm.Supp.) \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. By application of the collateral order doctrine, a defendant may immediately appeal a circuit court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss for double jeopardy. <em>Bunting v. State, </em>312 Md. at 477-78, 540 A.2d at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In <em>Abney, </em>the Supreme Court analyzed why the collateral order doctrine rendered appealable, on an interlocutory basis, an order denying an accused\u2019s double jeopardy defense. Such an order has all of the requisites of a \u201cfinal decision\u201d. 431 U.S. at 658, 97 S.Ct. at 2039, 52 L.Ed.2d at 659. It is, first of all, a fully consummated decision, which constitutes \u201ca complete, formal, and, in the trial court, final rejection of a criminal defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim.\u201d 431 U.S. at 659, 97 S.Ct. at 2040, 52 L.Ed.2d at 660; moreover, because a defendant who makes such a claim is not addressing the merits in any way, simply the \u201cvery authority of the government to hale him into court to face trial on the charge against him\u201d, it is \u201ccollateral to, separable from,\u201d the principal issue in the accused\u2019s impending criminal trial, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cwhether or not the accused is guilty of the offense charged,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and, lastly, it is effectively reviewable only if done before a trial of the merits. As to the latter point, acknowledging that the double jeopardy clause\u2019s only protection is not against being twice convicted of the same crime, which could be vindicated after a decision on the merits, 431 U.S. at 660, 97 S.Ct. at 2041, 52 L.Ed.2d at 661, the Court noted \u201c[i]t [also] is a guarantee against being twice put to <em>trial </em>for the same offense.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>(emphasis in original, footnote omitted) 431 U.S. at 661, 97 S.Ct. at 2041, 52 L.Ed.2d at 661. \u201cConsequently, if a criminal defendant is to avoid <em>exposure </em>to double jeopardy and thereby enjoy the full protection of the Clause, his double jeopardy challenge to the indictment must be reviewable before that subsequent exposure occurs.\u201d (emphasis in original). 431 U.S. at 662, 97 S.Ct. at 2041, 52 L.Ed.2d at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Courts Art. \u00a7 12-401(a), governing appeals from the District Court, permits a party to appeal \u201cfrom a final judgment entered in the District Court.\u201d Subsection (d) provides that the appeal, unless it is a civil case involving more than $2500.00 or the parties agree to proceed on the District Court record, is tried in the circuit court <em>de novo. </em>Similarly, a party may appeal a circuit court decision, but only if it is \u201ca final judgment.\u201d Section 12-301. Although \u00a7 12-101(f) defines a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as \u201ca judgment, decree, sentence, order, determination, decision, or other action by a court ... from which an appeal, application for leave to appeal, or petition for certiorari may be taken,\u201d it does not specify precisely what orders are \u201cfinal judgments\u201d. That decision, it has been held, properly belongs to this Court. <em>Cant v. Bartlett, </em>292 Md. 611, 616, 440 A.2d 388, 390 (1982). Ordinarily, a judgment is final when it denies the person aggrieved by it the means of further prosecuting or defending his or her rights or interest in the subject matter of the proceedings. <em>Fred W. Allnutt, Inc. v. Commissioner of Labor Industry, </em>289 Md. 35, 40, 421 A.2d 1360, 1363 (1980); <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 6, 432 A.2d 1319, 1323 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The District Court order denying the petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds did not, as the majority points out, deny petitioner the means of further defending himself on the merits. Thus, it was not a final judgment on the merits. It was final, however, insofar as the double jeopardy defense is concerned; as to that issue, for all intents and purposes, the District Court\u2019s order was a \u201cfinal decision\u201d. By virtue of that ruling, the petitioner could not further proceed on that issue in that court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Furthermore, the ruling was as final as a similar ruling, made by a circuit court would be. As we have seen, application of the collateral order doctrine would render the circuit court ruling immediately appealable. The majority holds that the same result is not only not required, but prohibited, in the case of a District Court ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Although recognizing the logic of giving the term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d, as used in \u00a7 12-401(a), the same meaning that it has in \u00a7 12-301, the majority nevertheless reaches a contrary result. It proffers several reasons for doing so. In the interest of giving \u201cdue regard to the context surrounding the appeal,\u201d it asserts that, given the lack of an express prohibition against double jeopardy in the Maryland Constitution and the lateness of the extension of that prohibition to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, \u201cin the era preceding creation of the District Court of Maryland in 1971, an accused whose double jeopardy defense was denied by [a court of limited jurisdiction] could not have invoked the absolute constitutional right basis for an immediate appeal.\u201d It also argues that there is no necessity for permitting interlocutory appeals from courts of limited jurisdiction; in order to have the full benefit of the right enjoyed by a circuit court defendant, all a District Court defendant need do is pray a jury trial, thus removing his case to the circuit court, where, if his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds were denied, he would be able to appeal immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Yet another reason offered by the majority relates to the nature of the <em>de novo </em>appeal procedure. That form of appeal, it maintains, \u201csimply is inappropriate for resolution of the kind of issues that trigger the collateral order doctrine\u201d since such issues, almost universally, are legal issues. Finally, the majority believes that, by refusing to apply the collateral order doctrine, this Court avoids \u201cadditional complexities\u201d inherent in a process which permits different aspects of one case to be tried in two different courts. The \u201cadditional complexities\u201d arise, we are informed, because there is no mechanism under the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>rules for bringing the two pieces together at an appropriate time, for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">None of the rationales offered by the majority is persuasive. That there has never been a direct appeal allowed from an interlocutory order of a trial court of limited jurisdiction on the basis of the collateral order, or constitutional issue, analysis until recently does not answer the question and, indeed, begs it. The first case, and there always must be a first case, usually defines the parameters of a claimed right. That is precisely what is being requested of us in this case. It is, I repeat, no answer that we have never had a case like it before.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">There is a necessity for a collateral order appeal from the District Court if one takes seriously both the rights afforded the defendant by the District Court appeal procedure and the applicability of the double jeopardy clause to defendants whose cases happen to begin in the District Court. Every double jeopardy defense that is raised in the District Court will not be successful. In point of fact, to be cognizable, it need only be colorable. <em>See Richardson v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 317, 322, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 3084, 82 L.Ed.2d 242, 249 (1984), citing <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 862, 98 S.Ct. 1547, 1554, 56 L.Ed.2d 18, 29 (1978). Granted that, in most cases, the defendant in the District Court who raises the double jeopardy defense will likely be entitled to pray a jury trial, but to make the lack of necessity depend upon the defendant\u2019s exercise of that right is to require him to spend a constitutional right in order to get a ruling on a motion, the immediate reviewability of which, though not necessarily constitutionally mandated, is addressed to his enjoyment of another indisputable constitutional right, <em>i.e., </em>freedom from twice being tried. A defendant charged in the District Court with an offense within that court\u2019s jurisdiction is entitled, if he or she wishes, to be tried in the District Court. That he or she has the right to remove the case to the circuit court by prayer for jury trial does not make it a necessity that he or she does so. Nor does it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>present the kind of necessity that should render the collateral order doctrine inapplicable to District Court appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A jury trial prayer removes the entire case, including the merits, to the circuit court. Thus, should the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss fail, he or she would be tried in the circuit court; he or she will have forever lost his or her right to be tried in the District Court. And, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, that right is not an insignificant one. Requiring the District Court defendant to pray a jury trial to obtain immediate review of the double jeopardy issue deprives the defendant who wishes to be tried in the District Court of a most significant right. Trial in the District Court, under the <em>de novo </em>appeal procedure, gives a defendant a free shot. He or she is enabled, by being permitted to see the State\u2019s evidence in the District Court trial, to assess the strength of its case and, in the event he or she chooses to put the State to its proof a second time in the circuit court, to prepare for any aspect of it as to which he or she was previously unaware or unprepared. Aside from the free shot or discovery reasons, a defendant may wish his or her case tried in the District Court because the disposition he or she receives there may be more favorable to him than one he or she could expect to receive in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The majority\u2019s citation to <em>Block v. State, </em>286 Md. 266, 407 A.2d 320 (1979) as illustrative of the point that there is no necessity for an immediate appeal from the District Court does not, in my view, have that effect. All that case illustrates is that the defendant in that case chose to follow the scenario the majority endorses: he did not attempt to appeal the District Court\u2019s order pursuant to the collateral order doctrine. Since he did not raise the issue now before us, that case has no persuasive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Nor is the majority\u2019s rationale that a <em>de novo </em>appeal is inappropriate for resolution of collateral order type issues persuasive. Whatever merit that proposition has, considered in a vacuum, it has absolutely none when it is placed in the context of this appeal. An appeal of the denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>motion to dismiss will involve nothing more than has previously occurred at the District Court level \u2014 argument on the motion. No trial either at the District Court level or the circuit court level will be required, simply an argument on the law, a fact that the majority specifically recognizes. There is no reason, therefore, for us to concern ourselves with any other scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">I have striven mightily, but without success, to determine what the majority means by \u201cadditional complexities.\u201d If a true collateral order doctrine appeal were permitted, any \u201cadditional complexities\u201d associated with it would necessarily be resolved prior to the trial on the merits in the District Court. And, of course, if the double jeopardy defense were found to have merit, <em>i.e., </em>the defendant prevailed, there would never be any necessity of a trial; the case would not need to be remanded or further reviewed. In any event, even when the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy appeal is unsuccessful and a trial on the merits is held, there still would never be an occasion to \u201cfurther review\u201d the appellate phase of the case; the collateral order appeal would have been completely resolved before the merits could be reached. Consequently, I fail to see how the \u201cadditional complexities\u201d argument militates against a collateral order doctrine appeal from a District Court ruling on a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Whatever may be the merits of an analysis to determine whether an immediate appeal, on the basis of the collateral order doctrine, is constitutionally mandated,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> whenever a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>double jeopardy defense is denied, in Maryland, there is a well-established appellate mechanism. And that mechanism recognizes the role that the collateral order doctrine plays in assuring that important rights, constitutionally based, or otherwise, are vindicated in a timely fashion, before they are lost. <em>See Bunting v. State, </em>312 Md. at 476-78, 540 A.2d 805; <em>State v. Hogg, </em>311 Md. 446, 535 A.2d 923 (1988), <em>Harris v. Harris, </em>310 Md. 310, 529 A.2d 356 (1987), <em>Yamaner v. Orkin, </em>310 Md. 321, 529 A.2d 361 (1987), <em>Parrott v. State, </em>301 Md. 411, 424-25, 483 A.2d 68, 75 (1984); <em>Public Service Comm \u2019n v. Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. 200, 477 A.2d 759 (1984), <em>Clark v. Elza, </em>286 Md. 208, 211-213, 406 A.2d 922, 924-25 (1979), <em>Peat &amp; Co. v. Los Angeles Rams, </em>284 Md. at 91-92, 394 A.2d at 804. Furthermore, this Court has provided a meaningful review of the denial of a double jeopardy defense, as the majority acknowledges, by interpreting \u201cfinal judgment\u201d, as used in Courts Article \u00a7 12-301, pertaining to circuit court appeals, to include an order denying a motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy. <em>Bunting, </em>312 Md. at 477-78, 540 A.2d 805. Consequently, we need not address whether there is a constitutional right to an immediate appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds; we need only determine whether, given the appellate scheme in Maryland, interpreting \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d as used in Courts Article \u00a7 12-401(a), to exclude an order denying a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, is violative of equal protection or due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>There can be no doubt but that the denial of a motion to dismiss a prosecution on double jeopardy grounds is a collateral order from which a collateral order doctrine appeal would lie. <em>See Abney, supra. </em>Indeed, the majority recognizes that this is so. It maintains, however, that immediate appealability, applicable to circuit court appeals, has no role to play in district court appeals. There is, furthermore, it suggests, a rational basis for distinguishing between such appeals. Specifically, the majority reiterates the reasons it proffered when addressing the applicability of the collateral order doctrine to <em>de novo </em>appeals. That it does, does not render those reasons any more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">I agree that it is a legitimate state interest to seek \u201cto enable persons who could not afford a transcript of the record the opportunity to have adverse judgments rendered by the District Court subject to a second look.\u201d That legitimate interest does not, however, negate, or even address, the question whether there should be an immediate appeal from an order by the District Court\u2019s denying a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. And it certainly provides no rational basis for interpreting \u201cfinal judgment\u201d one way when construing the circuit court appeal provision and interpreting it another way when construing the district court appeal provision. Permitting a second look at a critical issue, even if it is one required to be resolved before the merits are reached, is consistent with the purpose of the <em>de novo </em>appeal procedure. It is not, in any event, inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The majority also denies that there is a due process violation. Again its argument is premised on the availability to a litigant in the District Court, through the jury trial prayer, of the right to obtain an immediate appeal from a ruling on a nonfrivolous double jeopardy defense prior to being tried. To this argument, I again ask, at what cost? The immediate appeal may be available, but only by removal of the case to the circuit court. Thus, it is one step removed, <em>i.e., </em>the defendant must first pray a jury trial and remove the case from the District Court to the circuit court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Only then may he or she move to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds and, obtaining an unfavorable ruling, take an immediate appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This is the only rationale the majority provides for the different treatment. It does not suggest that a circuit court litigant must give up the right to trial on the merits in the circuit court as a prerequisite to review, in a meaningful and timely way, when the double jeopardy question is presented for the first time in that court. Moreover, the majority fails to discuss, and pointedly so, what the District Court litigant must give up to obtain the immediate appeal benefit. More to the point, it does no more than denigrate a litigant\u2019s desire to preserve his or her right to trial on the merits in the District Court, if his or her double jeopardy defense fails. As previously mentioned, I believe the right to be tried on the merits in the District Court to be significant and certainly worthy of preservation. This is especially the case when the issue may be resolved by reconciling the interpretation of the term \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d as used in different statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Nor am I impressed by the majority\u2019s \u201cpractical\u201d argument that the \u201cresult of not providing immediate appeals in District Court cases is that the case ordinarily can be tried and decided on the merits in less time than it would take for the clerk of the District Court to transmit the case to a clerk of a circuit court, had the District Court ruling on motion been immediately appealable.\u201d Assuming that that is true, the argument nevertheless misses the point; it is not how much time the District Court proceedings will take, rather the question is whether a District Court litigant deserves an opportunity to vindicate his double jeopardy rights to the same extent as a circuit court litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Finally, the majority suggests that the cases in the District Court, being minor ones, \u201c[d]o not ordinarily subject the defendant to \u2018embarrassment, expense and ordeal\u2019 or compel the defendant \u2018to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity\u2019 to the degree contemplated in <em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. [184,] 187, 78 S.Ct. at [221,] 223 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>[2 L.Ed.2d 199] [ (1957) ].\u201d When the case is that serious, it posits, the defendant may pray a jury trial and obtain the immediate and direct appeal. First of all, the Court in <em>Green </em>did not quantify the extent of the embarrassment, expense, ordeal, state of anxiety, or insecurity that must exist before the State\u2019s attempts to convict its citizen will not be permitted to continue. Rather, the thrust of <em>Green </em>is that the State\u2019s power should be curtailed so as to insulate one faced with prosecution, for whatever charge, from being placed in the situation of the defendant in <em>Green. </em>Furthermore, where the majority gets the notion that it is the nature of the prosecution, rather than the fact of prosecution, that triggers the need for double jeopardy protection is beyond me. And, because it is the fact of prosecution that triggers the double jeopardy protection, it follows inexorably that an opportunity to avoid that prosecution before a trial is held is minimally required. Should, however, the attempt to avoid a second trial be unsuccessful and the defendant does not otherwise elect, I would require that trial to be held in the forum in which the prosecution arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">I reiterate, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">. <em>In Ex Parte Robinson, </em>641 S.W.2d 552 (Tx.Crim.App.1982), it was held that \u201cThere is a Fifth Amendment right not to be exposed to double jeopardy, and that it must be reviewable before that exposure occurs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555. To reach that conclusion, the court interpreted <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977) as being grounded on \u201cthe constitutional right not to be exposed to double jeopardy, which would be significantly undermined by postponement of review until after conviction.\" 641 S.W.2d at 555, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hollywood Motor Car Company, </em>458 U.S. 263, 266, 102 S.Ct. 3081, 3083, 73 L.Ed.2d 754, 757 (1982). <em>State v.
