(Ocean), a Delaware corporation, is classified as a foreign manufacturing corporation taxable under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42B (as amended through St. 1937, c. 383, \u00a7 2). It qualifies as a farmers\u2019 cooperative for Federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code as in effect during the taxable years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ending on May 31, in 1961, 1962, and 1963.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For each such year Ocean in its Massachusetts excise tax return under G. L. c. 63 computed no tax to be due so far as its excise was measured by its \u201cnet income\u201d as defined, in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30, cl. 5. For each year the Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation made an additional assessment with respect to that part of the excise measured by Ocean\u2019s \u201cnet income.\u201d This was done because he determined that Ocean was not entitled to deduct (in computing its net income) nonpatronage dividends paid during the taxable year upon Ocean\u2019s capital stock. These dividends in each year exceeded the gross taxable income attributable to Massachusetts as computed by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">An application for abatement of the taxes thus assessed was filed by Ocean for each year and was denied. Upon appeals by Ocean to the Appellate Tax Board, the board rendered decisions for the commission. At Ocean\u2019s request, it made findings and a report. It held that, in computing its taxable net income, Ocean was not entitled to deduct the dividends mentioned above. Ocean appealed. It is stipulated that our decision \u2022 in the case involving the 1963 excise shall be binding in the cases for 1961 and 1962 and that the issues of law in all three cases are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 30, cl. 5 (as amended through St. 1933, c. 327, \u00a7 3, but prior to its amendment by St. 1966, c. 698, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 87, and by St. 1967, c. 755, \u00a7 3), reads: \u201c\u2018Net income,\u2019 the gross income from all sources, without exclusion, for the taxable year, less the deductions, other than losses sustained by the corporation in other fiscal . . . years and <em>other than dividends, </em>allowable by the federal revenue act applicable for said taxable year\u201d (emphasis supplied). In <em>Broadway Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>321 Mass. 25, 27, 29-30, this court held that the words \u201cother than dividends\u201d in c. 63, \u00a7 1 (as amended by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>St. 1933, c. 327, \u00a7 1), referred only to dividends <em>received </em>by the taxpayer and not to dividends <em>paid. </em>Chapter 63, \u00a7 1, in this respect, is nearly identical with c. 63, \u00a7 30, cl. 5, with the word \u201cbank\u201d substituted for \u201ccorporation.\u201d It was decided that the bank was entitled to deduct dividends paid by it on shares of its preferred stock held by the United States or by an exempt Federal instrumentality. The Internal Revenue Code of 1939, \u00a7 121 (53 Stat. part I, 56), then allowed banks to deduct such dividends in computing their net income subject to Federal tax. Accordingly, the bank was allowed to make such a deduction in computing net income subject to the Massachusetts corporation excise on banks. Ocean contends that the same reasoning requires that we interpret the quoted statutory language of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30, cl. 5, as permitting Ocean to deduct the dividends paid by it which it is allowed to deduct from gross income in computing its net income subject to Federal income tax under the Federal tax statutes cited above.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The tax commission points out (a) that Ocean\u2019s dividends were deductible under special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable only to certain cooperatives; (b) that these code provisions were not applicable to all corporations classified by G. L. c. 63 as \u201cforeign manufacturing corporations\u201d; and (c) that c. 63 (unlike the Federal act which made and makes special provisions for farmers\u2019 cooperatives) recognized no subclassification of the group of corporations treated by that chapter as \u201cforeign manufacturing corporations.\u201d From these facts, the tax commission argues that only such deductions permitted by the Federal code should be allowed (in computing a foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>manufacturing corporation\u2019s \u201cnet income\u201d for purposes of the Massachusetts excise under c. 63) as the Federal code allows to <em>all </em>corporations classified by c. 63 as \u201cforeign manufacturing corporations.\u201d We hold that there is no merit to this contention because \u00a7 30, cl. 5, in explicit terms, in defining \u201cnet income,\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 42B and other sections of c. 63, describes it as \u201cgross income\u201d less the deductions (with stated exceptions which do not exclude this cooperative\u2019s dividends) \u201callowable by the federal revenue act.\u201d As already stated, the commission\u2019s contention was effectively rejected in the <em>Broadway Natl. Bank </em>case, 321 Mass. 25, 27, 29-30, in considering the almost identical language of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The commission also argues that the deduction for dividends paid, allowed to farmers\u2019 cooperatives by the Federal code, is more like an exemption than a deduction. History gives some color to this contention. Prior to 1952, farmers\u2019 cooperatives which met the standards of \u00a7 101 (12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (see 53 Stat. part I, 33-34) had been fully exempt from Federal income taxation. In 1951, however (see Revenue Act of 1951, \u00a7 314, 65 Stat. 491-492), previously \u201cexempt\u201d farmers\u2019 cooperatives (a) were made taxable on their net income so far as not distributed or allocated to their members, but (b) were allowed thereafter to deduct dividends paid on their capital stock, in addition to any deductions otherwise allowable. See 6 Mertens, Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 34.34; Couper, The Farmer, the Cooperative, and the Commissioner, 7 Hastings L. J. 143, 148-149. This dividend deduction, by its express language, seems to us to be not an exemption but within the term \u201cdeductions . . . allowable by the federal revenue act\u201d as used in c. 63, \u00a7 30, cl. 5, and as interpreted in the <em>Broadway Natl. Bank </em>case, 321 Mass. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">We recognize that many of the provisions of c. 63, including those of \u00a7 30, cl. 5, have evolved over a period of years from efforts to cause Massachusetts excise taxation of banks and business and manufacturing corporations to comply with the requirements of Federal statutes regulating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>State taxation of national banks and also to meet various problems relating to inclusion of income from Federal government bonds within the measure of the corporation excise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Much of this history is described in Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts (3d ed.) 549-562, 576-583, 595-597, 613-625. Confusion has also resulted from the efforts (described in the pages just cited) to have the excises imposed by c. 63, so far as measured by income, related to the provisions of the Federal income tax on corporations defining gross income, deductions therefrom, and net income. There is no occasion for reviewing this history at length. It does not reveal legislative consideration of the precise problem now before us nor does it appear to us to provide any significant basis for interpreting \u00a7 30, cl. 5, in a manner contrary to the plain meaning of its language.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The tax commission argues that the Legislature has seen fit to exempt from excise taxation under c. 63 only farmers\u2019 cooperatives having no capital stock. By G. L. c. 157, \u00a7\u00a7 10-18, enacted by St. 1923, c. 438, \u00a7 4, provision was made for the organization of such cooperatives without capital stock. Whether formed in Massachusetts or elsewhere, they were exempted by \u00a7 18 from taxation under G. L. c. 63 and made subject to other taxing provisions not here relevant. By \u00a7 5 of the 1923 statute, c. 63, \u00a7 30, els. 1 and 2, were amended to exclude domestic corporations without capital stock formed under c. 157, \u00a7 10, and similar foreign cooperatives without capital stock, taxable under the provisions of c. 157, \u00a7 18. Ocean is not such a cooperative, for it does have capital stock and thus is taxable under c. 63, \u00a7 42B, as amended, in the same way as are other foreign manufacturing corporations. So far as the excise is measured by \u201cnet income,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that net income must be com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>puted in the manner set out in c. 63, \u00a7 30, cl. 5. We perceive nothing in the provisions of c. 157 sufficient to control the plain language of \u00a7 30, cl. 5. Any desired change in that language is for the Legislature, not this court, to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is reversed. The cases are remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including the computation and allowance of appropriate tax abatements. Ocean is to have costs of its appeals.
