A preliminary injunction against such violation was in effect from June 6, 1966, until May 23, 1967, when certain exceptions to a master\u2019s report were sustained and the master\u2019s report, as modified, was confirmed. By final decree the bill was dismissed, but this decree was revoked on June 1, 1967. A new final decree dismissing the bill was entered on January 4, 1968. From this Slade appeals. The facts are stated on the basis of the master\u2019s report as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Slade has engaged in the fish business in Boston since 1929 as a primary wholesaler and fish broker. O\u2019Neil, a business school graduate specializing in marketing, in 1963 answered Slade\u2019s newspaper advertisement for an assistant sales manager. At that time, he \u201cwas a highly skilled . . . person with varied and diversified experience as a salesman, market researcher, market analyst, and supervisor of personnel for\u201d well known firms. O\u2019Neil was told by Slade, before he was hired on an \u201cat will\u201d basis for a weekly salary of $192.50 (over $10,000 a year), plus \u201cbonuses or commissions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>sole discretion of Slade,\u201d that \u201c(a) he would break into the city sales department; (b) he would probably move into selling; (c) he might also assume supervisory or administrative work; [and] (d) he might handle some buying. He was [also] told . . . that Slade would lay out his duties for him; and that the latter could change his duties from time to time. O\u2019Neil . . . agreed to this arrangement. In addition, Slade told O\u2019Neil he would place him where he could be of the most value to the company and explained that his duties would be subject to change . . . according to how O\u2019Neil proved himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In September, 1963, when O\u2019Neil first worked for Slade, he had no written employment agreement. He was one of several employees with the title of assistant sales manager.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The others \u201cdid not [do] administrative work but concentrated on selling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u25a0 As O\u2019Neil learned the business, Slade gave him more responsibility, a number of accounts to handle, and a territory to prospect. By the time he signed his written employment agreement (fn. 1) on May 23, 1964, O\u2019Neil had \u201cvarious executive and supervisory duties, including the supervision of all salesmen employed by . . . [Slade], holding . . . sales meetings . . . [and] some policy-making functions.\u201d From September, 1963, to April 30, 1964, he was paid several hundred dollars as commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">O\u2019Neil, before signing the written employment agreement, read it \u201cand understood fully its terms and import.\u201d He-was given a copy. Other assistant sales managers signed similar documents. \u201cAlthough O\u2019Neil is described as \u2018assistant sales manager,\u2019 in the agreement, his duties are not defined.\u201d He \u201cwas aware he was to perform those duties . . . assigned to him by Slade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">O\u2019Neil had access to data and information which the master found to be \u201csignificant in the operation of . . . [Slade's] business.\u201d He dealt with the entire Gorton line, covering some 350 items of fish. He mailed sales brochures, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>had contact with customers, ascertained prospects, supervised salesmen, had access to the names and addresses of all customers and some suppliers, reviewed bills, and had credit, salary, and sales information (cost, selling prices, profit margins). The main source of prospective customers, however, was not confidential, but in fact was the \u201cyellow pages\u201d telephone directory. Because of the daily variation in fish prices, the sales information known to O\u2019Neil before May, 1966, when he left Slade\u2019s employ, would not be valuable thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">O\u2019Neil, after starting out well, began to \u201close steam.\u201d In the summer of 1965 Slade gradually changed O\u2019Neil\u2019s duties. The handling of the price list was first removed, and then the direction of sales meetings, so that O\u2019Neil could spend more of his time selling. Later, about half of O\u2019Neil\u2019s accounts were taken away because, in Slade\u2019s judgment, O\u2019Neil had failed to produce adequate sales volume. Slade\u2019s decisions were made in good faith, without changing O\u2019Neil\u2019s bonus, salary, or commission arrangements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was not unusual for accounts to be taken from some employees and given to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Although O\u2019Neil continued to do some work other than selling (e.g. buying salt fish), he became dissatisfied because of changes in his duties and the promotion of another to the position of sales manager (to exercise supervisory duties which O\u2019Neil theretofore had performed). O\u2019Neil did not express his feelings to Slade, but he felt that there was no future for him with the company. Accordingly, in 1966, he began negotiations with other wholesale fish dealers, including Fulham &amp; Maloney, Inc. (Fulham). Although urged to stay with Slade, he resigned on May 3, 1966, and worked for Fulham (essentially as a salesman at a lower salary and without any bonus, commissions, or title) until enjoined from doing so on June 6,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"A4b\">Slade is engaged mainly in selling to other wholesalers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>It, on occasion, sells to chain stores, as does Fulham, but the findings do not clearly show that the two companies sell the same products to chain stores. Slade encounters competition from other wholesalers both in buying and in selling. It has customers in thirty-five states, including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. To some of these customers O\u2019Neil himself made sales. Fulham is also a primary wholesaler and buys from some sources of supply from which Slade also buys. Both companies \u201chave occasionally sold products to the same customers.\u201d Such products do not represent a very substantial percentage of the business of one or the other company. Fulham\u2019s \u201cline is fluid, capable of expansion, and varies from time to time.\u201d Slade at all material times has handled everything on the Fulham product line except one product representing one quarter of Fulham\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The following are the principal conclusions of the master. (1) O\u2019Neil made the decision to leave Slade. (2) Fulham and Slade compete in purchasing items handled by both companies and in selling \u201cin some areas and to some extent.\u201d (3) O\u2019Neil took no customers\u2019 lists with him. (4) Price information possessed by O\u2019Neil prior to May, 1966, has become obsolete. (5) O\u2019Neil knew in May, 1966, that Fulham was competing with Slade in certain areas and that he would be in competition with Slade if he worked as a salesman for Fulham. The master concluded (so far as it might be a question of fact) that an injunction against O\u2019Neil for five years (see fn. 1, supra) was not required to afford Slade reasonable protection and \u201cthat a period not in excess of two . . . years\u201d would suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">1. The subsidiary findings indicate (a) that O\u2019Neil was employed with the title of assistant sales manager to do either supervisory work or sales as assigned to him by Slade; (b) that his duties were changed from time to time by Slade in good faith in the fight of O\u2019Neil's performance and demonstrated abilities; and (c) that O\u2019Neil left Slade of his own volition, although urged to remain without loss of salary and with reasonable prospects for future employment. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>assume, without deciding, that the employment agreement was not inherently unfair, was enforceable, and was made for valid consideration (see <em>Economy Grocery Stores Corp. </em>v. <em>McMenamy, </em>290 Mass. 549, 552; <em>Cygan </em>v. <em>Megathlin, </em>326 Mass. 732, 734-736); that there was no breach by Slade of the employment agreement, reasonably interpreted, which would make equitable relief inappropriate (cf. <em>Rayner </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>319 Mass. 311, 314; <em>National Overall Dry Cleaning Co. </em>v. <em>Yavner, </em>321 Mass. 434, 440); and that it was not abandoned or superseded by the conduct of the parties prior to O\u2019Neil\u2019s resignation. Cf. <em>F. A. Bartlett Tree Expert Co. </em>v. <em>Barrington, </em>353 Mass. 585, 587-588.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">2. The question for decision is whether the master\u2019s findings require specific enforcement of O\u2019Neil\u2019s covenant not to compete. Various considerations lead us to the conclusion that specific enforcement is not required, at least beyond the period June 6, 1966, to May 23, 1967. As already noted, during that period O\u2019Neil was subject to a prehminary injunction preventing him from working for Fulham.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The master\u2019s subsidiary findings do not establish a basis for concluding that Slade possessed good will of a type which would be adversely affected if O\u2019Neil were to work for a competitor. A subsidiary finding that good will existed was struck from the report on O\u2019Neil\u2019s objection that it was unsupported by evidence. The evidence summarized by the master, as supporting the finding, showed only that Slade was organized in 1929, had a branch office in Chicago, and had as customers, among others, three well known chain food stores. We assume that Slade possessed some good will, but the master\u2019s subsidiary findings do not establish to what extent any good will existed in the territory (the covenant area) in which O\u2019Neil\u2019s covenant not to compete applied. See <em>Club Aluminum Co. </em>v. <em>Young, </em>263 Mass. 223, 225-228. Cf. <em>New England Tree Expert Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>306 Mass. 504, 509-511.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The subsidiary findings concerning the nature and extent of Slade\u2019s and Fulham\u2019s operations in the covenant area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(although Slade supplies many customers there) are also meager. It does not appear adequately in what manner (a) there was either direct or indirect competition between the two companies in that area, or (b) O\u2019Neil\u2019s employment by Fulham would have any substantial effect upon Slade\u2019s interests, or cause Slade any significant damage, after May 23,' 1967, when the preliminary injunction was dissolved. The findings also do not establish how information possessed by O\u2019Neil as a consequence of his working for.Slade could be used by O\u2019Neil for Fulham adversely to Slade\u2019s interests. None of the information about Slade possessed by O\u2019Neil appears to have been highly confidential or secret. .Cf. <em>Novelty Bias Binding Co. </em>v. <em>Shevrin, </em>342 Mass. 714, 716-718; <em>New England Overall Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Woltmann, </em>343 Mass. 69, 75-78. Cf. also, <em>Abramson </em>v. <em>Blackman, </em>340 Mass. 714, 715-716.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The trial judge reasonably concluded, in effect, that ther\u00e9 was no occasion for further enforcement of the covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"ABv\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-11\">The covenant provided that O\u2019Neil \u201cagrees that upon his leaving the employment of . . .
