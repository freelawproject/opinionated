The land is located in a residential district under the town\u2019s zoning by-law which, nevertheless, provides that a \u201cmunicipal use\u201d may be authorized in a residential district upon approval by the town\u2019s board of appeals (Board). The plaintiffs applied for a special permit under the section so providing. The Board ruled that it could not act on the application because the contemplated use was not a \u201cmu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>nicipal use.\u201d This bill in equity (G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21), seeking review of the board\u2019s action, was reported without decision by the Superior Court judge. The sole question is whether the use of land for a United States post office is a \u201cmunicipal use\u201d within the intent of this zoning by-law. Put another way, we must decide whether \u201cmunicipal\u201d carries a connotation of \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cgovernmental\u201d (in a broader sense) as opposed to \u201clocal,\u201d the interpretation made by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">There is authority for the widened interpretation of \u201cmunicipal\u201d for which the plaintiffs contend. Certain dictionary definitions describe its meaning as being local as distinguished from national or State, or domestic as distinguished from international. Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary (Rawle\u2019s 3d Revision). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed.). Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary (1961). Some cases in other jurisdictions have also read \u201cmunicipal\u201d as \u201cpublic.\u201d See <em>Louisville </em>v. <em>Babb, </em>75 F. 2d 162 (7th Cir. 1935); <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Port of Portland, </em>20 Ore. 580; <em>Holbein </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>189 So. 2d 797 (Fla.). Contrary interpretations have been made. <em>Treasure Island </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>174 So. 2d 756 (Fla.).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The Board has properly invited our attention to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 2, G. L. c. 40D, \u00a7 1 (o), G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L, and G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 1 (f), all of which make some distinction between \u201cmunicipal\u201d and \u201cpublic,\u201d a distinction made quite clearly in G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 14, authorizing eminent domain takings by local governments of lands \u201cnot already appropriated to <em>public </em>use, for any <em>municipal </em>purpose ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). Such Massachusetts cases as there are also are consistent with the narrower reading of \u201cmunicipal.\u201d See <em>N. Ward Co. </em>v. <em>Street Commrs. of Boston, </em>217 Mass. 381, 384; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>272 Mass. 161, 163. See also <em>Pendergast </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>331 Mass. 555, 557 (\u201cZoning has always been treated as a local matter. The creation and modification of zones are matters of municipal legislation.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">We think that this town by-law should be viewed as employing \u201cmunicipal\u201d in its usual sense, i.e.^as applying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>local matters relating to the cities and towns of the Commonwealth. No indication of any wider meaning appears. It would have been easy and natural for the framers of the by-law to use broader terms if a wider meaning had been intended. A decree shall be entered affirming the ruling of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
