L. c. 231 A. The record on which we act puts the problem as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The bill alleges that bids were solicited by the trustees of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) for the purchase or other disposition of land in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and that the plaintiff submitted a bid for a fifty year lease on certain terms. The defendants, directly or through a nominee, submitted two bids to purchase the premises, one of which was accepted, to which action the plaintiff objected on the ground that his bid was more favorable to the MTA. Negotiations then commenced between the parties in this suit and after a year, on or about June 5, 1964, two written agreements were entered into, one being a \u201cCommission Agreement\u201d between one of the defendants, Supreme Markets, Inc. (by Paul J. Cifrino), and the plaintiff. This agreement, on the terms of which there is no debate, provided, inter alla, that the plaintiff\u2019s services would be retained for a stated fee in connection with the development of a shopping center project if the defendants\u2019 bid for the premises was accepted. The bill further alleges that a second agreement, \u201cSharing Agreement,\u201d was also concluded on the basis of a letter dated June 5, 1964,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> forwarded to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>plaintiff by the defendant Paul J. Cifrino, the receipt of which caused the plaintiff by letter dated June 9, 1964, to the MTA to \u201cwithdraw\u201d from the position he took concerning his bid for a lease on the MTA premises, which were subsequently conveyed to the defendant trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The defendants admit the withdrawal of the plaintiff from his position that he was the high bidder for the premises but claim he withdrew on the basis of the execution of the \u201cCommission Agreement\u201d and that, in any event, his claim had no status since he had been advised in writing by the MTA on April 10,1964, that the property was not advertised for lease but for sale and could not have been leased under relevant statutes pertaining to the advertisement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In general, the defendants\u2019 claim is that relative to the \u201cSharing Agreement\u201d no contract existed, and if one did it was too vague, uncertain and indefinite to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">1. We deal first with the plaintiff\u2019s statement of his intention to prove the validity of his claim that he was the highest bidder for the property and that he withdrew this claim \u201csolely in consideration of and in reliance on the \u2018 Sharing Agreement.\u2019 \u201d \u201c It is well settled that the abandonment of a claim believed to be well founded and made in good faith and \u2018not frivolous, vexatious or unlawful, although not of such character in law or fact or both as finally to commend itself to the judgment of the tribunal of last resort, is the surrender of a thing of value and is a sufficient, consideration for a contract.\u2019 <em>Codman </em>v. <em>Dumaine, </em>249 Mass. 451, 457-458.\u201d <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Gilchrist Co. </em>301 Mass. 386, 390. <em>Melotte </em>v. <em>Tucci, </em>319 Mass. 490, 492. That the MTA had advised the plaintiff it did not recognize his position would not of itself weaken his assertion of consideration. However, it appears weakened by the \u201cCommission Agreement\u201d in which it was provided in behalf of one of the defendants, Supreme Markets, Inc., \u201cThis agreement will not take effect and will be cancelled if we are not awarded the development of the Fields Corner Center,\u201d an event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>which took place. Not only had the plaintiff agreed to this but he had, when he brought his bill, received sizable sums of money under the terms of the \u201cCommission Agreement.\u201d He was not thus in a posture to maintain with propriety the validity of his claim against the MTA and his determination not to press it as consideration for the \u201cSharing Agreement,\u201d for he had already surrendered it and could not bring it to bear on the \u201cSharing Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">2. We thus move to consideration of the question whether the contents of the letter dated June 5, 1964, are sufficient to support an action of contract. Much depends on whether we view this letter as complete in itself or whether it is rather an important opening phase of what might develop into protracted negotiations. The \u201cSharing Agreement\u201d is concerned with the long range development of a shopping center. The parties were responsible and experienced persons with evident knowledge of what that entailed and with the host of details to be covered in any writing which might eventually reflect their complete understandings and respective undertakings. The letter sets out that it \u201cis intended\u201d to outline the commitment which the defendant Paul J. Cifrino was willing to make. It left to be worked out \u201cthe most feasible method of making payment\u201d of certain moneys to be earned by the plaintiff. The final sentence was, \u201cNaturally we can work up something more legal than this letter.\u201d The plaintiff was to commence sharing in the development \u201c20 years from opening,\u201d a date not otherwise defined. As the defendants have pointed out, \u201cthe 20 year amortization factor\u201d to be deducted from \u201cgross rental\u201d was mentioned with no more definite statement of how and from what base amortization would be figured. The letter was silent on a large number of other items which are routinely covered in contracts of the length and complexity of that upon which the parties were to embark. Without further discussion of them, it is our view that the letter was too indefinite to be enforced as an agreement. The parties on the exchange of the letter were in the state of \u201cimperfect negotiation.\u201d <em>Rosenfield </em>v. <em>United States Trust Co. </em>290 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>210, 217. <em>Saxon Theatre Corp. of Boston </em>v. <em>Sage, </em>347 Mass. 662, 666. See <em>Geo. W. Wilcox Inc. </em>v. <em>Shell Eastern Petroleum Prod. Inc. </em>283 Mass. 383. That the plaintiff so regarded the letter is discoverable in a letter which he dispatched to the defendant Paul J. Cifrino under date of June 9, 1964, in which he returned \u201cthe signed duplicate copy of the letter agreement between us dated June 5, 1964 (\u201cThe Commission Agreement\u201d), and stated in addition, \u201cI also acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 5, 1964, concerning the basis of our additional agreement which is to be formalized at a later date.\u201d <em>Drummond </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>159 Mass. 577, cited to us by the plaintiff, rests on a distinctly different set of facts. There the terms of the agreement had been well rounded out and the formal agreement, as Mr. Justice Holmes so aptly characterized it, remained to be executed as a mere \u201cadditional wheel in the machinery.\u201d P. 579. In this case the machine was lacking some of its most vital parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\">3. We thus conclude that the judge was not in error in decreeing that the letter of June 5, 1964, dealing with the \u201cSharing Agreement\u201d did not constitute a contract and was not contractually binding on the defendants, and that also, for the reasons assigned above, it was too vague, indefinite, and uncertain to be enforced as a contract. Each final decree is modified by striking out paragraph 5 dismissing the bill, and as so modified is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-5\"> \u201cJune 5, 1964</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Paul O.
