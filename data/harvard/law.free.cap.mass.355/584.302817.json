The board held that Knoll-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>wood was exempt from taxation under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twelfth. The Sharon assessors appealed. The facts, except as otherwise indicated, are stated on the basis of the board\u2019s findings and report, made at the request of the Sharon assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">By St. 1898, c. 207 (later amended in respects not here material by St. 1901, c. 183, \u00a7 1), Knollwood was created \u201cfor the purpose of purchasing, holding, managing and perpetuating a place for the burial of the dead\u201d in Sharon and Canton, subject to the approval of a majority of the voters of each town. Knollwood (\u00a71) was to \u201chave all the powers and privileges and be subject to all the duties . . . contained in all general laws . . . now . . . or . . . hereafter ... in force relating to such corporations.\u201d It was expressly authorized (\u00a7 3) to purchase land<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a cemetery in the manner in which Knollwood later did buy its land. The voters in each town gave consent in April, 1898.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">By recorded agreement (the Cameron agreement) dated May 27,1898, Knollwood undertook to acquire from John J. Cameron, acting for himself and several associates, land in Sharon and Canton. This agreement is summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>From the time of Knollwood\u2019s incorporation, it engaged in \u201cactivity ... to prepare the land for burial purposes.\u201d In 1901, \u201cconsecration exercises were held on the cemetery grounds ... to dedicate the property for burial purposes.\u201d The assessors concede that between 1898 and 1948, 9.78 acres south of Canton Street, Sharon, had been prepared for use for burial and that eighteen bodies had been interred north of Canton Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">\u201cAround 1907 . . . [Knollwood^ ran into financial trouble and required reorganization and refinancing.\u201d It continued, however, \u201cto operate exclusively for the burial of the dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The entire cemetery has been laid out by sections on paper since 1899. Some of the early roads in undeveloped areas \u201cwere crude\u201d and still remain so. \u201cA unified grid system is used by which all of the land can be identified.\u201d Knollwood has expended substantial sums in development \u201cas the need for lots arises\u201d and funds from sales are received. Between 1948 and 1965 Knollwood sold 42,566 burial spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Actual interments have been made in both Sharon and Canton. The property was not taxed by either town prior to 1962 when Sharon first levied a tax. Canton first taxed cemetery property in 1964. The Sharon assessors \u201cconsidered as exempt . . . the actual burial ground, land prepared for burials which had paved roads, and also a strip of land 150 feet wide adjoining the described area.\u201d The rest of the land, they considered undeveloped and treated it as not dedicated to the burial of the dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In Sharon, Knollwood owns about 199 acres. From 1962 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>through 1964, Sharon taxed eighty-five acres of land and a half-acre parcel containing a new administration building. In 1965 the Sharon assessors reduced the taxed land area from 85 to 78.5 acres <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>and also taxed the new administration building and the one-acre nursery for trees and shrubbery raised for transplanting to other parts of the cemetery.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Some undeveloped land cannot be used for underground burial. Knollwood on these areas proposes to build mausoleums which will house caskets for aboveground burial. It plans to use all undeveloped land only for burial purposes and estimates that it will take sixty years to fill the cemetery. There remain about 145,000 individual lots which can be developed as need arises. Knollwood does not have funds to develop the whole unused acreage now. No activity other than the operation of a cemetery has been conducted on Knollwood\u2019s land.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The board concluded that all Knollwood\u2019s property is dedicated to the burial of the dead. It recognized that Knollwood\u2019s land \u201cwill not be [fully used] for approximately sixty years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">1. General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 5, reads: \u201cThe following property shall be exempt from taxation . . . Twelfth, Cemeteries, tombs and rights of burial, so long as dedicated to the burial of the dead.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This exemption has existed at least since St. 1841, c. 114, \u00a7 7. See <em>Milford </em>v. <em>County Commrs. of Worcester, </em>213 Mass. 162, 166; Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts (3d ed.) 247-248. In the <em>Milford </em>case, this was described (p. 167) as a \u201cspecial and limited exemption confined to land devoted to cemeteries.\u201d It was held (pp. 165-166) that such corporations were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>exempt under the general charitable organizations exemption now found in c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>260 Mass. 129, 132-134; <em>Proprietors of the Cemetery of Mt. Auburn </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commn. 305 </em>Mass. 288, 293-297.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The assessors place great emphasis upon <em>Woodlawn Cemetery </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>118 Mass. 354. In that- case, an existing cemetery corporation (p. 356) proposed to buy an adjacent farm for cemetery purposes. The town declined to vote consent to the use of the land for burial purposes. The corporation proceeded to purchase the property and voted that it \u201cdedicate\u201d the land \u201cto the purposes of a cemetery.\u201d It notified the town of its action. The town proceeded to tax the land. The only use (p. 357) of the land for cemetery purposes was the occupation of a house by the cemetery gardener, the storage of cemetery supplies, and the conduct of a hothouse and an evergreen nursery, but (pp. 357, 362) <em>\u201cno part </em>of this land . . . [had] been used ... for burials, or divided off or laid out into lots or permanent avenues, [n]or [had] any attempt been made to sell... for purposes of burial\u201d (emphasis supplied). This court held (p. 363) that the purchased land was not exempt. Chief Justice Gray said (p. 361): \u201cNo land can be deemed to be \u2018dedicated for . . . a . . burial place ... so as to be exempt from taxation, or \u2018used or appropriated for ... a burial ground, so as to entitle the owner to use it for that purpose for the future without municipal permission, which has not been devoted <em>or set apart, </em>and <em>some active measures taken </em>toward preparing the ground, for a burial place. A mere dedication or appropriation on paper is not enough\u201d (emphasis supplied). It was held (p. 362) that the minor use of the purchased land for activities incidental to a cemetery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>did not constitute \u201cdedication of such land ... for ... a . . . burial place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The <em>Woodlawn </em>case is not controlling. From shortly after Knollwood\u2019s incorporation, the Emits of the land acquired by it for cemetery purposes have been known. The board\u2019s findings show that there were in the early years some development and use for burials of the land acquired in 1898. Very considerable development and use of large parts of the land for burials have taken place since. The sale of 42,566 burial lots in a seventeen year period alone is ample indication of \u201cactive measures\u201d taken well before 1962, directed to use of the land for burials, totally lacking with respect to the purchased land considered in the <em>Woodlawn </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Chapter 59, \u00a7 5, Twelfth, cannot reasonably be interpreted as requiring that, to qualify for exemption, <em>all </em>land acquired (with municipal consent) for burial purposes must be developed at one time. It must be expected that a cemetery corporation, in making land purchases, will anticipate its future needs for a period of time and that it will prudently develop its property in an orderly fashion as the need for doing so arises. We think that the planning and substantial actual use of parts of a defined area of land for cemetery purposes may properly be found, within the meaning of c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twelfth, to constitute a dedication of the whole of that land to cemetery use, in circumstances such as appear in the present case. We perceive nothing to the contrary in <em>Trefry </em>v. <em>Younger, </em>226 Mass. 5, 8, or in <em>Proprietors of the Cemetery of Mt. Auburn </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>150 Mass. 12, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The assessors somewhat vaguely contend that to have a dedication of land to cemetery purposes, there must exist no Ekelihood that the land wiE be used for other purposes by reason of a future sale of unused land by the cemetery corporation. It is suggested (see <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>Boston Catholic Cemetery </em>Assn. 146 Mass. 163,166; <em>Garden Cemetery Corp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>218 Mass. 339, 343) that Knollwood may apprppriate or sell its land for general purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The board was warranted in finding that Knollwood has used its property, and plans to use it, \u201cfor burial purposes only.\u201d The Cameron agreement (see fn. 3), unless amended, in effect restricts use to cemetery purposes. We assume that, after appropriate corporate action and obtaining consent of the shareholder successors to the vendors, Knollwood may sell for general use parts of its land not theretofore used for burials. Nevertheless, we think that Knoll wood\u2019s substantial use of the land for burials has been sufficient within the meaning of c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twelfth, to constitute dedication of all the land acquired in 1898 to cemetery use and to give rise to its exemption \u201cso long as [(the land is] dedicated to the burial of the dead.\u201d This language of clause Twelfth indicates to us that the statute, as a basis of exemption, looks to the situation at the time of assessment despite the possibility of future change. Similar considerations apply to buildings on the cemetery land and a tree nursery used in, and necessary for, administration and operation of the cemetery.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">2. The assessors contend that the board did not make adequate subsidiary findings to support its decisions and that some of its findings were not warranted. Examination of the testimony and exhibits convinces us that the board\u2019s findings, already summarized, were adequate and were warranted by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The first finding criticised by the assessors (that Knoll-wood \u201cmay not sell its land\u201d) in context merely purports to describe the Cameron agreement (fn. 3). It is irrelevant, as has been indicated, that the possibility exists that hereafter some parts of the land, in probably unlikely circumstances, may be used for general purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">A second finding, said to be unwarranted, is that from its incorporation Knollwood \u201cengaged in [(activity] to prepare the land for burial purposes.\u201d Read with later detailed findings, this finding reasonably reflects the evidence. Prior to 1948, the efforts (irrelevant now because long prior to the years of the taxes under discussion) to promote use of the cemetery were plainly more sporadic and less effective than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>after 1948, when substantial activity began under new management. The testimony concerning activity after 1948 amply supports the board\u2019s findings about the use of the land in the years for which taxes have been assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The assessors also suggest that the board had insufficient basis for concluding that Knollwood \u201chas adhered to the requirements of . . . statutes concerning cemeteries.\u201d There was testimony that no approval by the Sharon board of health was sought for development after 1948 of certain portions of Knollwood\u2019s land. The assessors contend that failure to seek such approval was a violation of G. L. c. 114, \u00a7 34, requiring it for use of \u201cland, <em>other than that already . . </em>. used or appropriated\u201d (emphasis supplied) for cemetery purposes. This requirement of approval was enacted by St. 1908, c. 379, \u00a7 1, ten years after Knollwood had acquired its land in 1898 and had taken significant action to dedicate some portions of it to burial use. Not only does Knollwood seem within the quoted exclusion from the operation of \u00a7 34 of land already appropriated to cemetery use, but also nothing in c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twelfth, makes exemption depend upon compliance with \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">3. The assessors contend that the board erroneously admitted testimony and exhibits concerning Knollwood\u2019s early history and sales efforts and its plans for the future. This evidence was relevant in applying the principles of our decisions concerning dedication of real estate to cemetery use, and in explaining the purpose of Knollwood\u2019s past and current activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">4. The board did not err in denying two requests by the assessors for rulings. The first request argued stated that Knollwood \u201cis a private cemetery corporation operated as a business enterprise for profit.\u201d The ruling, in any event, is irrelevant. Exemption under c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twelfth, is granted to a cemetery \u201cso long as dedicated to the burial of the dead.\u201d Whether it makes a profit is immaterial. The second request argued has been discussed already. Even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Knollwood has not complied with G. L. c. 114, \u00a7 34, this does not bar tax exemption under clause Twelfth.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">5. The decisions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Appellate Tax Board are affirmed. Knollwood is to have costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\"> Statute 1898, c. 207, \u00a7 3, provides that Knollwood \u201cmay agree with . . . persons from whom any lands are purchased ... to pay therefor a specified share not exceeding one half of the proceeds of all sales of the use of lots . . . and such share shall be first applied to the payment of such purchase money, and the residue thereof shall be applied to the preservation, improvement and embellishment of the cemetery grounds and to . . . expenses of the association. . . .
