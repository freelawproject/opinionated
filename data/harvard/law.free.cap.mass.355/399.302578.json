An order for judgment was entered dismissing the petition. The petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">In 1964 the petitioner was convicted of operating a motor vehicle without authority after his right to operate had been suspended, and was sentenced to a term of from two and one-half to five years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole. On November 19, 1967, he escaped from the Warwick Prison Camp to which he had been transferred. After he was apprehended, he was tried and convicted in 1968 of the crime of escape and was sentenced to an additional term of six months. As a result of the escape, the Commonwealth forfeited all of his good conduct deductions in relation to the 1964 sentence under the provisions of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 83B. The parties agree that if these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>good, conduct deductions were improperly forfeited, the petitioner would be entitled to an immediate release.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 83B, as amended through St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 47, reads in part, \u201cIf a prisoner escapes or attempts to escape from a prison camp all deductions from the sentence he is then serving shall be thereby forfeited.\u201d The petitioner argues that this provision conflicts with the more recently amended G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129, and therefore has been impliedly repealed. The principle of implied repeal \u201cis one which the court, in deference to the Legislature, does not regard with favor and applies with caution .... The test of the applicability of the principle of implied repeal is whether the prior statute is so repugnant to and inconsistent with the later enactment covering the subject matter that both cannot stand.\u201d <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Admn. </em>349 Mass. 687, 690. There is no such repugnancy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 129, was amended by St. 1963. c. 535, to provide that if \u201cduring the term of imprisonment of a prisoner confined in a correctional institution of the commonwealth, such prisoner shall commit any offense of which he shall be convicted and sentenced, he shall not be entitled to any deductions hereunder from the new sentence or sentences of imprisonment.\u201d Prior to this amendment \u00a7 129 required that the good conduct deductions be forfeited for the former, rather than the \u201cnew\u201d or subsequent, sentence. We are of opinion that \u00a7 129, as amended, does not so conflict with \u00a7 83B as to repeal it. The statutes, although overlapping in some respects, have separate functions which are not inconsistent. Section 83B punishes only escapes or attempted escapes, operates only with respect to sentences being served at the time of the escape, and applies only to inmates of prison camps. In contrast, \u00a7 129 punishes any offence by the prisoner for which a conviction later is secured, operates only with respect to future sentences, and applies to prisoners in all correctional institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\n<em>Order dismissing petition affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
