L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, from a decision of the board of appeal of the city of Chelsea (board) sustaining the building inspector\u2019s denial of a building permit. Both parties appealed from a final decree upholding the decision of the board. The judge filed \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order\u201d and the evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>We summarize the pertinent findings of the judge. Early in 1966, Joseph Barbato, Jr., entered into an oral agreement to purchase three adjacent vacant lots located within a residence B district in Chelsea. In 1949, the then owner of the lots had been granted a variance \u201cfor the purpose of erecting a building on said land to be used as <em>\u2018a </em>mechanical shop/ subject to . . . [certain] restrictions.\u201d On February 28, 1966, Barbato filed an application for a permit to build a one story concrete garage on the lots to house three ten-wheel dump trucks, a pickup truck and a backhoe. Necessary repairs of the equipment were to be made in the proposed building. Apart from the use to which the building would be put, it complied with the restrictions set forth in the 1949 variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The building inspector denied the permit \u201con the advice of the City Solicitor\u201d and Barbato appealed to the board. The board unanimously sustained the building inspector's denial. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal to the board, but prior to the board's decision, Barbato and his wife acquired title to the three lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Barbato contends that the proposed building constitutes a \u201ccommunity garage.\u201d A community garage, which is defined in the zoning ordinance as a \u201cgroup of private garages not more than one story in height, having a capacity of not more than ten automobiles, arranged in a row or surrounding a common means of access,\u201d is a permitted residence B district use, <em>\u201cprovided that no business or industry may be conducted </em>therein\u201d (emphasis supplied). Barbato argues that \u201cautomobile\u201d is a \u201cgeneric term covering both trucks and passenger cars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We do not think that the term \u201cautomobile\u201d as used in the zoning ordinance includes ten-wheel dump trucks or backhoes, or that the term \u201ccommunity garage\u201d includes a building for the storage and repair of such equipment. Admittedly one provision of the zoning ordinance specifically limits garages to \u201cpassenger automobiles.\u201d However, another provision permits \u201c[a] garage for not more than two automobiles\u201d as an accessory use in a residence A dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>trict. The community garage permitted in a residence B district is analogous to the accessory garage allowed in a residence A district. While not specifically limited to \u201cpassenger automobiles,\u201d both structures are limited to the parking of motor vehicles one would normally use as family or pleasure vehicles and would have at one\u2019s place of residence. See <em>Building Inspector of Falmouth </em>v. <em>Gingrass, </em>338 Mass. 274, 275. In addition, we note that the zoning ordinance provides that \u201cno business or industry may be conducted\u201d in a community garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Barbato also contends that the proposed building is within the variance granted in 1949 for the erection of a \u201cmechanical shop.\u201d We do not agree. We do not believe that when the variance was granted for the erection of a \u201cmechanical shop\u201d it was intended to be used for the storage and repair of heavy construction equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Barbato \u201cadmits that his application for a permit and his appeal . . . did not involve an accessory building.\u201d As the proposed building is within neither the uses permitted by the zoning ordinance nor the use permitted by the variance, we see no need to consider any of the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
