At the conclusion of the evi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>deuce the judge allowed motions for directed verdicts for the defendant. The cases are here on the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the allowance of those motions and also to the exclusion from evidence of a certain document.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We state the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff. Miss Margaret V. Burns had a savings account with the defendant bank. On April 2, 7, 13, 17 and 24, 1964, withdrawals totaling $4,100 were made from her account. On none of these occasions did Miss Burns appear at the bank. Instead, on each occasion a man who represented himself to be one William E. Shanahan, Jr. presented to a teller at the bank Miss Burns\u2019s passbook and a \u201cwithdrawal order\u201d naming William E. Shanahan, Jr. as payee and \u201csigned\u201d by Margaret V. Burns. A teller named Ferguson handled the withdrawals on April 2, 7, 13 and 17. On April 24 another teller, William Ley, handled the withdrawal. On that occasion the payee identified himself as William E. Shanahan, Jr. by means of a Massachusetts operator\u2019s license issued in that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On July 21, 1964, the bank was notified by Miss Burns\u2019s conservator that the withdrawals made during April were \u201cunauthorized.\u201d The same day a detective from the Boston police department appeared at the bank and talked with the bank\u2019s treasurer and Ley. Ley gave the detective a description of the man who presented the withdrawal order on April 24. Sometime between July 21, 1964, and October, 1964, the bank\u2019s treasurer found the check that had been given to the person making the April 2, 1964, withdrawal. It had been drawn on The First National Bank of Boston and had been \u201cendorsed\u201d by William E. Shanahan, Jr. On the back of the cancelled check was the number of a Massachusetts operator\u2019s license. It was the same as the number Ley had recorded at the time of the April 24 withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">In October, 1964, Ley learned that the detective had discussed the withdrawals with Miss Burns\u2019s conservator and that the conservator had said that the description Ley had given \u201ceither fitted a grandson, godson, or nephew of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Miss Burns.\u201d On December <em>2, </em>1964, the detective returned to the bank, and the bank\u2019s treasurer, after discussing the withdrawals with the detective, gave Ley permission to accompany the detective \u201con business which concerned\u201d the bank. The detective and Ley went to the plaintiff\u2019s home in Weymouth. When they found no one there, they went to the home of William E. Shanahan, Jr., also in Weymouth. There they were given \u201cinformation as to Mr. Shanahan\u2019s whereabouts.\u201d They then returned to the plaintiff\u2019s home, but were refused admission unless a member of the Weymouth police department was present. When they returned with a member of the Weymouth police department, they were admitted by the plaintiff. The detective informed the plaintiff of the general purpose of the visit, but Ley was not identified as a teller at the bank. During the thirty to forty-five minutes the detective and Ley were in the plaintiff\u2019s home, Ley \u201csat there and did nothing.\u201d He \u201ctook no part in the conversation.\u201d Upon leaving the plaintiff\u2019s home, Ley informed the detective that the plaintiff was the man who had represented himself to be William E. Shanahan, Jr. on April 24, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">No further attempt was made to locate William E. Shanahan, Jr. The detective and Ley went directly to the Municipal Court of the Roxbury District and obtained complaints charging the plaintiff with forgery, uttering and larceny on April 2, 1964, and with forgery and larceny on April 24, 1964. Ley signed both complaints as the complainant. The grand jury returned a \u201cno bill\u201d on the counts arising from the April 2 withdrawal and indicted the plaintiff on the counts arising from the April 24 withdrawal. The plaintiff was tried in a jury waived session of the Superior Court and was found \u201cnot guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Neither the bank\u2019s treasurer nor Ley had any doubts concerning the signatures on the withdrawal orders or the cancelled check. The treasurer\u2019s belief concerning the validity of Miss Burns\u2019s signatures was based entirely on what he had been told by her conservator. The plaintiff is the godson of Miss Burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>1. The defendant contends that the plaintiff \u201chas totally failed to sustain the burden of proving\u201d that it instituted the criminal proceedings against him. It asserts that there is no evidence that Ley was authorized to identify the plaintiff or to sign the complaints. It argues that under <em>White </em>v. <em>Apsley Rubber Co. </em>194 Mass. 97, authority \u201ccannot even be inferred\u201d because it had \u201cno knowledge of Ley\u2019s going to Weymouth to identify the plaintiff and later of signing the criminal complaints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We think that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that Ley had authority to act on behalf of the defendant. The bank\u2019s treasurer was aware of the unauthorized withdrawals. On at least three occasions he talked with Ley and the detective \u201cabout the account of Margaret V. Burns.\u201d During these conversations they \u201cdiscussed forgeries and larceny.\u201d He gave Ley permission to accompany the detective knowing that they \u201cwere going on business which concerned the . . . [bank and] that there was talk about a prosecution to be initiated.\u201d He knew that Ley and the detective \u201cwere going to the Roxbury Court.\u201d This is not a case where the plaintiff introduced evidence only of an employer-employee relationship and relied entirely upon the \u201costensible scope\u201d of the employee\u2019s authority. See <em>Henriques </em>v. <em>Franklin Motor Car Co. </em>260 Mass. 518. We are of opinion that the jury could have found that the defendant had given Ley authority to sign the complaints on its behalf. <em>White </em>v. <em>Apsley Rubber Co. </em>194 Mass. 97, 99-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">2. The defendant also contends that \u201cthe plaintiff has failed to show that the original prosecution was instituted without probable cause and that it was done maliciously.\u201d It asserts that \u201c[t]he basis of the prosecution of the plaintiff ... is the memory of . . . Ley ... as [to] the man who presented himself ... to make [the] unauthorized withdrawals\u201d and that \u201cthere is no evidence that casts doubt on Ley\u2019s power of observation or evidence that would indicate his motives to be other than honest.\u201d It argues that Ley did not \u201crashly\u201d accuse the plaintiff, having con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>fronted both the plaintiff and the real William E. Shanahan, Jr. \u201cbefore any criminal prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">However, these contentions ignore evidence to the contrary. The jury could find that, although Ley may have seen Shanahan in court prior to the trial, he did not \u201cconfront\u201d him prior to signing the criminal complaints. In an action for maliciou's prosecution, criminal proceedings are considered to have been commenced when the complaints are signed. It is then that the defendant in the action must have \u201ca state of facts in . . . |~his] mind ... as would lead a man of ordinary caution and prudence to believe, or entertain an honest and strong suspicion, that the person arrested is guilty.\u201d <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Towne, </em>4 Cush. 217, 238-239. <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>316 Mass. 700, 709. In response to written interrogatories the bank\u2019s treasurer stated that the bank \u201cat no time admitted that the withdrawals were based on forged signatures and made no claim that any criminal act was involved.\u201d He testified that he \u201cwasn\u2019t interested in finding out who had perpetrated these misdoings because the First National Bank guaranteed the signature of William E. Shanahan, Jr.\u201d The conservator\u2019s report that the withdrawals were \u201cunauthorized\u201d was ambiguous. Ley\u2019s identification was made seven months after he had handled a single bank transaction that lasted only a matter of minutes. It was made under circumstances which were less than ideal. We think that the jury could have found that the identification was so suspect that \u201ca man of ordinary caution and prudence\u201d would not have relied upon it. The plaintiff was entitled to have the case submitted to the jury in the action for malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">3. The plaintiff contends that Ley\u2019s visit to his residence to make the identification constituted a trespass. He argues that Ley entered for an \u201cunlawful purpose\u201d and that when he stayed for \u201cas long as forty-five minutes he became a trespasser, even if his entry in the first instant might have been lawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The plaintiff apparently contends that Ley was a trespasser ab initia. Ley was invited into the house. He did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>not enter under an authority or license given to him by law. See <em>Malcom </em>v. <em>Spoor, </em>12 Met. 279. The rule of the <em>Six Carpenters\u2019 Case, </em>8 Coke 146, is not applicable. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>110 Mass. 35, 38. The motion for a directed verdict was properly granted in the action for trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">4. The plaintiff also contends that the judge erred in excluding from evidence a certified copy of William E. Shanahan, Jr.'s application for a motor vehicle license. He argues that it was admissible under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30, because it \u201ctended to prove a vital factor in the plaintiff's case by showing the impossibility of the plaintiff being mistaken for William E. Shanahan, Jr.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 30, as amended through St. 1956, c. 351, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a] proper record of all applications . . . shall be kept by the registrar . . . [and] [certified copies of such records . . ,, attested by the registrar or his authorized agent, shall be admissible as evidence in any court of the commonwealth to prove the facts contained therein.\" The application in question contained a brief description of the physical characteristics of William E. Shanahan, Jr. It was admissible to prove the \u201cfacts contained therein\u201d that Shanahan was five feet, eight inches tall and twenty-seven years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">5. In the action for malicious prosecution the exceptions are sustained. In the action for trespass the exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
