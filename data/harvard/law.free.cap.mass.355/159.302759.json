L. c. 231A seeks to determine the time when a prison sentence imposed in the Superior Court \u201cwas to have become effective.\u201d The trial judge dismissed the bill \u201con the ground it was the intention of the judge to impose sentence from and after the 12-15 year sentence that . . . \u00a1The plaintiff] was serving.\u201d The case is here on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>On February 5, 1958, in the Superior Court for the county of Essex the plaintiff was sentenced to serve concurrently, three two and one-half to four year sentences. On April 16,</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">1958, in the Superior Court for the county of Barnstable he was sentenced to serve three to five years and twelve to fifteen years. This latter sentence was reduced to eight to twelve years. These sentences were to run concurrently \u201con and after sentence now being served.\u201d On May 14,</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">1959, in the Superior Court for the county of Worcester the plaintiff received five sentences of twelve to fifteen years. These sentences were to be served concurrently \u201cwith any sentence the . . . [plaintiff] may now be serving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">On June 29, 1959, in the Superior Court for the County of Middlesex the plaintiff received one nineteen to twenty year, two nine to ten year, and two four to five year sentences. These sentences were to be served concurrently and were \u201cto take effect from and after the expiration of the sentence now being served in the M.C.I. \u2014 Walpole.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time these latter sentences were imposed the plaintiff was serving the sentences imposed in Essfex County concurrent with those imposed in Worc\u00e9ster County.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The sole issue is whether the sentences imposed in Mid-dlesex County are to take effect upon the expiration of the longer or the shorter sentences of those previously imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The plaintiff argues that the \u201cMiddlesex sentence . . . does not with substantial certainty state when the sentence is to become effective.\u201d He contends that it is \u201cequally susceptible to interpretation that it is to take effect from and after the expiration of the [shorter] Essex sentence . . . as well as from and after the [longer] Worcester sentence . . ..\u201d Because of this the plaintiff maintains that \u201cthe Middlesex sentence ... is not susceptible of a reasonably certain starting date\u201d and that we should hold that the Middlesex sentences either \u201c . . . [came] into effect on the date . . . [they were] imposed\u201d or \u201ccommenced upon the expiration of the Essex sentence[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The fact that the judge used the singular word \u201csentence \u201d rather than the plural \u201csentences\u201d does not, in our opinion, create any ambiguity. The phrase, \u201cthe sentence now being served,\u201d reasonably construed, means \u201cthe sentences now being served.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In any event, while the plaintiff is technically serving more than one sentence, as a practical matter he is serving only one. When two or more sentences are to be served concurrently, the shorter ones are considered to be \u201cabsorbed\u201d within the longer sentence. Where a sentence is ordered to take effect \u201cfrom and after the expiration of a previous sentence,\u201d the \u201cprevious sentence\u201d is deemed to have expired when the prisoner serving it is released therefrom by parole or otherwise. G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 8A. Where the prisoner is serving concurrent sentences of different lengths, he is not released therefrom until the expiration of the longer sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 129, as amended by St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 66, provides in part that \u201c [i]f a prisoner has two or more sentences to be served concurrently or otherwise, the maximum period of time for which he may be held under his sentences shall be the basis upon which the deduction [from his sentence for good conduct] shall be determined . . ..\u201d The same deductions apply in computing the minimum term the plaintiff must serve for the purpose of determining when he will be eligible for parole. G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133, as amended through St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 69.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If we were to follow the plaintiff\u2019s theory, it would mean that, where concurrent sentences are imposed, the prisoner would receive the benefit of the longer sentence in computing the deductions, which would then be taken from the shorter sentence in order to determine his eligibility for parole. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>This, it seems clear to us, would be absurd and would defeat the very purpose of imposing concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The trial judge was not required to determine the intention of the judge who imposed the sentences. Whenever a sentence is ordered \u201cto take effect from and after the expiration\u201d of concurrent sentences, it takes effect from and after the expiration of the longer sentence. The plaintiff's exceptions are overruled and a final decree is to be entered dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\"> Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\"> We need only point to the frequent reference in the plaintiff\u2019s brief to the \u201cEssex sentence\u201d and the \u201cWorcester sentence\u201d to illustrate the use of the word \u201csentence\u201d where reference is in fact to two or more concurrent sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> Statute 1965, c. 764, \u00a7 1, amended \u00a7 133 by eliminating the provision allowing deductions for good conduct and substituting for it a provision allowing deductions for blood donations as provided in G.
