(Diocese), as representatives of all of the members of the Diocese, against the Diocese and four of its officers. The plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants \u201chave devised a scheme and entered into a conspiracy to perpetuate themselves in office, to deprive the plaintiffs and other regular members of the Diocese of the right to vote, Hand] to foist upon The Diocese as Bishop, the defendant, Stephen Lasko,\u201d all in derogation of the by-laws of the Diocese.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">The defendants appealed from an interlocutory decree overruling their demurrer to the bill and from a final decree determining which members of the Diocese are entitled to vote at its annual meeting and ordering the calling of a meeting of the Diocesan Council. The judge filed \u201cAmended Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Decree\u201d which he adopted as a report of material facts. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>We summarize the judge\u2019s findings. The Diocese is a religious corporation organized in 1956 under G. L. c. 180. Comprised of eleven churches located throughout the United States the Diocese serves \u201cpersons of Albanian descent or origin in the United States in their religious devotions in accordance with the Eastern Orthodox rites, customs, and traditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Four days after its organization, the Diocese \u201cacting through its members, duly adopted ... a code of by-laws.\u201d The by-laws extended regular membership in the Diocese to charter members, \u201cthe Bishop for the time being,\u201d present members and \u201cany Albanian or person of Albanian descent or origin or who has intermarried with an Albanian or person of Albanian descent or origin who is received and elected to membership.\u201d In order to \u201cqualify\u201d for regular membership, one has to subscribe to the by-laws and sign a membership roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The by-laws provide for the payment by regular members of annual dues. A member who is in arrears in the payment of these dues is \u201csubject to having his name stricken from the membership roll by the Diocesan Council.\u201d Notice is to be sent to members in arrears and \u201cif the arrears are not paid within thirty days after such notice is sent, the name of the member in arrears may be stricken from the roll.\u201d The membership roll is declared to be \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d of regular membership in the Diocese.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The governing structure provided by the by-laws for the operation of the Diocese consists of the bishop, the Diocesan Council of which the bishop is the chairman, an annual meeting of the regular members and an annual convention. The members of the Diocesan Council are the \u201cBishop or the time being, ... a Lay Vice-Chairman, a Clerical Secretary, a Lay Treasurer and a Lay Comptroller, four delegates elected by the [regular] members [at their annual meeting] and four delegates elected by the Convention, each clergyman . . . and each Chairman of the Board of Trustees of an affiliated church.\u201d They are to \u201chold office until their successors are duly elected as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>under the by-laws.\u201d Should the bishop be \u201cunable to act or officiate by reason of sickness, disability or other cause, the secretary of the Diocese shall be the acting Bishop until the selection of a succeeding Bishop by a special Convention to be called to select a permanent acting Bishop.\u201d At the annual convention held in 1959 the by-laws were amended to provide that \u201c <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [candidates for the Bishopric must be approved first by the Lay delegates of the Convention by a two-thirds (f) majority vote. The candidate (s) who receive the f vote of the lay delegates are then submitted to the convention of the Clergy who have the right to elect a bishop by two-thirds (|) majority vote. ... \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In addition to electing four members of the Diocesan Council, the regular members at their annual meeting elect four delegates to the annual convention. Both the annual meeting and convention are to be called by the Diocesan Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Bishop Fan S. Noli was the \u201chighest ranking officer\u201d of the Diocese at the time of its organization and retained that position until his death on March 13, 1965. At that time the defendant Sotir Dilogika was the secretary of the Diocese and became the \u201cacting bishop\u201d as provided by the by-laws. He called an \u201cextraordinary meeting\u201d of the Diocesan Council for March 17, 1965, to prepare plans for the official interment of Bishop Noli. The defendant Stephen Lasko, although a member of the council, did not attend this meeting as he was in Albania. Dilogika called another extraordinary meeting of the council for March 26, 1965, to hear a report of Lasko, who had returned from Albania. Lasko\u2019s report was that he had been consecrated a bishop while in Albania. Subsequent to this meeting the individual defendants formed an \u201cExecutive Committee\u201d and as such called an annual meeting of the regular members. One hundred and fifteen persons, including the plaintiffs, whose names \u201cwere never stricken from the membership roll by action of the diocesan council, and were at the time active regular members\u201d did not receive notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the meeting. There was no evidence that a special convention was called to select a \u201cpermanent acting bishop.\u201d The last annual meeting of the regular members was held in 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We proceed directly to the merits. <em>Walcott </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>351 Mass. 32, 33. <em>James J. Derba, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Serv. Inc. ante, </em>127.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">It is the law of this jurisdiction that the courts do not interfere in a controversy that is exclusively or primarily of an ecclesiastical nature. Where civil or property rights or the construction of legal instruments are involved, however, the courts have been \u201cless reluctant to interfere.\u201d <em>United Kosher Butchers Assn. </em>v. <em>Associated Synagogues of Greater Boston, Inc. </em>349 Mass. 595, 598. We perceive the dispute now before us not as one of church law (see <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Congregation Tiffereth Israel of Revere, </em>344 Mass. 755), but one of contract law (see <em>Kubilius </em>v. <em>Hawes Unitarian Congregational Church, </em>322 Mass. 638). We only interpret the by-laws of a Massachusetts corporation which constitute a contract between the members and the Diocese. <em>Kubilius </em>v. <em>Hawes Unitarian Congregational Church, supra, </em>at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The defendants contend that the bishop on whom great powers are bestowed by the by-laws is to be chosen according to \u201cCanon Law\u201d and not according to the by-laws. They argue that once a bishop has been consecrated there is no need to elect a \u201cpermanent acting Bishop\u201d as provided by the by-laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The question whether the defendant Lasko is a bishop in the Albanian Orthodox Church is not before us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question we are to answer is whether proper action has been taken under the by-laws. Members of the council are to \u201chold office until their successors are duly elected <em>as provided under the by-laws\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The by-laws provide for \u201cthe selection of a <em>succeeding </em>Bishop by a special Convention to be called to select a permanent acting Bishop\u201d (emphasis supplied). The amendment of 1959 provided for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the approval of candidates \u201cfor the Bishopric\u201d and for the election of \u201ca bishop.\u201d We do not think that one inconsistent phrase (\u201cpermanent acting\u201d) in a document which is \u201cwanting in clarity\u201d should be permitted to overshadow provisions clearly indicating that the successor to Bishop Noli is to be chosen as provided by the by-laws. The bylaws provide for the secretary of the Diocese to be the acting bishop until a successor is selected. We do not believe that such an elaborate procedure as the one provided for the election of a \u201cpermanent acting bishop \u201d was intended merely to select a temporary holder of the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The defendants do not challenge that part of the final decree determining which members are entitled to vote. They contest in only two respects that portion of the decree ordering the defendant Dilogika to call a meeting of the Diocesan Council. In light of the above discussion we need not consider the contention that the sole purpose of the meeting was to provide for the election of a bishop, and thus the order infringed on ecclesiastical matters. The next contention is that, since Dilogika resigned as secretary of the Diocese for reasons \u201cpersonally ecclesiastical,\u201d he is no longer acting bishop and cannot be required to perform the duties of that office. This, however, ignores certain essential facts. After the resignation Dilogika continued to act as secretary and called an \u201cextraordinary meeting\u201d on March 17, 1965. This meeting was attended by the defendants and certain actions were taken at that meeting. On March 24, 1965, Dilogika by telegram called for another \u201cextraordinary meeting\u201d to be held on March 26, 1965. This meeting also took place and was attended and participated in by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We are of opinion that the judge was correct in ordering Dilogika to call a meeting of the council. We have before us no question of church doctrine or departure from doctrine such as was considered recently in <em>Presbyterian Church in the United States </em>v. <em>Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Memorial Presbyterian </em>Church, 393 U. S. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\n<em>Decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\"> The plaintiffs in their brief state, \u201cWe are not primarily concerned with who is . . . the Bishop, nor are we concerned with whether . . . the defendant Lasko was ordained or consecrated a Bishop.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Kirk, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8i\">(dissenting) If the opinion did indeed \u201conly interpret the by-laws of a Massachusetts corporation which constitute a contract between the members and the Diocese,\u201d I would agree with it. But it does more. It orders the resigned secretary of the Diocese, an ordained clergyman, to comply with the court\u2019s interpretation of the by-laws. The resigned secretary, it appears, feels duty bound under Canon Law to recognize Stephen Lasko as Bishop. The court\u2019s order to the resigned secretary, it seems to me, (a) is an infringement of his right to be free from direction by civil authority as to how he should act on religious or ecclesiastical matters; and (b) constitutes interference in a controversy which is essentially ecclesiastical in nature. I think the court should stay away from it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
