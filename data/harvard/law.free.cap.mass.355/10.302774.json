L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, as amended, to review a decision of' the Commission Against Discrimination (the commission). Upon the record before the commission, it has been reported without decision by a judge of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Local Finance Company of Rockland (Finance) is a trust or voluntary association. See G. L. c. 182, as amended. It holds a license to make loans (see G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 96-114A, as amended) and maintains an office in Rockland, open during usual business hours to applicants for loans. Each applicant usually is interviewed by an employee of Finance and by him is assisted in filling out an application form.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The form contains three \u201cboxes\u201d marked, respectively, 1, 2, and 3. If the applicant is white, box 1 is checked; if the applicant is a Negro, box 2 is checked; and if the applicant is of Spanish ancestry, box 3 is checked. Finance\u2019s ledger cards contain similar boxes used for the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">The commission issued a complaint against Finance. It alleged \u201cdiscriminatory practices [on 15 April, 1964] in violation of\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98, as amended, by Finance, in that it maintained \u201can unlawful discriminatory policy of denying equal treatment in a place of public accommodation because of . . . [the] color ... of applicants for loan and in using a code to distinguish applicants by . . . color.\u201d Finance claimed by its answer before the commission that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>was not subject to \u00a7 98. It filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">On July 9, 1964, the commission conducted a hearing. Thereafter it made findings of the facts stated above concerning Finance and its practices. It found also (a) that \u201cthe information contained in the . . . boxes on . . . \u00a1[Finance\u2019s] application is a factor which is considered by . . . [Finance] in determining whether to grant ... a loan, white applicants being more favorably considered than are Negro or Spanish applicants,\u201d and (b) that on April 7, 1964, Finance\u2019s \u201cgeneral manager . . . refused to consider the application for a loan of a person solely because that person was not white.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The commission concluded (1) that Finance \u201cis a place of public accommodation within the meaning\u201d of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 92A and 98; (2) that Finance\u2019s use of the boxes \u201con its applications and ledger cards . . . constitutes a distinction on account of color ... in violation of\u201d \u00a7 98; (3) that \u201cgiving consideration to the color\u201d of the applicant constitutes discrimination; and (4) that Finance\u2019s refusal to consider an application on April 7, 1964, was a discrimination in violation of \u00a7 98. The commission\u2019s order required Finance to desist \u201cfrom considering the color ... of any applicant ... as a factor in determining whether to grant . . . a loan,\u201d from \u201crecording the color\u201d of any applicant, and from using forms designed to record the color of applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">1. Finance contends that its place of business is not a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d within \u00a7\u00a7 92A and 98.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>When \u00a7 92A was first enacted by St. 1933, c. 117, \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d was a narrowly defined term, restricted essentially to inns, eating and recreation facilities, conveyances, barber shops, and theatres. By St. 1953, c. 437, the scope of the term was materially broadened, especially by the inclusion of the words \u201cany place . . . which is open to and accepts or solicits the patronage of the general public \u201d (fn. 1, see italicized language in the quotation from \u00a7 92A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The italicized language (fn. 1) in \u00a7 92A, particularly when read in the light of the obviously broad legislative purpose, strongly indicates that the enumerated specific examples of \u201cplaces of public accommodation\u201d do not restrict the preceding general statutory language or provide a basis for applying the principle of ejusdem generis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In interpreting \u00a7 92A, no prior Massachusetts case is conclusive. See <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Rich\u2019s Grill, </em>216 Mass. 344, 347 (which refers to an earlier form of statute, found in St. 1895, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>e. 461, as prohibiting \"in the most comprehensive terms . . . any discrimination except for good cause, applicable alike to all persons of every color\u201d); <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Robert L. Kent, Inc. </em>341 Mass. 125, 126 (weight placed upon the circumstance that a dance studio \u201cwas a business operated for profit\u201d in holding it not within the exclusion of organizations operated for educational purposes, see fn. 1). See also <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Colangelo, </em>344 Mass. 387, 395-396.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In other jurisdictions, the current tendency of the decisions (although, of course, dealing with statutory language by no means uniform) is to give antidiscrimination statutes, generally comparable to \u00a7 92A, a broad, inclusive interpretation. The decisions place no undue emphasis on either the principle of ejusdem generis or the rule that penal statutes must be interpreted strictly. See <em>Amos </em>v. <em>Prom, Inc. </em>117 F. Supp. 615, 622-630 (N. D. Iowa); <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Poppy Constr. Co. </em>57 Cal. 2d 463, 468-470 (somewhat broader statutory language); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hara, </em>57 Cal. 2d 476, 478; <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Mandel\u2019s of Cal. </em>156 Cal. App. 2d 855, 856-857; <em>Darius </em>v. <em>Apostolos, </em>68 Colo. 323, 326-328; <em>Sellers </em>v. <em>Philip\u2019s Barber Shop, </em>46 N. J. 340, 344-348; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>57 N. J. Super. 223, 229-232; <em>Camp-of-the-Pines, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York Times Co. </em>184 Misc. (N. Y.) 389, 399-401 (Supr. Ct.); <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>York Studios, Inc. </em>208 Misc. (N. Y.) 888, 891-894 (Mun. Ct.); <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Harron, </em>380 Pa. 123, 126-127. We think that similar principles of interpretation may properly be applied to the general language of \u00a7 92A.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">A further contention by Finance must be considered. General Laws c. 15\u00cdB, \u00a7 4, as amended, makes it an unlawful practice<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to discriminate on grounds of color in issuing surety bonds (subsec. 3A, inserted by St. 1955, c. 274) or in granting mortgage loans (subsec. 3B, inserted by St. 1960, c. 163, \u00a7 2). Finance argues that these specific provisions in c. 151B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tend to restrict the general language of c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 92A and 98, since subsecs. 3A and 3B (fn. 4) would not have been necessary if \u00a7\u00a7 92A and 98 in fact covered the same area. This argument overlooks c. 151B, \u00a7 9 (most recently amended by St. 1965, c. 397, \u00a7 7), which provides that c. 151B \u201cshall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof\u201d and that nothing in c. 151B \u201cshall be deemed to repeal [c. 272, \u00a7 98] or any other law ; . . relating to discrimination because of . . . color.\u201d We perceive no indication of any legislative desire to have subsecs. 3A and 3B of c. 151B, \u00a7 4, limit c. 272, \u00a7 \u00a7 92A and 98. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In the circumstances, we interpret c. 272,.. \u00a7 92A, as amended, as including the business conducted by Finance within the term \u201cplace of public accommodation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">2. The commission was warranted by the evidence in finding the following facts. On the morning of April 7, 1964, John T. Murphy of the Seaview Garage in Marshfield called Finance\u2019s Rockland branch manager concerning a possible loan for one of Murphy\u2019s customers, Gracia, by name. . The branch manager inquired of Murphy whether the customer was \u201ca Code 2,\u201d that is a Negro, and told Murphy that \u201che would not accept any application from a Negro.\u201d That afternoon Murphy went to Finance\u2019s office, where the application form was explained to him. Finance\u2019s branch manager then said \u201che had Negro [application] files in his files enough so as ... no one could claim discrimination and they were all A-l credit risks,\u201d and also \u201cthat he had told other people that if they didn\u2019t like the way he did business they could take him to the\u201d commission. Later a commission field representative went to the Finance office where the use of the code was admitted and explained. The branch manager testified that Murphy\u2019s customer had the same or a similar name as \u201ca poor account, a colored per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>son\u201d in Finance\u2019s files, and that the code was used \u201cstrictly for identification purposes.\u201d The application form used by Finance showed the code \u201cboxes\u201d at the top of the front of the form. In the middle of the back of the form were spaces for recording such identification information as sex, social security number, driver\u2019s license number, employer\u2019s badge number, date of birth, union, and selective service data.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We think that this evidence was sufficiently substantial to permit the commission to conclude that the code \u201cboxes\u201d were used to record race and that Finance on at least one recent occasion had declined to consider a loan to a Negro on the ground of color. The commission reasonably, in the light of Murphy\u2019s testimony, could regard the concealment involved in Finance\u2019s use of a code as a suspicious circumstance, casting doubt on the truthfulness of its claim that it recorded color only for identification purposes. See Fuld, J. in <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>307 N. Y. 38, 45 (\u201cOne intent on violating the . . . \u00a1[antidiscrimination law] cannot be expected to . . . announce his purpose. Far more likely is it that he will pursue his discriminatory practices in ways that are devious, by methods subtle and elusive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">3. Finance does not appear to contend that the commission\u2019s order was in any respect inappropriate, if Finance was subject to \u00a7\u00a7 92A and 98. This slender record shows no occasion for modifying the remedial measures adopted by the commission in its discretion. See <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>307 N. Y. 38, 46. Cf. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Colangelo, </em>344 Mass. 387, 400-401, where it was noted that the order in that case seemed \u201cparticularly extreme in a case of first impression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">4. A decree, incorporating the substance of the commission\u2019s order and affirming it, is to be entered in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-8\"> General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 98 (as amended through St. 1963, c. 613, \u00a7 5; see St. 1950, c. 479, \u00a7 3), reads, in part: \u201cWhoever makes any . . . discrimination ... on account of . . . color . . . except for good cause applicable alike to all persons of every . . . color . . . relative <em>to </em>the admission of any person to, or his treatment in, any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement, as defined in . . .

All persons shall have the right to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike to all persons. This right is recognized and declared to be a civil right.\u201d In \u00a7 92A (as amended through St. 1953, c. 437), \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d is defined as including <em>\u201cany place, whether licensed or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>unlicensed, which is open to and accepts or solicits the patronage of the general public and, without limiting the generality of this definition, </em>whether or not it be (1) an inn . . . motel ... or resort for . . . patrons seeking housing or lodging, food, drink, entertainment, health, recreation or rest; (2) a carrier, conveyance or elevator for the transportation of persons . . . and the . . . facilities appurtenant thereto; (3) a gas station, garage, retail store or establishment, including those dispensing personal services; (4) a restaurant, bar or eating place . . . ; (5) a rest room, barber shop, beauty parlor, bathhouse, seashore facilities or swimming pool; (6) a boardwalk or other public highway; (7) an auditorium, theatre ... or hall . . . ; (8) a place of public amusement, recreation, sport, exercise or entertainment; (9) a public library, museum or planetarium; or (10) a hospital . . . operating for profit; provided, however, that no place shall be deemed to be a place of public accommodation . . . which is owned or operated by a club or institution whose . . . facilities . . . are available only to its members and their guests nor by any religious, racial or denominational institution . . . nor by any organization operated for charitable or educational purposes\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\"> The legislative history of the 1953 amendment shows little more than that it was intended to bring about an \u201cexpansion of the definition of a place of public accommodation.\u201d See title of 1953 House Bill No. 1967; 1953 Senate Bill No. 720; 1953 Senate Journal, pp. 845, 921.
