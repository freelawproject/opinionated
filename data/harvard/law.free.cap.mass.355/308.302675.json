The insurer does contend that there is no basis for the finding of total incapacity for the period from April 22, 1960, to April 5, 1966, and that the finding is based on incorrect subsidiary findings of what the physician had observed and reported in his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The single member\u2019s finding of total disability since April 22, 1960, was made on \u201cconsideration of all the testimony.\u201d We rule that there is adequate support in the testimony for the conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The employee, sixty-three years of age in 1966, testified that on March 21, 1960, his physician operated to fuse two discs in his spine. Since bis discharge from the hospital he has worn a canvas and steel brace twenty-four hours a day and he has not been able to do any work. He was willing to work and if he were able to it would be as a general electrician. He had not looked for work since 1960. He had made some improvement for \u201ca year or so, a year and a half\u201d after the operation but has been \u201cgoing down\u201d since. At the end of the year and one half, the pain started radiating down the leg again. This happened every day. He kept looking for a position to relieve the pain. At night he would get \u201cterrific cramps\u201d and would fall out of bed to reheve the pain. He had spasms every day sometimes \u201c2 or 3 or 12 times.\u201d It was \u201cat least 3 years [[prior to 1966] when . . . [he] first noticed\u201d the spasms. He suffers falls both indoors and outdoors. He takes walks every day, sometimes twice, \u201chalf a mile, or a mile, mile and a half sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The employee\u2019s wife testified that she first observed bis \u201cconstant pain\u201d about \u201ca year or so\u201d after the operation. He has \u201cappeared to be in pain continually.\u201d She has seen him fall half a dozen times or more. He walks about the house with his fists clenched. He used a cane for some months after he came home from the hospital in 1960, but stopped using it about the first of 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Dr. Warren H. Eddy testified that in his opinion, based on bis April 5, 1966, examination, the employee was totally and permanently disabled and that this was causally related to the compensable injury sustained on February 1, 1952. In the first part of 1961 Dr. Eddy did not feel that the employee could at that time try some light work. They talked about \u201csome light work in the future.\u201d The physician then wanted the employee to increase his activities by walking or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>bicycling. \u201cHowever, he seemed to reach a plateau at that time and he never really showed much improvement.\u201d He was not as good in 1966 as he was in 1961. Based on his report of July 26, 1962, the physician felt the employee could \u201cdo some lighter forms of work\u201d at that time but \u201che would not be able to do anything that would require a good deal of bending and lifting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">He thought in July, 1962, that the employee had a \u201cpermanent partial disability at that time and still felt encouraged he could do something.\u201d Asked when the permanent and total aspects appeared, he answered, \u201cI would think in the last year or year and a half . . . [it] has been quite noticeable that he would never be able to do anything again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The single member found that Dr. Eddy testified that the employee reached a plateau in March, 1961, and that from then on his condition continued to deteriorate and had worsened, and that he was totally disabled on April 5,1966, and had reached an end result. The single member erroneously attributed to Dr Eddy the testimony as to falls and the use of a cane. This is collateral to the main issue and does not invalidate the general finding. See <em>Wnukowski\u2019s </em>Case, 296 Mass. 63, 64-65. The single member did not attribute to Dr. Eddy a conclusion of total incapacity throughout the period.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The single member was entitled to give weight to the testimony of the employee and his wife as to the extent to which his affliction interfered with normal activity. The single member was not required to accept as conclusive the physician\u2019s feeling on July 26, 1962, that the employee could do some lighter forms of work. <em>Fiorentini\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 388, 389. The physician so testified as to suggest that in 1966 he regarded his 1962 views as tentative (\u201cI . . . still felt encouraged he could do something \u201d). The physician did not believe \u201cabout the first of 1961\u201d that the employee should then try working.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The single member could conclude that although the physician was encouraged by mid-1962 to believe that some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>light work could be possible, the afflictions were such as to make it very unlikely that this employee, trained as a general electrician, could find and keep employment. He could find that frequent disabling spasms began about 1963 and that there were recurrent falls and steady pain. \u201cIt is sufficient if the evidence shows that the employee\u2019s disability is such that it prevents him from performing remunerative work of a substantial and not merely trifling character, and regard must be had to the age, experience, training and capabilities of the employee.\u201d <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 635, 639. See <em>Paltsios\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 526, 528-529; <em>Khachadoorian\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 625, 629-631.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The decree of the Superior Court is affirmed. Costs of \u25a0appeal are to be determined and awarded by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
