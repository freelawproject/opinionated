At the conclusion of the evidence, the defendant requested a ruling \u201cthat the Court find as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>matter of law that the Commonwealth has not sustained the burden of proving the defendant guilty of the crime as charged.\u201d The judge denied the request, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, and the sole question is whether the request was properly denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The premises on which the alleged violation of the ordinance occurred were located in an area zoned as a \u201cResidence and Rural District\u201d (\u00a7 38-15). Among the uses permitted in such a district are \u201cfarms, market gardens, nurseries and greenhouses.\u201d Elsewhere in the ordinance (\u00a7 38-5) a farm is defined as \u201ca tract of land devoted to agricultural purposes, including the raising of domestic or other animals, and including the buildings accessory to such agricultural purposes and the dwelling of the farmer.\u201d Another part of the ordinance (\u00a7 38-7 [N3) provides that \u201cThe keeping of birds and animals is prohibited, except on farms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The defendant at the time of the alleged violation was the holder of a Mink Ranch Certificate issued by the Department of Agriculture under G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 105A, inserted by'St. 1950, c. 424, as amended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We are of opinion that mink are not included in the phrase, \u201cdomestic or other animals,\u201d and that the land was not \u201cdevoted to agricultural purposes.\u201d Accordingly the defendant\u2019s raising of mink was not a permitted use as a \u201cfarm\u201d under \u00a7 38-15 of the zoning ordinance. Mink are not domestic animals within the meaning of the ordinance since the word \u201cdomestic\u201d as applied to animals ordinarily carries the meaning of \u201ctamed, associated with family life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>accustomed to live in or near the habitations of men.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>285 Mass. 136, 139. See Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 506. Nor are the mink covered by the term, \u201cOther animals.\u201d We think that these words \u201cincluding the raising of domestic or other animals\u201d must be read with the words immediately preceding them, namely, \u201ca tract of land devoted to agricultural purposes.\u201d This strongly suggests that the term, \u201cother animals,\u201d refers only to those similar to domestic animals and of the sort commonly associated with agricultural pursuits. If the meaning of \u201cother animals\u201d were not thus restricted, land on which Hons, for example, were raised would be classified as a farm. We think that such an interpretation would be unreasonable. See <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>314 Mass. 16, and <em>Miodus-zewski </em>v. <em>Saugus, </em>337 Mass. 140, which held, respectively, that neither the raising of hogs nor the raising of greyhounds for racing purposes made the land a \u201cfarm.\u201d See also <em>Hume </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Westford, ante, </em>179.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In support of his argument that the raising of mink made his premises a \u201cfarm\u201d the defendant relies on the fact that he held a certificate under G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 105A, and hence the mink were \u201cdomesticated mink\u201d and he was engaged in \u201can agricultural pursuit.\u201d See fn. 2. The classification of mink and mink raising under \u00a7 105A is irrelevant to an interpretation of the zoning ordinance. A \u201cfarm\u201d under the ordinance must be determined in the context of the ordinance and not by a statute dealing with a different objective. See <em>Mioduszewski </em>v. <em>Saugus, supra, </em>145.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The defendant further contends that \u00a7 38-15 is unconstitutional on the ground of vagueness. But the defendant\u2019s request for ruling did not raise this question and it cannot be raised here for the first time. We, therefore, do not consider it. <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>Levenson, </em>334 Mass. 100, 107. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Allied Sports Associates, Inc. </em>349 Mass. 544, 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> In his brief the defendant argues that the Commonwealth failed to show that there was any criminal sanction contained in the ordinance and that therefore he had committed no crime. At the arguments this contention was waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\"> Section 105A provided for the licensing of mink ranches for the raising of \u201cdomesticated mink.\u201d \u201cDomesticated\u201d mink were defined as those that had been propagated in captivity for two or more generations. \u201cThe breeding, raising, producing in captivity and marketing . . . [of such mink should] be deemed an agricultural pursuit.\u201d The defendant\u2019s mink had been propagated in captivity for more than two generations and were \u201cdomesticated mink\u201d as defined in \u00a7 105A. This section was repealed by St. 1967, c. 802, \u00a7 1. Provisions similar to those just mentioned are now included in G. L. c. 128, \u00a7 8B, inserted by St. 1969, c. 37, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
