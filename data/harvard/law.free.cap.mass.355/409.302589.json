The single member found that the employee is permanently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and totally disabled and the reviewing board adopted his findings and decision. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10, as amended through St. 1947, c. 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">We summarize the relevant facts. On April 26, 1956, while pushing a cart during the course of her employment as an attendant at the Northampton State Hospital, the employee suffered an injury to her back. Since the injury she has been hospitalized three times for corrective surgery. She is unable to perform any work that requires \u201cany bending or lifting\u201d or \u201cprolonged standing and lifting.\u201d In 1963, the employee\u2019s husband purchased a small variety store. The store was primarily a self-service store. She worked in the store as a clerk six and one-half hours a day, five days a week. All of the heavy work was done by a hired girl. With the exception of \u201cbending over to get candy out of the case for school children,\u201d the employee was not required to do any bending or lifting. However, \u201cbecause of the difficulties in her working at the store her husband was forced to sell the store in January, 1964.\u201d The employee attended school until only the eighth grade and all of her employment prior to the injury \u201cconsisted mostly of work that one would call heavy in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The Commonwealth contends that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to warrant the reviewing board\u2019s finding of permanent and total disability \u201cwithin the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A.\u201d It argues that the employee\u2019s proof failed both as to the medical evidence and as to the evidence of inability to obtain employment within her physical capabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The question of total and permanent disability is one of fact and the finding of the reviewing board must stand unless there is no evidence to support it. <em>Amello\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 347, 348. <em>Chouinard\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 152, 153. Total and permanent disability \u201cis intended to mean total and permanent disability to earn wages. . . . The total and permanent disability . . . is to be construed to be such as to prevent the employee from engaging in any occupation and performing any work for compensation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>profit, that is, from obtaining and retaining remunerative employment of any kind within his ability to perform. Complete physical or mental incapacity of the employee is not essential .... It is sufficient . . . that the employee\u2019s disability is such that it prevents him from performing remunerative work of a substantial and not merely trifling character, and regard must be had to the age, experience, training and capabilities of the employee.\u201d <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 635, 639. See <em>Shirley\u2019s Case, ante, </em>308.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The employee is a woman of limited education and work experience. Two medical experts stated that she was no longer able to perform the tasks required by her previous type of employment. She is not required to produce medical testimony to the effect that she is unable to perform any remunerative work. See <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Nor is she required to show that she attempted to obtain employment that common sense would indicate she is incapable of performing. Following the injury she was virtually unable to work even a limited number of hours a day at a job that required little physical exertion. She has been unable to obtain employment that requires no physical exertion. We are of opinion that the evidence supports the finding that the employee is permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The decree is reversed. A decree enforcing the reviewing board\u2019s decision is to enter. Costs of appeal are to be determined and awarded by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
