He ceased work on November 9, 1962, and except for two days in December, 1962, has not worked since. The third insurer had been on the risk on and after August 30, 1962. The issues presented by that insurer\u2019s appeal from the decree in the Superior Court awarding compensation on the reviewing board\u2019s decision are whether there was adequate basis for the board\u2019s finding that there was causal connection between the disability and the employee\u2019s exposure in the period from August 31, 1962, to November 9, 1962, and whether lack of formal notice and late filing of claim prejudiced the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">A physician who attended the employee on and after November 14, 1962 (he was the physician of \u201cthe owner\u201d of the then corporate employer and was recommended by him), testified that the chemicals, if they did not initiate the employee\u2019s affliction, \u201ccertainly had severe aggravating effect on this man\u2019s disease.\u201d As to whether inhalation of the offending substances from the time of the employee\u2019s hospitalization in 1961 down to November of 1962 \u201ccaused the condition to progress,\u201d the physician answered \u201cProgression? ... In that period of time, yes.\u201d Another physician attributed the affliction to the employee\u2019s con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tinning use of cigarettes but the employee\u2019s physician testified that the bullous type of emphysema was unusual and \u201ca highly destructive type . . . which is rarely associated with cigarette smoking.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The insurer\u2019s contention that causation is not shown depends upon the testimony of this physician set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This testimony is ambiguous. Reasonably construed, it states the view that short periods of exposure considered by themselves would not substantially aggravate the disease. It does not, however, negative the other testimony that the exposure in the whole period including the last two months caused the condition to progress. Undoubtedly, the increase in the affliction in any two or three months period separately considered would be difficult to measure. But exposure in the last two months was no less significant than in any other two months period throughout the years of work and the physician did not indicate to the contrary. The board could find that the progressive disease reached its conclusive disabling effect on November 9, 1962, when in fact the employee ceased work. <em>DeFilippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531, 533-534. <em>Fabrizio\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 352, 354. <em>Langford\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 461, 463. <em>Crowley\u2019s Case, </em>287 Mass. 367, 371. <em>Long\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 517, 521. <em>Joyce\u2019s Case, </em>350 Mass. 77, 82. The case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>288 Mass. 96, 100, as there the board found against the first insurer. That insurer\u2019s coverage had ceased on November 14, 1930. The employee worked until December 4, 1930, and the second insurer was on the risk on and after December 3, 1930. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>This court held that the findings were permitted that the point of \u201cincapacity for work\u201d had been reached prior to November 14,1930, and that the work after that day had no appreciable effect. Assuming that similar findings could have been made in the case now before us, they were not required. It is a workable and fair rule that the last of successive insurers be charged if there is a basis for so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The filing of claim eleven months after November 9, 1962, was of course late and there was no prior formal notice. But the circumstance of exposure was not contested, only its significance. <em>Kulig\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 524, 526. The board\u2019s finding of lack of prejudice was within reason on the evidence. <em>Mahoney\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 629, 632. <em>Davidson\u2019s Case, </em>338 Mass. 228, 232. <em>Ogonowsky\u2019s Case, </em>338 Mass. 468, 471. <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 282, 284-285.
