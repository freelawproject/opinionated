We have reviewed and made our own appraisal of the evidence in this bitterly contested case and conclude that in no aspect were the decrees plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-16\">We have given careful consideration to the evidence on which the husband relies to support his contention that the mother should not have custody. It will serve no purpose to recite the evidence in this opinion. We conclude that notwithstanding the mother\u2019s daily work at her medical profession and her nervous and distraught state in a period in which she used prescription drugs, the reasonable likeli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>hood is that with marital tensions removed, the home with the mother will be the right place for the children. Their welfare will of course remain a concern of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The husband shows no basis for modification of the support order. A physician, he now has a position in Philadelphia with an income of about $16,000 a year. There is no basis for a reversal because of asserted manifestations of the judge\u2019s alleged prejudice against the husband. Most of the references to the transcript show Ms impatience with questions to witnesses that the judge deemed not to bear on the main issues. The judge\u2019s report of material facts and Ms demal of a motion for a new trial show that he learned of an alleged tMeat by the husband only after he had already determined his decision. Comments by the judge at the time of the motion for a new trial as to the defendant\u2019s credibility and as to Ms feeling that if he had the power he should dismiss the appeal because of contempt, do not show that the issues were decided otherwise than on their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">We have dealt with the case on the merits for we tMnk there was no power in the Probate Court to dismiss the husband\u2019s appeal from the decree msi because of the husband\u2019s contempt for falling beMnd in the alimony payments and not paying the attorney\u2019s fee (although at the same time finding $1,400 to pay for printing the record). The power of tMs court to dismiss an appeal because of contempt of the appellant in thwarting the decree of custody from wMch the appeal is taken and thus preventing \u201can orderly settlement of the controversy\u201d <em>(Henderson </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>329 Mass. 257, <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>334 Mass. 466, 467-468) is a function of our appellate jurisdiction. It is not an exercise of a power to punish for contempt, a power wMch the Probate Court also has. G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 34. Nothing in <em>Sloane </em>v. <em>Sloane, </em>349 Mass. 318, 319, cited by the wife, suggests that the power to dismiss for interfering with the appellate process extends to the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The decree dismissing the appeal is reversed. The decrees dismissing the husband\u2019s libel and awarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>wife a divorce, custody and alimony and counsel fees are affirmed. The decree denying the motion for a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
