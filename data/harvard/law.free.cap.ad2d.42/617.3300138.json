[c]). The modification of the subpoenas, even after notice had been given, was an abuse of discretion in view of our decision in <em>Matter of McArdle </em>v. <em>Temporary N. Y. State </em>Comm. <em>of Investigation </em>(41 A D 2d 401) in which the same grounds, advanced for similar relief, were rejected. Herlihy, P. J., Greenblott, Sweeney, Kane and Main, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
