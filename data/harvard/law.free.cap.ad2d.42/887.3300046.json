Since this was an action for declaratory judgment, the complaint should have not been dismissed merely because plaintiff was not entitled to the declaration sought by him. The court at Special Term, in granting summary judgment, should have made a declaration of the rights of the parties with respect to the subject matter of the litigation. <em>(Sweeney </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>30 N Y 2d 633; <em>Fhagen </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>36 A D 2d 926, 927, affd. 29 N Y 2d 348; <em>Lanza </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>11 N Y 2d 317, 334.)
