JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b197-25\">Plaintiff-appellant Joe Frank Holder sued defendants-appellees Prudential Insurance Company of America and its agent, Andy Mathis for coverage of a medical procedure performed on his now-deceased wife. The district judge found that the treatment was \u201cexperimental in nature\u201d and had not yet been \u201ccommonly and customarily\u201d recognized throughout the medical profession, as a result of which was excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy. Plaintiff appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In 1987, Wanda Maurine Holder was diagnosed with breast cancer. The tumor and surrounding tissue were removed from her breast and she underwent standard chemotherapy. In October 1987, a recurrence of the cancer was discovered and diagnosed, and Mrs. Holder was referred by her treating physician to M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston, Texas for further treatment. There she underwent additional chemotherapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Mrs. Holder was approached by her doctors at M.D. Anderson Hospital to accept a treatment of high-dose chemotherapy coupled with an autologous bone marrow transplantation (\u201cHDC-ABMT\u201d). Mrs. Holder signed a consent form for the treatment which noted that the procedure was an \u201cexperimental study;\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she participated in the treatment and died of complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Mrs. Holder was a beneficiary under a health insurance plan provided by her husband\u2019s employer and purchased from Prudential Health Insurance Company of America (\u201cPrudential\u201d). Mr. Holder submitted a claim to Prudential for hospital and physician expenses associated with the HDC-ABMT treatment. Prudential partially denied coverage based on the policy exclusion for experimental treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Plaintiffs contention on appeal is that the district court erred in finding the HDC-ABMT treatment experimental and therefore excluded from policy coverage. The parties do not here dispute that this court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard of review. F.R.Civ.P. 52(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">The policy provided that it did not cover treatment not reasonably necessary for medical care. To be \u201creasonably necessary,\u201d a treatment must be ordered by a doctor and customarily recognized as appropriate, and it could not be experimental in nature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court was presented with two live expert witnesses and the deposition testimony of two others. The court found the testimony of Dr. Fehir, a M.D. and a Ph.D. in immunology and transplantation biology offered by Prudential, to be \u201cmost compelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-15\">The opinions of the experts were conflicting on the experimental nature of the treatment extended to Mrs. Holder. Although HDC-ABMT was not considered \u201cexperimental\u201d in the treatment of other cancers (leukemia, Hodgkin\u2019s disease, and lymphoma), the issue was whether it was experimental in the treatment of Stage IY metastatic breast cancer. Clinical studies were referred to which showed that this procedure for the treatment of this disease was still being investigated at the time of Mrs. Holder\u2019s treatment. Further, the protocol used on her was only given to twenty or thirty women nationwide and was regulated by the FDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The trial court was in the best position to view the evidence and weigh the testimony of the expert witnesses, among whom Dr. Fehir\u2019s testimony was found to be most credible. The court also relied on the signed consent form describing the treatment as an \u201cexperimental study.\u201d Upon reviewing the record and evidence presented, we cannot say that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Plaintiff alternatively appears to argue that as a matter of law HDC-ABMT treatment for Stage IV metastatic breast cancer is not experimental. This contention must also fail. The various district court decisions that found coverage despite such exclusionary provisions are readily distinguishable from the case at hand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Of course, it is the nature of medical research that what may one day be experimental may the next be state of the art treatment. Had Mrs. Holder undergone a similar treatment more recently under an accepted protocol, this case may have turned out differently.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Prudential and Mathis, through a separate appeal, assert that the district court erred in not awarding attorney fees in this ERISA action. Under ERISA the court has discretion to award attorney fees to either party. 29 U.S.C. 1132(g)(1). This court uses a five factor test to determine whether a party is entitled to attorney fees. <em>See Ironworkers Local No. 272 v. Bowen, </em>624 F.2d 1255, 1266 (5th Cir.1980). Prudential argues that this five factor test is suspect when the defendant is the prevailing party because the test appears to be geared toward the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Prudential argues that this court should apply a Seventh Circuit test announced in <em>Bittner v. Sadoff &amp; Rudoy Industries, </em>728 F.2d 820, 829 (7th Cir.1984). The Seventh Circuit analogized to the Equal Access to Justice Act in stating, \u201cThese words create a modest presumption ... in favor of awarding reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the winning party, plaintiff or defendant, unless the loser\u2019s position, while rejected by the court, had a solid basis \u2014 more than merely not frivolous, but less than meritorious ... This standard is consistent with previous articulations of the test under Section 1132(g)(1) but is simpler and more definite.\u201d <em>Bittner, </em>728 F.2d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The decision to award attorney\u2019s fees is committed to the discretion of the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>court. We need not decide whether to embrace the Seventh Circuit\u2019s test because even if that test were to be applied, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion here. The experimental nature of Mrs. Holder\u2019s treatment raised an undecided issue of fact. Holder\u2019s experts stated that the treatment was not experimental in nature, while the case law has split. To impose attorneys\u2019 fees upon Holder under these circumstances would have added insult to injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">. The consent form, signed by Mrs. Holder, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">2.PURPOSE OF STUDY: This is an <em>experimental study </em>which uses high doses of mitox-antrone, etoposide (VP-16) and thiotepa (MVT) in the treatment, combined with bone marrow transplantation. The use of higher-than-normal doses of chemotherapy carries with it a greater risk of complications to both the blood-forming cells of the body (the marrow) and other organs. Therefore, the purposes of this study are: 1) to find if such a combination is associated with acceptable toxicity to organs other than the bone marrow when used with the infusion of autologous marrow; and 2) to determine if, at these high doses, there is a significant response rate [shrinkage of the tumor].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">Emphasis added.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-12\">. In the lower court, Prudential contended that its officials exercised administrative discretion over the benefit determinations, entitling their decisions to judicial review under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). The district court disagreed. Prudential has not taken issue with this ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b198-17\">.The policy provides that it does NOT cover:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQE\">Non-essentials, check-ups \u2014 Anything not ordered by a doctor or not reasonably necessary for medical care of sickness or injury.

Gulf Health Plan, Inc., </em>688 F.Supp. 590 (S.D.Ala.1988) (it is undisputed that autologous bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of breast cancer is still considered experimental or investigative, even though such treatment is no longer considered experimental by Blue Cross for certain other types of cancer); <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Gerber Products Co. Medical Benefits Plan, </em>728 F.Supp. 594 (D.Neb.1989) (\u201cHigh dose chemotherapy accompanied by ABMT as a treatment for breast cancer is in an early stage of development ... the treatment is investigational and experimental (as those terms are ordinarily defined) and has not yet been commonly and customarily (as those terms are ordinarily defined) recognized throughout the medical profession as appropriate treatment of metastic breast cancer.

Several recent studies and the cases in which they have been applied to compel coverage of HDC-ABMT treatment for Stage IV metastatic breast cancer lead to the conclusion that the treatment, under a different protocol than that administered to Mrs. Holder, may no longer be considered experimental. <em>See White v.
