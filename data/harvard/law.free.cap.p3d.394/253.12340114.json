THOMAS THORNBRUGH, PRESIDING JUDGE:</author>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">\u00b6 1 Diane Carista appeals the dismissal, with prejudice, of her wrongful death suit against Westminster Family Drug (Pharmacy). On review, we find that dismissal was appropriate as to Carista\u2019s existing petition, but that it is possible for Carista to amend her petition to state a recognized duty by Pharmacy. We vacate the lower court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice, and remand with instructions that Carista be given a reasonable period to file an amended petition pursuant to 12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 2012(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b283-19\">\u00b6 2 This suit arises from the death of Barton Ray Carista (Decedent) from a purported overdose of painkillers prescribed by a physician.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff, Diane Carista (Carista), Decedent\u2019s sister, sued several parties, including Pharmacy, seeMng damages for alleged wrongful death. Carista alleged in her petition that a \u201chealth care provider-patient relationship\u201d existed between Decedent and Pharmacy, and that Pharmacy had acted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-20\">1. Failed to \u201cappreciate proper prescription filling procedures for dangerous medications ... by not reviewing a Patient Prescription History Report and/or contacting the prescribing physician\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-21\">2.

The district court dismissed Pharmacy as a defendant. Carista now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b6 3 The standard of review for an order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is <em>de nov\u00f3. Tuffy\u2019s, Inc. v. City of Okla. City, </em>2009 OK 4, \u00b6 6, 212 P.3d 1158. When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the Court must view the facts as true and favorably to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>The purpose of a motion to dismiss is to determine the legal sufficiency of the claim, not the underlying facts. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA pleading must not be dismissed for failure to state a legally cognizable claim unless the allegations indicate beyond any doubt that the litigant can prove no set of facts which would entitle the plaintiff to relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u00b6 4 The dismissal in this case was made <em>on </em>the grounds that no duty existed pursuant to the facts pled. The threshold question in any action for negligence is the existence of a duty. <em>Wood v. Mercedes-Benz of Okla. City, </em>2014 OK 68, \u00b6 7, 336 P.3d 457; <em>Miller v. David Grace, Inc., </em>2009 OK 49, \u00b6 11, 212 P.3d 1223; <em>Bray v. St. John Health Sys., Inc., </em>2008 OK 51, \u00b6 6, 187 P.3d 721. The existence of a legal duty is a questioh of law for the court. <em>Id. </em>If a defendant does not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff, there can be no liability for negligence as a matter of law. <em>Lowery v. Echostar Satellite Corp., </em>2007 OK 38, \u00b6 12, 160 P.3d 959; <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank in Durant v. Honey Creek Entertainment Corp., </em>2002 OK 11, \u00b6 20, 54 P.3d 100. Caris-ta\u2019s petition alleges that pharmacists filling prescriptions in Oklahoma have a broad range of duties not currently established by the state\u2019s courts. As such, this case presents a matter of first impression,</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">I. THE LEARNED INTERMEDIARY DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">\u00b6 5 Pharmacy\u2019s motion to dismiss relied primarily on the \u201clearned intermediary\u201d doctrine. The Oklahoma Supreme Court first noted this doctrine in <em>McKee v. Moore, </em>1982 OK 71, 648 P.2d 21, wherein it held that, in the absence of any directive that a warning be given directly to the patient, it is the duty of a drug manufacturer to inform a physician of known hazards, side effects, and interactions of prescription drugs, and the duty of the physician, not the manufacturer, to relay this information to the patient. Pharmacy argued that this principle places sole responsibility with the physician to communicate any matter covered by the learned intermediary doctrine, and not with a pharmacist</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">\u00b6 6 No published OHahoma case has applied this doctrine in a case involving a pharmacist. Many other states appear, however, to have adopted the doctrine, with limited exceptions, to shield pharmacists from being required to \u201csecond guess\u201d, a physician\u2019s medical decisions.embodied in an otherwise authorized and legally made prescription. These exceptions are generally:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">1. If the prescription is \u201cunreasonable on its face,\u201d e.g., it prescribes facially bizarre quantities or dosages clearly outside of any acceptable range, or clearly inappropriate drugs; and</p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">2. If the prescribed drug is clearly contraindicated, and the pharmacist has sufficient knowledge of the patient\u2019s condition and history to know this.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u00b6 7 These conditions appear to conform to the various Oklahoma cases that attempt to define the duties of a pharmacist. The most comprehensive Oklahoma appellate court statement regarding these duties is found in <em>Pharmcare Oklahoma, Inc. v. State Health Care Auth., </em>2007 OK CIV APP 5, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 152 P.3d 267:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">Based on the scope of a pharmacist\u2019s practice, it is clear the responsibility of prescribing medication to a patient does not lie with a pharmacist. Rather, the determination of whether a particular medication is medically necessary for a patient lies with the treating physician or other appropriate individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">A pharmacist\u2019s duty to that same patient is clearly defined and limited under the Pharmacy Act. These duties include accurately filling and dispensing prescriptions, advising by counseling or providing other information, or the provision of other services that are necessary to providing pharmaceutical care. Although a pharmacist does have a duty under the Pharmacy Act to interpret and evaluate prescription orders, this does not equate with a physician\u2019s duty of determining the medical necessity of a particular service or medication. This is a determination to be made by the patient\u2019s treating physician in the first instance....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">This existing case law does not support Car-ista\u2019s expanded view of the duties of a pharmacist. Carista relies, however, on the (Ma-homa Pharmacy Act, 59 O.S.2Q11 &amp; Supp. 2015 \u00a7\u00a7 353 through 366 (Pharmacy Act), the Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC), and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (US-DEA) .regulations as a.source of the duties she claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">A. Federal Drug Enforcement Administration Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u25a0 \u00b6 8 Carista cites section 523:10-3-1.2 of the \u201cPharmacists.Manual\u201d issued by the USDEA as authority for a tort duty in this case.- We find no reported case in <em>any jurisdiction of the United States </em>utilizing or examining this USDEA publication as a source of law, guidance, or persuasive authority in a tort case, or in . any other case. We further have no copy of this document in the appellate record. We decline to take the unprecedented step of declaring that a federal publication of unknown content establishes a tort not previously recognized by our Supreme Court. .</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">B. The Pharmacy Act</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">\u00b6 9 Carista relies on the \u201cDefinitions\u201d section (\u00a7 353.1) of the Pharmacy Act as creating a tort duty in this ease. Subsection 37 of \u00a7 353.1 defines \u201cpractice of pharmacy\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-12\">a. the interpretation and evaluation of prescription orders,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-13\">b. the compounding, dispensing, administering and labeling of drugs and. devices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>except labeling by a manufacturer, repaek-ager or distributor of nonprescription drugs and commercially packaged legend drugs and devices,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">c. the participation in drug selection and drug utilization reviews,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">d. the proper and safe storage of drugs and devices and the maintenance of proper records thereof,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">e. the responsibility for advising by counseling and providing information, where professionally necessary or where regulated, of therapeutic values, content, hazards and use of drugs and devices,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">f. the offering or performing of those acts, services, operations or transactions necessary in the conduct, operation, management and control of a pharmacy, or'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuRp\">g. the provision of those acts or services that are necessary to provide pharmaceutical care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u00b6 10 Carista argues that two of these definitions, 37(a) (\u201cthe interpretation and evaluation of prescription orders,\u201d) and 37(e) (\u201cthe responsibility for advising by counseling and providing information, where professionally necessary or where regulated, of therapeutic values, content, hazards and use of drugs and devices\u201d), define the duty of a pharmacist in a tort context. Viewing the \u201cDefinitions\u201d section in context, we find it clear that it is intended to <em>define activities that are subject to regulation by the Board of Pharmacy </em>pursuant to 59 O.S \u00a7 353.7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no authority for the proposition that these definitions create statutory duties in a tort context. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">C. The Oklahoma Administrative Code</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">\u00b6 11 Carista next relies on OAC \u00a7 317:30-5 as defining \u201cthe statutory duties of pharmacists.\u201d Section 317:30-5 is, however, part of the OAC Title 317 regulations concerning the Oklahoma Healthcare Authority as that authority relates to Fee-for-Serviee Medical Providers, including physicians; physician assistants: hospitals; long term care hospitals; pharmacies; certified laboratories; long term care facilities; bariatric surgery; medical suppliers; genetic counselors; certified nurse midwives and lactation consultants; and numerous other professions. The scope of this regulation clearly defines the various legal relationships between numerous fee-for-service providers and the Oklahoma Healthcare Authority/Soonercare program. Section 317:30-5-70.1 is clear that pharmacists are governed by the rules of professional conduct as promulgated by the Oklahoma Board of Pharmacy (or the state\u2019s rules of professional conduct where the pharmacy is licensed) pursuant to 59 O.S. \u00a7 353.7(12), and not by this section of the OAC We find no indication that the Title 317, Chapter 30, regulations were intended to generally regulate the practice of numerous professions or define statutory duties outside of the fiscal and administrative relationship of a provider with the state healthcare authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Any \u201cstatutory duty,\u201d if it exists, must therefore be found in Title 535 of the regulations, rather than Title 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">\u00b6 12 Carista finally cites OAC \u00a7 535:10-3-1.2(10) as making it a violation of professional conduct for a pharmacist not to \u201cattemptf ] to address the possible addiction or dependency of a patient to a drug dispensed by the pharmacist, if there is reason to believe that the patient may be dependent or addicted.\u201d Carista\u2019s petition contains no allegation that the Decedent was addicted to the drug dispensed by the pharmacist, or any facts indicating that Pharmacy had any reason to believe that he was addicted to the drug dispensed by the pharmacist. Rather, the petition alleges that Pharmacy had a duty to consider Decedent\u2019s \u201chistory of methamphetamine and marijuana abuse,\u201d and his consequent \u201chigh risk for abuse and addiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">\u00b6 13 This argument wanders too far afield from the regulatory text. The regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>deals with a patient\u2019s possible addiction or dependency to a drag <em>dispensed by the pharmacist, </em>not with a risk for abuse indicated by the use of dangerous controlled substances such as methamphetamine or marijuana. We find no indication that the Board of Pharmacy intended to create a duty for pharmacists to question clients regarding illegal drug use, or to second-guess the judgment of a doctor in prescribing drugs to persons who may also abuse illegal substances. Pharmacists are neither physicians nor counselors on the use of illegal drugs. They are statutorily prohibited from any attempt at diagnosis or treatment that might infringe upon the legally constituted right or obligation of any practitioner of the healing arts. To place the responsibility on a pharmacist to act as a virtual \u201csecond medical opinion\u201d when filling an otherwise facially valid prescription would radically change the accepted duties of a pharmacist.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">D. Conclusion to this Section</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b6 14 Carista proposes a broad expansion to the duties of pharmacists that we find unsupported by existing Oklahoma state law or regulations, and outside the mainstream of other states\u2019 laws. The duties urged by Car-ista would result in pharmacists acting as a form of second medical opinion, and certainly could enmesh pharmacists in the practice of medicine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find that the duty of Pharmacy in this matter is limited by the principles and exceptions to the learned intermediary doctrine outlined in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">II. THE COURT\u2019S DISMISSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">A. The Submission of Evidence in a Dismissal Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b6 15 After Pharmacy filed its motion to dismiss pursuant to 12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 2012(B)(6), Carista replied with evidence in the form of a report by one Michael Burton, a \u201cPharm D.\u201d from Spring, Texas. This report contained both evidence regarding generally accepted dosages and legal conclusions regarding the duty and liability of Pharmacy. Notably, Carista did hot ask to amend her petition to add any of these factual allegations. The purpose of \u00e1 motion to dismiss is to test the legal sufficiency of a petition, not to engage in an evidentiary contest of facts. <em>Tuffy\u2019s, </em>2009 OK 4 at \u00b6 6, 212 P.3d 1158. This unsworn report therefore was irrelevant to the dismissal inquiry.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">B. The Court\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"AqLt\">\u00b6 16 On review, we agree that Carista\u2019s existing petition failed to state facts sufficient to show a breach of duty by Pharmacy. However, as we have identified in this opinion, although the immunity granted by the \u201clearned intermediary\u201d doctrine and other Oklahoma statutes is broad, it is not absolute. Pursuant to \u00a7 2012(G), the district court should have allowed Carista the opportunity to amend her petition to allege a recognized duty of the pharmacist in this ease, following the principles outlined in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">\u00b6 17 This matter is remanded with the following instructions: The dismissal with prejudice is vacated. The district court is to dismiss Carista\u2019s petition with leave to amend to state a cognizable claim, and set a reasonable time for doing so. If such amendment is not forthcoming, the court may follow the dismissal procedure set out in \u00a7 2012(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">\u00b6 18 VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<judges id=\"b287-16\">BARNES, J., concurs, and RAPP, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-15\">.

The first question for determination is: Does a duty, recognized by law, exist on the part of Westminster, which requires that it conform to a standard of conduct so as to protect buyers of narcotic prescriptions, like Carista, against an unreasonable risk from an improper or dangerous use of the prescription? As stated in <em>McClure v. Sunshine Furniture, </em>2012 OK CIV APP 67, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 283 P.3d 323, 328-29:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">A duty is a threshold question in any negligence case. Whether a duty exists presents a question of law which depends on the relationship between the parties and the general risks involved in the common undertaking. <em>Wofford v.

Whether a defendant stands in such relationship to a plaintiff that the law will impose upon the defendant an obligation of reasonable conduct for the benefit of the plaintiff is a question for the court. <em>Id. </em>\u2018Duty of care is not a concept that arises only by statute ... Whenever a person is placed in such a position with regard to another that it is obvious that if he did not use due care in his own conduct he will cause injury to the other, the duty at once arises to exercise care commensurate with the situation in order to avoid such injury.\u2019 <em>Union Bank, </em>771 P.2d at 222.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">Professor Prosser had this to say: The assertion that liability must ... be denied because defendant bears no \u2018duty\u2019 to plaintiff begs the essential question\u2014 whether the plaintiffs interests are entitled to legal protection against the defendant\u2019s conduct.... [Duty] is not sacrosanct in itself, but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection. (Prosser, <em>Law on Torts </em>[3d ed. 1964] at pp. 332-333.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-10\"><em>Wofford, </em>1990 OK 77 at \u00b6 10, 795 P.2d at 519.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALT1\">The most important of those policy considerations in the determination of whether a duty exits is foreseeability. The general rule is that a \u201cdefendant owes a duty of care to all persons who are foreseeably endangered by his conduct with respect to all risks which make the conduct unreasonably dangerous.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>1990 OK 77 at \u00b6 11, 795 P.2d at 519. Foreseeability as an element of duty establishes a \u201czone of risk,\u201d that is, whether the conduct \u201ccreates a generalized and foreseeable risk of harming others.\u201d <em>Delbrel v. Doenges Bros. Ford, Inc., </em>1996 OK 36, \u00b6 8, 913 P.2d 1318, 1321; <em>McCain v. Florida Power Corporation, </em>593 So.2d 500, 502-503 (Fla. 1992). When a defendant\u2019s conduct \u201ccreates a foreseeable zone of risk, the law generally will recognize a duty placed upon defendant either to .lessen the risk or see that sufficient precautions are taken to protect others from harm that the risk imposes.\u201d <em>McClain, </em>593 So.2d at 503.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">The foreseeability component of duty is different than the foreseeability element of proximate cause. The latter is concerned specifically with whether and to what extent the defendant\u2019s conduct foreseeably and substantially caused the injury that occurred. <em>Delbrel, </em>1996 OK 36 at \u00b6 12, 913 P.2d at 1322; <em>McCain, </em>593 So.2d at 502-503.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">\u00b6 3 Thus, the Subsection 37(e) definition of what constitutes a component of the pharmacist\u2019s practice is a statutory statement of duty. However, the Opinion narrowly interprets Subsection 37(e) as being only a provision defining what may be regulated and not what may be considered as a duty for tort law purposes. The case of <em>Pharmcare Oklahoma, Inc. v. State of Oklahoma Health Care Authority, </em>2007 OK CIV APP 5, 152 P.3d 267 (case dealing with recoupment of funds paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>under the Oklahoma Medicaid program), suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b64 In <em>Pharmcare, </em>at paragraphs 26 and following, the Court engaged in an analysis of whether a pharmacist had a duty or responsibility to determine whether a particular medication was medically necessary. In concluding that the pharmacist did not have that duty, the Court found that the pharmacist\u2019s duty was defined (and limited) under the Pharmacy Act, citing Subsection 37. Thus, the <em>Pharmcare </em>Opinion states, \u201cThe Pharmacy Act provides -the scope of a pharmacist\u2019s practice. The \u2018practice of pharmacy' includes (Subsection 37).... A pharmacist\u2019s duty to that same patient is clearly defined and limited under the Pharmacy Act. These duties include accurately filling and dispensing prescriptions, advising by counseling -or providing other information.\u201d <em>Pharmcare Oklahoma, Inc., </em>2007 OK CIV APP 5 \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30, 152 P.3d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u00b6 5 I would reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of this action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
