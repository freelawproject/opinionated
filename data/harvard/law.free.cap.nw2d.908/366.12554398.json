The investigator followed appellant outside, displayed his security badge, and told appellant that she needed to return to the store. Appellant refused. The investigator attempted to take appellant into custody, but appellant resisted. During the ensuing scuffle, appellant attempted to discard the items on the sidewalk and tried to hand her purse to a friend who had accompanied her to the store. The investigator took appellant's purse, stating that it was evidence of the crime, and, with the assistance of the store manager, handcuffed appellant and escorted her to the manager's office inside of the store along with her purse. The investigator seated appellant in a chair and placed her purse on top of the manager's desk. The manager then called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At 1:58 p.m., two police officers responded to the shoplifting call. Dispatch informed the officers that appellant also had outstanding warrants. One officer proceeded to the manager's office and spoke to the investigator and appellant. That officer arrested appellant and then searched her purse. The officer discovered suspected narcotics within a zipped compartment of appellant's purse, consisting of a baggie containing a white, powdery substance and a container with several pills. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension later determined that the baggie contained 0.932 grams of methadone and identified the assorted pills as hydromorphone, oxycodone, and lorazepam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant was charged with two counts of fifth-degree controlled-substance crime,\n   in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.025\">\n    Minn.

Under these circumstances, we hold that appellant's purse remained immediately associated with her person during the detention at the store and was subject to a subsequent search incident to her lawful arrest by the officer who knew or had reason to know she had possessed it when detained.
