It further contends that because an exempted institution is no\n   longer supporting services alternatively provided by public taxation, it is reasonable to require an institution to show that its activities relieve the government's burden to provide such services. Essentially, respondent argues that the \"educational institution\" exemption is a sort of quid pro quo; if the institution relieves the government's burden to provide education to the public, then it receives a tax exemption. However, nothing in the language of the statute suggests such a requirement, and it is well established that the perceived purpose of a statute may not supersede the statutory text.

This principle applies with equal force when interpreting a statute that provides a tax exemption. As this Court has recently explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   When interpreting statutory language, our obligation is to ascertain the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the words expressed in the statute.

While there is a strong and proud tradition of publicly funded education both in Michigan and in the United States as a whole, there is a similarly proud tradition of private educational institutions. Indeed, \"tax exemption for private educational institutions extends to the beginning of colonial America.\" Colombo,\n   <em>\n    Why is Harvard Tax-Exempt? (And Other Mysteries of Tax Exemption for Private Educational Institutions)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Ariz.%20L.%20Rev.%20841\">\n    35 Ariz.

There is no statutory basis for concluding that an \"educational institution\" must be part of the \"general scheme of education\n   <em>\n    provided by the state\n   </em>\n   \" rather than a part of the general scheme of education provided by the state\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   private institutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For these reasons, I believe that, in a more appropriate case, this Court should reconsider what constitutes an \"educational institution\" under MCL 211.7n. While I do not purport to articulate a definitive standard in this statement, I share a few initial observations that I believe warrant further consideration by this Court. Taken in isolation, the definition of the word \"educational\" could be broadly interpreted to provide a property tax exemption for most properties, which would clearly be inconsistent with the statutory scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, when viewed in the context of MCL 211.7n as a whole, I believe that a more reasonable interpretation emerges. MCL 211.7n does not only provide a tax exemption for \"educational institutions,\" but also for theaters, libraries, scientific institutions, and properties \"devoted exclusively to fostering the development of literature, music, painting, or sculpture which substantially enhances the cultural environment of a community as a whole, [and] is available to the general public on a regular basis....\" \"This Court must avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute nugatory.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Rea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20422\">\n    500 Mich. 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.W.2d%20362\">\n    902 N.W.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Accordingly, it appears that theaters, libraries, scientific institutions, and properties devoted to promoting cultural development will generally\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   constitute \"educational institutions,\" even if they are \"educational\" in the broadest sense of the term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition, the history of the American educational experience itself provides at least some guidance as to the meaning of an \"educational institution.\" There are certain\n   kinds of institutions that, in the American experience, have traditionally been viewed as \"educational institutions.\" Such institutions include public schools,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   parochial schools,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   liberal arts colleges,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   graduate programs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and vocational schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The common thread among these institutions is that they instruct students in order to promote intellectual growth or employment-related skills. By contrast, other kinds of institutions that \"educate\" in the broadest sense, such as baby-sitting programs, zoos, dance academies, and athletic teams, are not, in common parlance, generally considered to be \"educational institutions.\" Thus, it appears to me that an \"educational institution\" must be of a kind that, in the perspective of the overall American experience, has been traditionally viewed as an institution that instructs students to promote intellectual growth or employment related skills. But these are all tentative ruminations and speculations, and await specific development in a future case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As the Supreme Court of New Hampshire aptly noted when defining an \"educational institution\" under its own tax exemption statute, \"the construction of a brightline test is impossible; each case will necessarily depend on its own peculiar facts.\"\n   <em>\n    New Canaan Academy, Inc. v. Town of Canaan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4453416\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/122/134/#p137\">\n    122 N.H. 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20A.2d%201174\">\n    441 A.2d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). Thus, it is incumbent upon this Court, as the highest court in this state, to provide an appropriate framework for determining whether an entity constitutes an \"educational institution\" that is entitled to a property tax exemption. In my judgment, the current framework is clearly contrary to the statutory text and imposes an unwarranted burden on an institution seeking a tax exemption to show that it performs a quasi-governmental function. I welcome the opportunity in a future case to formulate a new standard for what constitutes an \"educational institution\" that is more consistent with the plain meaning of that phrase and within the American educational tradition.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    This Court has never clearly explained whether an entity is entitled to an exemption if it satisfies\n    <em>\n     either\n    </em>\n    of these requirements, or whether it is only entitled to an exemption if it satisfies\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    of these requirements. However, multiple Court of Appeals decisions have cited\n    <em>\n     Ladies Literary Club\n    </em>\n    for the proposition that an entity is only entitled to an exemption if it satisfies\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    of these requirements.
