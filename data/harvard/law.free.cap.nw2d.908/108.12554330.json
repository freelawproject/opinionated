Forster/Krebs argue the district court erred in construing language in a lease agreement with B&amp;B Hot Oil as a waiver of their claims against B&amp;B Hot Oil for damages to their building and property and to preclude a subrogation claim by their insurer, Acuity, against B&amp;B Hot Oil. Forster/Krebs also argue the district court improperly granted summary judgment dismissing their claims against JB's Welding for concerted action and a joint venture. Because we conclude a stipulation to dismiss Forster/Krebs' other remaining claims against JB's Welding without prejudice does not make the judgment final for purposes of our appellate jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 2] B&amp;B Hot Oil leased one-half of a building owned by Forster/Krebs and used the leased property to store two hot oil trucks. An explosion in January 2010, destroyed the building and its contents and damaged surrounding property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Messer v.

The alleged cause of the explosion was a propane leak from one of the hot oil trucks, which has been referred to by the parties as a \"knock off\" truck built through \"reverse engineering\" by B&amp;B Hot Oil with assistance from JB's Welding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Several third parties sued Forster/Krebs and B&amp;B Hot Oil in this action for damages. Forster/Krebs cross-claimed against B&amp;B Hot Oil and JB's Welding for damages related to the destruction of Forster/Krebs' building and the contents. Forster/Krebs ultimately alleged claims against B&amp;B Hot Oil for breach of contract, negligence, res ipsa loquitur, and strict products liability, and against JB's Welding for negligence, strict products liability, and concerted action and a joint venture with B&amp;B Hot Oil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The district court granted summary judgment dismissing all of Forster/Krebs' cross-claims against B&amp;B Hot Oil, ruling that Forster/Krebs waived their right to recover damages to their property under the provisions of the lease agreement with B&amp;B Hot Oil and that Forster/Krebs' insurer, Acuity, was not entitled to subrogation from B&amp;B Hot Oil. The court denied Forster/Krebs' motion to amend their pleadings against B&amp;B Hot Oil. The court also granted summary judgment dismissing Forster/Krebs' claims against JB's Welding for concerted action and a joint venture with B&amp;B Hot Oil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 5] As a result of the district court's rulings, Forster/Krebs' other remaining claims against JB's Welding for negligence and strict products liability were scheduled for a jury trial on March 9, 2017. On February 10, 2017, a stipulation for the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of Forster/Krebs' remaining claims against JB's Welding was filed in the district court. In the filed stipulation, which was signed by counsel for Forster/Krebs and counsel for JB's Welding, Forster/Krebs and JB's Welding agreed the court shall enter an order dismissing Forster/Krebs' claims against JB's Welding without prejudice. The court subsequently signed an order dismissing Forster/Krebs' claims against JB's Welding without prejudice and a judgment was entered dismissing those claims without prejudice. The effect of that judgment disposed of all the claims in the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Forster/Krebs appealed from the judgment, arguing the district court erred in: (1) dismissing their claims against B&amp;B Hot Oil and their insurer's subrogation claim against B&amp;B Hot Oil; (2) denying their motion to amend their pleadings against B&amp;B Hot Oil; and (3) dismissing with prejudice their claims against J&amp;B's Welding for concerted action and a joint venture. Forster/Krebs' appeal did not raise any issues arising from the stipulated dismissal without prejudice of their negligence and strict products liability claims against JB's Welding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 7] B&amp;B Hot Oil moved to dismiss Forster/Krebs' appeal and JB's Welding filed a brief in support of that motion. B&amp;B Hot Oil and JB's Welding contend this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction to hear this appeal, because the dismissal without prejudice of Forster/Krebs' remaining claims against JB's Welding circumvented N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b) and created an artificial final judgment for purposes of\n   appeal. Forster/Krebs opposes the motion to dismiss, arguing their appeal is from a final judgment and this Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. We stayed a decision on the motion to dismiss pending oral argument on the merits of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 8] It is well established that the right to appeal in this State is governed by statute, and if there is no statutory basis to hear an appeal, we must dismiss the appeal.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sanderson v.

The Court\n   may enter its Order for Dismissal without Prejudice without further notice to either party.\" The court subsequently dismissed the remaining claims without prejudice consistent with the parties' stipulation. The stipulation to dismiss without prejudice Forster/Krebs' remaining unadjudicated claims against JB's Welding purports to toll the statute of limitations for those claims pending appeal and does not have the effect of terminating those claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8436558\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/712/842/\">\n    2006 ND 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8436558\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/712/842/\">\n    712 N.W.2d 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under these circumstances, the dismissal without prejudice does not dispose of all of the claims and is not final. Additionally, the district court did not direct the entry of a final partial judgment with an express determination that there is no just reason to delay an appeal as required by N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Lacking a final judgment or proper N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b) certification, there is no right to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 16] Although parties may stipulate to a dismissal of remaining unadjudicated claims without prejudice under N.D.R.Civ.P. 41(a), the parties nevertheless may not use that procedure to circumvent the requirements of N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b) and manufacture finality for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8\n   <em>\n    Moore's Federal Practice\n   </em>\n   , at \u00a7 41.34[7][b] (recognizing voluntary dismissal without prejudice may not be used to manufacture finality for purposes of appellate jurisdiction). The application of a bright-line test is consistent with N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b) and our finality jurisprudence for appellate jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 17] We conclude the judgment is not final for purposes of our appellate jurisdiction, and we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 18] Jon J.
