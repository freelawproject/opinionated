Jackie Huft argues there is insufficient evidence showing he engaged in any acts that adversely affected his daughter's safety, security, or privacy. We conclude the district court abused its discretion in issuing the disorderly conduct\n   restraining order against Jackie Huft because the petitioner, the daughter's guardian, did not present evidence of specific acts or threats constituting disorderly conduct and the findings fail to specify reasonable grounds for a disorderly conduct restraining order under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 12.1-31-01(1). We summarily reverse the one-year disorderly conduct restraining order against Jackie Huft. N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitzel v.
