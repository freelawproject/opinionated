(Stern Oil) against James R. Brown (Brown). In\n   <em>\n    Stern Oil Co., Inc. v. Brown\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Stern Oil I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7073406\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/817/395/\">\n    2012 S.D. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7073406\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/817/395/\">\n    817 N.W.2d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Brown appealed a judgment awarding Stern Oil over eight years of lost profits exceeding $900,000. This Court reversed and remanded, determining the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Stern Oil on its breach of contract claims against Brown and by denying Brown's fraud\n   claims against Stern Oil. On remand, a jury found in favor of Stern Oil on the breach of contract and fraud claims and awarded $260,464 in damages. Stern Oil appeals that award, raising three issues for our review. Brown raises one issue by notice of review. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2.] Stern Oil is a fuel and petroleum distributor based in Freeman operated by Scott and Staci Stern and Scott's father, Gillas. The business supplies fuel at locations across the Midwest. Brown is a businessman from Gettysburg. Brown operates two convenience stores in North Sioux City, South Dakota: Goode to Go and Freeway Mobil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3.] In 2005, Brown and Stern Oil entered into two ten-year Motor Fuel Supply Agreements (MFSAs) for Stern Oil to supply ExxonMobil branded fuel to Brown to sell at his two convenience stores. The MFSAs required Stern Oil to sell and deliver up to a contractually determined \"Maximum Annual Volume\" of fuel to Brown. Brown was obligated to purchase at least 75% of that amount annually. Approximately a year and a half into the ten-year agreements, Brown stopped purchasing fuel from Stern Oil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4.] Stern Oil sued Brown for breach of contract. Brown counterclaimed and asserted that Stern Oil fraudulently induced him to enter into the MFSAs by verbally guaranteeing Brown a five-cent profit on each gallon of fuel sold at his convenience stores. Brown also asserted defenses to the validity of the MFSAs. The circuit court granted Stern Oil's motion for summary judgment on its claims for breach of contract and on Brown's fraud claims. The parties waived a jury on the issue of damages, and the case proceeded to a bench trial in October 2009 and January 2010. The circuit court awarded Stern Oil lost profits in the amount of $925,317. Brown appealed and this Court reversed in\n   <em>\n    Stern Oil I,\n   </em>\n   determining that genuine issues of material fact existed on Stern Oil's breach of contract claim and Brown's fraud claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7073406\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/817/395/\">\n    2012 S.D. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7073406\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/817/395/\">\n    817 N.W.2d at 403-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5.] On remand to the circuit court, the matter proceeded to a jury trial on liability and damages. The jury found that Brown breached the MFSAs and rejected Brown's fraud claims and other contract defenses. The jury awarded Stern Oil lost profit damages in the amount of $260,464. Following the trial, Stern Oil moved for recovery of prejudgment interest. Stern Oil also moved for costs and attorney's fees under the terms of the MFSAs requiring the \"non-prevailing party\" to pay attorney's fees and costs to the \"prevailing party.\" The circuit court determined that Stern Oil was not the prevailing party and denied attorney's fees or costs to either party. The circuit court entered a judgment on the jury's verdict and for prejudgment interest of $143,708.77 on the damage award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6.] Stern Oil appeals the circuit court's judgment, raising three issues, which we reorder and restate as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Whether the circuit court erred in instructing the jury that Stern Oil's damages had to be foreseeable to Brown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2. Whether the circuit court erred by excluding Stern Oil's lost profit evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   3. Whether the circuit court erred in determining that Stern Oil was not a prevailing party entitled to attorney's fees and costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 7.] Brown's notice of review challenges the circuit court's award of prejudgment interest. Brown asks this Court to consider whether prejudgment interest was erroneously calculated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Whether the circuit court erred in instructing the jury that Stern Oil's damages had to be foreseeable to Brown.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 8.] Stern Oil objected to the following damage instructions at trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Instruction No. 30\n   </strong>\n   : The measure of damages for a breach of contract is the amount which will compensate the aggrieved party for all determent legally caused by the breach, or which, in the ordinary course of things, would be likely to result from the breach. Damages for a breach of contract which are not clearly ascertainable in both their nature and origin are unrecoverable. Consequential damages must be reasonably foreseeable by the breaching party at the time of contracting. If consequential damages were not reasonably foreseeable, then they are not recoverable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Instruction No. 30A\n   </strong>\n   : Consequential damages are damages that do not arise within the scope of the buyer-seller transaction, but rather stem from losses incurred by the non-breaching party in its dealings, often with third parties, which were a proximate result of the breach, and which were reasonably foreseeable by the breaching party at the time of contracting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 9.] Stern Oil claims it was reversible error for the circuit court to give these instructions. It argues that lost profits resulting from an immediate payment discount given by ExxonMobil were recoverable as direct damages and not as consequential damages, and as such, the damages were not subject to a foreseeability requirement. Brown contends that any profits arising from the discount received from ExxonMobil were consequential to the breach of the MFSAs because they were based upon a third-party contractual agreement between Stern Oil and ExxonMobil. Brown was not a party to that agreement and claimed he was not aware of its terms. He maintains the jury was properly instructed. In the alternative, Brown claims that if an error occurred, it was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 10.] In its complaint and at trial, Stern Oil asked for damages in the form of lost profits caused by Brown's breach of the MFSAs. Stern Oil presented evidence showing that there were three sources of profit that Stern Oil would have earned under the MFSAs. These sources of profit included: a 1.5-cent markup per gallon above the price paid by Stern Oil; profit earned by Stern Oil for transporting the fuel to Brown's convenience stores; and a 1.25% discount Stern Oil received from ExxonMobil for immediate payment on fuel Stern Oil purchased from ExxonMobil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 11.] At trial, Scott Stern (Stern) testified that the 1.25% prompt-payment discount received from ExxonMobil is a part of the total profit Stern Oil receives under the MFSAs. Stern stated that when Stern Oil takes ExxonMobil fuel from a terminal, ExxonMobil debits Stern Oil's bank account for the cost of the fuel the next business day. Thereafter, Stern oil receives a 1.25% credit off the purchase price of the fuel. Stern also testified that Stern Oil is not given an option regarding the terms of the discount and that ExxonMobil has been providing Stern Oil with the prompt-payment discount for at least 15 years. Stern claimed that Stern Oil relies on the 1.25% discount to set the amount of its markup on fuel and freight charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 12.] The jury awarded lost profit damages to Stern Oil as follows: (1) $176,152 for gasoline; (2) $0 for diesel fuel; (3) $61,653 for freight; (4) $0 for the Stern Oil discount of 1.25%; and (5) $22,659 for BIP contract damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stern Oil claims\n   that the jury did not award lost profits from the 1.25% fuel discount because the circuit court erroneously instructed the jury on its lost profit claim.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A trial court has discretion in the wording and arrangement of its jury instructions, and therefore we generally review a trial court's decision to grant or deny a particular instruction under the abuse of discretion standard. However, no court has discretion to give incorrect, misleading, conflicting, or confusing instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Karst v.

SDCL 57A-2-102. Fuel sold under the MFSAs qualifies as \"goods\" under the UCC definition, SDCL 57A-2-105(1), and both parties acknowledge that the UCC applies to this transaction. Under Title 57A, a seller's damages for breach of contract after nonacceptance or repudiation are generally measured by \"the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price[.]\" SDCL 57A-2-708(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Vanderwerff Implement, Inc. v.

Subsection (2) of SDCL 57A-2-708 provides an alternative measure of damages to a seller for nonacceptance or repudiation of a contract. Under subsection (2), if the contract/market price remedy is \"inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of damages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer[.]\" SDCL 57A-2-708(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 14.] This Court has previously recognized that the alternative lost profit formula is available under SDCL 57A-2-708(2) to a \"lost volume seller.\"\n   <em>\n    Vanderwerff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11908884\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/561/24/\">\n    1997 S.D. 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11908884\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/561/24/\">\n    561 N.W.2d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Unique Designs, Inc. v.

The circuit court instructed the jury on the question whether Stern Oil was a lost volume seller.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stern Oil presented unrefuted evidence that it had an unlimited supply of fuel available from ExxonMobil and lost the opportunity to sell the volume of fuel it otherwise would have sold to Brown under the MFSAs.

They are damages that reflect a party's loss of the benefit of the bargain from the agreement between the parties, not other economic harm caused by agreements collateral to the contract. The determination whether lost profits are direct or consequential is a question of law for the court considering the terms of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b6 24.] Here, the MFSAs created a franchise relationship between Stern Oil and Brown, which granted Brown the right to use ExxonMobil proprietary marketing material and sell the ExxonMobil-branded fuel. Brown acknowledged under the terms of the MFSAs that Stern Oil had a distributor relationship with ExxonMobil, which allowed Stern Oil to purchase ExxonMobil branded fuel and sell this fuel to Brown. Stern Oil's relationship with ExxonMobil was an integral part of Brown's ability to use ExxonMobil's proprietary marks and purchase the ExxonMobil-branded fuel under the MFSAs. Most importantly, all the profits claimed by Stern Oil arose from the sale of the fuel by Stern Oil to Brown under the MFSAs and included monies that were to be paid by Brown to Stern Oil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b6 25.] The lost profits claimed by Stern Oil are direct damages, not consequential damages. This is true whether the profits consisted of the markup on the fuel, the discount for immediate payment, or freight charges under the MFSAs. Instructions No. 30 and 30A instructing the jury on consequential damages were erroneous given that all the lost profits sought by Stern Oil were direct to the MFSAs. Because the lost profit damages flowed directly from the MFSAs, Stern Oil did not have an obligation to show foreseeability. We require a non-breaching party to show that consequential damages were foreseeable to the breaching party at the time of the contracting.\n   <em>\n    Colton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10697788\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/540/172/#p177\">\n    540 N.W.2d at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, direct damages for breach of contract do not have an element of foreseeability because they are, by their very nature, foreseeable by the parties at the time of contracting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b6 26.] Under the franchise relationship created by the MFSAs, it was foreseeable to Brown that Stern Oil expected to earn a profit from the fuel supplied to Brown. The MFSAs required Brown to \"use good faith and best efforts to maximize the sale\" of fuel at his convenience stores and required Brown to purchase at least 75% of the Maximum Annual Volume of fuel. These provisions put Brown on notice that Stern Oil expected to earn a profit under the MFSAs and enhance its profit as Brown sold a larger volume of fuel. The fact that Brown did not have knowledge of how Stern Oil calculated its profits or the specific price terms between ExxonMobil and Stern Oil for the fuel Stern Oil resold to Brown under the MFSAs did not mean\n   that lost profits were not foreseeable to Brown. To require such knowledge in business transactions would be antithetical to the arms-length bargaining process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b6 27.] The error in Instructions No. 30 and 30A was not harmless. Because the evidence showed that Brown did not know about the 1.25% discount, the jury certainly could have concluded from these instructions that it should not award any damages for the discount. Stern Oil's lost profit claim is remanded for a new trial on damages to include claims for the 1.5-cent-per-gallon markup on gasoline, the freight for the gasoline, and the 1.25% discount on the gasoline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether the circuit court erred by excluding Stern Oil's lost profit evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b6 28.] Prior to trial, Brown objected to portions of the proposed damage testimony from Stern Oil's expert, Dr. Ralph Brown (Dr. Brown). In an economic loss appraisal prepared for Stern Oil, Dr. Brown created four alternative models to calculate Stern Oil's alleged future lost profits over the remaining term of the MFSAs. These damage calculations were based on the volume of fuel that Stern Oil projected it would have sold to Brown during the remaining term of the MFSAs. The circuit court excluded three of the models. Thus, Stern Oil was limited to presenting evidence of lost profit damages under a fourth model, which was based on 75% of the fuel Brown actually purchased from Stern Oil in the first year under the MFSAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b6 29.] Stern Oil argues the circuit court erred by excluding Dr. Brown's other three damage calculation models and the evidence supporting those models. The three excluded scenarios were based on: (1) Brown purchasing (and selling) 100% of the projected Maximum Annual Volume of fuel under the MFSAs; (2) Brown purchasing 75% of the projected Maximum Annual Volume under the MFSAs; and (3) the actual amount of fuel sold to Brown in the first twelve months of the MFSAs. Stern Oil argues that all three excluded scenarios were supported by evidence and that the circuit court erred in not allowing Stern Oil to present each of these other models.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b6 30.] Brown argues the circuit court's ruling properly recognized the contractual language that Stern Oil was obligated to sell the Maximum Annual Volume of fuel under the MFSAs, while Brown was only obligated to purchase 75% of the Maximum Annual Volume. As noted by Brown, if he had only purchased that amount and nothing more, he would not have been in breach of the MFSAs. Thus, that minimum amount would constitute full performance, and Stern Oil is not entitled to recover anything greater.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b6 31.] Stern Oil's offer of proof shows that Stern would have testified concerning the projected volume of fuel that Brown would have purchased over the 10 years of the MFSAs. From these projections, Dr. Brown calculated the four damage models. Stern testified that he regularly made fuel sales projections for Stern Oil's franchise dealers such as Brown and that these projections served as the basis for the volumes set forth in the MFSAs for Brown\n   and other fuel retailers. Stern presented evidence that he projected the initial Maximum Annual Volume of fuel that Stern Oil was obligated to sell Brown during the first year of the MFSAs at 1.38 million gallons and 1.5 million gallons, respectively, for a total of approximately 2.88 million gallons of fuel annually. The evidence shows that Brown purchased approximately 2.4 million gallons of fuel at his convenience stores during the first year of the MFSAs. This was more than the 75% Brown was obligated to purchase during the first year of the MFSAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b6 32.] Stern also testified that he believed Brown would have continued to increase the annual amount of fuel sold over the remaining term of the MFSAs if Brown had not breached these agreements with Stern Oil. Stern based this testimony on his experience with many other Stern Oil franchisees. Stern testified that none of their current franchisees were purchasing less than the minimum contractual requirement of 75% of the Maximum Annual Volume and most were \"far exceeding that number.\" Stern also testified that over half of Stern Oil's current franchisees were exceeding the Maximum Annual Volume requirements, and all of them were within a \"percentage point or two\" of the 100% number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b6 33.] In refusing Stern Oil's offer of proof on damages, the circuit court concluded that Stern Oil could not recover anything more than \"the minimum performance that was required by the defendant.\" The circuit court's evidentiary ruling limited Stern Oil's recovery for future damages to no more than 75% of the actual fuel sales that Stern Oil sold to Brown during the first year of the MFSAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b6 34.] A circuit court's evidentiary rulings are presumed to be correct and reversed only if there is an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Table Steaks v.

Yet the circuit court limited Stern Oil to claiming future damages of 75% of the fuel Brown purchased during the first year, or 1.8 million gallons annually, rather than the actual sales made by Stern Oil during the first year of the MFSAs. The third scenario that the circuit court excluded would have permitted Stern Oil to present evidence of damages to the jury based on the actual sales to Brown during the first year of the MFSAs. Stern Oil's other two excluded damage scenarios used future projections that exceeded the historical sales of fuel during the first year. These projections were based upon Stern Oil's experience with other similar dealers under other MFSAs and expected future increases in the volume of fuel purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b6 36.] The circuit court's decision to exclude evidence of these other damage models was based primarily on its determination that Brown would have been able to fully perform under the remaining term of the MFSAs by purchasing 75% of the actual\n   first year fuel sales. This reading of the MFSAs assumed that the Maximum Annual Volume, and thus Brown's 75% minimum purchase requirement, was static and would never change under the remaining term of the MFSAs. This reading is inconsistent with section 4(b) of each MFSA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   For each month of the remaining contract years, the Maximum Monthly Volume for the current month shall be the greater of actual volume in the prior month or actual volume in the current month of the prior year purchased by Franchise Dealer from Distributor.

Stern Oil sought to introduce evidence that these projected volumes would increase in future years, which would in turn increase Brown's minimum purchase requirements. We give no deference to the circuit court's reading of a contract as contract interpretation is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Tri-City Assocs., L.P. v.

Based on the factual predicate in Stern Oil's offer of proof, it was a question for the jury whether any or portions of the four damage models premised on past sales and future projections accurately reflected Stern Oil's damages. It was error for the circuit court to exclude this evidence as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b6 39.] Brown argues that under SDCL 21-1-5, Stern Oil could not recover more than 75% of the Maximum Annual Volume, under any scenario, because Brown would have been in full compliance with the MFSAs if he purchased at least 75% of the Maximum Annual Volume. SDCL 21-1-5 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Notwithstanding the provisions of these statutes, no person can recover a greater amount in damages for the breach of an obligation than he could have gained by the full performance thereof on both sides, except in the cases specified in statutes providing exemplary damages or penal damages, and in statutes relating to damages for breach of promise to marry, for seduction, or wrongful injuries to animals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [\u00b6 40.] This statute limits the damages that a party may recover for breach of contract to the amount that the non-breaching party \"could have gained by the full performance thereof on both sides.\" SDCL 21-1-5. Full performance by both parties under the MFSAs, absent the breach, would have been for Stern Oil to sell up to the Maximum Annual Volume of fuel and Brown to pay for that volume of fuel. This established the maximum amount of damages under SDCL 21-1-5 that Stern Oil could have gained under the MFSAs. All four future damage scenarios, if the jury believed the projections, were within this statutory maximum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b6 41.] On remand, Stern Oil should be permitted to present evidence to the jury on all four of the future scenarios.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

He argues the circuit court erred in calculating prejudgment interest from the date that Brown first breached the contract on May 8, 2007, since the future damages awarded by the jury would have been sustained over the remaining term of the MFSAs. Stern Oil asserts that Brown failed to object to prejudgment interest at the circuit court level and that prejudgment interest was properly calculated. Other than a general objection to Stern Oil's motion for prejudgment interest, Brown's trial counsel's only objection to prejudgment interest was that it should not begin to accrue until after this Court's remand in\n   <em>\n    Stern Oil I\n   </em>\n   .

Considering our decision remanding this case for a new trial on damages and Brown's general objection to prejudgment interest, the Court declines to address the other issues raised by Brown as to whether the prejudgment interest under SDCL 21-1-13.1 was properly calculated on the future damages awarded in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [\u00b6 54.] The circuit court erred when it instructed the jury on consequential damages and the foreseeability of Stern Oil's lost profits to Brown at the time of contracting.

Because of these errors, we reverse the jury's verdict as it relates to the award for \"Motor Fuel\" and \"Stern Oil Discount of 1.25%\" and remand for a new trial on Stern Oil's damages for lost profits on gasoline consistent with this Court's decision. The circuit court's decision that Stern Oil was not the prevailing party is also reversed. On remand, the prevailing party should be determined consistent with this opinion. The jury's decision awarding BIP contract damages to Stern Oil in the amount of $22,659 and denying Stern Oil's lost profits claim for diesel fuel is considered final and neither claim shall be retried.

However, there is no similar consequential damages provision to a seller for a buyer's breach under SDCL 57A-1-708. Brown argues that consequential damages are not available to a seller seeking lost profits under SDCL 57A-1-208(2). However, it is unnecessary to resolve this issue because we determine that all the lost profits claimed by Stern Oil are direct damages.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    This does not in any way diminish claims of fraud or misrepresentation by a party in the negotiating process, but those claims were determined adverse to Brown by the jury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The jury rejected Stern Oil's claims for diesel sales, apparently determining Stern Oil had released Brown's contractual obligation to purchase diesel fuel under the MFSAs. Stern Oil has not challenged the jury's determination denying damages for diesel sales.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Although we reverse and remand the damage issue, we review the circuit court's prevailing party determination based on the result before the circuit court at the time it reviewed the issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    In this case, the MFSAs provide for payment of reasonable costs and attorney's fees. The circuit court has discretion to determine the amount of costs and attorney's fees that are reasonable. In assessing reasonableness, the circuit court must consider a number of factors, including the result obtained and:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n    (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount involved and the results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances; (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; (7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and (8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    <em>\n     Eagle Ridge Estates Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v.
