Mead appeals as of right his conviction, following a jury trial, of possessing methamphetamine, MCL 333.7403(2)(b)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ), as a fourth-offense habitual offender, MCL 769.12. The trial court sentenced him to serve 2 to 10 years' imprisonment. Defendant challenged the validity of the search in the trial court. In our prior opinion, we concluded that Mead, a passenger in a vehicle, lacked standing to challenge the search of a container in the vehicle under\n   <em>\n    People v.

Officer Richard Burkart testified that he stopped the vehicle for an expired license plate. Officer Burkart stated that Mead had a backpack on his lap. According to Officer Burkart, Taylor consented to a search of the vehicle, Officer Burkart asked Taylor and Mead to exit the vehicle, and Mead left the backpack \"on the front passenger floorboard.\" When Officer Burkart searched the vehicle, he opened the backpack and found methamphetamine.

The\n   <em>\n    LaBelle\n   </em>\n   vehicle's driver violated MCL 257.652(1), and the police stopped the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 891,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=732%20N.W.2d%20114\">\n    732 N.W.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Michigan Supreme Court concluded that the stop was objectively lawful.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . After the stop, the driver consented to a search of the vehicle. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .

However, the Supreme Court concluded that \"[t]he search of the backpack was valid,\" explaining that \"[b]ecause the stop of the vehicle was legal, the defendant, a passenger, lacked standing to challenge the subsequent search of the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

Mead was a passenger in a motor vehicle driven by Taylor. Officer Burkart stopped the vehicle. Mead has not challenged the validity of the stop. After the stop, Taylor consented to a search of the vehicle. Officer Burkart then searched an unlocked backpack in the vehicle's passenger compartment. Therefore, under\n   <em>\n    Labelle\n   </em>\n   , Mead lacked standing to challenge the search, and Officer Burkart had authority to search the backpack.\n   <em>\n    Labelle\n   </em>\n   is binding on this Court.\n   <em>\n    People v.

In citing caselaw from those courts, the Utah Supreme Court of Utah determined that courts evaluate the reasonableness of an officer's actions by analyzing several factors, such as the type of container searched, any identifying material on the outside of the container, the container's location, the number of containers, the number of passengers, and the passengers' conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 38-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   If\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   and its extension to searches of containers in automobiles as applied in foreign courts were the law in Michigan, an argument that Officer Burkart lacked a reasonable belief that Taylor had common authority over the backpack would have some merit. A backpack is a container used to store personal items, which suggests individual, rather than common, ownership.\n   <em>\n    Harding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6981203\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/282/31/#p34\">\n    282 P.3d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The relationship between Mead and Taylor suggests that Taylor would not have had authority over Mead's personal items. Mead testified\n   that he met Taylor on the night of the search. Taylor stated on a video of the traffic stop that Mead was in her car because she was dropping Mead off on her way to another destination. Officer Burkart testified that Mead had the backpack on his lap with his arms resting on either side at the time of the stop. The video shows that Officer Burkart searched the backpack while it was placed in the passenger side of the vehicle. Officer Burkart testified that he believed that the backpack belonged to Mead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, in Michigan,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   's common-authority framework does not apply to warrantless searches of containers in automobiles.
