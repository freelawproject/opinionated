See\n   <em>\n    Halbert v. Michigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209670\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/605/\">\n    545 U.S. 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209670\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/605/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209670\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/605/\">\n    162 L.Ed.2d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). The record reflects that defendant's appellate counsel did not file an application for leave to appeal, seek any other relief on the defendant's behalf, or move to withdraw based on the attorney's determination, after a thorough review of the trial record, that the appeal was wholly frivolous. Thus, through no fault of the defendant, he lost the right to seek leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals on direct review. On remand, new appellate counsel, once appointed, may file an application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals for consideration under the standard for direct appeals, and/or any appropriate postconviction motions in the circuit court, within six months of the date of the circuit court's order appointing counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Costs are imposed against the attorney, Tracie Gittleman, in the amount of $500, to be paid to the Clerk of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
