He argues, among other things, that the district court erred in the amount of its child support award; failed to follow the child support guidelines; and did not follow this Court's mandate on remand. He also contends the court erred in using pay stubs to calculate his child support obligation. We summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(2) and (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Gerald W. VandeWalle, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Jerod E.
