Each was sixteen years old at the time. J.B. and her mother, Jodie Jacobs (\"Jacobs\"), moved to North Dakota. Jacobs stated that she noticed a change in J.B.'s behavior after the move, including J.B. being more distant from Jacobs and spending more time on her cell phone. Jacobs attributed this change to J.B.'s relationship with R.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Jacobs, on behalf of J.B., petitioned the district court for a disorderly conduct restraining order against R.B. The petition alleged the following events: R.B. threatening suicide, which caused J.B. to visit a counselor for three hours; R.B. stating that \"J.B. is mine\" to Jacobs; R.B. telling J.B. to stop posting pictures of herself smiling because he didn't want to see her happy without him; R.B. telling J.B. to not be friends with girls that smoke cigarettes because doing so would prevent her from becoming \"the doctor she wanted to be\"; R.B. telling J.B. to wear his ring and sweatshirt, to not speak to any guys \"ever,\" and to disrespect Jacobs; R.B. indicating to J.B. that if she did not do what she said she was going to do, \"he would possibly hurt himself\"; J.B. crying and telling Jacobs that she does not want to see R.B. die; R.B. telling Jacobs that \"he will not stop\" and that she cannot control J.B. when she is eighteen; and R.B. sending a message to J.B.'s Snapchat account that said \"bad mother alert.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The district court issued a temporary restraining order. Following a hearing, the district court issued a two-year restraining order against R.B.

This Court will not reverse a district court's decision to grant a restraining order or to conduct a hearing absent an abuse of discretion. The district court abuses its discretion when it acts in an arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable manner, when it misinterprets or misapplies the law, or when its decision is not the product of a rational mental process leading to a reasoned determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Hanisch v.

The most a petitioner may establish at the hearing is thus the full scope of allegations in the petition.

N.D.C.C. \u00a7 12.1-31.2-01(1).

Further, the respondent was harassing her about a tax rebate from the IRS, by \"threatening to tell the IRS that [petitioner] forged his signature on an IRS return,\" and about her personal life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hanisch v.

We concluded the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting a restraining order because the text messages were intended\n   to adversely affect the petitioner's \"safety, security, and, in particular, intrude on her privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 9] As outlined above, the allegations in the petition included R.B. threatening suicide, which caused J.B. to visit a counselor for three hours, R.B. telling J.B. that \"he would possibly hurt himself\" if she didn't do what he instructed her to do, and R.B. telling J.B. to not speak to any guys. R.B. has not provided a transcript as required by N.D.R.App.P. 10(b)(1). Without a transcript, we do not know what testimony the district court heard or what oral findings it may have made. The appellant who fails to provide a transcript assumes the risk and consequences of his failure, and we resolve any ambiguity that could be resolved by a transcript against the appellant. We can provide meaningful review only by presuming that the petitioner and appellee established at the hearing every fact alleged in the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 10] Taking every allegation in the petition as true, there are no reasonable grounds to believe R.B. engaged in disorderly conduct. The petition did not allege R.B. threatened J.B. with violence, nor did it state J.B. or Jacobs were fearful for J.B.'s safety or security. It did not allege threats that could have adverse legal consequences, as in\n   <em>\n    Skadberg\n   </em>\n   , or privacy concerns, as in\n   <em>\n    Hanisch\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the petition focused on R.B.'s manipulation of J.B. and his disrespectful behavior toward Jacobs. This is not enough under\n   <em>\n    Cusey\n   </em>\n   , which requires more than wanting an individual out of one's life. Further, section 12.1-31.2-01(1), N.D.C.C., requires R.B. to have intended to adversely affect J.B.'s safety, security, or privacy. The petition did not allege that this was R.B.'s intention or provide any evidence indicating he acted with this intention or continued to act knowing this was the result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328656\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/890/817/\">\n    2017 ND 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328656\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/890/817/\">\n    890 N.W.2d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"[i]t is not enough to show the respondent's actions are unwanted; rather, the petitioner must show specific unwanted acts that are intended to affect the safety, security, or privacy of another person\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 11] The district court abused its discretion by granting a disorderly conduct restraining order on the basis that there were reasonable grounds to believe R.B. engaged in disorderly conduct.
