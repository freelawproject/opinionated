We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 5, 2015, appellant approached a family gathering in the front yard of a residence in Minneapolis, exposed his penis, and danced provocatively. Multiple family members, including three children under the age of 16, witnessed appellant's exposure. During the incident, witnesses attempted to stop appellant from exposing himself, videotaped appellant's conduct, called 911, and eventually removed him from the area in front of their home. When the police arrived, they encountered appellant in the street in front of the residence and arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant was charged with one count of indecent exposure in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20617.23\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 617.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 2(1) (2014). Prior to the presentation of evidence, the defense made a series of motions stating its intent to rely on the statutory defense of voluntary intoxication and the common-law defense of involuntary intoxication. The district court determined that because indecent exposure is a general-intent crime, appellant was not entitled to an instruction on the statutory defense of voluntary intoxication. But the court ruled that the common-law defense of involuntary intoxication would still be available to appellant, provided he could make a prima facie showing on each element of the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, witnesses testified that appellant exposed himself within five feet of their group during the incident. Video evidence of the incident was played for the jury. Multiple witnesses testified that appellant appeared to be intoxicated and nonresponsive. The arresting officer testified that appellant appeared to be \"intoxicated and/or drugged.\" No tests were conducted to determine what, if any, substances appellant ingested prior to the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant testified that, prior to the incident, he smoked what he believed to be\n   shisha-a flavored tobacco consumed through a hookah-with some men he met that day. He testified that after smoking the substance, he felt dizzy and disoriented. His reaction to the substance intensified and he vomited, blacked out, and woke up in the jail hours later-with no recollection of the incident. Appellant testified that he never experienced a similar reaction to shisha in the past and was not under the influence of any other drugs or alcohol that day. At the conclusion of his testimony, appellant rested and requested that the jury receive the involuntary-intoxication instruction. The district court denied appellant's request for this instruction, finding that appellant failed to make a prima facie showing on any of the elements of the defense. Appellant moved for reconsideration and the district court heard the state's response prior to giving the final jury instructions. The district court denied the motion to reconsider. Appellant was found guilty and convicted of gross misdemeanor indecent exposure in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20617.23\">\n    Minn.

To be entitled to the instruction, appellant needed to establish that (1) he \"was innocently mistaken as to the nature of the substance taken\"; (2) the \"intoxication was caused by the intoxicating substance in question and not by some other intoxicant\"; and (3) he was temporarily mentally ill at the time of the offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662388\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/596/241/#p251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotations omitted). A prima facie showing is one that is \"[s]ufficient to establish a fact or raise a presumption unless disproved or rebutted.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1382 (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Appellant presented evidence in the form of his own testimony that he went to the home of two men he had never met before, smoked a substance in a hookah he believed to be shisha, and blacked out. Through the testimony of other witnesses, he established that he appeared to be intoxicated during the incident. The district court found that appellant failed to make a prima facie case for the defense because he presented \"no evidence, no witnesses, and only speculation [about what] was in that hookah\" and that it was unknown whether there was any substance other than the typical flavoring and tobacco that comprises shisha. Upon review of the record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that appellant failed to make the required showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As to the first factor, appellant did not identify what, if any, substance was the source of his intoxication. He presented evidence that he smoked what he believed to be flavored tobacco, he became dizzy and vomited, and woke up in jail. He testified that he never had a reaction like that to tobacco in the past. He did not present any evidence that there was any substance other than tobacco in the hookah and thus did not establish that he was \"innocently mistaken as to the nature of the substance taken\" because he did not establish that he innocently mistook the shisha that he voluntarily consumed for something other than the flavored tobacco he believed it to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Likewise, as to the second factor, that the intoxication was caused by the intoxicating substance in question and not by some other intoxicant, appellant failed to make the requisite showing. In\n   <em>\n    Voorhees\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court confronted similar circumstances to this case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662388\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/596/241/#p251\">\n    596 N.W.2d at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the defendant pursued a theory of involuntary intoxication as the result of a reaction to Prozac.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662388\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/596/241/#p251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662388\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/596/241/#p251\">\n    at 249-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At trial, it was established that he had ingested methamphetamine, alcohol, and Prozac on the night of his offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662388\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/596/241/#p251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662388\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/596/241/#p251\">\n    at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And because it was \"impossible to ascertain whether his intoxication was caused by Prozac alone or some combination of the Prozac, alcohol, and methamphetamine he ingested prior to the killing,\" the supreme court concluded that he \"made no prima facie showing that his involuntary intoxication, if any, was caused by Prozac and not some other intoxicant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662388\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/596/241/#p251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662388\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/596/241/#p251\">\n    at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, it was impossible to ascertain whether appellant's intoxication was caused by the tobacco, some unknown intoxicant, the flavoring in the tobacco, a combination of all three, or something else he ingested that day. In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Voorhees\n   </em>\n   , appellant failed to make a prima facie showing that his intoxication was due to an unknown and unidentified substance rather than the other substances in the shisha he voluntarily consumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Turning to the third factor, appellant was required to make a prima facie showing that \"at the time of committing the alleged criminal act,\" he \"was laboring under such a defect of reason, from [mental illness or cognitive impairment], as not to know the nature of [the] act, or that it was wrong.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20611.026\">\n    Minn.

Appellant presented evidence that he blacked out, and was non-communicative and unsteady on his feet. The state presented evidence that police found appellant \"leaning up against a vehicle with his stomach, as if he was hiding something\" with his zipper \"halfway down.\" The district court found that, because appellant \"hid his privates\" when the uniformed police officer approached and \"put himself back together and put his genitals back in his pants,\" he knew his behavior to be criminal and therefore there was no mental defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The supreme court has endorsed \"a district court's rejection of a mental-illness defense based in part on a defendant's behavior before and after crimes, such as planning and concealment, flight from authorities, disposal of evidence, and expressing awareness of consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court affirmed a district court's rejection of a mental-illness defense based in part on evidence that the defendant \"refused to identify himself and resisted arrest\" and \"indicated an awareness of the consequences of his behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10664708\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/352/13/#p15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the evidence indicated that appellant was aware of the potential consequences of his behavior and attempted to conceal evidence of his crime when the police arrived.
