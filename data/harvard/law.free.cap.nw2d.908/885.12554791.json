On order of the Court, the application is again considered. Pursuant to MCR 7.305(H)(1), and in light of the prosecutor's concession that defendant's argument that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek suppression of his prior convictions under MRE 609 was not decided against him on direct appeal, we VACATE the Court of Appeals opinion and REMAND this case to that court for reconsideration. On remand, the Court of Appeals shall consider all of the defendant's claims of error in light of the prosecutor's concession and determine whether he is entitled to relief under MCR 6.508(D) under the proper standard, namely reviewing the Wayne Circuit Court's decision to grant the motion for relief from judgment for an abuse of discretion and reviewing its\n   factual findings for clear error.
