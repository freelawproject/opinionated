MCR 7.305(H)(1). In lieu of granting leave to appeal, we VACATE the order of the Court of Appeals and we REMAND this case to that court for further consideration in light of this Court's November 16, 2017 order in\n   <em>\n    Marik v. Marik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%20918\">\n    501 Mich. 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -919,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20194\">\n    903 N.W.2d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). On remand, we DIRECT the Court of Appeals to issue an opinion specifically addressing the issue whether the order in question may affect the custody of a minor within the meaning of MCR 7.202(6)(a)(iii), or otherwise be appealable by right under MCR 7.203(A). If the Court of Appeals determines that the Oakland Circuit Court Family Division's order is appealable by right, it shall take jurisdiction over the defendant-appellant's claim of appeal and address its merits. If the Court of Appeals determines that the Oakland Circuit Court Family Division's order is not appealable by right, it may then dismiss the defendant-appellant's\n   claim of appeal for lack of jurisdiction, or exercise its discretion to treat the claim of appeal as an application for leave to appeal and grant the application. See\n   <em>\n    Varran v. Granneman (On Remand)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777725\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/312/591/\">\n    312 Mich.App. 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20N.W.2d%20242\">\n    880 N.W.2d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), and\n   <em>\n    Wardell v. Hincka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4084511\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/297/127/\">\n    297 Mich.App. 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133 n. 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=822%20N.W.2d%20278\">\n    822 N.W.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). We direct the Court of Appeals' attention to the fact that we have also remanded the related case of\n   <em>\n    Royce v. Laporte\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 156131) to the Court of Appeals and that\n   <em>\n    Marik v. Marik\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 155833), and\n   <em>\n    Madson v. Jaso (After Remand)\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 154529), have also been remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration. We further note that this Court has opened an administrative file, ADM File No. 2017-20, to consider amending MCR 7.202(6)(a)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
