Following an investigation, the Committee on Character and Fitness (Committee) refused to certify to the State Board of Law Examiners that petitioner possessed the good moral character and general fitness necessary for the practice of law. Petitioner requested a hearing on that decision and, on October 17, 1988, and November 15, 1988, the hearing panel of the Committee received evidence concerning his character and fitness to practice law. The panel initially voted 4 to 3 to recommend certification, but one member of the panel changed his vote. As a result, the full Committee directed the panel to reconvene and, on January 22, 1990, the panel voted 5 to 2 to deny certification. Petitioner filed exceptions to the report and recommendation of the hearing panel (107 Ill. 2d R. 708(d)).</p> <p id=\"b254-7\" pgmap=\"254\">The following issues are raised on review: (1) whether the hearing panel arbitrarily disregarded petitioner\u2019s evidence that he suffered an alcohol-related blackout on March 28, 1984; and (2) whether the hearing panel\u2019s recommendation to deny certification was arbitrary.</p> <p id=\"b254-8\" pgmap=\"254\">The following evidence was adduced at petitioner\u2019s hearing. He was born in 1944 and has resided in Chicago and its surrounding communities his entire life. Petitioner testified that he began drinking alcohol at the age of 14. He stated that while he had used marijuana and cocaine sometimes in the past, he preferred alcohol.</p> <p id=\"b254-9\" pgmap=\"254(18) 255(114)\">Petitioner had engaged in a series of criminal acts, beginning in December 1958, when he was arrested with four high school classmates for riding in a stolen motor vehicle. He pleaded guilty in juvenile court and was sentenced to one year of supervision. In May 1964, petitioner was arrested as a result of a barroom altercation. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, was fined $250 and served two days in jail. In March 1974, he pleaded guilty to the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol. He was fined $500 and his driver\u2019s license was revoked for one year. In November 1977, petitioner refused to take a breathalyzer test and his driver\u2019s license was revoked for 90 days because of his refusal to take the test.</p> <p id=\"b255-5\" pgmap=\"255\">In 1978, petitioner began working as a hearing officer with the Cook County assessor\u2019s office. In his employment application, petitioner included one prior position which he never held and failed to include any of his prior arrests. In 1981, petitioner entered the evening program at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. In his application for admission, petitioner included one prior position which he never held and failed to include his job as a bouncer in a bar.</p> <p id=\"b255-6\" pgmap=\"255\">In 1982, petitioner entered the Chicago police academy and was graduated first in his class. As a policeman, petitioner received five honorable mentions. Five or six complaints were made against petitioner but none of them were sustained.</p> <p id=\"b255-7\" pgmap=\"255(87) 256(13)\">The following incident took place on March 27, 1984, and March 28, 1984, while petitioner was on furlough from the Chicago police department. At approximately 11:30 p.m. on March 27, 1984, petitioner went to the Snuggery Lounge in Chicago. In the course of three to four hours, petitioner drank five or six Southern Comfort Manhattans which, according to the record, contained two to three ounces of alcohol per drink. Throughout the evening, petitioner was accompanied by Mr. Hall and Mr. Terry Finnegan. Petitioner knew Hall from the Rush Street area but he had never met Finnegan before.</p> <p id=\"b256-5\" pgmap=\"256\">At approximately 1:30 a.m., a prostitute, Brenda Yearby, solicited petitioner for an act of sex and informed him that he could meet her at the Paxton Hotel in Chicago. He told her that he was a policeman and suggested that she leave the bar. Yearby, however, remained there with her companion, Rufus Terry. Petitioner left to use the washroom; when he returned he noticed that his drink tasted bitter. He testified that he experienced a complete blackout which lasted 14 to 16 hours. There is no medical evidence in the record which indicates that petitioner\u2019s blackout was drug-induced. He maintains that the blackout was caused by his addiction to alcohol and his overconsumption of alcohol that evening.</p> <p id=\"b256-6\" pgmap=\"256\">The record reveals that Yearby and Terry carried an attache case containing 1,000 $1 bills and an additional $140. At some point during the evening Terry opened the case in the lounge. Petitioner did not see the attache case in the lounge. According to him, Finnegan saw the case and he told petitioner that the case contained little bags of white powder.</p> <p id=\"b256-7\" pgmap=\"256(116) 257(121)\">At approximately 4:30 a.m., petitioner and his two companions left the lounge and went to the Paxton Hotel. The hotel clerk, Charles Garner, testified that petitioner \u201cstaggered through the door\u201d and appeared drunk. Petitioner showed Garner his badge and told him that he was on a \u201cdrug investigation.\u201d He demanded Yearby\u2019s room key, but Garner refused to give it to him. Garner testified that petitioner became extremely abusive, used profane language and threatened him with his pistol. Garner relented and brought petitioner to Year-by\u2019s room. On the way to the room petitioner kicked and beat Garner and threatened him further with his pistol. Garner gave petitioner the room key, but petitioner was not able to unlock the door. Petitioner then fired one shot into the ceiling, one into the door, and he used his body to open the door and found Yearby in the room. He placed his pistol against Yearby\u2019s head and asked her where Terry was. He found Terry naked in the closet and ordered him to lie on the bed. After a search of the room, petitioner found the attache case under some clothing. The case was opened; it contained the money but not the drugs. Petitioner then attempted to telephone the police, but he was unable to get through because no one was tending the hotel switchboard. Petitioner confiscated the attache case and left the hotel:</p> <p id=\"b257-5\" pgmap=\"257\">Yearby and Terry called the 911 emergency number. Chicago police officer Michael Williamson responded quickly to the call and conducted a brief investigation at the hotel. Officer Williamson then proceeded immediately to petitioner\u2019s apartment. Officer Williamson confronted petitioner outside his apartment and asked petitioner what he had been doing. Petitioner stated he was out having a good time and that he was on his way to Cicero. Petitioner was placed under arrest and 255 one dollar bills were found in the dresser drawer of petitioner\u2019s apartment.</p> <p id=\"b257-6\" pgmap=\"257\">After he made bond, petitioner was voluntarily committed to Ingalls Memorial Hospital for detoxification. He was then transferred to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he remained for two weeks. Petitioner testified that he was suicidal for several days following the incident.</p> <p id=\"b257-7\" pgmap=\"257(59) 258(65)\">Petitioner was charged with home invasion, armed robbery, residential burglary, armed violence and theft. After a bench trial, petitioner was found guilty of the misdemeanor offense of theft in an amount less than $300, and was sentenced to one year of conditional discharge. Petitioner was acquitted of the remaining charges. The court found that petitioner did not possess the mental state element of those offenses because he thought he was acting in the line of duty. In support of that finding, the court noted that petitioner\u2019s intellectual ability was substantially reduced as a result of his over-consumption of alcohol. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. 144 Ill. App. 3d 1175 (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23).</p> <p id=\"b258-5\" pgmap=\"258\">After an administrative hearing, petitioner was discharged from the Chicago police department. That decision was upheld by the circuit court and appellate court. (177 Ill. App. 3d 583.) Petitioner maintains that he did not receive a fair hearing because the police board did not consider whether the incident was causally related to his addiction to alcohol.</p> <p id=\"b258-6\" pgmap=\"258\">Petitioner testified that his criminal or violent behavior always occurred when he was under the influence of alcohol, and he was never in any kind of trouble when he was not under the influence of alcohol. He stated that he had suffered blackouts in the past as a result of his over-consumption of alcohol, but never of the magnitude of March 28,1984.</p> <p id=\"b258-7\" pgmap=\"258\">Petitioner testified that he began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings once he was released from the hospital. He stated that he attends AA meetings three times per week, has chaired meetings, has served as a secretary, and has sponsored two persons. He further stated that all of his friends are AA members and he regularly attends AA social functions.</p> <p id=\"b258-8\" pgmap=\"258\">Petitioner testified that he has not consumed any alcohol or taken any mood-altering drugs since March 28, 1984. He admits that he is an alcoholic and is \u201cpowerless over all of the mind and mood altering drugs.\u201d He testified that he is confident that he will not drink alcohol or take drugs again. Finally, petitioner apologized for what he had done.</p> <p id=\"b259-4\" pgmap=\"259\">Petitioner\u2019s sister, Carol Ryan, testified on petitioner\u2019s behalf. She stated that their mother passed away in August 1983, and at that point petitioner began drinking more heavily. She further stated that petitioner became violent when he was under the influence of alcohol, but was a \u201ckind, considerate\u201d person when sober.</p> <p id=\"b259-5\" pgmap=\"259\">Ryan testified that she, like petitioner, is a recovering alcoholic. She stated that, based on her relationship with her brother and her experience as a member of AA, she is confident that petitioner will never drink alcohol again. She testified that she has not seen petitioner drink alcohol since March 28,1984.</p> <p id=\"b259-6\" pgmap=\"259\">Five friends of petitioner who are members of AA also testified on petitioner\u2019s behalf. They stated that petitioner has often expressed regret over the incident of March 28, 1984. They further stated that, based on petitioner\u2019s personality, desire and active involvement in AA, they do not believe petitioner will ever drink alcohol again.</p> <p id=\"b259-7\" pgmap=\"259\">The five members of AA further testified that they each suffered blackouts in the past as a result of the overconsumption of alcohol, and that they each did things while under the influence of alcohol that they later regretted. They expressed the opinion that alcoholics frequently suffer blackouts.</p> <p id=\"b259-8\" pgmap=\"259\">Dr. Jack Arbit, a clinical psychologist, interviewed petitioner, examined his history and gave him a series of neuropsychological and personality tests. Dr. Arbit opined that petitioner suffered from \u201calcohol dependence and chronic anxiety reaction.\u201d He noted that petitioner is deeply committed to AA and to reorganizing his life. He believed that petitioner has the ability to abstain from alcohol and to overcome the stresses and demands of life and the practice of law.</p> <p id=\"b259-9\" pgmap=\"259(25) 260(43)\">Dr. Arbit testified that blackouts typically occur as a result of the overconsumption of alcohol. He further testified that alcoholics suffer blackouts more frequently during the later stages of their addiction. It was his opinion that petitioner suffered a blackout on March 28, 1984, and that the incident on that date was causally related to petitioner\u2019s history of alcoholism and overconsumption of alcohol that evening.</p> <p id=\"b260-5\" pgmap=\"260\">Mary Larsen, a senior certified addictions counselor, met with petitioner on several occasions and reviewed his history. Larsen testified that petitioner was \u201cjust one of millions\u201d who have performed violent or immoral acts while under the influence of alcohol. She stated that, in her experience, a large percentage of alcoholics suffer blackouts. She further stated that a large percentage of police officers who have undergone treatment for alcoholism have used their weapons when it was inappropriate to do so. Larsen concluded that petitioner is dedicated to abstinence \u2022 and is taking the correct steps to remain sober. She opined that petitioner is not capable of performing bad or violent acts when he is not under the influence of alcohol.</p> <p id=\"b260-6\" pgmap=\"260\">The first issue presented for review is whether the hearing panel arbitrarily disregarded petitioner\u2019s evidence that he suffered an alcohol-related blackout on March 28, 1984. The hearing panel heard a great deal of evidence on the subject of alcohol-related blackouts. The evidence was comprised of the testimony of petitioner and the testimony of petitioner\u2019s lay and expert witnesses. Nonetheless, \u201c[cjertain members of the hearing panel experienced doubts as to the possibility that a \u2018black out\u2019 does occur as a result of the excessive consumption of alcohol.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b260-7\" pgmap=\"260\">Petitioner presented two expert witnesses who testified that it is possible for someone to suffer a blackout as a result of the overconsumption of alcohol. In fact, both experts testified that blackouts are a common problem for alcoholics. There was no expert testimony to the contrary.</p> <p id=\"b261-4\" pgmap=\"261\">The weight accorded expert testimony must be decided by the trier of fact. (Miller v. Pillsbury Co. (1965), 33 Ill. 2d 514, 516.) Even if several competent experts concur in their opinion and no opposing expert testimony is offered, it is still within the province of the trier of fact to weigh the credibility of the expert evidence and to decide the issue. (People v. Harvey (1919), 286 Ill. 593, 604.) However, the uncontradicted and unimpeached opinion of an expert cannot be rejected arbitrarily. (R. Hunter, Trial Handbook for Illinois Lawyers, Civil, \u00a745.16, at 573 (6th ed. 1989); 31A Am. Jur. 2d Expert &amp; Opinion Evidence \u00a7135 (1989).) An opinion of an expert is to be accorded such weight that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances of the case, reasonably attaches to it. Harvey, 286 Ill. at 604.</p> <p id=\"b261-5\" pgmap=\"261\">The Committee report and the record amply demonstrate to this court that the expert testimony on alcohol-related blackouts was not arbitrarily disregarded. In their concluding remarks of their report, the Committee noted that \u201c[c]ertain members experienced doubts as to the possibility that a \u2018black out\u2019 does occur as a result of the excessive consumption of alcohol.\u201d A doubt is simply an inclination to disbelieve. (Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 679 (1986).) Disbelieving expert testimony does not mean that the testimony was arbitrarily rejected.</p> <p id=\"b261-6\" pgmap=\"261(82) 262(20)\">In addition, the record of the hearing before the Committee demonstrates that the Committee did not simply reject the testimony on alcohol-related blackouts in an arbitrary fashion. In fact, Committee member Robert E Martwick expressed interest in blackout episodes and therefore asked petitioner\u2019s expert, Dr. Jack Arbit, about the behavior of persons who are in an alcohol-related blackout state. The other expert who testified on behalf of the petitioner, Mary Larsen, was asked questions about alcohol-related blackouts by the attorney representing the Committee, Edward Bradley, as well as Committee members Henry Field, Ronald Orner, and the Committee chairman, William Maddux.</p> <p id=\"b262-5\" pgmap=\"262\">The second issue presented for review is whether the hearing panel\u2019s recommendation to deny certification was arbitrary. Petitioner bears the burden of proving that he possesses the good moral character and general fitness necessary for the practice of law. (In re DeBartolo (1986), 111 Ill. 2d 1, 5.) When a hearing panel concludes that a petitioner does not possess the good moral character and general fitness necessary for the practice of law and recommends to deny certification, the court will not reverse unless that recommendation was arbitrary. In re Ascher (1980), 81 Ill. 2d 485, 498; In re Latimer (1957), 11 Ill. 2d 327, 330; In re Frank (1920), 293 Ill. 263, 264; but see In re Loss (1987), 119 Ill. 2d 186, 193-94 (when the Committee recommends to certify the applicant, the court will not reverse unless the record shows by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner is neither rehabilitated nor fit to practice law).</p> <p id=\"b262-6\" pgmap=\"262\">It is apparent from the Committee\u2019s report and from the record of the hearing before the Committee that the Committee considered the totality of the petitioner\u2019s background, including his rehabilitation efforts since the incident of March 28, 1984, before concluding that petitioner did not possess the good moral character and general fitness necessary for the practice of law. The record is replete with information about petitioner which supports the Committee\u2019s determination that petitioner does not possess the requisite character to practice law. Therefore, we hold that the Committee\u2019s recommendation to deny certification was not arbitrary.</p> <p id=\"b262-7\" pgmap=\"262(38) 263(58)\">The Committee deemed the petitioner\u2019s arrest record to be significant. At the age of 14, in 1958, petitioner was arrested for riding in a stolen motor vehicle. He pleaded guilty to this offense in juvenile court and he was given one year\u2019s supervision. At the age of 19, in 1964, petitioner pleaded guilty to a disorderly conduct charge which stemmed from a barroom altercation. Also, in a separate incident in 1964, petitioner was again arrested on a disorderly conduct charge. This charge stemmed from an argument petitioner had with a prostitute. Petitioner was acquitted.</p> <p id=\"b263-5\" pgmap=\"263\">In 1972, petitioner was arrested as a result of a fight at a wedding reception. Petitioner was acquitted of this charge. In 1974, petitioner was arrested on a battery warrant which was issued as a result of petitioner\u2019s conduct in evicting a patron from a tavern. Petitioner was acquitted of this charge also.</p> <p id=\"b263-6\" pgmap=\"263\">Petitioner was charged with driving while intoxicated in 1974 and 1977. In 1974, he pleaded guilty to this offense and his driving privileges were revoked for one year. In 1977, he was found not guilty of driving while intoxicated, but his driving privileges were suspended for 90 days because he refused to take a breathalyzer test.</p> <p id=\"b263-7\" pgmap=\"263\">The Committee considered petitioner\u2019s conduct on March 27 and 28, 1984, to be the most significant factor which impacted upon his character and fitness. The petitioner was not able to testify about most of the events that transpired during the March 1984 incident, because he claimed at the hearing that much of the incident occurred while he was in an alcoholic-blackout state. Therefore, the hearing panel had to rely to a large extent on stipulations, and transcripts of the cause before the police board and the criminal division of the circuit court of Cook County.</p> <p id=\"b263-8\" pgmap=\"263(52) 264(141)\">We can understand why the Committee attached so much significance to the March 1984 incident because the testimony of petitioner and the circumstances surrounding the incident cast some doubt on petitioner\u2019s veracity. Since he cannot recall because of the blackout, petitioner\u2019s only explanation for his going to the Paxton Hotel was that he led a drunken police raid to confiscate drugs that were allegedly in the possession of Yearby and Terry. Petitioner embarked on this raid because a person whom he never met before, Finnegan, told him that a briefcase in the possession of Yearby and Terry contained little bags of white powder. However, Yearby had testified previously in petitioner\u2019s criminal trial that the briefcase contained a significant amount of money and it was opened up in petitioner\u2019s presence at the Snuggery. At the hearing before the Committee, petitioner claimed he never saw the briefcase or its contents. Yet, one of the undisputed events noted in the appellate opinion which reviewed the discharge order of the police board was that petitioner \u201ctried to take the briefcase but Yearby stopped him.\u201d 177 Ill. App. 3d at 584.</p> <p id=\"b264-5\" pgmap=\"264\">As it turned out, when petitioner arrived at the hotel, the briefcase did not contain the little bags of white powder that he was searching for. The briefcase contained over $1,000 in cash instead. The hotel clerk testified at the hearing that petitioner attempted to phone the police from the hotel but that he was unsuccessful because the telephone switchboard was unattended. This would support petitioner\u2019s explanation that he was engaged in a drunken police raid. However, the very people he attempted to reach by phone, the Chicago police, met him outside his apartment almost immediately after the incident. Petitioner was questioned by Officer Michael Williamson outside his apartment. Officer Williamson asked petitioner what he had been doing that night. The petitioner did not say that he had confiscated money in a raid. Rather, petitioner stated that he was out having a good time and that he was on his way to Cicero. Petitioner\u2019s reply to Officer Williamson casts some doubt on the truthfulness of his explanation to the Committee that he was engaged in a drunken police raid.</p> <p id=\"b265-4\" pgmap=\"265\">There are additional reasons why petitioner\u2019s credibility in connection with his testimony regarding the March 1984 incident is somewhat doubtful. First, petitioner, while testifying before the hearing panel, stated he did not take drugs on the night of March 27, 1984. Yet, petitioner\u2019s defense at trial was predicated on drug intoxication, and one of petitioner\u2019s witnesses testified that petitioner was under the influence of drugs when the witness saw the petitioner the morning of March 28.</p> <p id=\"b265-5\" pgmap=\"265\">The second reason relates to petitioner\u2019s testimony that he suffered an alcohol-related blackout in March 1984. Petitioner was ultimately convicted of misdemeanor theft. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 16\u2014 1(b)(1).) Under the Criminal Code of 1961 (Code), a theft must be committed \u201cknowingly.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 16 \u2014 1(a).) The Code states that persons act knowingly when they are consciously aware that their conduct or the attendant circumstances of their conduct will lead to one of the Code\u2019s defined crimes, or when they are practically certain such a result will occur. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 4 \u2014 5.) Petitioner was convicted of a crime which requires conscious awareness of his behavior, or at least practical certainty that his behavior will achieve a particular result. We find his theft conviction to be logically inconsistent with the concept of an alcohol-related blackout. How could petitioner be consciously aware of his behavior on March 27, 1984, and perform the acts which consisted of the other elements of the crime of which he was eventually convicted, and yet be in a blackout state? We believe this inconsistency can only weigh against petitioner, in light of the other more obvious examples of petitioner\u2019s untruthfulness.</p> <p id=\"b265-6\" pgmap=\"265(39) 266(86)\">Honesty is an important factor in assessing a person\u2019s moral character. (In re Polito (1989), 132 Ill. 2d 294, 303.) Petitioner did answer his bar application completely and honestly. (See In re Mitan (1979), 75 Ill. 2d 118 (attorney disbarred when it was discovered that he lied on his bar application).) However, petitioner lied on his application to law school. He failed to list a previous job and listed one prior position which he had not occupied. Petitioner testified that he intentionally falsified this information in order to \u201cbe seen in a better light.\u201d Moreover, petitioner had been in continual violation of City of Chicago weapons registration laws, both while he was a policeman and since his dismissal from the police department.</p> <p id=\"b266-5\" pgmap=\"266\">On the subject of petitioner's alcoholism, it is clear from the record that he has overcome this problem. He attends AA meetings three times per week, he has held leadership positions within AA and he is generally an active participant in the organization. Petitioner states that he has dedicated his life to abstinence. As an example of his determination, he abstained from alcohol despite the trauma of his father\u2019s death in 1985. He is to be commended for his fortitude. While the petitioner may be rehabilitated, rehabilitation is only one factor, albeit an important one. (In re Loss (1987), 119 Ill. 2d 186, 196.) The Committee adequately considered petitioner\u2019s rehabilitation before it decided to deny certification. Petitioner\u2019s past misconduct cannot be lessened by his subsequent exemplary conduct. In re Berkley (1983), 96 Ill. 2d 404, 410.</p> <p id=\"b266-6\" pgmap=\"266\">For the reasons stated, the petition for admission is denied.</p> <p id=\"b266-7\" pgmap=\"266\">Petition denied.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b266-8\" pgmap=\"266\">JUSTICE STAMOS,</author> <p id=\"AO\" pgmap=\"266\">specially concurring:</p> <p id=\"b266-9\" pgmap=\"266\">I agree with the majority\u2019s denial of the petition in the case at bar. However, I find, in some respects, the majority fails to squarely face the issues presented in this case. I therefore write separately.</p> <p id=\"b267-4\" pgmap=\"267\">Supreme Court Rule 708 provides that an applicant \u201cwho has availed himself of his full hearing rights before the Committee on Character and Fitness and who deems himself aggrieved by the determination of the committee may *** petition the Supreme Court for relief.\u201d (107 Ill. 2d R. 708(d).) Generally, an exercise of discretion by the Committee on Character and Fitness (Committee) in its consideration of an applicant\u2019s fitness for admission to the bar will not be reversed by this court unless certification has been arbitrarily refused. (In re Ascher (1980), 81 Ill. 2d 485, 498.) The Committee\u2019s determinations are advisory only, and neither bind this court nor limit our authority to take action. In re Loss (1987), 119 Ill. 2d 186,192.</p> <p id=\"b267-5\" pgmap=\"267\">The Committee\u2019s report and the majority opinion focus almost exclusively on the incident of March 27, 1984. Because of the outrageous nature of this incident, the Committee was forced to focus most of its efforts on petitioner\u2019s past in connection with both the particular incident in question and petitioner\u2019s history of alcoholism. After examining the Committee\u2019s report, I have determined that petitioner\u2019s testimony before the Committee about this incident, in light of the events and results of his trial for the criminal acts he allegedly committed that evening, raises some questions regarding petitioner\u2019s veracity. I will explain this later. However, even though I agree with the majority that the Committee reached its alleged \u201cfindings\u201d regarding the expert testimony relating to alcohol-related blackouts without arbitrarily disregarding petitioner\u2019s expert testimony, I believe the majority failed to recognize how unimportant this issue is in relation to the evidence of petitioner\u2019s lack of moral character.</p> <p id=\"b267-6\" pgmap=\"267(27) 268(79)\">There is nothing arbitrary about denying this petition. There is ample evidence in the Committee report, unconnected to the incident of March 27, 1984, or petitioner\u2019s alcohol problems, which impugns petitioner\u2019s veracity in such a way that I conclude he lacks the requisite moral character for bar admission. Petitioner falsified an application for employment by listing prior jobs he had in fact never occupied while omitting certain jobs and entirely omitting his arrest record. He admitted to the Committee that these falsifications were intentional, stating, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would get the jobs if I had been accurate on the application.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b268-5\" pgmap=\"268\">Further, petitioner lied on his application to law school. He failed to list a previous job and listed one prior position which he had not occupied. Again, petitioner testified that he falsified this information in order to \u201cbe seen in a better light.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b268-6\" pgmap=\"268\">There is nothing in the record that shows petitioner\u2019s deceitful nature has any connection to his alcoholism. Rather, the record, particularly petitioner\u2019s own testimony, reveals a pattern of using fraud and deceit to further career objectives. The majority opinion fails to clearly articulate this point. Petitioner had argued that the Committee\u2019s decision to deny certification was based solely on petitioner\u2019s alcohol-inspired violent tendencies. However, the Committee report clearly shows that while much of the focus was on petitioner\u2019s alcoholism and alcohol-induced violent behavior, it also considered petitioner\u2019s general background and employment history, which revealed petitioner\u2019s history of prevarication. Therefore, based solely on petitioner\u2019s deceitful tendencies, I would deny certification.</p> <p id=\"b268-7\" pgmap=\"268(62) 269(239)\">The majority correctly mentions petitioner\u2019s rehabilitation from alcoholism. (139 Ill. 2d at 249.) Rehabilitation is indeed important. (Loss, 119 Ill. 2d at 196.) Petitioner argues that his case is \u201cmarkedly different\u201d from the Loss case in that the petitioner in Loss had a more egregious criminal record and history of dishonesty. However, the same misgivings regarding the Loss petitioner are equally applicable to the petitioner in the case at bar. Should we \u201cpermit a person to perpetrate a fraud on a law school in order to be admitted, and then later, when applying for admission to the bar, to admit that he had been a liar and be forgiven. To me, being truthful in answering the [Committee] questionnaire is not a manifestation of the reform of a deceitful person.\u201d (Loss, 119 Ill. 2d at 214-15 (Ryan, J., specially concurring).) There is nothing in the evidence to show that the Committee found these specific incidents of petitioner\u2019s deceitfulness to be connected with or influenced by his drinking. Even if we were to hypothesize that petitioner\u2019s lying on the employment and law school applications were attempts at concealing conduct which alcoholism caused to transpire, there is nothing in the record to support this. Petitioner admitted the lies were to put himself in the best possible light. I am not concerned with petitioner\u2019s past alcohol abuse, or the violent acts which ensued as a result. Petitioner has apparently overcome this problem; I commend him for his courage and tenacity. I am also not concerned with his criminal record. I am, however, concerned about his propensity for lying. (See Loss, 119 Ill. 2d at 213-14 (Ryan, J., specially concurring).) Therefore, even if the incident of March 27, 1984, had never occurred, the record supports denying this petition.</p> <p id=\"b269-5\" pgmap=\"269(99) 270(95)\">I also agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion regarding how the incident of March 27, 1984, and its legal resolution casts some doubt on petitioner\u2019s veracity. Before I explain this, however, I must discuss the ambiguity caused by the majority\u2019s failure to exactly define the terms \u201calcohol-related blackout\u201d (see 139 Ill. 2d at 244) or \u201ccomplete blackout\u201d (see 139 Ill. 2d at 246). To a lay person, a \u201cblackout\u201d could mean a temporary memory loss or a loss of consciousness. (American Heritage Dictionary 185 (2d College ed. 1985).) The majority never explains this. The Committee report contains summaries of the expert witnesses\u2019 testimony, but is also unclear as to what a person experiences when he or she is \u201cblacked out\u201d due to alcohol consumption. Is it that a \u201cblackout\u201d victim possesses the ability to reason and make willful decisions, and simply cannot remember what he has done? Or does \u201cblackout\u201d mean a complete loss of control, where the ability to reason, make rational or volitional decisions, and remember are all suspended? This lack of clarity could explain why some members of the hearing panel expressed misgivings about the expert testimony.</p> <p id=\"b270-5\" pgmap=\"270\">Indeed, in his arguments before the court, petitioner made much of the hearing panel\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d that alcohol-related blackouts cannot occur. While I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to show that the panel arbitrarily rejected petitioner\u2019s expert testimony, to go no further leaves several questions unanswered.</p> <p id=\"b270-6\" pgmap=\"270(149) 271(17)\">First, petitioner argues the hearing panel concluded that no blackout had occurred. The majority opinion fails to address this argument. I find that the panel made no such \u201cfinding\u201d of fact. The Committee report merely stated that \u201c[c]ertain members of the hearing panel experienced doubts\u201d regarding the factual existence of \u201cblackouts\u201d stemming from the overconsumption of alcohol. The report contains no evidence to connect this statement to the vote taken by the hearing panel. In fact, the Committee report noted that the hearing panel had reviewed all the evidence, including petitioner\u2019s police record, transcripts of his hearings before the police board and the trial court, and his general background. The majority opinion merely states that some of the Committee members \u201cexpressed interest\u201d in the blackout theory. (139 Ill. 2d at 251.) This begs the question. The majority should have focused on the totality of the hearing panel\u2019s investigation and given more emphasis to the critical issue in this cause \u2014 petitioner\u2019s credibility.</p> <p id=\"b271-5\" pgmap=\"271\">I also find that the majority\u2019s discussion of the March 27, 1984, incident and petitioner\u2019s conviction following that event does not clearly explain why these circumstances reflect poorly on petitioner\u2019s moral character. \u201cAn opinion of an expert is to be accorded such weight [as], in light of all the facts and circumstances of the case, reasonably attaches to it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (People v. Harvey (1919), 286 Ill. 593, 604.) While all the testimony regarding the possibility of alcohol-related blackouts went uncontradicted, the other facts and circumstances relating to petitioner\u2019s alleged blackout on March 27, 1984, leads me to conclude that the majority\u2019s conclusion that these events cast a pall on petitioner\u2019s veracity needs bolstering.</p> <p id=\"b271-6\" pgmap=\"271\">While not conclusive in and of themselves, there are several reasons why petitioner\u2019s credibility in connection with his testimony regarding the March 27, 1984, incident is at least somewhat doubtful; the majority touched on most of these. First, petitioner, while testifying before the hearing panel, stated he did not take drugs on the night of March 27; he stated that his blackout was solely alcohol induced. Yet, petitioner\u2019s defense at trial was predicated on \u201cdrug intoxication,\u201d and one of petitioner\u2019s witnesses testified that petitioner was under the influence of drugs when the witness saw petitioner the morning of March 28. The record is unclear as to what petitioner\u2019s attorney meant by pleading \u201cdrug intoxication,\u201d and we cannot determine the credibility of the witness\u2019 testimony. While certainly not conclusive, this evidence adds to my impression that petitioner has habitually relied on falsehood to avoid the consequences of his past behavior.</p> <p id=\"b271-7\" pgmap=\"271(16) 272(119)\">The next two reasons relate to assessing whether petitioner\u2019s testimony regarding his suffering the blackout is actually an issue on which our determination of petitioner\u2019s character and fitness should rest. When the trial judge acquitted petitioner of most of the charges related to the March 27 incident, the judge stated that petitioner had been acting under the impression that he was performing his police duties. The record is unclear as to whether this holding was based on petitioner\u2019s testimony, or simply upon the trial judge\u2019s observation or the testimony of others. Also, the trial judge did convict petitioner of misdemeanor theft. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 38, par. 16 \u2014 1(b)(1).) Through all this, petitioner maintains he has no memory of the events of the evening of March 27, 1984.</p> <p id=\"b272-5\" pgmap=\"272(226) 273(46)\">These two determinations of the trial court could be seen as being at odds with what petitioner characterizes as a \u201ccomplete blackout.\u201d Theft was, at common law, a specific-intent crime. (Ill. Ann. Stat., ch. 38, par. 16, Committee Comments, at 18 (Smith-Hurd 1977).) Under the Criminal Code of 1961 (Code), a theft must be committed \u201cknowingly.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 38, par. 16 \u2014 1(a).) The Code states that persons act knowingly when they are consciously aware that their conduct or the attendant circumstances of their conduct will lead to one of the Code\u2019s defined crimes, or when they are practically certain such a result will occur. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 4 \u2014 5.) For petitioner\u2019s intoxication to have negated his criminal responsibility on March 27, 1984, it must have been so extreme as to nullify the existence of a mental state which is an element of the crime. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 38, par. 6 \u2014 3(a); Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 6 \u2014 3(a) (1988 amendment states that criminal responsibility is negated if intoxication \u201c[i]s so extreme as to suspend the power of reason and render him incapable of forming a specific intent which is an element of the offense\u201d).) Thus, petitioner\u2019s intoxication defense could only have been effective if the prosecution was unable to prove that petitioner possessed the mental state required for several of the offenses he had been charged with. See O\u2019Neill, Illinois\u2019 Latest Version of the Defense of Voluntary Intoxication: Is it Wise? Is it Constitutional?, 39 De Paul L. Rev. 15,19 (1989).</p> <p id=\"b273-5\" pgmap=\"273\">Petitioner was convicted of a crime which requires \u201cconscious awareness\u201d of his behavior, or at least \u201cpractical certainty\u201d that his behavior will achieve a particular result. I find this logically inconsistent with the concept of a \u201ccomplete blackout.\u201d How could petitioner be \u201cconsciously aware\u201d of his behavior on March 27, 1984, and perform the acts which consisted of the other elements of the crime of which he was eventually convicted, without being \u201cconsciously aware\u201d of his behavior, as Dr. Ar-bit, one of petitioner\u2019s expert witnesses, testified before the hearing panel? Of course, as a court of review, we cannot determine whether this inconsistency is the product of petitioner\u2019s dishonesty or was caused by a strategy which petitioner\u2019s attorney used at trial. Thus, this problem, on its own, could not be a determining factor in our review of petitioner\u2019s character. However, I believe this inconsistency can only weigh against petitioner, in light of the other more obvious examples of petitioner\u2019s untruthfulness.</p> <p id=\"b273-6\" pgmap=\"273(114) 274(40)\">I find that the trial court\u2019s determination that petitioner thought he was acting in the line of duty is similarly inconsistent with the \u201cblackout\u201d testimony before the hearing panel. (See 139 Ill. 2d at 245-46.) A person who has a sincere belief \u2014 even if totally fanciful \u2014 and who acts intentionally under that belief cannot be said to be' without conscious awareness of his actions. Yet, Dr. Arbit testified that petitioner was not consciously aware of what he was doing. Again, this logical inconsistency alone would not lead me to conclude that petitioner lacks the character required for bar admission, because we have no way of determining whether the trial judge\u2019s conclusion was based directly on petitioner\u2019s view of the events in question. However, in my estimation this evidence, if it can be construed as significant at all, merely adds to the more egregious evidence of petitioner\u2019s lack of veracity.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
