We have jurisdiction to review the denial of the continuance motion. <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 437 (5th Cir.2006). The denial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Masih v. Mukasey, </em>536 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cThe BIA does not abuse its discretion so long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so aberrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Cabral v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir.2011) (alterations and citation omitted). Because Al-Hiyari married his second wife after the commencement of removal proceedings, the marriage was presumptively invalid. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(e)(1) (adjustment of status of nonimmigrant); <em>e.g., Zafar v. Holder, </em>322 Fed.Appx. 376, 377 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citing <em>Matter of Arthur, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 475, 479 (BIA 1992)). Here, relying on <em>In re Velar de-Pacheco, </em>the BIA recognized a motion to reopen for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of proceedings may be granted in the exercise of discretion. <em>See </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). Nevertheless, the BIA declined to exercise its discretion. The BIA\u2019s decision was \u201cnot capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so aberrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach\u201d. <em>Cabral, </em>632 F.3d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-17\">Al-Hiyari also maintains the denial of the continuance deprived him of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>process. This contention is unavailing because \u201cdiscretionary relief from removal, including an application for an adjustment of status, is not a liberty or property right that requires due process protection\u201d. <em>Ahmed, </em>447 F.3d at 440 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Finally, Al-Hiyari challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that he was removable because, in 2002, he willfully misrepresented a fact in his student-visa application. He contends his checking \u201csingle\u201d (at a time he was otherwise claiming he was married for 1-130 purposes) was not material to obtaining a student visa. Because the misrepresentation had a natural tendency to influence the decision of the then Immigration and Naturalization Service, the misrepresentation was material. <em>See Matter of D-R- </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 445, 450 (BIA 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th CrR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
