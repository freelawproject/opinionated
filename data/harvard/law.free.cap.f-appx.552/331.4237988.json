Lee argues that he was denied his constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments when the defendants placed his two daughters on his negative mailing list. He also asserts that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity. However, because the district court did not base its dismissal on qualified immunity, we do not address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-21\">By moving to proceed IFP, Lee is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-22\">Lee has failed to demonstrate that the board\u2019s policy bears no rational relation to a legitimate penological interest. <em>See Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987); <em>Prison Legal News v. Livingston, </em>683 F.3d 201, 216, 222 (5th Cir.2012). Thus, he has failed to show that the placement of his children on the negative mailing list ran afoul of his constitutional rights. <em>See Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678-82 (5th Cir.2009). Further, although he asserts that the defendants\u2019 actions deprived him of due process, he has not alleged that he was denied any procedural safeguards. <em>See Procunier v. Martinez, </em>416 U.S. 396, 417, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974), <em>overruled on other grounds by Thornburgh v. Abbott, </em>490 U.S. 401, 413-14, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-23\">Because Lee has failed to raise a non-frivolous issue for appeal, his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>for the appointment of counsel also is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Lee\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Lee is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
