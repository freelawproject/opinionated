Little argues his convictions should be vacated because using another person\u2019s name on a forged check does not constitute the use of a means of identification within the meaning of \u00a7 1028A. He further argues for the first time on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to show that he knew the names on the checks were those of real rather than fictitious persons. Upon review, we reject Little\u2019s arguments and affirm his convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-17\">\u201cWe review questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-18\">The aggravated identity theft statute prohibits the knowing transfer, possession, or use, without lawful authority, of \u201ca means of identification of another person,\u201d in relation to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), (c)(5). The statute defines <em>means of identification </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-20\">any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-21\">(A) <em>name, </em>social security number, date of birth, official State or government issued driver\u2019s license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-22\">(D) telecommunication identifying information <em>or access device </em>(as defined in section 1029(e)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7) (emphasis added). Section 1029(e), in turn, provides the following definition of <em>access device:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am1\">any card, plate, code, account number, electronic serial number, mobile identification number, personal identification number, or other telecommunications service, equipment, or instrument identifier, or other means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds <em>(other than a transfer originated solely by paper instrument </em>).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Because this definition specifically excludes \u201ca transfer originated solely by paper instrument\u201d \u2014 i.e., a check \u2014 Little argues that the identity theft statute as a whole excludes forged checks. The Government points out that the basis of Little\u2019s conviction was his use of a name under \u00a7 1028(d)(7)(A), not an access device under \u00a7 1028(d)(7)(D), and only the latter excludes checks. To this, Little responds that because every check necessarily includes a name, applying the check exclusion only to access devices renders the exclusion meaningless \u2014 whenever the check exclusion would prevent the Government from basing a violation of \u00a7 1028A on an access device, it could always base a violation on the use of a name instead. For this reason, Little urges the court to apply the check exclusion to the entirety of \u00a7 1028(d)(7) even though it only appears in reference to an access device.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Little\u2019s argument fails because <em>access device </em>is defined by reference to \u00a7 1029(e)(1), and that section is used in other contexts. Even if the plain text of the statute renders the check exclusion without effect in \u00a7 1028A, the exclusion may still be meaningful when \u00a7 1029(e) is applied elsewhere \u2014 e.g., in the substantive criminal provisions of \u00a7 1029 itself. Therefore, Little has not shown that that \u201cthe general principle that courts must not interpret one provision of a statute to render another provision meaningless,\u201d <em>United States v. Castrillon-Gonzalez, </em>77 F.3d 403, 406 (11th Cir.1996), applies to this case. Accordingly, we have no cause to depart from the plain meaning of the statute, under which a person\u2019s name on a check qualifies as a means of identification under \u00a7 1028A. <em>See United States v. Blixt, </em>548 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe Aggravated Identity Theft statute defines the term \u201cmeans of identification\u201d in a way that makes reasonably clear that forging another\u2019s signature on a check constitutes the use of a means of identification.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Generally, we review <em>de novo </em>whether evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir.2009). However, the record indicates that Little\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal before the district court did not encompass his argument on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to show he knew that the names he used belonged to real people. Therefore, this argument has been raised for the first time on appeal, and we review it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>see also United States v. Hunerlach, </em>197 F.3d 1059, 1068-69 (11th Cir.1999) (noting that plain-error review applies even when a defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on sufficiency-of-the-evidence grounds before the district court if he failed to articulate the specific sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim later raised on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>? error requires a preliminary showing of an error that is plain and affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007). Little fails to meet this threshold requirement because the evidence presented at trial was not clearly insufficient to establish that Little knew the names on the fraudulent checks belonged to real people. The fact that the checks were tax refunds issued by the United States Treasury, which ordinarily would not be issued to fictitious people,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> creates a reasonable inference that Little knew the payees of the checks were real. <em>See United States v. Philidor, </em>717 F.3d 883, 885-86 (11th Cir.2013) (finding the inference that the government \u201cverifies identifying information ... before issuing a tax refund\u201d reasonable based on \u201ccommon sense and ordinary human experience\u201d). Moreover, having found Little guilty of making false statements in connection with the fraudulently signed checks, a jury could reasonably infer Little\u2019s criminal state of mind and his awareness of other details of his scheme, including the origins of the checks and the fact that they had been issued to real people. For these reasons, Little is unable to show plain error with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-13\">. Little has also filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental brief, which we deny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b966-6\">. Little argues that the Treasury occasionally issues tax refunds to fictitious people, but he can point to no evidence suggesting that he believed this this was one of those unusual cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
