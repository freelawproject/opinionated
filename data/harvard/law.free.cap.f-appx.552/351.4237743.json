She contends that her sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable as well as unconstitutionally disproportionate to her offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-24\">Generally, we review criminal sentences for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first determine whether the district court committed any procedural errors, such as improperly calculating the defendant\u2019s advisory sentencing-guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In making that determination, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts de novo. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). If the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, we will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>dard.... tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Gardner argues that the district court procedurally erred when it enhanced her sentence under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(H) based on the intended loss resulting from the fraudulent scheme underlying her offense. Gardner preserved this challenge to her sentence through her objections to the presentence report. However, she has not shown, in light of her knowledge of, and participation in, the fraudulent scheme of Irvin Warren Lawrence, that the district court erred in its method of determining the amount of intended loss or clearly erred in calculating that intended loss. <em>See United States v. Klein, </em>543 F.3d 206, 214 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>201 F.3d 346, 351 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">For the first time on appeal, Gardner argues that her sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). When a defendant raises a sentencing challenge on appeal that she did not present to the district court, we will review the decision for plain error only. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To prevail on plain error review, a defendant must show that an error occurred, that the error was clear or obvious, and that the error affected her substantial rights. <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392. If those factors are established, we have the discretion to correct the forfeited error, but we will not exercise that discretion unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Gardner contends that a shorter sentence is appropriate because she played a minimal role in the fraudulent scheme and her offense did not physically harm anyone. Gardner\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s assessment of an appropriate sentence does not rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to her within-guidelines sentence and does not establish an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Gardner has not shown error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">For the first time on appeal, Gardner also argues that her sentence violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution because it is grossly disproportionate to her offense. In analyzing whether a defendant\u2019s sentence is so grossly disproportionate to her offense that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, we make a threshold comparison of the gravity of the offense against the severity of the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>627 F.3d 146, 160 (5th Cir.2010). Only if that threshold comparison suggests dispropor-tionality will we conduct a deeper inquiry into sentences for similar crimes in the same and other jurisdictions. <em>Id. </em>The federal sentencing guidelines are a \u201cconvincing objective indicator of proportionality.\u201d <em>United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th Cir.1993). Gardner\u2019s 27-month sentence was within her properly calculated advisory guidelines range. Thus, she has not shown that her sentence is grossly disproportionate to her offense. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
