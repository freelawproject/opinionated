He contends that the district court plainly erred when it enhanced his sentence based on a finding that his 2011 Missouri conviction for possession with intent to distribute, deliver, or sell more than five grams of marijuana was a felony drug trafficking offense for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), as well as our decision in <em>United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268 (5th Cir.2005), Perez-Melgarejo argues that the Missouri statute under which he was convicted is broader than the drug trafficking offense definition set forth in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 because the statute criminalizes the possession of a small amount of marijuana with the intent to give it away or offer to give it away to another person for no remuneration. Because the state court documents did not narrow his conviction to a qualifying drug trafficking offense, he argues that the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement was a clear and obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-24\">Perez-Melgarejo did not object to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement in the district court. Our review therefore is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005). To show plain error, Perez-Melgarejo must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>(2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Section 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) provides that the offense level for unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States shall be increased by 16 levels if the defendant was deported after a conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months, if the conviction receives criminal history points. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines a drug trafficking offense as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The state court documents provide that on April 1, 2011, Perez-Melgarejo was convicted of possession with intent to distribute, deliver, or sell more than five grams of marijuana in violation of Mo. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 195.211(1) and (3). For purposes of \u00a7 195.211, the term \u201cdistribute\u201d means \u201cto deliver other than by administering or dispensing a controlled substance.\u201d Mo. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 195.010(12). The term \u201cdeliver\u201d means \u201cthe actual, constructive, or attempted transfer from one person to another of drug paraphernalia or of a controlled substance, or an imitation controlled substance, whether or not there is an agency relationship, and includes a sale.\u201d \u00a7 195.010(8). Finally, the term \u201csale\u201d includes a \u201cbarter, exchange, or gift, or offer therefor, and each such transaction made by any person, whether as principal, proprietor, agent, servant or employee.\u201d \u00a7 195.010(38).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In <em>Garzar-Lopez, </em>we vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded because the California statute at issue criminalized activity that did not fall within the definition of a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274-75. Specifically, we concluded that the statute was broader than the drug trafficking offense definition set forth in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 because the statute criminalized \u201cthe transportation of a controlled substance for personal use and offers to transport, sell, furnish, administer, or give away a controlled substance.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 274. Because the district court did not have appropriate documents upon which it could have relied on to determine whether the defendant had been convicted of a drug trafficking offense, we held that the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement amounted to plain error. <em>Id </em>at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">After our decision in <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>the United States Sentencing Commission amended \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a drug trafficking offense to include offers to sell a controlled substance. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)); <em>United States v. Marban-Calderon, </em>631 F.3d 210, 211-12 (5th Cir.2011). We have not conclusively answered the question of whether a conviction for giving away or offering to give away a controlled substance constitutes a drug trafficking offense under the post-2008 version of \u00a7 2L1.2. Further, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moncrieffe </em>addressed whether an alien\u2019s Georgia conviction for possession with intent to distribute 1.3 grams of marijuana qualified as an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), <em>Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1683-84, and we have yet to address Moncrieffe\u2019s effect, if any, on whether a conviction for sharing a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Because the issue is subject to reasonable debate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and the error is not readily apparent, the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement, if erroneous, did not rise to the level of a clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377-78 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Perez-Melgarejo cannot show plain error, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
