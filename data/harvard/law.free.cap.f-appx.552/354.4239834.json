The district court sentenced Ramirez-Mendez to 18 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. She appeals her sentence but not her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">Because Ramirez-Mendez has been released from prison and removed to Mexico, her appeal is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). Therefore, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
