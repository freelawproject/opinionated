His grievance is essentially that the district should not have allowed his children to attend school there and that his wife should be forced to return the children to Connecticut. In his brief on appeal, Book states that \u201c[t]his lawsuit arises in a situation of a yet unaddressed long-term political cancer in Connecticut state government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The district court declined Book\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and entered summary judgment for defendants. The court correctly decided that Book had sufficient income and assets to pay the required fees. The court also observed that \u201cPlaintiffs Civil Rights Complaint consists of a twenty-four page tirade against the Connecticut state government and a recitation of Plaintiffs crusade to rein in corruption in that state by filing numerous law suits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">There is no error. The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
