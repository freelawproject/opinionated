The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) determined that Mr. Saucier suffered from several severe impairments, noting his history of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. The ALJ further acknowledged that Mr. Saucier had degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, depressive disorder, and somatization disorder. Nonetheless, the ALJ determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>that Mr. Saucier was not disabled because these impairments did not meet or equal one of the listed impairments in 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.00 <em>et al. </em>The district court affirmed, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">We review \u201cde novo the district court\u2019s decision on whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). Thus, \u201cthe question is not whether substantial evidence supports a finding made by the district court but whether substantial evidence supports a finding made by the [ALJ].\u201d <em>Graham v. Bowen, </em>790 F.2d 1572, 1575 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">On appeal, Mr. Saucier, through counsel, argues that the ALJ erred in discounting Dr. Patrick Gorman\u2019s somatization diagnosis and opinion that Mr. Saucier had extreme functional limitations in satisfaction of Listing 12.07. According to Mr. Saucier, had the ALJ properly credited Dr. Gorman\u2019s opinion, the testimony of Jane Beougher, a vocational expert, would have established that there was no work that Mr. Saucier could perform in the national economy. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Mr. Saucier was not entitled to disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">In order to demonstrate the required level of severity for somatoform disorders under Listing 12.07, the claimant must satisfy both subparagraphs to the listing. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, Listing 12.07. As relevant here, subpara-graph (B) requires the disorder to result in at least two of the following: (1) marked restriction of activities of daily living; (2) marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning; (3) marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace; or (4) repeated episodes of decom-pensation, each of an extended duration. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">Mr. Saucier argues that Dr. Gorman\u2019s diagnosis of somatization disorder and opinions regarding Mr. Saucier\u2019s functional impairments conclusively established that Mr. Saucier satisfied all the requirements of Listing 12.07. But a claimant cannot meet the criteria of a listing based solely on a diagnosis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1525(d). Instead, issues regarding whether the claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cunable to work\u201d are reserved to the Commissioner. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1). Although the Commissioner will \u201cconsider opinions from medical sources on issues such as whether [the claimant\u2019s] impairments) meets or equals the requirements of any impairments) in the Listing of Impairments in appendix 1, ... the final responsibility for deciding these issues is reserved to the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). Accordingly, the ALJ correctly declined to \u201cgive any special significance\u201d to Dr. Gorman\u2019s opinion on these issues. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Moreover, contrary to Mr. Saucier\u2019s argument, the ALJ credited Dr. Gorman\u2019s diagnosis, finding that Mr. Saucier suffered from somatization disorder. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>D.E. 17 at 25.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ, however, ultimately determined that Mr. Saucier failed to demonstrate the required level of severity for somatoform disorders under Listing 12.07. <em>Id. </em>at 26. In so doing, the ALJ considered, but rejected, Dr. Gorman\u2019s opinion that Mr. Saucier suffered from extreme functional impairments in satisfaction of the requirements of subpara-graph (B) of Listing 12.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Mr. Saucier says that this was error because it failed to accord Dr. Gorman\u2019s opinion the substantial weight to which it was entitled \u201cdue to the frequency of [Dr. Gorman\u2019s] contact with Claimant.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 26. As Mr. Saucier correctly points out, absent good cause, the ALJ must give the medical opinions of treating physicians \u201csubstantial or considerable weight.\u201d <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179 (internal quotation marks omitted). Mr. Saucier\u2019s argument, however, fails to contend with the ALJ\u2019s determination that Dr. Gorman did not qualify as a treating physician. <em>See </em>D.E. 17 at 32. A treating source is a claimant\u2019s own physician, psychologist, or other acceptable medical source who provides, or has provided the claimant with medical treatment or evaluation and who has, or has had, an ongoing treatment relationship with the claimant. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.902. Mr. Saucier does not contest that he was referred to Dr. Gorman by his attorney, <em>see </em>D.E. 17-2 at 79, and the Social Security Administration does not \u201cconsider an acceptable medical source to be [a] treating source if [the claimant\u2019s] relationship with the source is not based on ... medical need for treatment or evaluation, but solely on [the] need to obtain a report in support of [the] claim for disability.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1502 (\u201cIn such a case, we will consider the acceptable medical source to be a non-treating source.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">in any event, even assuming that Dr. Gorman was a treating source, the ALJ had good cause to not give his opinion considerable weight. Good cause exists when the \u201c(1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclu-sory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1241 (11th Cir.2004). Here, Dr. Gorman\u2019s opinions were not only inconsistent with evidence concerning Mr. Saucier\u2019s activities and other medical opinions, but also Dr. Gorman\u2019s own observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mr. Saucier had only moderate restrictions in (1) activities of daily living; (2) maintaining social functioning; and (3) concentration, persistence, or pace. For example, Mr. Saucier indicated in his functional report that \u201che has no problems maintaining personal care, preparing simple meals, doing laundry, using a riding lawn mower, and managing finances.\u201d D.E. 17 at 27. <em>See also id. </em>at 118-122. Dr. Pamela Green, a state agency consultant, concluded that Mr. Saucier had mild restrictions in activities of daily life, maintaining social functioning, and concentration, persistence, or pace; she found no episodes of decompensation of extended duration. <em>See </em>D.E. 17-2 at 43. Dr. Ada Ramirez, the consultative examining physician, noted that Mr. Saucier\u2019s \u201cverbal and communication skills were adequate and his eye contact was fair\u201d; although his \u201cspeech was soft and slow,\u201d it was \u201clucid and goal directed.\u201d D.E. 17-2 at 22. And these observations were consistent with the ALJ\u2019s own observations of Mr. Saucier\u2019s testimony at the hearing. D.E. 17 at 27 (\u201cClaimant\u2019s testimony at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>hearing was presented in a very soft voice and was halting, but he responded to questions, answering them relevantly and adequately.\u201d)- Finally, the ALJ properly discounted Dr. Gorman\u2019s opinion that Mr. Saucier experienced continual episodes of decompensation, because there was no record evidence of ongoing mental health treatment or extended periods of decom-pensation requiring supporting care or mental health hospitalization. Thus, the ALJ correctly accorded little weight to Dr. Gorman\u2019s opinion that Mr. Saucier\u2019s functional restrictions were extreme.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Furthermore, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. Gorman\u2019s opinions because they were inconsistent with Dr. Gorman\u2019s own observations. Following an examination of Mr. Saucier, Dr. Gorman observed that (1) Mr. Saucier\u2019s \u201cspeech was within normal limits for rate, rhythm, and volume\u201d; (2) his \u201cattention and concentration appeared appropriate\u201d; and (3) he \u201cunderstood all task questions and instructions and did not require repetition or clarification.\u201d D.E. 17-2 at 76. Moreover, Dr. Gorman noted that Mr. Saucier \u201cdisplayed poor effort on numerous tasks of response bias that were presented to him during [his neuropsychological] evaluation,\u201d performing \u201cworse than patients with severe dementia who required hospitalization as well as young children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79. For example, after testing on verbal memory functioning, Dr. Gorman noted that it was \u201chighly unlikely that [Mr. Saucier] would be able to obtain [his low test] score without knowing the correct answer and purposely choosing the wrong one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78. \u201c[G]iven [Mr. Saucier\u2019s] poor effort on the tasks presented to him combined with highly variable performance,\u201d Dr. Gorman concluded that \u201cthe results obtained on measures of intellectual functioning, executive function, attention and concentration and learning and memory [were] likely an inaccurate underestimate of [Mr. Saucier\u2019s] current functioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79. In light of these more detailed findings, the ALJ properly declined to credit Dr. Gorman\u2019s conclusory opinions that Mr. Saucier suffered from extreme limitations in daily living, social functioning, and concentration, persistence or pace. <em>See </em>D.E. 17-2 at 63 (form evaluation by Dr. Gorman indicating that Mr. Saucier suffered from \u201cextreme\u201d functional limitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">In sum, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision not to adopt Dr. Gor-man\u2019s conclusions regarding the severity of Mr. Saucier\u2019s functional limitations. Accordingly, the ALJ properly did not credit the portion of Ms. Beougher\u2019s testimony that required her to accept as true Dr. Gorman\u2019s opinions on Mr. Saucier\u2019s limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">For the above stated reasons, and upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-7\">.
