Perdomo Nova argues that his 26-month within-guidelines sentence is unreasonable in that it was greater than necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>accomplish the goals of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Relying on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), Perdomo Nova contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1 is flawed and not based on \u201c \u2018empirical data and national experience.\u2019 \u201d As such, he argues that his within-guidelines sentence should not be afforded the presumption of reasonableness. He also contends that the flawed guideline results in an advisory sentencing range that overstates the seriousness of his offense. Per-domo Nova also argues that the guidelines do not take into consideration his history and personal characteristics, including his benign motive for returning to this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Perdomo Nova recognizes that <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), and <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008), foreclose his argument that because the guideline is not empirically grounded, the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to a sentence calculated under \u00a7 2L1.1. He further recognizes that because he did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence before the district court, this court reviews his argument under the plain error standard. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The district court considered Perdomo Nova\u2019s arguments in mitigation of his sentence and expressed compassion and respect for Perdomo Nova\u2019s motive for returning to this country. It nevertheless deemed the 26-month within-guidelines sentence \u201cappropriate to comply with the goals of the sentencing statute.\u201d Perdomo Nova does not offer any specific argument that the district court considered any irrelevant or improper factors or that it did not account for a factor that should receive significant weight. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Given the deference owed to the district court\u2019s sentence determination, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), Perdo-mo Nova\u2019s conclusional assertions that the district court erred in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and that his sentence is unreasonable in light of those factors is insufficient to establish plain error and to rebut the presumption that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
