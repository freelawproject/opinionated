Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993). We generally do not disturb a district court\u2019s credibility determination unless it is \u201cso inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Mr. Manning\u2019s testimony was in direct conflict with other evidence offered at the hearing. The evidence presented by the government showed that the building Mr. Manning subleased was vandalized hours after Mr. Manning moved out; that there was no sign of a break-in; that the security alarm was armed when the sub-lessor, Jeffrey Stewart, arrived to survey the damage; that Mr. Manning had access to a key and the alarm system; and that Mr. Manning had a motive to damage the building because Mr. Stewart had refused to renew his lease. The evidence further showed that Mr. Manning vengefully scratched Mr. Stewart\u2019s car with a key immediately after a hearing in which Mr. Stewart obtained a $2,000 monetary award against Mr. Manning. Mr. Stewart testified that after the hearing he saw Mr. Manning standing by his car smirking and holding keys. Police investigator Amy Hall\u2019s testimony corroborated this story.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Manning was not credible is thus not \u201cso inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>See Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d at 749. Although the court did mention Mr. Manning\u2019s prior convictions, it acknowledged that \u201csome of these convictions are a good bit in the past and [Mr. Manning] ha[s] become a contributing member of the community.\u201d The district court found Mr. Manning\u2019s demeanor at the hearing to be \u201cvery defensive\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d D.E. 97 at 152. The court ultimately based its credibility determination on its belief that \u201cthese transactions with Mr. Stewart were motivated by Mr. Manning\u2019s feeling of anger and feeling he had been denied by Mr. Stewart.\u201d D.E. 97 at 153. Because the evidence supports this conclusion, we will not disturb it under the clearly erroneous standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), a district court may revoke a term of supervised release if the government shows by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, and may impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir.2006). A preponderance of the evidence simply requires the factfinder to believe that the existence of the fact is more probable than its nonexistence. <em>United States v. Trainor, </em>376 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2004). When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, his own testimony, if disbelieved by the factfinder, may generally be considered as substantive evidence of his guilt. <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1335 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">The evidence discussed above shows that Mr. Manning had a motive and an opportunity to cause the damage to Mr. Stewart\u2019s leasehold property and car. From this evidence, the district court could reasonably conclude that it was more probable than not that Mr. Manning committed these offenses. <em>See Trainor, </em>376 F.3d at 1331. Additionally, the district court\u2019s adverse credibility finding weighs heavily against Mr. Manning. <em>See United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2009). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Mr. Manning\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">We review conclusions of law <em>de novo. United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994). A defendant facing possible revocation of supervised release is enti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>tied to some, but not all, of the procedural protections afforded a defendant in a criminal proceeding. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 414 (11th Cir.1994). We have held that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in revocation of supervised release proceedings. <em>Frazier, </em>26 F.3d at 114. Nevertheless, defendants are entitled to certain minimal due process requirements, and the admissibility of hearsay is not automatic. <em>Id. </em>In deciding whether or not to admit hearsay, the district court must balance the defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses against the grounds asserted by the government for denying confrontation. <em>Id. </em>Failure to conduct this balancing test constitutes a violation of due process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Once it is established that the admission of hearsay violated due process, the defendant bears the burden of showing that the court explicitly relied on the hearsay in revoking his supervised release. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>931 F.2d 842, 847 (11th Cir.1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant must show: (1) that the challenged hearsay is materially false or unreliable; and (2) that the challenged hearsay served as the basis for the revocation or sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Here, the district court erred in admitting the hearsay statements of Frederick Wright. Both police investigator Amy Hall and Mr. Stewart related out-of-court statements by Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright had told them that, while waiting in the parking lot for his brother to leave the bank, he witnessed Mr. Manning scratch Mr. Stewart\u2019s car. The district court overruled defense counsel\u2019s hearsay objection to this testimony without explanation. The court thus failed to conduct the balancing that <em>Frazier </em>mandates. <em>See </em>26 F.3d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Nonetheless, Mr. Manning has failed to show that the hearsay testimony was \u201cmaterially false or unreliable.\u201d <em>See Taylor, </em>931 F.2d at 847. Mr. Wright\u2019s statements were consistent with the timing of the incident and with Mr. Stewart\u2019s own testimony. Mr. Wright identified Mr. Manning without hesitation at a photographic line-up. Mr. Manning gives no reason why Mr. Wright\u2019s statements are unreliable or untruthful. As a result, Mr. Manning has failed to meet his burden in showing the district court committed reversible error in admitting the hearsay statements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">One of the procedural protections afforded to defendants at a revocation hearing is a written statement by the district court as to the evidence it relied upon and the reasons for revoking the supervised release. <em>Copeland, </em>20 F.3d at 414. In <em>Copeland, </em>we held that the district court had satisfied the requisite specificity by setting forth the witness testimony it relied upon, its reasoning for crediting a witness, and its justification for revoking the supervised release. <em>Id. </em>at 415. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>further held that the district court can set forth this reasoning orally so long as it is recorded and can be transcribed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">Here, the district court made specific findings with regard to the credibility of the key witnesses and the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the alleged offenses. <em>See Copeland, </em>20 F.3d at 415. The court noted on the record that its primary reason for revoking supervised release is that \u201cI credit Mr. Stewart\u2019s testimony and I don\u2019t credit Mr. Manning\u2019s testimony.\u201d D.E. 97-151. The court went on to enumerate \u201cvarious bits of evidence\u201d pertaining to each incident that induced the court to find the government\u2019s version of events more compelling. Accordingly, there was no error, plain or otherwise, with regard to the court\u2019s explanation of its decision to revoke Mr. Manning\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Valladares, </em>544 F.3d 1257, 1261 (11th Cir.2008). The denial of a continuance must be upheld unless the defendant can show an abuse of discretion and specific, substantial prejudice. <em>United States v. Gossett, </em>877 F.2d 901, 906 (11th Cir.1989). To make such a showing, the defendant must identify something in the record that would indicate the possibility of a different outcome if the continuance had been granted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">We have stated that the revocation of supervised release for commission of a subsequent criminal offense does not constitute punishment for that criminal offense for purposes of double jeopardy. <em>United States v. Woods, </em>127 F.3d 990, 992 (11th Cir.1997). A defendant is not entitled to a jury trial or to the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard at his revocation hearing. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Mr. Manning has failed to identify anything in the record that would indicate the possibility of a different outcome had the continuance been granted. <em>See Gossett, </em>877 F.2d at 906. Contrary to Mr. Manning\u2019s assertions, there is no double jeopardy issue because the revocation of his supervised release did not constitute punishment for his underlying criminal offenses. <em>See Woods, </em>127 F.3d at 992. Our precedent also makes clear that a defendant is not entitled to a jury trial for the revocation of supervised release. <em>See Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d at 1268. Thus, Mr. Manning has failed to show that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance violated any of his constitutional rights or caused him any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">The revocation of Mr. Manning\u2019s supervised release is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b986-12\">. In March 2008, Mr. Manning was sentenced to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment with a 3-year term of supervised release. His conditions of supervised release included a requirement that he refrain from committing another federal, state, or local crime. He was also required to notify his probation officer of any arrest or police questioning within 72 hours of such incident. In March of 2013, the probation office filed a petition stating that Manning was released from imprisonment on August 30, 2010, and alleging that he had violated the terms of his supervise release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b988-6\">. Although <em>Taylor </em>addresses a revocation of parole scenario, we have held that the same procedural protections apply to revocation of parole and revocation of supervised release. <em>See Frazier, </em>26 F.3d at 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b988-7\">. Mr. Manning also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the admission of this hearsay violated his constitutional rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. We reject this argument under plain error review because the Confrontation Clause guarantees the right to confront adverse witnesses only in \"criminal prosecutions.\u201d The Supreme Court has held that a parole revocation hearing is not part of a \"criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), and we have explained that there is \"no significant conceptual difference between the revocation of probation or parole and the revocation of supervised release.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>26 F.3d at 113-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
