The district court concluded that it lacked authority to grant Smith\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if it was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). If, however, the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is not lowered by a retroactively applicable guideline amendment, the district court has no authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, a reduction is not authorized if an applicable amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision,\u201d such as the statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A); <em>see also United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012) (stating that a sentence reduction is not authorized where the amendment \u201creduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based\u201d (quoting <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330)); <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">At Smith\u2019s 2007 sentencing, Smith was held responsible for 14.8 grams of crack cocaine. Based on this drug quantity, Smith\u2019s initial advisory guidelines range for his two crack cocaine offenses was 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment using a base offense level of 26. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7) (2006). Because the mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (2006) was five years, or 60 months, Smith\u2019s guidelines range became 60 to 71 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>\u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2) (2006) (prohibiting the district court from imposing a guidelines sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">At sentencing, the district court granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for substantial assistance and lowered Smith\u2019s offense level by five levels, which resulted in a guidelines range of 41 to 51 months for Smith\u2019s crack cocaine offenses. The district court imposed 41-month concurrent sentences for Smith\u2019s two crack cocaine offenses and a mandatory 84-month consecutive sentence for Smith\u2019s firearm offense, for a total sentence of 125 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Here, Smith is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 because that amendment did not lower his applicable guidelines range. Amendment 750, made retroactive through Amendment 759, among other things, changed the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)\u2019s Drug Quantity Tables. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 750 (making permanent Amendment 748\u2019s temporary, emergency changes). Had Amendment 750 been in effect at the time of Smith\u2019s 2007 sentencing, Smith\u2019s base offense level would have been 20 rather than 26, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(10) (2013), and the resulting initial guidelines range would have been 30 to 37 months, not 57 to 71 months. However, because Smith was subject to \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)\u2019s mandatory minimum 60-month sentence, his sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines would not have been lowered. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (2006) (stating that when the statutory mandatory minimum exceeds the high end of the applicable guideline range, the statutory mandatory minimum \u201cshall be the guideline sentence\u201d). Because Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering Smith\u2019s sentencing range, the district court was not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Smith\u2019s sentence. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377; <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Contrary to Smith\u2019s argument, the fact that he received a downward departure for substantial assistance does not change this outcome. As we explained in <em>Williams, </em>the district court\u2019s starting point for the substantial assistance departure is the mandatory minimum sentence, not the guidelines range initially calculated using the base offense level. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-41 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Williams, </em>this Court concluded that a district court\u2019s granting of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion does not \u201ceffectively waive[ ] the statutory mandatory minimum and thus entitle[] [the defendant] to a sentence reduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Likewise, this Court has already rejected the argument that the new definition of \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 from Amendment 759 requires the district court to determine the range before applying the mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 540\u201441 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 181, 187 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013) (\u201cIn fine, it is clear that the new definition of applicable guideline range has nothing to do with mandatory m\u00ednimums and does nothing to alter this court\u2019s rule that the applicable guideline range is the scope of the sentences available to the district court, which could be limited by a statutorily imposed mandatory minimum \u2018guideline sentence.\u2019 \u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Rather, to determine the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, the court must proceed through all the steps outlined in \u00a7 lBl.l(a) to calculate the defendant\u2019s range, including U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l\u2019s consideration of the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 541.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 makes clear, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction is inappropriate if, as in Smith\u2019s case, an amendment does not lower his applicable guideline range because of the operation of the statutory mandatory minimum. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Finally, this Court also has rejected Smith\u2019s argument that the FSA provides a basis for granting a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542; <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. The FSA is a statutory change, rather than a guidelines amendment, and thus cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Further, even assuming Smith could bring his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his claim still would fail because he was convicted and sentenced in 2007, and the FSA does not apply retroactively to defendants like Smith who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s 2010 enactment. <em>Id.; see also Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, neither Amendment 750 nor the FSA provided a basis for the district court to reduce Smith\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Smith\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-12\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-6\">. Smith attempts to distinguish <em>Williams </em>and <em>Hippolyte </em>because they involved application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) rather than \u00a7 5G 1.1(c). Although those two cases involved a statutory mandatory minimum that exceeded the initial guidelines range and thus, under \u00a7 5 G 1.1(b), became the guidelines sentence, their reasoning applies with equal force to cases in which, under \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2), the statutory mandatory minimum raised the low end of the range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b945-24\">. Smith\u2019s argument that the rule of lenity dictates retroactive application of the FSA to all defendants fails because Smith does not point to an ambiguity in either 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) or the FSA on that issue. <em>See United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that the rule of lenity applies only when the provision remains ambiguous after the application of the normal rules of construction).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
