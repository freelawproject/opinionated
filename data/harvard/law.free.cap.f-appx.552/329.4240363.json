She now challenges her sentence as unreasonable. Under Ortiz\u2019s view, her sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the aims of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a) because the below-guidelines sentence failed to take into account her history and characteristics, namely, her difficult past and history of drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-19\">Because Ortiz did not object to her sentence, we review her argument for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Under this standard, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects her substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If she makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>This standard has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-20\">Insofar as Ortiz argues that the district court erred by not according enough weight to certain sentencing factors, this argument amounts to no more than a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of these factors, which shows no error in connection with the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). To the extent she contends that this court should reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we decline to do so. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (\u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
