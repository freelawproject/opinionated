On appeal, the Swarts raise two issues. First, they argue that the BIA erred by finding that their proposed social group \u2014 crime witnesses \u2014 lacked the social visibility that is required for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Second, the Swarts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>argue that substantial evidence did not support the BIA\u2019s denial of their request for CAT relief. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">When reviewing the final order of the BIA, we review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>with appropriate deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the INA. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2003). We follow the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation of the INA unless the interpretation is unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, or clearly contrary to law. <em>See Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Under this highly deferential test, we affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351 (quotation marks omitted). We may only reverse the BIA if the record not only supports reversal, but compels it. <em>Id. </em>The fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is insufficient to reverse. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">The Swarts first argue that the BIA erred in reversing the IJ\u2019s decision to grant the Swarts asylum and withholding of removal. To qualify for asylum or withholding of removal, applicants must establish that they are unable or unwilling to return to their home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The Swarts claimed membership in a \u201cparticular social group\u201d consisting of \u201ccrime witnesses\u201d because they witnessed a murder committed by a corrupt police officer in South Africa and were threatened by the police when they tried to report it. The BIA disagreed, finding that crime witnesses do not constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d in South Africa under the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">Because Congress has not defined what constitutes a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA, we defer to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of that term. <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1195-96. In <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>the BIA defined a \u201cparticular social group\u201d as a group of persons who \u201cshare a common, immutable characteristic.\u201d 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987). The BIA noted that this characteristic \u201cmust be one that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">The BIA later refined the definition of \u201cparticular social group\u201d by emphasizing two considerations: (1) immutability and (2) social visibility. <em>Matter of C-A-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 951, 957-59 (BIA 2006). In analyzing social visibility, the BIA stressed that the social group category was not meant to be a \u201ccatch all\u201d applicable to all persons fearing persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 960. Rather, a \u201cparticular social group\u201d has characteristics which are \u201chighly visible and recognizable by others in the country in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, the BIA determined that a group of \u201cnoncriminal informants\u201d providing information about a drug cartel did not constitute a particular social group because the cartels \u201cdirected harm against anyone and everyone perceived to have interfered with, or who might present a threat to, their criminal enterprises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this sense, noncrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>nal informants are no different from \u201canyone who has crossed the ... cartel or who is perceived to be a threat to the cartel\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we concluded that this interpretation of the INA was reasonable. <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1199.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">With these principles in mind, we agree with the BIA that the Swarts failed to establish that they were members of a particular social group under the INA. There is little evidence that the Swarts\u2019 proposed social group in this case \u2014 crime witnesses \u2014 would be \u201chighly visible and recognizable\u201d by South African society. <em>Matter of C-A-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 960. There is also no evidence that the Swarts were targeted or singled out for persecution because of their status as witnesses to a crime. More likely, the Swarts were persecuted because they were viewed as a potential threat to the personal interests of the police officers involved in the murder. <em>See id.; Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201c[E]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence ... or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d). In this sense, the Swarts are no different from the criminal informants in <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>whose \u201cdefining attribute is their persecution by the cartel.\u201d 446 F.3d at 1198. As a result, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the Swarts\u2019 proposed social group lacked the visibility to be considered a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, or clearly contrary to law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1195 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">The Swarts next argue that the IJ and BIA erred in finding that they were ineligible for CAT relief. To establish eligibility for CAT relief, applicants must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that they would be tortured if they are removed to the designated country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Torture is defined, in part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-10\">[A]ny act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Because the BIA expressly agreed with, and in part adopted, the reasoning of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA as to the Swarts\u2019 claims for CAT relief. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the decisions of the IJ and the BIA. Indeed, the Swarts failed to show that it is more likely than not that they would be tortured upon their return to South Africa. Although the Swarts were threatened by the police, there is no evidence that they were ever harmed, and nothing in the record compels the conclusion that the police would move beyond threats if the Swarts returned to South Africa. Additionally, although the Swarts\u2019 relatives were questioned by the police about their whereabouts, the families were never told that the Swarts would be harmed if they returned to South Africa, nor were their families ever directly threatened by the police. Therefore, there is nothing in the factual record that compels us to reverse the decisions of the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Because the Swarts have not demonstrated that they are eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief, we deny the Swarts\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-6\">. The Swarts urge us to follow <em>Valdiviezo-Galdamez v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>663 F.3d 582 (3d Cir.2011), where the Third Circuit held that the BIA\u2019s social visibility requirement was not reasonable, and therefore not entitled to deference. <em>Id. </em>at 603-09; <em>see also Gatimi v. Holder, </em>578 F.3d 611, 615 (7th Cir.2009) (arguing that the \"social visibility\u201d requirement \"makes no sense; nor has the Board attempted, in this or any other case, to explain the reasoning behind the criterion of social visibility\"). We are bound, however, by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Castillo-Arias </em>to defer to the BIA finding regarding social visibility. 446 F.3d at 1196 (applying <em>Chevron </em>deference to the BIA\u2019s formulation of \"particular social group\u2019\u2019); <em>see also Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997) (\"The law of this circuit is emphatic that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b951-12\">. We are not concluding that crime witnesses could <em>never </em>constitute a particular social group under the INA. We merely conclude that, based on the record before us, the Swarts failed to show that they were perceived as a group by their persecutors or South African society. <em>See Gashi v. Holder, </em>702 F.3d 130, 132 (2d Cir.2012) (holding that witnesses to war crimes were visible because they were published on a list of potential witnesses, fellow villagers were aware of the witnesses, and other potential witnesses were harassed); <em>Henriquez-Rivas v. Holder, </em>707 F.3d 1081, 1091-92 (9th Cir.2013) (en banc) (holding that crime witness was socially visible because the witness testified in open court and the Salvadoran legislature had enacted special witness protection laws).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
