Joiner argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. Joiner admitted that he violated the conditions of his supervised release a third time by forging two checks that he had stolen from his mother\u2019s business; failing to comply with conditions governing his residence, employment, drug screening, and drug counseling; and traveling out of state without permission from his probation officer. Joiner failed to improve his conduct despite having served a sentence of 70 months of imprisonment for drug and firearm offenses, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 922(j), 922(k); having his four-year term of supervised release revoked and being sentenced to an additional five months of imprisonment followed by 19 months of supervised release after testing positive for marijuana and failing to participate in a substance abuse program; and having that second term of supervised release revoked and being sentenced to another 19 months of supervised release after missing counseling sessions, refusing to undergo drug testing, and submitting synthetic urine when he did submit to a drug test. The district court determined that Joiner\u2019s \u201cconsistently not good record and ... pattern\u201d of misconduct supported its decision to vary four months above Joiner\u2019s advisory guideline range of 8 to 14 months of imprisonment and impose a sentence of 24 months of imprisonment. Even so, the district court reduced Joiner\u2019s sentence by six months to account for the time he had served in state custody for his forgery offense. The district court found \u201creally significant\u201d Joiner\u2019s forgery and his lengthy criminal history and thought that \u201csome additional jail time [was] necessary\u201d to convince him that \u201cjail is not a good thing,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(c), 3553(a), and those concerns are sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the upward variance. <em>See United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378-79 (11th Cir.2010). Joiner argues that his sentence fails to account for his acceptance of responsibility and his assurances that his behavior will improve, but the district court was entitled to find that \u201cthere [had been] nothing ... to [suggest] ... [he] [had] changed.\u201d Joiner\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">We AFFIRM the revocation of Joiner\u2019s supervised release and his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
