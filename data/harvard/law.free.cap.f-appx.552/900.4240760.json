Leverette appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Meritplan. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">This case arose out of a physical fight between Leverette and Bruno Arredondo. While playing golf with a group of friends, Leverette exchanged verbal insults with Arredondo, a member of another group of golfers. At some point, Leverette grabbed Arredondo\u2019s golf club; and the club broke into two pieces. During the ensuing physical struggle, Leverette\u2019s friend, Derrick Austin, kicked Arredondo in the head, rendering Arredondo unconscious. Leverette then punched Arredondo repeatedly in the face. Arredondo suffered severe and permanent injuries as a result of the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Arredondo filed a civil suit against Lev-erette in state court, alleging claims for trespass to personalty, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and punitive damages. Leverette sought to have Meritplan defend him against Ar-redondo\u2019s suit under Leverette\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d) with Meritplan. Meritplan agreed to provide the defense under a reservation of rights and filed this declaratory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Arredondo then amended the underlying complaint, adding a negligence claim against Leverette. Arredondo alleged that Leverette was negligent for \u201ccreating a dangerous situation whereby [Arredon-do] felt that he had no choice but to physically tackle Defendant Leverette to the ground, thus resulting in the subsequent physical assault\u201d on Arredondo by Austin and Leverette.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The district court concluded that, because Arredondo\u2019s injuries were not caused by \u201caccident,\u201d the altercation between Leverette and Arredondo constituted no \u201coccurrence\u201d under the terms of the Policy; and Arredondo\u2019s injuries were not covered by the Policy. As a result, the district court determined that Meritplan had no duty to defend Leverette against Arredondo\u2019s civil suit and was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 836-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">\u201cAn insurer\u2019s duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the provisions of the policy.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. City of Rome, </em>268 Ga.App. 320, 601 S.E.2d 810, 812 (2004). Under the terms of the Policy, Meritplan has a duty to defend Leverette \u201c[i]f a claim is made or a suit is brought against [Leverette] for damages because of \u2018bodily injur/ or \u2018property damage\u2019 caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 to which this coverage applies.... \u201d The term \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined in the Policy as \u201can accident ... which results ... in: ... \u2018Bodily Injury\u2019; or ... \u2018Property damage.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">The term \u201caccident\u201d is undefined by the Policy. But, under Georgia insurance law, the term \u201caccident\u201d means \u201can event which takes place without one\u2019s foresight or expectation or design.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Grayes, </em>216 Ga.App. 419, 454 S.E.2d 616, 618 (1995) (citing O.C.G.A. \u00a7 l-3-3(2)). \u201cAn accident refers to an unexpected happening rather than one occurring through intention or design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether an event constitutes an \u201caccident\u201d is determined based on the viewpoint of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>sured. <em>Rucker v. Columbia Nat\u2019l Ins. Co./Am. Home Shield Corp., </em>307 Ga.App. 444, 705 S.E.2d 270, 273-74 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Leverette, demonstrates that the events underlying Arredondo\u2019s complaint did not take place without Lever-ette\u2019s foresight, expectation, or design. That Leverette intended to grab Arredon-do\u2019s golf club and to strike Arredondo repeatedly in the head and face is undisputed. Although Leverette contends that he acted in self-defense, that does not alter our conclusion that Leverette acted intentionally.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Grayes, </em>454 S.E.2d at 618-19 (concluding that, despite the insured\u2019s self-defense argument, no dispute existed that the insured shot the victims intentionally when he \u201cintended to shoot the gun and hit those whom he intended to shoot.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">That Leverette might not have intended the specific injuries suffered by Arredondo is immaterial. The Policy excludes expressly from coverage losses resulting from \u201cbodily injury ... which is expected or intended by [the insured] even if the \u2018bodily injury5 ... [i]s of a different kind, quality or degree than expected or intended....\u201d In addition \u2014 under Georgia law\u2014 Leverette must show \u201cthat the loss was the unexpected result of an unforeseen or unexpected act which was involuntarily or unintentionally done, i.e., that the injury resulted from \u2018accidental means.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Winters v. Reliance Std. Life Ins. Co., </em>209 Ga.App. 369, 433 S.E.2d 363, 363-64 (1993) (interpreting policy language that provided coverage for \u201cbodily injury caused by accident\u201d); <em>see also Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Hallum, </em>276 Ga. 147, 576 S.E.2d 849, 851 (2003) (explaining that Georgia law distinguishes between insurance coverage for \u201cbodily injury caused by accident\u201d and \u201caccidental bodily injuries\u201d). Because Leverette acted intentionally and voluntarily when he grabbed Arredondo\u2019s golf club and struck Arredondo, Leverette cannot show that Arredondo\u2019s injuries resulted from \u201caccidental means\u201d such that they would be covered under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">The district court committed no error in determining that Meritplan owed no duty to defend Leverette in Arredondo\u2019s suit and that Meritplan was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-6\"> Leverette argues for the first time on appeal that, because he acted in self-defense, his conduct falls under a \"reasonable force\u201d exception to the Policy\u2019s standard bodily injury exclusion. Because Leverette failed to raise this argument in the district court, the issue is not properly before us. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
