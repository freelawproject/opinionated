After review of the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.Bd 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). \u201c[W]e may affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied upon by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). A federal prisoner must ordinarily bring any collateral attacks on the validity of his conviction or sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Once a federal prisoner has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, as Starks has, he may file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion only in two very limited circumstances that do not apply here. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Separately, the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e) permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 when the remedy by \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255(e). However, one of the minimum requirements of a \u00a7 2241 claim is that it \u201cmust be based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision.\u201d <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1343 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Starks is a prisoner at the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in the Middle District of Florida. In 1991, a federal jury in the Southern District of Alabama found Starks guilty of conspiracy to possess cocaine and cocaine base with the intent to distribute (count one), structuring financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements (count three), and money laundering (counts four and five). Count one of the superseding indictment charged that Starks had conspired to possess with the intent to distribute \u201cmore than five (5) kilograms of cocaine and more than fifty (50) grams of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine which contains cocaine base\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Starks received a life sentence on count one, a concurrent 60-month sentence on count three, and concurrent 240-month sentences on counts four and five. We focus on count one because of its relevance to Starks\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Starks unsuccessfully pursued relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the sentencing court in 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Starks v. United States, </em>No. 01-480 (S.D. Ala. filed June 28, 2001); <em>id. </em>(Order filed Aug. 21, 2001). In his current \u00a7 2241 petition, Starks argues that he is actually innocent of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and that his life sentence exceeds the 20-year statutory maximum authorized by Congress for a violation of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). In support of his argument that he is entitled to file a \u00a7 2241 petition, Starks relies on two Supreme Court cases, <em>DePierre v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011), and <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. 218, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010). After briefing, the district court dismissed Starks\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because these cases are not retroactively applicable and do not render Starks actually innocent of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">Because Starks misinterprets the holding of <em>DePierre, </em>and because neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number><em>DePierre </em>nor <em>O\u2019Brien </em>apply retroactively, he is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2241. First, in <em>DePierre, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe term \u2018cocaine base\u2019 as used in [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 841(b)(1), means not just crack cocaine, but cocaine in its chemically basic form.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 2237. Based on DePierre\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ccocaine base,\u201d Starks asserts he was convicted and sentenced for a non-existent substance and thus for conduct that did not constitute a crime. Starks relies on the phrasing in his indictment that charged him with possessing with intent to distribute \u201cmore than five (5) kilograms of cocaine and more than fifty (50) grams of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine which contains cocaine base.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">Even assuming that <em>DePierre </em>applies retroactively, we cannot say that <em>DePierre </em>shows that Starks was convicted for a nonexistent substance or offense. Contrary to Starks\u2019s contentions, <em>DePierre </em>did not narrow the interpretation of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), but instead held that \u201ccocaine base\u201d includes not only \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d but all cocaine in its chemically basic form. <em>DePierre, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2237. For that reason, <em>DePierre </em>did not decriminalize Starks\u2019s conduct and the language in Starks\u2019s indictment still falls within the definition established in <em>DePierre, </em>as well as the relevant federal drug statutes. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii)(II) (\u201ccocaine\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) (\u201cmixture or substance described in clause [\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) ](ii) which contains cocaine base\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Second, to the extent Starks is making a claim based on the reasoning in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), such claims are not retroactive. Starks argues that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the sentence enhancement in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), because his jury did not find the type and quantity of controlled substances in his offense. To make this argument, he relies on <em>DePierre, O\u2019Brien </em>and <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (applying rule in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>and holding \u201cany fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Although the jury found Starks \u201cGUILTY as charged in Count 1 of the indictment,\u201d the jury was specifically instructed that \u201c[t]he evidence in this case need not establish that the amount or quantity of cocaine was as alleged in the indictment[, b]ut only that a measurable amount of cocaine was ... the subject of the acts charged in the indictment.\u201d In light of the language of the indictment and the district court\u2019s instructions, it is evident that the jury was required to find drug type, but not drug quantity. Under current law, established since <em>Apprendi </em>was decided in 2000, this is constitutional error., <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>668 F.3d 1298, 1309 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201c[T]he enhanced statutory maximum penalties in \u00a7 841(b) cannot apply unless the jury determines the drug type and quantity involved in the overall drug conspiracy offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">The problem for Starks is that his argument about the jury\u2019s failure to find drug quantity is at its core based on <em>Apprendi. Apprendi </em>established that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. In light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we held that it is constitutional error to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence based on drug quantity beyond the 20-year statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>ry maximum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) unless it is submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250, 1270 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc). But we have also held that the <em>Apprendi </em>rule does not apply retroactively. <em>See Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1281-82 (11th Cir.2006); <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e hold that the new constitutional rule of criminal procedure announced in <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The decisions in <em>Alleyne </em>and <em>O\u2019Brien </em>are based on <em>Apprendi. See Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155 (holding that the distinction between \u201cfacts that increase the statutory maximum and facts that increase only the mandatory minimum ... is inconsistent with ... <em>Apprendi </em>\u201d); <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. at 224, 235 130 S.Ct. at 2174-75, 2180 (applying <em>Apprendi </em>rule and holding that whether firearm was a \u201cmachinegun\u201d under the federal firearms statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(ii), is an element of the offense that must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt). Consequently, Starks, whose conviction became final long before <em>Apprendi, Alleyne, </em>and <em>O\u2019Brien were </em>decided, cannot now collaterally challenge his conviction based on his jury\u2019s failure to find drug quantity, because the holding in <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">For these reasons, we find that the district court did not err by dismissing Starks\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-7\">. Starks also sought a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706, but because of his drug quantity level, together with his leadership role and obstruction of justice enhancements, this amendment did not change his guideline range of life imprisonment. <em>United States v. Starks, </em>409 Fed.Appx. 264, 265-66 (11th Cir.2010). He was therefore not entitled to relief on account of Amendment 706.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
