He raises no specific issues as to the evidence presented in support of his motion to reopen. He does not argue that the BIA erred by denying the motion for reconsideration on the basis that he raised issues that already had been raised or could have been raised in his previous administrative appeal. Obiero is represented by counsel, and his brief is not entitled to liberal construction. <em>See Woodfox v. Cain, </em>609 F.3d 774, 792 (5th Cir.2010). He has failed to brief the relevant issues for this court\u2019s consideration as to the motion for reconsideration or reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
