Sybil Thomas (collectively, the \u201cDefendants\u201d) engaged in an improper medical inquiry, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on Russell\u2019s improper medical inquiry claim on the ground that Russell failed to show that she suffered any damages or injury as a result of any alleged improper inquiry. On appeal, Russell disputes the district court\u2019s conclusion, claiming that she became faint and had to request medical attention as a result of the allegedly improper medical inquiry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Ross v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., </em>173 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.1999). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, a court will grant summary judgment if a movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">The ADA provides that an employee may \u201cnot require a medical examination and shall not make inquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of the disability, unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A). Notwithstanding the proscriptions in \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A), an employer may \u201cmake inquiries into the ability of an employee to perform job-related functions.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(B). An employee may raise a \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) claim whether or not she is disabled. <em>Owusu-Ansah v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>715 F.3d 1306, 1310 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 655, 187 L.Ed.2d 449 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Although we have not published a decision holding that a plaintiff-employee must show damages or injury in order to succeed on a \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) claim, we have held that plaintiffs raising claims under \u00a7 12112(d)(2)(A), a parallel provision applicable to job applicants (as opposed to employees), must show damages \u2014 emotional, pecuniary, or otherwise. <em>Harrison v. Benchmark Elecs. Huntsville, Inc., </em>593 F.3d 1206, 1216-17 (11th Cir.2010). In <em>Harrison, </em>we determined that where a plaintiff was not hired \u2014 and provided enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that it was because of his responses to allegedly unlawful questions \u2014 he had shown sufficient damages to withstand summary judgment. <em>See id. </em>at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">As noted, \u00a7 12112(d)(2)(A) and (d)(4)(A) are parallel provisions with similar language and virtually identical prohibitions concerning medical inquiries, the only difference being that one applies to job applicants and the other to employees. Thus, we agree with the district court that the proof of damages requirement set in <em>Harrison </em>equally applies to cases involving allegedly improper inquiries under \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">We also agree that in this case, Russell has not shown that the record supports her claim that she suffered any injury or damages from any alleged improper medical inquiry. As a potential injury resulting from the allegedly improper inquiry, Russell points to the heated conversation with Mobile Police Department Lt. Sybil Thomas, alleging that she felt faint and had to request medical attention, but that argument mischaracterizes the record. According to the affidavits of Mobile Police Department Radio Communications Officers (\u201cRCO\u201d) Brenda Wilks and Gloria Herrine, and of Lt. Thomas, the heated conversation with Thomas was unrelated to the medical inquiry, and, rather, concerned an internal complaint that Russell had lodged against another employee. The excerpts from Russell\u2019s deposition in the record do not contradict the affidavits. Additionally, although Russell returned to an RCO office later the same day to request medical attention, nothing in the record suggests that her request for medical attention was related to the allegedly improper inquiry. Thus, Russell has not shown any genuine dispute of material fact concerning any damages she suffered from any allegedly improper inquiry under \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A). <em>See Harrison, </em>598 F.3d at 1216-17.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">As for Russell\u2019s assertion that a jury should be allowed to decide whether other symptoms that she suffered \u2014 namely, depression and mood changes \u2014 were the proximate result of the alleged \u00a7 12112(d)(4) violation, we are unpersuaded. Russell testified that she suffered those particular symptoms because of her Graves\u2019 disease, and nothing else in the record suggests that she suffered depression or any other malady because of the alleged \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) violation. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment because Russell failed to show that she suffered any injury or damages as a result of the alleged \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-10\">. Russell raised numerous ADA-related claims below, but on appeal, her arguments focus entirely upon the denial of her improper inquiry claim under \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A). Therefore, she has abandoned any argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her other claims. <em>See Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cA passing reference to an issue in a brief is not enough, and the failure to make arguments and cite authorities in support of an issue waives it.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b933-7\">. Russell also suggests, in the facts section of her brief, that, on July 14, 2009, the paramedics provided a copy of her medical report to her supervisors. Even if true, however, Russell would still have to prove that she suffered damages or injury as a result of the improper inquiry, which she has not done. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
