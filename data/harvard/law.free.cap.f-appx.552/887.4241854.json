After review, we vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss the \u00a7 2241 habeas petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A5C\">A. Convictions and Direct Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b914-17\">After a 1998 jury trial in the federal court in the Middle District of Florida, Chester was convicted of fourteen counts of conspiracy to possess and to distribute cocaine and heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Generally, the statutory penalty for such offenses was \u201cnot ... less than 10 years or more than life\u201d imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Thus, without any enhancements, Chester\u2019s federal convictions alone subjected him to statutory maximum penalties of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-18\">However, prior to trial, the government filed a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 notice of its intent to seek an enhanced penalty of <em>mandatory </em>life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) based on Chester\u2019s prior felony drug convictions. The government\u2019s \u00a7 851 notice listed two separate third-degree Florida state court felony convictions for possession of cocaine in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-19\">Based on his two prior felony drug-possession convictions in Florida and the quantity of drugs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attributed to Counts 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>and 2 of his 1994 federal convictions, Chester faced a <em>mandatory </em>sentence of life imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Due to this statutory requirement, the sentencing court sentenced Chester to terms of life imprisonment for Counts 1 and 2. The court also sentenced to Chester to concurrent 360-month sentences on the remaining counts. This Court affirmed Chester\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">B. Prior \u00a7 2255 Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Subsequently, Chester moved to vacate, correct, or set aside his convictions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied that motion, and this Court dismissed Chester\u2019s \u00a7 2255 appeal for want of prosecution for failure to pay filing fees. Chester filed another motion to set aside his convictions. The district court construed that motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it for failure to seek authorization from this Court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. This Court denied Chester\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">C. Current \u00a7 2241 Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Most recently, Chester filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Southern District of Georgia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. In his petition, Chester asserted that he should not have received life sentences because the two prior felony drug convictions described in the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 notice and relied on by the sentencing court are \u201cnow non-qualifying punishable felony conviction[s] under federal law for enhancement purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">The district court declined to decide whether Chester could bring his \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Instead, the district court decided Chester\u2019s petition on the merits and concluded that the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) sentencing enhancement was properly applied because the two Florida convictions listed in the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 notice were qualifying felony drug offenses. Specifically, the district court noted that even though the written judgments documenting Chester\u2019s two Florida cocaine-possession convictions failed to list the particular subsection of Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13 under which Chester was convicted, the judgments clearly stated that Chester was convicted of third-degree felonies on both occasions. The district court then observed that, pursuant to Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2) and 893.13(6)(a), actual or constructive possession of cocaine is punishable \u201cby a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082(3)(d). Because Chester\u2019s two Florida convictions were for felony drug offenses that were punishable by up to five years\u2019 imprisonment, the district court found that those convictions were qualifying felony drug convictions and that the enhanced penalty was properly applied in Chester\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Chester now appeals. On appeal, Chester argues that the district court erred because the written Florida judgments documenting his prior Florida felony drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>offenses were ambiguous as to the statutory subsection under which he was convicted. According to Chester, it was not clear whether the drug convictions were felonies under state law, and, thus, they did not qualify as \u201cfelony drug offenses\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Therefore, Chester argues that the sentencing court improperly applied the <em>mandatory </em>life imprisonment sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">On appeal, the government contends that \u00a7 2255(e) denied the district court subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of Chester\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Specifically, the government asserts that Chester did not satisfy the requirements of the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) because he was not sentenced <em>above </em>the statutory maximum penalty, as required by our holding in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Typically, a collateral attack on the validity of a federal sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). When a prisoner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, he must apply for and receive permission from the appropriate court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h). However, under narrow, limited circumstances, a federal prisoner may file a habe-as petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Section 2255(e) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMm\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, <em>unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added to indicate the savings clause). The last clause of \u00a7 2255(e) is the so-called \u201csavings clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">The applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201c[I]n enacting \u00a7 2255(e), Congress clearly restricted the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">Chester previously filed an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion. He has not obtained this Court\u2019s permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Consequently, Chester\u2019s only available avenue for collateral relief in a \u00a7 2241 petition is through \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">In our en banc decision in <em>Gilbert, </em>we held that the savings clause \u201cdoes not authorize a federal prisoner to bring in a \u00a7 2241 petition a claim, which would otherwise be barred by \u00a7 2255(h), that the sentencing guidelines were misapplied in a way that resulted in a longer sentence not exceeding the statutory maximum.\u201d 640 F.3d at 1323. We concluded that, \u201cfor claims of sentence error, at least where the statutory maximum was not exceeded, the point where finality holds its own against error correction is reached not later than the end of the first round of collateral review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1312; <em>see also id. </em>at 1295 (holding that a federal prisoner cannot \u201cuse a habeas corpus petition to challenge his sentence ... at least where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>the sentence the prisoner is attacking does not exceed the statutory maximum.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Chester was convicted of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Given the quantity of drugs underlying his convictions, Chester was subject to a term of imprisonment of \u201cnot ... less than 10 years or more than life.\u201d <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Chester had two prior felony drug convictions in Florida, his statutory penalty was enhanced to a \u201cmandatory term of life imprisonment without release.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Based on the clear language of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), Chester faced a statutory maximum penalty of life imprisonment even before his prior Florida felony drug convictions were considered. Because Chester received a life sentence, he was not sentenced <em>above </em>the statutory maximum penalty. Consequently, the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) does not apply to Chester\u2019s claim, and the district court lacked jurisdiction to address his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1312. Further, the Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>No. 12-11212, 738 F.3d 1253, 1273-75 (11th Cir.2013) does not apply to Chester\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because the statutory maximum penalty for Chester\u2019s underlying federal convictions was always life imprisonment, even without considering his prior Florida felony drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">We do recognize that Chester\u2019s prior Florida felony drug convictions, in effect, triggered a statutory mandatory minimum sentence because they caused his statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment to change to a mandatory life sentence. To the extent that Chester attempts to argue that he faced an improper statutory <em>minimum </em>penalty in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Alleyne, </em>his claim fails for several reasons. <em>See Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (extending <em>Apprendi </em>to statutory <em>minimum </em>penalties by holding that \u201cany fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">First, <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is the governing law in this case. <em>See Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1, 133 S.Ct. 2151 (noting that the Supreme Court was not revisiting <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>); <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (recognizing that this Court is \u201cbound by <em>Almenda-rez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court\u201d \u2019). Under <em>Almen-darez-Torres, </em>recidivism is <em>not </em>an element of an offense that must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. at 247, 118 S.Ct. at 1233. Consequently, the prior Florida drug convictions, that made Chester\u2019s statutory minimum penalty of life imprisonment a mandatory minimum life sentence, were not elements of his offenses and need not have been proven to a jury. <em>See id. </em>at 235, 118 S.Ct. at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">Second, because it is based on the <em>Apprendi </em>rule, Alleyne\u2019s rule does not apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>See Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1281-82 (11th Cir.2006); <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e hold that the new constitutional rule of criminal procedure announced in <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review.\u201d). Consequently, Chester cannot collaterally challenge his convictions\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>which became final long before <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Alleyne </em>were decided \u2014 based on the qualifying nature of his predicate felonies. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. 2255(h) (applying to new rules of constitutional law \u201cmade retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court\u201d); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1273-75 (requiring, among other things, that the new rule announced by the Supreme Court to apply retroactively on collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand with instructions for the district court to dismiss Chester\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-14\">. On appeal, the government represents that, at sentencing, Chester was held accountable for 4.8 kilograms of heroin and 116.5 kilograms of cocaine for Counts 1 and 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-9\">. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(a) based on a drug quantity greater than one kilogram of heroin or five kilograms of cocaine faced a statutory penalty between ten years\u2019 and life imprisonment. If a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(a) also had one prior felony drug conviction, his sentencing range was between twenty years\u2019 and life imprisonment. And, if a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(a) had two prior felony drug convictions (as Chester did), he faced a <em>mandatory </em>sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b915-14\">.
