He asserts that the district court erred in denying his request for a sentence reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(16)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 5C1.2. The district court\u2019s denial of the reduction was based on its determination that Bosch had not been truthful in providing information to the government. Bosch argues that at the time of sentencing there was no evidence before the district court showing that he did not provide truthful information and that the district court\u2019s credibility determination was based upon speculation, rather than \u201cspecific factual findings\u201d or \u201cevidence in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of the \u00a7 5C1.2 reduction for clear error. <em>See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457 (5th Cir.2006). We are particularly deferential to a district court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 752-53 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The safety valve provision, in pertinent part, requires that \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">After considering Bosch\u2019s arguments and questioning him extensively, the district court determined that his statements were not credible. Because the district court\u2019s adverse credibility determination is plausible in view of the record as a whole, it is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 396 (5th Cir.2010); <em>McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d at 457-58. Therefore, Bosch has not shown that the district court clearly erred in denying his motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>See McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-24\">. Although Bosch cited \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll) in his brief, it is clear from the substance of his briefing and context of this case that he meant to cite \u00a7 2D 1.1 (b)( 16).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
