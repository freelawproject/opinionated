He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to obtain the return of the documents filed in his purported 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 proceeding and the denial of his motion to recuse the trial judge. At the time these motions were filed, the district court had already dismissed Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition in part as an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application and denied it in part on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-23\">The majority of Taylor\u2019s brief consists of challenges to the validity of his state convictions and the district court\u2019s reconstruction of his \u00a7 2241 petition as arising under \u00a7 2254. However, he had voluntarily dismissed his appeal following the district court\u2019s rejection of his habeas proceeding, and his current notice of appeal is not timely from that final judgment. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Accordingly, we decline to consider these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-24\">To the extent that Taylor challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to order the return of his \u00a7 2241 petition and his supporting exhibits, he cites to no authority establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ing that he is entitled to such relief. Because he has not shown that any government officer or employee owed him the return of those documents, the district court properly denied Taylor\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. As for Taylor\u2019s assertion that the district judge should have recused himself from the case, his allegations of the adverse decisions are insufficient to support a claim of bias. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Because Taylor has not established error in the denial of his motions, the district court\u2019s orders are AFFIRMED. In light of this ruling, all outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
