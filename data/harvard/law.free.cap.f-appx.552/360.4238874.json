In this appeal, Gonzalez raises issues related to the district court\u2019s imposition of a period of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for procedural error and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Because Gonzalez did not object to the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence, however, our review is for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To show plain error, a defendant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>To show that an error was clear or obvious, \u201cA defendant need not show that the specific factual and legal scenario has been addressed but must at least show error in the straightforward applications of case law. By contrast, an error is not plain if it requires the extension of precedent.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas-Soto, </em>700 F.3d 180, 182 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Gonzalez contends that imposition of the four-year period of supervised release was procedurally unreasonable because it was imposed without an adequate explanation, despite the suggestion, in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) (2011), that defendants like him should not be sentenced to a period of supervised release. Because he qualified for the safety-valve provision, he contends, a period of supervised release was not \u201crequired by statute,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 5Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">In <em>United States v. Miranda-Delgado, </em>535 Fed.Appx. 398, 398-99 (5th Cir.2013) (unpublished), this court, applying the plain error standard, rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that \u201chis qualification for relief under the safety-valve provision relieved the court from any statutory obligation to impose a term of [supervised release] and triggered application of \u00a7 5Dl.l(c).\u201d The court observed that there were no cases from this or any other circuit on point. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court concluded, any error was not clear or obvious under current law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Although <em>Mirandar-Delgado </em>is not dis-positive, it is persuasive authority, and Gonzalez cites no authority in support of his legal argument, which involves an extension of the law. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 47.5.4; <em>see also Vargas-Soto, </em>700 F.3d at 182. In light of <em>Miranda-Delgado, </em>it was neither clear nor obvious that Gonzalez was eligible for relief from imposition of a period of supervised release under \u00a7 5Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>535 Fed.Appx. at 398-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Gonzalez contends that the district court failed to explain adequately its reasons for imposing a period of supervised release. The district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the statutory sentencing factors provided a sufficiently particularized explanation of its decision to impose a period of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Becerril-Pena, </em>714 F.3d 347, 349-51 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Because he qualified for the safety-valve provision, Gonzalez asserts, he was eligible for a period of supervised release of less than the statutory minimum four-year period. Contrary to Gonzalez\u2019s assertion, the record tends to support the conclusion that the district court was aware that it could impose a period of supervised release of less than four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Gonzalez has not rebutted the presumption that his within-guidelines four-year term of supervised release was substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d 601, 607-08 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Next, Gonzalez contends that the district court plainly erred in imposing a \u201ctrue name and date of birth\u201d condition of supervised release in violation of his rights under the First Amendment. A district court may impose any condition of supervised release that is reasonably related to one of four factors: (1) the nature and characteristics of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, (2) deterrence of criminal conduct, (3) protection of the public, and (4) the need to provide the defendant with educational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment. <em>United States v. Weatherton, </em>567 F.3d 149, 153 (5th Cir.2009); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B)-(D), 3583(d). The condition may not involve a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary and must be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Weatherton, </em>567 F.3d at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Gonzalez asserts that the true-name special condition was not reasonably related to one of the four factors because his offense did not involve the use of a false name or false date of birth and because the presen-tence report did not indicate that he has a history of doing so. He contends that he has a First Amendment right to use a false name or false date of birth in some circumstances and that the true-name condition is not narrowly tailored to accommodate that constitutional right. Because Gonzalez\u2019s argument involves an extension of <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2537, 2544-47, 2553-55, 183 L.Ed.2d 574 (2012) (Breyer, J., concurring), rather than a straightforward application of that case, any error on the part of the district court was not clear or obvious. <em>See Vargas-Soto, </em>700 F.3d at 182. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-14\">. Gonzalez has preserved for possible further review the question whether his substantive unreasonableness claim should not be subject to plain-error review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
