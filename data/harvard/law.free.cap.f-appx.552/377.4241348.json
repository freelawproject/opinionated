He entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on grounds that SORNA\u2019s registration requirement, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913, was unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. (NFIB) v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Stager contends that SORNA\u2019s registration requirement, which compels individuals to actively register intrastate, is unconstitutional because it exceeds Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause. He argues that in <em>NFIB, </em>a majority of the Justices held that the Commerce Clause does not authorize Congress to compel individuals to engage in local activity. Like the obligation to purchase health insurance at issue in <em>NFIB, </em>Stager argues that SOR-NA\u2019s registration requirement regulates an individual\u2019s inactivity. According to Stager, SORNA\u2019s registration requirement is even further removed from Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause authority because the underlying activity is not economic. Finally, he argues that the registration requirement cannot be upheld under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Stager concedes that his argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Whaley, 577 </em>F.3d 254 (5th Cir.2009), but he seeks to preserve the issue for further review. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance, arguing that Stager\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Whaley. </em>In the alternative, the Government requests an extension of time in which to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">We review constitutional claims de novo. <em>Whaley, </em>577 F.3d at 256. In <em>Whaley, </em>we held that SORNA\u2019s registration and penalty provisions were valid exercises of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power. <em>Id. </em>at 258-61. Under our rule of orderliness, one panel may not overrule the decision of a prior panel absent an intervening change in the law, such as by a superseding Supreme Court case. <em>United States v. Alcantar, </em>733 F.3d 143, 145 (5th Cir.2013). \u201cSuch an intervening change in the law must be unequivocal, not a mere \u2018hint\u2019 of how the Court might rule in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146. Because <em>NFIB </em>did not explicitly or implicitly overrule <em>Whaley, </em>we are bound by that decision. <em>See id. </em>at 145-46 (rejecting argument that <em>NFIB </em>overruled circuit precedent holding 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) constitutional). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary af-firmance is GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
