It was held that the \u00a3500 was not a penalty, but liquidated damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Coliman, J., said: \u201cAlthough the word \u2018penalty,\u2019 which would <em>prima facie </em>exclude the notion of stipulated damages, is used here, yet we must look at the nature of the agreement and the surrounding circumstances to see whether the parties intend the sum mentioned to be a penalty or stipulated damages. Considering the nature of the agreement, and the difficulty the plaintiff would be under in showing what specific damage he had sustained from the defendant\u2019s breach of it, I think we can only reasonably construe it to be a contract for stipulated and ascertained damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The rule that the intent should govern, irrespective of the special words used or omitted, as shown by the nature of the agreement and the surrounding circumstances, seems to be approved by Parsons on Contracts, Yol. 2, pp. 434, 435, and by Greenleaf\u2019s Evidence, Vol. 2, Sections 257, 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">This-is followed in many cases. In <em>Chamberlain vs. Bagley, </em>11 N. H., 240, it was agreed to pay $500 as a forfeiture in case of breach, and it was held liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">In <em>Holbrook vs. Torrey, </em>66 Maine, 412, many cases are cited where the word \u201c penalty.\u201d alone is used, and yet it was held to be liquidated damages. The rule stated is approved in <em>Dwinel vs. Brown, </em>54 Maine, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">We shall adopt it for our guide in the case at\u2019bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Recurring then to the contract, it was an engagement to sell a retail business and the goodwill of it to the plaintiff, and the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>fendant agreed not to engage in a retail business in Honolulu for three years ; and in a penalty and forfeiture of $2,000 bound himself fo pay to the plaintiff said sum -upon any breach of the said covenant.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AY7\"><em>C. W. Ashford, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b178-11\"><em>W. A. Whiting </em>and <em>W. R. Austin, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"b178-12\">Honolulu, May 29, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The damages in case of any breach are manifestly uncertain, and impossible of definite ascertainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">And the defendant expressly agrees to pay said sum of $2,000 in case of any breach. This shows a clear intent of the parties to treat the amount as stipulated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">See <em>Chamberlain vs. Bagley, </em>11 N. H., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">We shall so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The plaintiff further claims that he had a right to waive the balance of $2,000 mentioned in the contract, and sue as here for $200 damages. The suit is for unliquidated damages, and, if we are right, should have been for a fixed sum in debt. We think he could not at the trial so change the nature of his cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The judgment below is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
