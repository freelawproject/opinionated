F. Biolcerton, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b159-9\"><em>J. L. Kauluhou, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"b159-10\">Honolulu, February 1, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b159-3\">The defendants deny all fraud and conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The Chancellor, in the court below, decided in favor of the defendants, aud from the decree entered thereon the plaintiff appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On reading the evidence, and the paper executed by the plaintiff, which is attacked, we are convinced that the plaintiff executed it well knowing that it was a deed and not a will. It is in form of a deed; it mentions a consideration of $1, and sets forth an agreement by defendants to support plaintiff during his life, and it reserves to the plaintiff for life two houses erected on the land conveyed. The proof is conclusive that the paper was read over to the plaintiff at the time of its execution. He had before executed a will. It is impossible to believe that he did not know that this paper was a deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The land conveyed is spoken of as one-third of certain land and premises. Upon \u201c B,\u201d as specified in the plan in evidence, the houses reserved were erected. <em>u </em>B \u201d is separated on the plan from \u201cA,\u201d the part not sold, by a fence. We think \u201cB\u201d and \u201c C\u201d may be construed to be appurtenant to the houses.\u2019 Doubtless, before the new street was cut, \u201c B \u201d and <em>11G\u201d </em>were in one lot adjacent to the houses. We think the reservation of the houses may properly be construed to include as a reservation for life the lots <em>u </em>B <em>\u201d </em>and \u201c C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">It is said that an actual third, as conveyed, would go beyond the fence bstween \u201cA\u201d and \u00cd(B,\u201d and vrould strike off the edge of a house certainly almost entirely erected on the part unsold, and which is rented to tenants by the plaintiff. The land sold is not described by metes and bounds. We think that it was not intended to strike off that edge, and that the land intended to be sold is bounded by the fence erected between \u201cA\u201d and (&lt;B.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
