B. Dole, </em>for prisoner.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"b184-15\">Honolulu, June 16, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b184-3\">The prosecutrix was 11-j years old. She swore that when the defendant made the repeated attempts to commit the crime of which he was convicted, she made no outcry when others might have heard her, because the defendant kept his hand over her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The act was done on Sunday, and she did not make it known until Tuesday ; but she was told not to tell.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">By the English Statute of 24 and 25 Victoria, to carnally know a girl between 10 and 12 years old is a misdemeanor, and under 10 a felony. Under the English Statute the offense shown here would have been punishable by two years imprisonment, even though not against the girl\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">See Russell on Crimes, Vol. 1, p. 929, last edition.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">But by our law the act must be against her will if above 10 years of age. Her delay in making known the outrage was a question of fact to be considered by the jury. She may have been afraid to tell because told not to, or ashamed to tell. Her tender age is a strong element, characterizing all her acts. The jury thought the delay not strange.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">With the hand of her beastly assailant upon her mouth, she may have been unable or afraid to make an outcry; and if silent from fear, or confusion or other cause, the act might be against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">All the facts were for the jury, and they thought the child\u2019s story was substantially true.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The counsel for defendant claims that there is a conclusive presumption of consent in case of such an assault on a girl over 10, unless there are resistance, outcries and immediate complaint. We do not understand this to be the law. All the facts were properly submitted to the jury and the evidence amply sustains the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">See Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, Vol. 2 (7 ed.), Sections 1149 and 1156 c.; 4 Bl. Com. 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">Exceptions overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
