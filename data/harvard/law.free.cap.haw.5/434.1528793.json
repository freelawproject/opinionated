When the possession is several, each relying on a separate title and separate defense, it would be*just as proper to sue half a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>dozen defendants on as many promissory notes as to allow him to proceed against half a dozen tenants of as many pieces of land.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AoIy\">Honolulu, August 10, 1885.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><em>Mr. Kinney, </em>for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The defendants\u2019 motion was too wide, being for an absolute judgment; that supposing the defendants\u2019 contention to be correct, he should have asked for a nonsuit; and he submitted that by the weight of authority there was no misjoinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">He cited <em>White vs. Pickering, </em>12 Serg. &amp; R., 435; <em>Fisher vs. Hepburn, </em>48 N. Y., 41; <em>Jackson vs. Woods, </em>5 Johns., 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">On this exception we think the plaintiff\u2019s contention is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The defendants were not entitled to have judgment entered for them absolutely.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The case of <em>Jackson vs. Hazen </em>is explained by Kent, C. J., in the subsequent case of <em>Jackson vs. Woods, </em>which latter is a direct authority for the plaintiffs, as are also the other cases cited for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">The judgment of the Court in <em>Fosgate vs. Herkimer Company </em>is not in accordance with the decision in <em>Jackson vs. Woods, </em>but the judgment appears to have been rendered under the authority of the Revised Statutes of New York, p. 307, Sec. 29, which enacts that where <em>\u201c </em>the action is against several defendants, if it appear on the trial that any of them occupy distinct parts in' sever-alty or jointly, and other defendants possess other parcels in severalty, the plaintiff shall elect at the trial against which he will proceed, and a verdict shall be rendered in favor of the defendants against 'whom the plaintiff does not proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">The Court directed the jury (the plaintiffs having abandoned their claim for damage against all the defendants except Mr. Hart-well\u2019s clients) that they might find damages against Chulan &amp; Co. and Hoe Ping and Chung Tai Hoon from the 29th of January last until the 18th March, to which direction exception was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">We are of opinion that such direction was erroneous, as the plaintiffs could only claim title from the 9th March, from which day only the plaintiffs\u2019 right of possession accrued, but as we cannot see that any advantage will be gained by again trying the title, we will allow the judgment to stand for possession of the property, on the plaintiffs filing a <em>remittitur </em>of all damages within fourteen days, otherwise a new trial is ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
