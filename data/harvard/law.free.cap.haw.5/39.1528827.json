We are not prepared, to say but that they were right in so finding. They certainly had a right to proceed to see whether the item could or ought to be allowed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AcM\"><em>JS. Preston </em>and <em>J. Bussell, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b64-11\"><em>S. B. Dole </em>and <em>W. O. Smith, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"b64-12\">Honolulu, January 7, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Upon the item of extra time at $5 a day taken to complete the work, the arbitrators must have found that the circumstances showed a waiver of the clause providing a day for completion. The evidence seems to show such a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The award seems to have been made in accordance with the terms of the submission, and it appeal\u2019s that it was not made by collusion or fraud, nor is this claimed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">By numerous cases \u201cit is well settled that the award, if made in good faith, is conclusive upon the parties, and that neither of them can be permitted to prove that the arbitrators decided wrong either as to the law or the facts of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\"><em>Winship vs. Jewett, </em>1 Barb., Ch. 173, 184; <em>Jackson vs. Ambler, </em>14 Johns, 105 ; <em>Mitchell vs. Bush, </em>7 Cow, 185 ; <em>Perreman vs. Steggal, </em>9 Bing. 681; <em>Lancaster vs. Kennington, </em>4 Ad. &amp; El. 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The defendants\u2019 counsel further claim that the clause allowing an appeal in the agreement to arbitrate,' and allowing the appellate court to fix the costs in case of appeal, takes the case out of the Statute. We think not. The appeal referred to is the one mentioned in the Statute, See. 936, and under Sec. 933 the arbitrators have properly provided for the costs of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">\n<em>The judgment must be affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
