We made no claim upon the ship for the same, as we did not wish to damage the reputation of the vessel, and think the Captain will appreciate our action in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-16\">Hay: We were very much inconvenienced by your, sending us 200 bales of hay without orders by the <em>Wrestler, </em>as we did not need it, besides we had ordered 150 bales to come down by the <em>Murray. </em>The hay market is completely glutted, consequently we have to hold it. Hay has been sold on the wharf at $25 per ton, which is below its cost. Please do not send us any more goods without orders. in future, as it is very apt to put us to .some inconvenience and loss when goods arrive which we do not anticipate.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-17\">Bolles &amp; Co.: We enclose a copy of a letter- from this firm, wherein they decline receiving the 100 bales hay sent them by your goodselves, on acount of it being inferior, consequently we have had to pay freight on same and pay your draft upon them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>for the said hay. We have had to store it on account of the market being glutted with this article. The quality is poor, but we will endeavor to close it out at the very first suitable opportunity.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">18th May, 1881, per <em>Murray.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u2018Hay s We regret the loss on this article, but we did the best we could for you. The market is completely glutted, in fact a lot was sold at auction to-day for $21 a ton. We will meet quite a loss on the 200 bales which you sent us ex Wrestler.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">6th June, 1881, per Australia\u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u2018We have already addressed you by this conveyance, and the object of this mainly to enclose account sales of 100 bales hay, received ex bark <em>Kalakaua, </em>showing net proceeds $214 78 to your credit in account.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">4th July, 1881, per <em>City of New York.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">\u2018Hay ex Wrestler: We have treated this invoice as a consignment, and have stored the whole lot on your account. The hay market is completely glutted, and it is impossible to make sales unless at a heavy loss, we therefore hold same for an advance in price \u2014 to sell at auction would be simply to give it away.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">30th July, 1881, per <em>Zealandia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">\u2018The hay invoiced per <em>Wrestler, </em>$413 10, is still on hand, and as we never ordered it, we cannot take it, but will dispose of it on best terms, at the earliest opportunity. The market is completely glutted with hay, and we are surprised at your action in continuing shipping the article in the face of such facts.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">6th August, 1881, per <em>Kalakaua.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">\u2018Hay; We cannot sell this article at anything like its cost, we tried a small lot of 30 bales at auction, and it only brought $1$, will we hold it for better price?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">25th August, 1881, per <em>City of Sydney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">Account sales: We now beg to enclose the following account sales of goods sold on your account:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">Sales bran, shingles, firewood, per D. <em>C. </em>M., N.

P.,</p>\n<p id=\"b503-20\">due Sept. 15..................... ................................... 103 47</p>\n<p id=\"b503-21\">All of the documentary evidence introduced at the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>trial, including extracts of letters from J. C. Merrill &amp; Co., to F. T. Lenehan &amp; Co., and account sales, accounts current, invoices and manifests are hereby referred to and made a part of this bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The Court charged the jury in part as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u2018The case has been fully presented by counsel. The facts are before you. As to 200 bales of hay, it is conceded by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that it was not shipped on an order. When it arrived here, defendant was not obliged to take it. If that position was not changed, plaintiffs cannot recover as to the hay. You have heard the explanations of counsel and the letters and the testimony on both sides. You have the right, if you choose, to say that the letters characterized the keeping of the hay. If you consider there was the relation of -principal and agent, from the letters, and all the facts in the case, it is for you to say. If letters should convince you this was so \u2014 that defendant was agent as to the hay, then your verdict would be against plaintiff as to the hay. If the letters and all the facts show a sale consummated, then the verdict should be for plaintiff. If plaintiff recovers as to the hay, there is to be a deduction of some $70 or $80.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">At the close of the charge to the jury the counsel for the plaintiff asked the Court to further charge as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">If the 200 bales of hay were sent to F. T. Lenehan &amp; Co., as a sale, and he accepted the sale and admitted to J. C. Merrill &amp; Co., that he held the hay on his own account, then F. T. Lenehan &amp; Co. could not afterwards repudiate the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">But the Court refused to charge on this point, except- as above, to which refusal as aforesaid the plaintiff by his counsel excepted. The following evidence was also taken in the said trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">F. A. Schaefer, sworn: Know Merrill \u2014 was his agent \u2014 some years ago \u2014 (identifies power of attorney) \u2014 do not know of any partners in J. C. Merrill <em>&amp; Go. </em>Am familiar with freighting in 1881 and 1882, for compressed bales hay, freight was $1 25, I think.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Cross-Ex. Don\u2019t think I was Merrill\u2019s agent when this suit commenced. My agency terminated, I think, January, 1884. Merrill has no agency here now, I believe. This is not Merrill\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>first suit against Lenehan. Don\u2019t remember first suit. Recollect being at trial about two years ago. This is third trial, I think.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Redirect. Power of attorney (exhibited) never revoked. Acted under it in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">H. R. Macfarlane, sworn : (for plff.) Knew Lenehan. In 1881 had dealings with him in freights \u2014 general freights \u2014 molasses probably more than anything else. Had difficulty with molasses. He engaged to take molasses \u2014 got it on wharf \u2014 he could not take it on <em>Wrestler </em>\u2014 then it was to go on <em>Kalahaua </em>\u2014 didn\u2019t go \u2014 then it was to go on <em>Murray </em>\u2014 but it didn\u2019t go \u2014 all this happened within six weeks. Then he compromised, I think, for $75. First shipment was to be 250 bblss \u2014 carted, coopered and had to be taken. The second time it was displaced again by sugar, which was more profitable. Tonnage was scarce then. It finally went, some in his, some in other vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Cross-Ex. Recollect conversation with Captain of Wrestler. He said he could not possibly carry any molasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">W. C. Wilder, sworn : (for deft.) My firm ordered facing bricks from Lenehan &amp; Co. \u2014 2,000\u2014they were not good \u2014 unsizable and poor colors \u2014 8,000 more were offered \u2014 we refused, them, because they were worse than the first. We had ordered 20,000 or 30,000 \u2014then we countermanded the order. They were not delivered promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">, Cross-Ex. Am not a brick-layer \u2014 knew the bricks were bad from their looks. They looked like culls \u2014 we used the first 2,000 somehow \u2014 I know the 8,000 were worse than the 2,000. We built the store with another lot of bricks from San Francisco\u2014 these.were good bricks.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">E. B. Thomas, sworn: (for deft.) Been brick work contractor for twenty-four years \u2014 -built Wilder\u2019s block. Don\u2019t know where they got bricks for facing \u2014 my attention was called to some bricks that came early in the stage of building. First lot was 2,000 \u2014 many culls \u2014 one-fourth of an inch difference in size\u2014 some dark, some light. For facing, you must use bricks of a size. Don\u2019t know whether any of these bricks were used \u2014 I didn\u2019t see the 8,000 lot. Think they were condemned and taken out of ship. Don\u2019t remember going to wharf with Wilder to work at them.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Cross-Ex. Never saw any bricks but first 2,000. Heard that some of the 2,000 were used \u2014 don\u2019t know \u2014 they don\u2019t send first-class bricks to these Islands \u2014 no first-class front bricks ever came here. There are no first-class front bricks in Wilder\u2019s block. The first lot of 2,000 were very bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">T. B. Walker, sworn: (for deft.) Brick-layer for twenty-two years. Remember when Wilder\u2019s block was built \u2014 Lenehan then had pressed bricks \u2014 asked me to look at them \u2014 I told him they were very inferior. I saw one lot at Widemann\u2019s lot, near West\u2019s. They varied in thickness \u2014 colors were not so bad \u2014 but they had to be sorted. I had told Lenehan I wanted some bricks, but not like them \u2014 I told him I could not pay price of pressed bricks for these \u2014 they were worth no more than common bricks. Good pressed brick costs $37 \u2014 common brick, from $15 to $20. Don\u2019t know how many I saw on Widemann\u2019s lot \u2014 I went with Lenehan to a vessel to look at some bricks \u2014 they were also inferior \u2014 some bricks were handed up from hold \u2014 they varied in thickness\u2014 labor in sorting them made them cost more than first-class bricks \u25a0 \u2014 they were not suitable for facing bricks \u2014 decidedly not the kind to put in a building like Wilder\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Cross-Ex. In cornice work cutting bricks requires a deal of labor. I saw bricks that Wilder\u2019s building were made of \u2014 did not examine them.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">A. Jaeger, sworn: (for deft.) Defendant. Have known Lenehan for twelve years. Remember when he went into business for himself, about four years ago. My relations with him were rather intimate. I am pretty well acquainted with his business. He had one of Widernann\u2019s warehouses, where he occasionally kept 'flour and bran \u2014 it was a small house. He did not keep flour and hay about his premises \u2014 if he had, I should have known it.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Cross-Ex. About June 1, 1881, he took another larger warehouse. Don\u2019t remember exactly when he had hay there. I have seen hay there.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, whereupon the plaintiff, by his counsel, excepted to the said verdict, and gave notice of a motion for a new trial, on the ground that said verdict was against the law and the evidence, and on the 1st day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>May the Court made a <em>pro forma </em>ruling, refusing the said mo= tion, to which ruling the plaintiff, by his counsel, excepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\">By the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">From the foregoing lengthy exhibit of evidence offered, on the trial, as well as from the previously quoted statement of the substance of the pleadings, it appears that, as to two items, the claims for the hay and the bricks, the single question was one of fact, whether the transactions were consignments or sales, and as to the third item, the charge upon the molasses, this was a question of fact, whether the defendant\u2019s decedent was acting as the plaintiff\u2019s agent. The instructions of the Court placed these matters before the j ury solely on the evidence as submitted. No exception can be sustained as to the finding of the jury under this instruction given. But the Court refused to give a further instruction asked for by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, this, namely, that \u201cIf the 200 bales of hay were sent to F. T. Lenehan &amp; Co. as a sale, and he accepted the sale, and admitted to J. C Merrill &amp; Co. that he held the hay on his own account, then F. T. Lenehan &lt;&amp; Co. could not afterwards repudiate the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We think this instruction might have been given, but we are further of opinion that it had been substantially given in the previous instructions. The Court had charged that \u201cIf the letters and all the facts show a sale of the hay consummated, then the verdict should be for the plaintiff.\u201d For a \u201csale consummated\u201d once, fixed the liability of the defendant, and there could be no question of repudiation afterwards. There was nothing in the pleading's to support a question of repudiating a sale which had been \u201cconsummated, \u2019 \u2019 that is, made and completed, and so rendering the vendee liable to the vendor for the price of the goods. An instruction that the jury must find from the evidence whether the sale was <em>1 </em>\u2018consummated,\u201d did not need a repetition with a supposititious instruction that the vendee could not afterwards repudiate the consummated sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">We understand the rule of law to be that the Court is not required to put propositions to the jury, although correct, in the very language used by counsel, nor, further, is required to give again, in the terms proposed by counsel, what has already been given.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A97\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>3.
