Chillingworth, Deputy-Sheriff of Maui, at Makawao, on oath, complains and informs the said Justice that your affiant is informed and verily believes that opium is in the possession of one Yee Hop,, or See Hop, at Kahului, District of Wailuku, and that said opium, or a portion thereof, is concealed in and on the premises of Yee Hop at Kahului, aforesaid, and that said Yee Hop, or See Hop, is not a duly licensed physician or surgeon, nor did he receive said opium- from the Board of Health, and that said opium is contraband in law, and prays a warrant to search for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">Dated this 6th day of February, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">(Signed) Saml.

L. Aholo.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Police Justice of Wailuku.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">The parties come into Court and agree that a verdict be entered against the defendant, with damages fifty dollars, subject to the\" ruling of the Court upon the sufficiency of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">By the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">The requisites of the Constitution as to search warrants are, (Art. 12,) probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and description of the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. The premises to be searched are in this complaint, I think, sufficiently described, and the article to be seized, if found, is stated as opium, an article which it was a criminal offense to have in possession. Information and belief, which are more than suspicion, being sworn to, may be \u201cprobable cause\u201d on which a warrant may issue. So far, then, as the Constitution prescribes particulars, the information in this case is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">It complies with the ruling of the Court in <em>Hang Lnmg Ke\u00e9 vs. Biekerton </em>and <em>Parke, </em>4 Hawn. 584, in charging that the opium concealed on the described premises is in the possession of a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>son named. But the Court also say that \u201cthe search warrant can only be issued (unless elsewhere granted by statute) for the purposes specifically named in the statute, and it is clear that there must be an affidavit that the articles sought to be discovered are necessary to be produced as evidence, or otherwise, on a criminal trial.\u201d The statute referred to is Chap. 48 Penal Code, wherein it is provided that search warrants may only issue (unless elsewhere granted by statute) in four cases, to discover stolen property, etc., to seize forged instruments or counterfeit coin, etc., to seize arms or munitions, etc., and fourthly, to discover articles necessary to be produced as evidence, or otherwise, on the trial of any one accused of a criminal offense.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMm\"><em>A. 8.

Under the authority and the statute quoted, I am bound to hold that the complaint, while complete in all other respects, is defective in this material point.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Judgment will be entered on the verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">By the Coubt in Banco.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">We have considered the question raised by the exception and the decision as rendered by the presiding justice, and see no reason to disagree with it, and therefore confirm the judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
