J.</author>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">The bill of complaint avers that the defendant corporation made an agreement with the plaintiffs, dated March 1, 1880, which is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">\u201cWhereas, the Princeville Plantation, a corporation only (duly) organized under and by virtue,of the laws of the Hawaiian Kingdom, has agreed to rent to Chulan &amp; Co., merchants, doing business in Honolulu, Oahu, certain lands situate in Hanalei, Island of Kauai, for the purpose of cultivating rice, and the said Princeville Plantation Company and the said Chulan <em>&amp; </em>Co. do hereby agree to sign, seal and execute a lease in duplicate, to be hereafter prepared upon the terms and conditions as are hereafter named and expressed. The Princeville Plantation Company agree to lease from 300 to 700 acres of land, to be used only in the cultivation of rice, at said Hanalei, and put Chulan &amp; Co., or their agents, in possession of all lands over 300 acres as soon as the manager elects to do so, the 300 acres to be taken possession of immediately, for the term of five years, with a privilege of an extension of the said lease for a further period of five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>years, upon the same terms and conditions of the present lease, at the yearly rental of \u00a720 per acre, payable quarterly. Also, that the Plantation Company will not lease any other land in Tlanalei Valley, for the purpose of cultivating rice, to any person \u2022or persons, without the consent of Chulan &amp; Co.; also, to allow \u25a0said Chulan &amp; Co. to cut deadwood from lands owned or controlled. by the Plantation Company for fencing, posts and household purposes, but such cutting shall be done under the management and control of the Manager of the Plantation Company; also, to furnish all the water necessary for the cultivation of said land with rice; also, pasturage upon the Lands owned or controlled by the Plantation Company for the horses and cattle of \u25a0Chulan &amp; Co. used in working and cultivating the land ; also, that in every 100-acres of land, two acres shall he allowed, rent free, for erection of houses for Chulan <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u2019s <em>laborers; </em>that said \u2022Chulan &amp; Co. shall not sublet or assign the lands, or any part thereof, without the consent, in writing, of said Plantation Company, nor in any manner interfere with the Plantation labor; \u2022also, that the rent of the 300 acres shall commence on the 1st day of April, 1880, and the balance of said land, up to 700, from date \u25a0of possession being given. In witness whereof,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">That, pursuant to this agreement, defendant, by its agent, C. Koelling, about 1st April, delivered to plaintiffs, and plaintiffs took possession of all land marked on a map (Rowell\u2019s) 1,2, 3,-5 6, 7, and defendant stated to plaiutiffs it was of the area of 300 \u2022acres, and demanded rent therefor. That defendant, about 1st \u2022July, 1880, delivered to plaintiffs, and plaintiffs took possession \u25a0of, lot 4, on said map, and stated that the area was 55 J aeres, and also that certain other pieces, then delivered, contained 8.08 acres, and demanded rent. That plaintiff .paid the rent, believing that the statements were true, to 1st April, 1882. That no survey of the premises was made at the time of agreement. That plaintiffs enclosed the land with a fence when it was delivered to them, and the fence now encloses all the land at any time in their possession. Plaintiffs suspected, from the low yield, that the acreage under cultivation was less than was stated by defendant, and caused a survey to be made, by which it appears only -303.116 acres were in their possession. That then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>plaintiffs refused to pay rent, as claimed by defendant, on 363.68 acres, but offered to pay on 303.06 acres, and demanded of defendant repayment of the excess of rent paid. Defendant refused to accept the rent offered or to pay back the excess, and brought action in the District Court to recover possession of thg premises for nonpayment- of rent. The bill prays that defendant be ordered to execute a lease for 303.06, or such number of acres as the Court may find to be in plaintiffs\u2019 possession, and to order the defendant to pay back the excess of rent, and to accept the arrears of rent due on the basis of 303.06 acres; for an, injunction against the suit, and general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The answer admits the agreement, and alleges, in substance, that defendant delivered, March, 1880, to plaintiffs <em>339\\ </em>acres of rice land, but plaintiffs being dissatisfied with 24 acres thereof, as unsuitable for rice, defendant took them back, leaving 315-3- acres in plaintiffs\u2019 possession; that July 1st, 1880, they delivered plaintiffs another tract of 55-} acres, and that then plaintiffs had 371 acres; deducting two acres per hundred, as per agreement, there would remain 363.58 acres, on which rent had been demanded and paid to April 1st, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">That a survey was made before any of the premises were delivered, and that when possession was given, the boundaries were pointed out'by Monsarrat and Koelling, and that plaintiffs accepted Monsarrat\u2019s survey ; and denies that plaintiffs\u2019 survey shows the area of land kept in possession by them, and avers that a large portion of the land so delivered suitable for rice culture, has not been planted ; that defendant has offered to take back certain portions of land left idle by plaintiffs, but they refused to surrender the same, and other formal matters are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The rights of the parties hereto are to be determined by the agreement, and it seems to us that it ought to be construed as a lease. It transfers the possession of the land, stipulates the annual rent payable per acre, and contains the covenants and conditions agreed upon. The rent of the 300 acres was to begin 1st April, 1880, and for the remainder, up to 700 acres, from date of possession given.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Taylor\u2019s Landlord and Tenant, See. 43, reads: \u201c From a consideration of the cases the rule would appear to be, that if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>instrument professing to be an agreement for a lease is itself a transfer of possession, whether immediate or <em>in futuro, </em>it is a lease, although it contains a stipulation for executing a subsequent lease.\u201d For the i( 300 acres to be taken possession of immediately,\u201d it seems to be admitted by the plaintiffs that the agreement was a lease. The plaintiffs urge that there is no tenancy between the parties established by the agreement beyond this area of land, and that they are only liable, for use and occupation, for the amount of land over 300 acres actually occupied by them. The defendant claims that the plaintiffs should be holden for rent of whatever land over the 300 acres was delivered to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">We think the plaintiffs are bound to pay rent for whatever land was delivered by the defendant and accepted by the plaintiffs, without reference as to whether the same was thereafter planted or not by plaintiffs. This must, however, be qualified. The land must be such as is suitable for rice culture. The land was to be \u201c used only in the cultivation of rice,\u201d and this implies that it was to be rice land, capable, by an ordinary expenditure of money in preparation, of growing* rice. The plaintiffs were not bound to take land which, with an extraordinary expenditure of labor and money, might possibly be made to grow rice, but land reasonably level, so as to be easily laid out in patches and capable of being put under water as required. That the agreement was so understood by the parties is evident from the fact that the plaintiffs surrendered a piece of land of twenty-four acres (Lot \u2022&lt; Y \u201d of Monsarrat\u2019s map) as being unsuitable for rice, and it was accepted by defendant. It must also be land upon which water could be brought from ditches or streams convenient and accessible. We do not think it necessary in this case to decide whether the words in the agreement binding the defendants to \u201c furnish all the water necessary for the cultivation of said -land with rice,\u201d compels them to cut and keep in repair the necessary canals to lead water to the land cultivated in rice by plaintiffs, for there is no allegation in the bill setting forth any default of this character by the defendant. It might be said, however, that in default of a particular covenant by the lessors to that effect, it is not to be implied that they were to expend money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>and labor in the cutting of ditches to lead the water to the plaintiffs\u2019 rice fields, and that the action of the 'plaintiffs in making their own ditches is an indication of the way they interpreted the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\">The plaintiffs were bound to take whatever land of this character was delivered them by defendants up to- 400 acres, additional to the 300 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">But rice land \u201cfurnished with water\u201d means land for which enough water for the successful growing of crops of rice is reasonably accessible, and without charge to the plaintiffs for the use of such water.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Having settled these principles, there remains to be considered how much land of this character was delivered to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The plaintiffs claim that they are only liable for rent for 303.08 acres, as shown by the Rowell map, and the defendants claim rent for 363.5-8- acres, as shown by the Monsarrat map.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The difference between the parties is 60.52 acres, and it is made up of various parcels of land in Hanalei valley, in close proximity to the plaintiffs\u2019 rice fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The largest parcel in dispute is a lot of 24.69 acres, which is in the upper end of \u201cField A\u201d in the Monsarrat map, marked \u201c Lot F.\u201d ' The remaining difference is 41.91 acres, comprising lots \u201c B, C, D, E \u201d and \u201c G \u201d on the Monsarrat map.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">A reference to the map makes it clear that these disputed parcels all bordered upon land taken and planted by plaintiffs as suitable for rice; they are, in fact, ends or remnants of such fields, and the territory is all within certain well defined natural boundaries, <em>i. e., </em>the Hanalei river on two sides, the foothills on an\u00f3ther*side, and the \u201cPobanui\u201d stream on the remaining side-.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">Mr. Koelling, the defendants\u2019 manager, says he delivered all of \u201cField A\u201d (including \u201cLot F\u201d) to Chung Fook, representing plaintiffs, in March, 1880. He says he \u201cwent over the whole of the lot with him, and showed him the boundaries as laid down (in Monsarrat\u2019s map). He did not object to any part of it. It is very good soil, and all bottom land; was planted with cane. I laid out ditch in upper corner <em>; </em>spent two days leveling to show them where to bring on water. No part of \u2018 Field A\u2019 is higher than the ditch.\u201d Chung Fook says; \u201cWe got lots 6 and <em>7 </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>March, 1880.\u201d Lots 6 and 7, with the piece <em>\u201cF,\u201d </em>comprise \u201cField A\u201d of the Monsarrat map. \u201cNo land above 7 (lot \u2018 F \u2019) is suitable for cultivation. Outside of where I cultivate in lot 7 is about ten feet above the river. Water cannot be taken on to the highest part above lot 7, and that is the only reason I do not plant it; it is good land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">Mr. Bertleman says that lot \u201cF\u201d is a little lower than 7, three or four feet above, the river. \u201cCertainly it is fit for rice culture. They want low land. There is good manienie grass there, and some bushes. The Chinamen have had their cattle there since they took possession.\u201d Mr. G. N. Wilcox says the piece marked \u201cF\u201d could be planted; not so flat as the rest of the valley. The part next the river might be subject to freshets.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Richard Gerke says of this tract of land that he examined it, and it was rich, alluvial soil, and not so much subject to floods as some other places then planted by plaintiffs. He applied to Chung Fook to lease this land to him, and received the reply that this was not allowable by the term of the lease, and that by and by they would plant it themselves. That the place was grown up with bushes and grass, and had cattle on it that looked well.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We think that the effect of this testimony is, that not only was this lot delivered to plaintiffs, but that its possession was retained by them. It cannot properly be urged that the plaintiffs are not liable to pay rent for this piece, because they use this lot for pasturage under the agreement that defendants are to \u201c furnish pasturage upon the lands owned or controlled by the Plantation Company for the horses and cattle of Chulan &amp; Co., used in working and cultivating the land.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 cattle were to be pastured on pasture land, free of charge, presumably in common with the defendants\u2019 cattle, and not upon land which is suitable for rice culture, and delivered as such. Lot \u201cG,\u201d containing two or three acres, is declared by Messrs. Bertleman and Wilcox to be perfectly suitable for rice.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The lots \u201c B \u201d and \u201c C \u201d lie on three sides of lot 1, of Rowell\u2019s map, which plaintiffs plant with rice. Mr. Bertleman says of these lots that they are adapted for rice and have been planted in cane. Mr. Wilcox says of them: \u201cI see no reason why they should not be planted in rice.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AUX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>A. 8. Hartwell, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b114-8\"><em>F. M. </em>Hatch, for defendants.</attorneys>\n<otherdate id=\"b114-9\">Honolulu, January 30, 1884.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b114-3\">Lot <em>\u201c </em>C \u201d had been prepai\u2019ed for rice, but abandoned. Mr. Rowell, who surveyed these lands in 1880, says there were several patches around lot 1 prepared, but evidently abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">As to lots \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE,\u201d both Mr. Bertleman and Mr. Wilcox say they are now grown up with rushes, and are boggy and swampy; but it is said that their present condition is owing to neglect of draining during two or three years past. On the other hand, Mr. Rowell says that the land above 2 and 3 (lots \u201cD\u201d and \u201c E \u201d) was swampy and rush-grown, and seemed to be blighted near the sour water, and that this swamp was not caused by not keeping drains open.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We are of opinion that these lots cannot be considered as suitable for rice culture, and so exempt the plaintiffs from liability to pay rent therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Let a reference be made to the Clerk of the Court to ascertain the acreage of lots \u201c D \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>E \u201d of swampy, rush land, and on the coming in of this report a decree will be signed ordering the defendants <em>to </em>execute a lease in accordance with the agreement for 363.58 acres of land, less the acreage of lots \u201c D \u201d and \u201c E,\u201d and that the parties settle their accounts on the above basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">The decision having been filed on the 30th of January, counsel for the respective parties come before the Court, and counsel for plaintiffs claims that the plaintiffs should not pay interest on the amount found due by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">The defendants claim interest on each item of rent, as it became due, on the acreage established by the Court, which is more than the acreage claimed to be chargeable by plaintiffs, and less than that claimed by defendants. As the acreage upon which the claim was based was uncertain, and was the subject of controversy in this action, the claim for its rent was an un-liquidated claim. No demand is shown to have been made for the sum found due by the Court, nor was there any tender of this sum by the plaintiffs. The rule of law in such a ease as this is, that interest is recoverable from the date of the writ, upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>amount then due, and upon the sums thereafter becoming due, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, upon the acreage as found by the Court. We consider that the proceedings in this case are equivalent to an action by defendants to recover their rent. Interest is therefore allowed, as above, from December 4, 1882, the date of the writ.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A3q\">Honolulu, February 7, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The question is made as to the area of the land upon which the Court held that the plaintiffs were not chargeable for rent. From the proofs before us, we held that lots &lt;!D\u201d and \u201c E,\u201d as marked and testified to at the trial, were sufficiently definite.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u2022 The only question left open was as to the area of the lots so marked, and to determine which the reference was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We think that costs should be divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
