We think this principle has been carried too far in many cases. A rule which- withdraws a man and his property from the ordinary protection of the law ought not to be lightly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">It is sufficient to overthrow the defense offered here to say that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>when the injury recovered for was done, the parties had left the \u25a0\u201c hula\u201d and at that time were not engaged in any unlawful act.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AN8\"><em>F. M. Hatch, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b165-17\"><em>J. M. Davidson, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"b165-18\">Honolulu, April 7, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Further, \u201cthe general principle which allows defenses in such cases is that a party cannot maintain an action when his own illegal act must be shown as a part of his case and to make out his claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><em>Gregg vs. </em>Wyman, 4 Cush., 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In the case at bar no such proof was necessary. The first heard of the \u201c hula\u201d was from the offer of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Again, in <em>Steele vs. Burkhardt, </em>104 Mass., 63, Chapman, C. J., says : \u201cAnd it is true generally that while no person can maintain an action to which he must trace his title through his own breach of the law, yet the fact that he is breaking the law does not leave him remediless for injuries willfully or carelessly done to him and to which his own conduct has not contributed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">This principle is fatal to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">See also <em>Hall vs. </em>Corcoran, 107 Mass., 260; <em>Welch vs. Wesson, </em>6 Gray, 505 ; where the doctrine is fully sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">The Court in <em>Sutton vs. Wautosa, </em>29 Wis., 21, say: \u201cTo make good the defense (of illegality) it must appear that a relation existed between the act of violation of law on the part of the plaintiff and the injury or accident of which he complains, and the relation must have been such as to have caused or helped cause the injury or accident, not in a remote or speculative sense, but in the natural and ordinary course of events as one event is known to precede or follow another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">Cooley on Torts, p. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">We think this principle is sound and decisive of this case. The fact that plaintiff, some time previous and in a remote spot from the place of collision, had promoted an unlawful \u201chula,\u201d has no relation, that we can see, to the collision, nor did it in any way contribute to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
