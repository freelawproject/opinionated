B. Dole, </em>for libellant.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"b186-7\">Honolulu, May 30, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">If this were a case of a formal motion by defendant to file a specific answer, it may be the matter of laches should be applied to it j but that question is of little moment, for the defense must inevitably come in, plea or no plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Let the defense be allowed, as claimed, on such terms as the Court may deem just.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
