The \u2018 Halai \u2019 kuleana, as described in Land Commission Award numbered 1279, on Waiakea,\u201d is comprised in the demise. This was not brought to the attention of the Court or jury on the trial, nor to us on the arguing of the exceptions. It is clear that this changes the whole aspect of the case, and shows a good defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">We therefore think a new trial should be had, and so order. The costs of the previous trial and of these exceptions must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>paid by the defendant, as it was through his laches the case was left to the jury.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Adq\">L. <em>A. </em>Thurston, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AHb4\">P. <em>Neumann </em>and <em>W.
