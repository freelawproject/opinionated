Austin Whiting, his deputy appointed, the indictment was presented, and the motion to quash it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The Court have carefully examined their decision in Banco in <em>Rex vs. Wm. Kanaau, </em>3 Hawn., 669, in which Chief Justice Harris delivered the opinion, and think they are bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In that case, John S. Walker, Minister of Finance, was appointed Attorney-General <em>ad interim, </em>and a motion similar to the motion made in this case was made and denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The Chief Justice says: \u201c It is said that the Constitution contemplates that there should be four advisers to the King \u2014 Cabinet Officers \u2014 and that it is \u25a0 not conforming with the Constitution when two of these offices are held by one person. This may be all very true, and it may be that a prolonged neglect to fill all the offices would be a neglect to perform the duties required by the Constitution in this respect, but it by no means follows that, in case of a vacancy occurring by death or otherwise, His Majesty must fill it up precipitately, without taking time to consider, and. that lie cannot delegate the authority to act for the time being to another Ministerial officer, or that all or any of the functions of government must be suspended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We believe this to be a sound exposition of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">It follows that Walter M. Gibson was duly appointed Attorney-General by His Majesty, and began to hold the office <em>de jure. </em>But it is now said that on this motion to quash the indictment, which is a matter between the King and people and the defendant, and to which Walter Murray Gibson is not a party, the Court by this summary process shall decide that, owing to lapse of time, he has become only Attorney-General <em>da facto, </em>and that he shall be ousted from office. We think this cannot-be so done.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">In <em>Fowler vs. Beebe, et al., </em>9 Mass., 231, 234, Parsons, C. J., says that <em>\u201c </em>Mr. Smith (whose right to hold the office of Sheriff was questioned collaterally) is no party to this record, nor can he be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>legally heard, in the discussion of this plea; although our decision would as effectually decide on his title to the office as if ' were a party. This would be judging a man unheard, contrary natural equity and the policy of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u201cFrom considerations like these arises the distinction between holding an office <em>de facto </em>and <em>de </em>jure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u201cWe do not decide whether he is Sheriff <em>de jure </em>of the county of Hampden or has intruded himself into the office, but as we are of opinion that he is Sheriff in fact, we hold that is sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AV\">Kent, in his Commentaries, Vol. 3, p. 295, says: \u201c In the case of public officers who are such <em>de facto, </em>acting under color of office by an election or appointment not strictly legal, or without having qualified themselves by the'requisite tests, or by holding over after the period prescribed for a new appointment, as in the case of sheriffs, constables, etc., their acts are held valid as respects the rights of third persons who have an interest in them, and as concerns the public, in order to prevent a failure of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In Sheehan\u2019s case, which was a motion to discharge a man on habeas corpus, who had been convicted, as he claimed, by a Court which was only a Court de facto: (122 Mass., 445,446:) Gray, C. J., decides as did C. J. Parsons in the 9th Mass, case cited, and says, to decide otherwise would be 1\u2018 inconsistent with the convenience and security of the public,\u201d and further says: \u201c The appropriate form of trying his right to exercise the office of a justice is by information in behalf of the commonwealth, or perhaps by action against him by the person injured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">See also 9 Mass., 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The doctrine of these cases as to officers <em>de facto </em>is sustained by a long line of authorities in England and America, and we have found none questioning it.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">See <em>State vs. Carroll, </em>38 Conn., 449, 454-458, where Butler, O. J., makes an exhaustive examination of English and American authorities, commencing with the case of the Abbe of Fontaine, reported in the year books in 1431, where it is believed the doctrine was first established and reported, and finds scarcely a case against it from then to the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">See <em>Woodside vs. Wagg, </em>71 Maine, 207; <em>Brown vs. Lunt, </em>37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Maine, 423, 433; <em>Pepin vs. Lachenmeyer, </em>45 N. Y., 27, 32 ; <em>Nelson vs. The </em>People,, 23 N. Y., 294.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqt\"><em>W\u2019 A. </em>Whiting, Deputy Attorney-General, for the Crown,</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b86-10\"><em>A. S. </em>Hartwell, and <em>Smith &amp; </em>Thurston, for prisoner.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"b86-11\">Honolulu, January 14, 1884,</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">These authorities are sufficient on which to overrule the exceptions. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In this case the defendant claims that he has no remedy by <em>quo </em>warranto, because the officer is the Attorney-General, and he has charge of moving for that remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We are not called upon to decide now what remedy the defendant might have, but only to decide as to the validity of the remedy here sought. But the cases in 9 and 122 Mass., cited, are authority for saying that the defendant, who is aggrieved, might proceed directly to attack the officer who wrongs him.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We think he would have such a right under the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The exceptions are overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
