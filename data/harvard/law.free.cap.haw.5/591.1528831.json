The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff. A motion for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was contrary to law and evidence, was heard and denied by the presiding justice.

This bond is to the plaintiff and it conforms to the former part of the rule, being conditioned not to dispose of his property to the detriment of the plaintiff, and it provides for the payment of all the costs to accrue. But it is not the bond required by the rule, which should be to the Clerk of the Court for the further costs to accrue. A new bond is required by the rule by the party failing before the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The exceptions are dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
