The respondent noted an appeal to the Court in Banco. A bond for costs was duly filed within the ten days required by rule of Court, but accrued costs were not paid until the next day after the ten days had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">At the October term \u2014 October 15th \u2014 a motion was made by respondent\u2019s counsel to place the cause upon the calendar. The motion was resisted on the ground that the appeal was not properly perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-17\">Pending a decision, petitioner\u2019s counsel appeared before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Court in Banco on October 31st, and withdrew their objection to the allowance of the appeal, and the case was presented and argued before the Court on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">On January 12, 1885, a majority of the Court rendered a decision reversing the decree of the Chief Justice. <em>Ante, </em>page 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">On motion by petitioner\u2019s counsel, filed January 20th, the Court ordered that a rule issue returnable before the full Court on <em>the </em>80th January, 1835, ordering the respondent \u201cto show cause why the decree of the Chief Justice of the 12th September, 1884, should not stand as a final judgment and decree herein, on the ground that, as appears by the records and papers on file, no appeal was taken and perfected as required by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">From the testimony offered it seems clear that the withdrawing by counsel of objections to the appeal was not without the consent of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">A. 8. Hartwell and W. E. Castle, for petitioner, urge that the Court in banco has not obtained jurisdiction of the cause. The absence of a matter necessary to give the Court jurisdiction cannot be waived. The rule requiring costs to be paid within ten days as one of the steps necessary to an appeal has the force of law. Failure in this respect renders the appeal nugatory, and no agreement can make it valid. Parties cannot waive requirements which are for the benefit of the State. This case is to be distinguished from those in which the waiver affects irregularities pertaining to the jurisdiction over the person only, the Court already having jurisdiction of the cause and subject matter, and this matter in question affects the cause and subject matter and cannot be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\"><em>Paakuku vs. Komoikehuehu, </em>3 Hawn., 642 ; <em>Re Oopa, </em>3 Hawn, 407; <em>Rex vs. </em>Cullen, 3 Hawn., 122 ; <em>Est. of Keliiahonui, </em>July Term, 1866; <em>Paona vs. Heanu, </em>3 Hawn., 591; <em>Tisdale vs. Bark Almy, </em>4 Hawn., 503; <em>Est. of Kailikauoa, </em>3 Hawn., 459; <em>Kauhi vs. Liaikulani, </em>3 Hawn., 356; 38 Cal. 286 ; 4 Cush., 270 ; 133 Mass., 465; 6 Cush., 9 ; 119 Mass., 295 ; 5 Cush., 615; 17 Pick, 295; 21 Conn., 530 ; 22 Pick, 295; 23 Conn., 175; 10 Cal., 81; 24 Cal., <em>98.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">C. W. Ashford, for respondent \u2014 The failure to pay costs was a mere irregularity and may be waived. It is considered to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>waived if the party having a right to complain of it takes any subsequent step inconsistent with an intent on his part to take advantage of it. Consent cures error.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><em>Hansen vs. </em>Hoitt, 14 N. H., 56; <em>Holmes vs. </em>Rogers, 13 Cal., 191; <em>Keyes vs. Warner, </em>45 Cal., 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The Court has jurisdiction of the subject <em>matter </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>authority to take cognizance of, try and determine cases for separation from the marriage relation. Cooley Const. Lim., p. 397. The Court may gain jurisdiction of the parties by their consent or by their appearance without taking objection; id., 400; <em>Crane vs. Daniells, </em>20 Conn. 331; also 29 Conn., 415 ; 32 Conn., 108 ; 32 Conn., 147 ; 6 Mich., 279 ; 41 Mich., 227 ; 26 N. H., 232 ; <em>Washington Bridge Company vs. Stewart, </em>9 Howard, 413; 39 Mich. 123; 22 Mich., 78 ; 30 Me., 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">By the Couet:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Upon a careful review of the authorities cited by both sides, we are of the opinion that the rule should be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The Court in banco has jurisdiction to hear and determine, on appeal, causes for separation from bed and board. Vide Sections 1336 and 859 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\"><em>\u201c </em>A Court has jurisdiction of any subject matter, if, by the law of its organization, it has authority to take cognizance of, try and determine cases of that description. If it assumes to act in a case over which the law does not give it authority, the proceeding and judgment will be altogether void, and rights of property cannot be divested by it. And on this point there is an important maxim of the law, that consent will not confer jurisdiction, by which is meant that the consent of parties cannot empower a Court to act upon subjects which are not submitted to its judgment by the law.\u201d Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, p. 398. A jurisdictional defect of this character can be made available at any stage of the case, as the defect is fundamental, being a total want of power to act at all. A familiar illustration would be a District Court assuming to try a libel for divorce, or an indictment for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">In the case we are considering the Court had jurisdiction of the parties; they appeared and submitted their case on its merits to the final adjudication of the Court. Says Cooley id., p. 409 : \u201c It is a general rule that irregularities in the course of judicial proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ings do not render them void. An irregularity may be defined as the failure to observe that particular course of proceeding which, conformably with the practice of the Court, ought to have been observed in the case.\u201d The learned author says further that even in the same proceeding an irregularity may be waived, 'and will commonly be held to be waived if the party entitled to complain of it shall take any subsequent step in the cause inconsistent with an intent on his part to take advantage of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">This doctrine seems to be abundantly sustained by authority. In the case of the <em>Washington Bridge Company vs. </em>Stewart. 3 Howard, U. S., 413, the Supreme Court of the United States held that though this Court had j urisdiction only, on appeal, from <em>final </em>decrees' of the Circuit Court, yet if this Court actually entertains jurisdiction and affirms the decree of a Circuit Court, etc., the question whether the decree appealed from was final cannot be raised on a second appeal. The Court say: \u201cTo permit after-wards upon an appeal from proceedings on its mandate, a suggestion of the want of jurisdiction of this Court upon the first appeal, as a sufficient cause for re-examining the judgment then given, would certainly be a novelty in the practice of a Court of equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In <em>Post vs. Williams, </em>33 Conn., 147, the defect was that commissioners to settle boundaries had not taken a special statutory oath. The Court say: \u201cThere are certainly numerous decisions in our reports that the positive requirements of statutes in certain cases must be exactly complied with. But there are quite as many, espec al.y of late years, to the effect that although an error may be of a fatal nature, yet the right to take advantage of it may be lost by laches or waiver creating an estoppel.\u201d \u201cSo far as there is a conflict, those decisions are most consistent with sense and justice which prevent a party from going to trial on the merits and accepting the result if favorable, but if otherwise, taking advantage of a technical difficulty which he knew of or should have known from the beginning.\u201d \u201cThe general rule is that wnen the Court has jurisdiction of the parties and the cause, and there has been in the course of the proceedings an irregularity which might be fatal, as the omission to do some act required by law or the doing it improperly, the objection may be waived or a party may be estopped from raising it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>It is not necessary to discuss the question of estoppel or waiver by implication, for in the case at bar there was an express waiver of the irregularity in open Court, and we are freed from difficulty in deciding whether the party having the right to complain may Waive the defect or irregularity by \u00ed\u00e1ec. 7 of the Civil Code, which enacts that <em>\u201c </em>private agreements shall have no effect to contravene any law which concerns public order or morals. But individuals may, in all cases in which it is not expressly or implicitly prohibited, renounce what the law has established in their favor, when such renunciation does not affect the rights of others and is not contrary to the public good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">This Court has been uniformly strict in its rulings upon all matters concerning appeals, compelling parties to comply literally With the requirements of the statutes and rules of Court, but in only one case has it held that counsel have not the authority to waive objections to non-compliance with these rules. This is the case of <em>Paakuku vs. Komoikehuehu, </em>3 Hawn., 642, decided in 1875. This case has had our careful attention. It was rendered by a divided Court and much stress is laid by the majority of the Court that the written waiver (which was of the fact that the appeal was perfected only on the thirteenth day after the decision) was made by counsel without the consent of his client. It seems that the case was argued and submitted to the full Court on its merits, but petitioner\u2019s counsel says at the end of his brief : ilThe plaintiff\u2019s counsel allowed the defendant\u2019s counsel, as far as he is concerned, to perfect his appeal after the time. He says, nothing on that point. It is for the Court alone to reopen the decree or not.\u201d There is nothing in the papers on file to show that the plaintiff personally objected to the course taken by her counsel, and the Court, inspecting its record, on its own motion declined jurisdiction on the ground that the appeal had not been perfected in time. We think the majority of the Court erred in holding that such an irregularity could not be waived by counsel, and so far as the decision has established this as law, we feel obliged to overrule it. The Court undoubtedly considered that the defect affected the jurisdiction of the Court over the subject matter, and the views now presented, that it affected the jurisdiction over the persons only, were not clearly elaborated by counsel.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Az8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>A.
