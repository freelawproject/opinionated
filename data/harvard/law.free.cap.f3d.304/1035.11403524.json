Charles Larry Jones was convicted for his participation in a cocaine distribution conspiracy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>and sentence of 292 months of imprisonment were affirmed by this court, and certiorari was* denied by the United States Supreme Court on February 22, 1993. <em>United States v. Eley, </em>958 F.2d 1083 (table) (11th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, DeFoor v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 916, 113 S.Ct. 1271, 122 L.Ed.2d 666 (1993). On September 18, 2000, Jones filed his pro se, form \u00a7 2255 motion, which the district court denied as untimely; judgment was entered on November 20, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Jones then moved the district court to alter or amend the judgment and contended for the first time that the statute of limitations should have been equitably tolled. He argued that tolling was warranted because, in his \u00a7 2255 motion that was filed on March 28, 1997, in a related case concerning the same facts and pending at that time in the same district as this case, that he had stated: \u201cI plan on filing a 2255 on my other case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R1-76; SR1-83-Ex. A-7. Jones makes the novel argument, which is one of first impression nationwide, that this unspecific reference in a related case notified the government of his prospective intention to file a \u00a7 2255 motion in this case and preserved his right to do so. The district judge denied the motion to alter or amend the judgment because Jones \u201cfailed to make a legal showing as to why his motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7' :-2255 should' be considered timely filed.\u201d Rl-77. Jones appeals the district judge\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence as untimely and the order denying his motion to alter or amend the judgment based on equitable tolling of the one-year statute of limitations. Pursuant to the district court\u2019s certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), our review is \u201climited to the question of whether the pendency of a similar claim in another habeas proceeding operates to toll the one-year statute of limitations found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> R1-82; <em>see Murray v.

We have held that a federal prisoner whose conviction became final prior to the effective date of the AEDPA, April 24, 1996, has one year, until April 23, 1997, to file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Goodman v. United States, </em>151 F.3d 1335, 1337-38 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). Because Jones\u2019s conviction in this case was final with the denial of certiorari in his direct appeal by the United States Supreme Court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> prior to the effective date of the AEDPA, his one-year, statutory limitation period for filing his \u00a7 2255 petition terminated on April 23, 1997.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Helton v.

Department of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 457, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990). A fundamental purpose for the AEDPA was to establish finality in post-conviction proceedings. <em>Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 178, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 2127, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 420, 436, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 1490, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In contrast to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, where federal habeas proceedings for state prisoners involve comity and federalism concerns in addition to finality, the Supreme Court has clarified that \u00a7 2255 does not implicate exhaustion or other collateral proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Duncan, </em>533 U.S. at 178-80, 121 S.Ct. at 2127-29. Since the Court has upheld \u201cthe signal purpose[] animating AEDPA [a]s [being] the desire of Congress to achieve finality in criminal cases, both federal and state,\u201d through strict interpretation of the one-year limitation period for federal prisoners in \u00a7 2255, we must be cautious in analyzing a \u00a7 2255 petitioner\u2019s appellate issues not to \u201ccreate a loophole which is contrary to the legislative intent of insuring a greater degree of finality.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Brackett v.

United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.1999) (per <em>curiam); see Calderon v. United States Dist.

The <em>petitioner </em>has the burden of proving entitlement to equitable tolling by showing that \u201cextraordinary circumstances that were both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence\u201d prevented filing the petition on time. <em>Akins, </em>204 F.3d at 1090; <em>see Trenkler v.

[and that a] petitioner must show that he or she \u2018exercised reasonable diligence in investigating and bringing [the] claims\u2019 \u201d (third alteration added) (internal citations omitted)). Federal courts \u201cmust examine each case on its facts\u201d and apply statutory law and controlling precedent to determine if a particular request qualifies for equitable tolling of the unequivocal, one-year limitation period. <em>Fisher v. Johnson, </em>174 F.3d 710, 713 (5th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1164, 121 S.Ct. 1124, 148 L.Ed.2d 991 (2001); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">Jones\u2019s appointed appellate counsel offers three reasons for his failure to file his \u00a7 2255 motion within the one-year limitation period that allegedly qualify for equitable tolling.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The first is that the government had notice that Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was going to be filed in this case because of his unspecific reference in his other \u00a7 2255 motion, filed timely in a similar case in the same district with the same counsel, that he was going to file a \u00a7 2255 motion in his \u201cother\u201d case, purportedly meaning <em>this </em>case. \u2018 This argument is fraught with problems, not the least of which is the fact that Jones has provided no direct authority for his innovative proposition, and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">Jones has misapprehended the notice requirement concerning the one-year limitation period, which derives from the mandatory language of \u00a7 2255 as well as his burden of proof. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (\u201cA 1-year period of limitation <em>shall apply </em>to a motion under this section.\u201d (emphasis added)). The onus is on Jones, not on the government, to show why he did not file his \u00a7 2255 motion within the statutory limitation period. His deflective notice argument misses the issue and misconstrues his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">Even if Jones\u2019s notice argument were colorable, he failed to provide specific notice that he meant <em>this </em>case. It is impracticable to expect the government, inundated with numerous prisoners\u2019 cases, 'to parse any petitioner\u2019s <em>other </em>cases to find an unspecific reference to filing a collateral motion in another case and to know which ease is meant. We will not place such an unrealistic burden on the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that a timely filed \u00a7 2254 motion will not toll the analogous one-year limitation period for a second, untimely \u00a7 2254 petition, <em>Duncan, </em>533 U.S. at 181-82, 121 S.Ct. at 2129, and the First and Fourth circuits have held that pending motions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 will not toll the one-year limitation period for a \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>Trenkler, </em>268 F.3d at 24-27; <em>United States v. Prescott, </em>221 F.3d 686, 688-89 (4th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rejecting petitioner\u2019s equitable tolling argument, the First Circuit reasoned that the pen-dency of petitioner\u2019s Rule 33 motion for more than two years, while out of his control, \u201cprovides no basis for equitable tolling\u201d because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-5\">nothing prevented [petitioner] from filing a \u00a7 2255 motion while his Rule 33 motion was pending, just as nothing compelled him to file a motion under Rule 33 in the first place rather than seeking relief under \u00a7 2255.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-6\">That he felt it prudent to wait for the completion of yet another round of litigation before filing a motion under \u00a7 2255 <em>does not excuse his failure to com/ply with the one-year limitations period.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\"><em>Trenkler, </em>268 F.3d at 26 (emphasis added); <em>see Prescott, </em>221 F.3d at 689 (\u201cIn light of the unambiguous language of the statute and Congress\u2019 knowing rejection of an exhaustion requirement for \u00a7 2255, we would be guilty of judicial legislation were we to grant the relief [petitioner] requests.\u201d). Otherwise, \u201cevery defendant seeking to file an untimely \u00a7 2255 motion could do an end-run around the AEDPA limitation period by filing a timely, but ultimately mer-itless, Rule 33 motion.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>246 F.3d 655, 659 (6th Cir.2001) (treating Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered evidence of false testimony at trial after the finality of direct review and filed after the ten-day period provided in Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(3) as a collateral challenge for the purpose of fifing an untimely \u00a7 2255 motion outside the one-year limitation period).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">Jones does not contend that newly discovered evidence or any specific cause was the reason for the delay in fifing his \u00a7 2255 motion in this case within the one-year limitation period. Instead, he relies on his unspecific notice <em>in </em>his timely filed \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>motion in another case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When even newly discovered evidence following finality of direct appeal has been determined to be ineligible for equitable tolling of the one-year \u00a7 2255 limitation period, we readily conclude that Jones\u2019s unspecific notice argument in another \u00a7 2255 case is an unsatisfactory explanation for his lack of diligence in filing his \u00a7 2255 motion in this case and an insufficient reason for the rare use of equitable tolling for failing to file his \u00a7 2255 motion within the statutory limitation period. <em>See Irwin, </em>498 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. at 458 (\u201cWe have generally been much less forgiving in receiving late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">Jones\u2019s counsel next argues that, since both of his \u00a7 2255 cases concern the same facts,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> they \u201crelate back\u201d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; thus, he can amend his untimely \u00a7 2255 motion in this case with his timely \u00a7 2255 in another case and thereby avoid the statutory one-year limitation period. Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 16-18. Like Jones\u2019s first argument, this contention is attenuated. The cases that he cites from our circuit involve amendments to \u00a7 2255 motions in the <em>same </em>case' and not an untimely \u00a7 2255 motion serving as an amendment to a timely \u00a7 2255 motion in <em>another </em>case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">Our cases, however, indicate that equitable tolling based on relation back is inappropriate. We have recognized that Rule 15(c) \u201c \u2018has been revised to prevent parties against whom claims are made from taking unjust advantage of otherwise inconsequential pleading errors to sustain a limitations defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pruitt v. United States, </em>274 F.3d 1315, 1318 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting Advisory Committee Note to 1991 Amendments to Rule 15). This case does not involve a technical pleading error, but an attempt to evade a statutory limitation period. <em>See Mederos v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.2000) (vacating district court\u2019s dismissal of petitioner\u2019s sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>ond \u00a7 2255 motion as time barred when it \u201ccured the initial \u00a7 2255 motion\u2019s technical deficiency\u201d of petitioner\u2019s failure to sign it). This \u201crelatively narrow purpose\u201d of Rule 15(c) can be thwarted in the post-conviction context: \u201cthe effective date of the claims made in amendments to habeas corpus petitions [would be] irrelevant, because if the claim could not be added by amendment, it could be asserted by subsequent petition that would not be barred by any limitations period.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Pruitt, </em>274 F.3d at 1818. Additionally, allowing such amendments \u201cwould effectively require the government to prepare its case a second time,\u201d which is not an equitable remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Significantly, \u201c[u]nder Rule 12 of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2255 Proceedings, a district court may apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in a lawful manner <em>not inconsistent with the Rules Governing \u00a7 2255 Proceedings.\u201d Mederos, </em>218 F.3d at 1254 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-6\">A motion shall be limited to the assertion of a claim for relief against <em>one judgment only </em>of the district court. If a movant desires to attack the validity of other judgments of that or any other district court under which he is in custody or may be subject to future custody, as the case may be, he shall do so by <em>separate motions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">Rules Governing \u00a7 2255 Proceedings 2(c) (emphasis added). Under this rule, Jones cannot join his two \u00a7 2255 motions through amendment or otherwise. This argument is a thinly veiled attempt to escape the strictures of a clear statutory-limitation period. Jones\u2019s \u201ccurrent predicament\u201d plainly results from \u201chis inattention to the limitation period of \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Prescott, </em>221 F.3d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">Finally, Jones\u2019s counsel contends that, since his \u00a7 2255 motions were pro se and based on the same facts and law, these motions should be liberally construed together to capture the timely filing of the first \u00a7 2255 motion to preserve this second petition. Similar to his relation-back argument, the cases cited for this proposition do not concern joining two separate cases by using the statutory limitation period for a timely filed \u00a7 2255 motion in one case to save an untimely filed \u00a7 2255 motion in another case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Our court has determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>that a petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, raising ineffective assistance of counsel, is an unavailable, successive petition when a district judge recharacterizes a Rule 33 motion as both a Rule 33 and \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>O\u2019Ryan Castro v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 1270, 1273-75 (11th Cir.2002). Not only did we strictly \u201capply the AEDPA restrictions to successive \u00a7 2255 petitions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1274, but also we stated that \u201cthe ineffective assistance of counsel claim was available to [petitioner] at the time he filed his initial motion for new trial, and he had an opportunity to raise this claim during the adjudication of his recharacterized \u00a7 2255 petition,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">Jones\u2019s reiterated statements that the facts are identical in his two \u00a7 2255 motions as a means to join them for the purpose of securing a timely filing date for this untimely \u00a7 2255 motion belie his liberal-construction argument. He plainly did know the one-year statutory limitation period because his first \u00a7 2255 motion was filed timely. <em>Cf. Felder v. Johnson, </em>204 F.3d 168, 171-73 (5th Cir.) (holding that ignorance of the law is insufficient rationale for equitable tolling), cert. <em>denied, </em>531 U.S. 1035, 121 S.Ct. 622, 148 L.Ed.2d 532 (2000). Because the facts are the same, Jones could have timely filed <em>both </em>of his \u00a7 2255 motions within the one-year statutory limitation period. \u201c[T]he fact that a statute of limitations creates certain inefficiencies or inconveniences hardly qualifies as an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 that \u2018prevent[s]\u2019 a litigant from complying with the strictures of the applicable limitations period.\u201d <em>Trenkler, </em>268 F.3d at 25 (citation omitted) (first alteration added). Significantly, an inefficiency consideration is irrelevant in the context of a mandatory statute-of-limitations period; the issue is not whether a district court \u201cshould have <em>decided\u201d </em>petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion while his Rule 33 motion was pending, but \u201cwhen [petitioner] should have <em>filed\u201d </em>his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>Equitable tolling does not apply \u201cto what is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect.\u201d <em>Irwin, </em>498 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">None of Jones\u2019s reasons for equitable tolling of the one-year, statutory-limitation period for filing his \u00a7 2255 motion at issue in this appeal qualifies under our dual circuit standard.

In <em>Duncan, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted the phrase \"application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) to mean that <em>only state, not federal, </em>habeas corpus proceedings toll the one-year limitation period during the pendency of a timely filed federal habeas petition. 533 U.S. at 181-82, 121 S.Ct. at 2129. To fulfill the AEDPA statutory purpose of finality in addition to the plain, mandatory language, the Court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-9\">Section 2244(d)(l)'s limitation period and \u00a7 2244(d)(2)\u2019s tolling provision, together with \u00a7 2254(b)\u2019s exhaustion requirement, encourage litigants <em>first </em>to exhaust all state remedies and <em>then </em>to file their federal habe-as petitions as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-10\">[O]ur sole task in this case is one of statutory construction, and upon examining the language and purpose of the statute, we are convinced that \u00a7 2244(d)(2) <em>does not toll the limitation period during the pendency of a federal habeas petition.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 181, 121 S.Ct. at 2129 (third emphasis added). If a timely filed \u00a7 2244 habeas petition will not toll the one-year limitation period for an untimely filed, second \u00a7 2254 petition, where there are comity and exhaustion concerns relative to state courts, then a timely filed \u00a7 2255 motion clearly will not toll the one-year limitation period for a second, untimely filed \u00a7 2255 motion, where the issues of comity and exhaustion of state remedies are not present. <em>See Trenkler, </em>268 F.3d at 23 (\"Federal habeas review of state convictions under \u00a7 2254 implicates principles of comity that are inapplicable in the context of federal review of federal convictions under \u00a7 2255.\u201d); <em>Prescott, </em>221 F.3d at 689 (\"Moreover, \u00a7 2244(d) indicates Congress was aware of tolling issues regarding post-conviction relief proceedings, yet chose not to add an exhaustion requirement for post-trial motions to \u00a7 2255.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">. Taken to its logical conclusion, Jones's notice argument theoretically could preserve filing a motion for post-conviction relief indefinitely, which would be diametrically counter to the finality purpose of the AEDPA. If Jones were to prevail in this appeal, then he would have successfully preserved the filing of his \u00a7 2255 motion for more than seven years from the finality of his conviction. Because federal courts have extrapolated from and interchanged \u00a7 2255 and \u00a7 2254 decisions, such a result potentially could be en-grafted in the \u00a7 2254 context, which would extend a resolution that would circumvent the finality impetus of the AEDPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">.

Among the cases quoted by Jones's counsel is the seminal case for pro se, liberal-construction jurisprudence, <em>Haines v.

Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 19 &amp; 21. Also inapposite is the quotation from <em>Irwin, </em>which, quoted in full, states: \"We have allowed equitable tolling in situations where the claimant has <em>actively pursued his judicial remedies </em>by filing a defective pleading <em>during the statutory period, </em>or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass.\" 498 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. at 457-58 (emphasis added); Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 19 &amp; 24. Jones did not actively pursue <em>this </em>\u00a7 2255 motion during the applicable statutory limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">Regarding the law in our circuit, Jones\u2019s counsel quotes from <em>Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488 (11th Cir.1991), that \"[t]his court has a duty to 'liberally construe [a pro se litigant's] assertions to discern whether jurisdiction to consider his motion can be founded on a legally justifiable base.\u2019 \" Petitioner's Brief at 19 &amp; 21 (quoting <em>Fernandez, </em>941 F.2d at 1491). Yet, the <em>Fernandez </em>panel determined that the prisoner/petitioner's collateral attack on his sentence through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) was denied correctly by the district judge as untimely for failure to file within the statutory period: \u201cA court has no authority to extend the 120-day period and has no jurisdiction over a Rule 35(b) motion filed after the period runs.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>941 F.2d at 1492. Jones's quotations from <em>United States v. Grant, </em>256 F.3d 1146 (11th Cir.2001), are misapplied because <em>Grant </em>concerns the proper filing of a notice of appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b) and not a \u00a7 2255 motion. Petitioner's Brief at 21 &amp; 22. Critical to our court's permitting the appeal when Grant, who had two convictions, had omitted one of the case numbers from his timely notice of appeal and thus filed a second, untimely notice of appeal, was because \"a consolidated sentencing hearing on both cases was held in the district court, and there was only one judgment and commitment order entered for both cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1151. The timely \u00a7 2255 motion that Jones seeks to amend or join with his untimely \u00a7 2255 motion for the purpose of complying with the statutory limitation period is from a separate criminal trial <em>and judgment. </em>In contrast to <em>Grant, </em>these convictions were not consolidated for sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">. Given the mandatory one-year-limitation period in \u00a7 2255, Jones's filing a timely \u00a7 2255 motion in his related case based on the'same facts, and our circuit requirements for equitable tolling, the district judge did not err in not according Jones a hearing before ruling on his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See In re Boshears, </em>110 F.3d 1538, 1541 n. 1 (11th Cir.1997) (recognizing that \"hearing and findings of fact [are] not required for [a] \u00a7 2255 motion where 'the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief\u2019 \u201d (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255)).
