Since Maharaj filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, <em>et seq., </em>the provisions of that act apply. Because Maharaj\u2019s resentencing had not occurred at the time he filed his habeas petition, his court judgment had not become final, and thus his federal ha-beas petition, which challenged all of his convictions and sentences, was not ripe for review. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice, which will allow Maharaj to refile his federal habeas petition now that the state court has completed its resentencing, was not in error. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-21\">Maharaj, serving three life sentences for one count of first-degree murder and two counts of armed kidnapping, a 15-year sentence for unlawful possession of a firearm while engaged in a criminal offense, and who was awaiting resentencing on another conviction for first-degree murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>filed a habeas corpus petition challenging his convictions and sentences on a variety of constitutional grounds, on 12 July 2001 in district court. Maharaj challenged \u201chis convictions and sentences,\u201d Rl-1-5, \u00b625, and more specifically, \u201chis convictions and sentence of death,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20, \u00b688,not just the convictions and non-capital sentences that had become final at the time of filing. The state moved to dismiss and contended that, because the state court had not re-sentenced Maharaj, his federal habeas petition was not yet ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">In response, Maharaj argued that (1) all of his convictions had become final, although he was awaiting resentencing on the capital conviction, (2) he had exhausted his state remedies to challenge his convictions, so his petition must be considered or run the risk of being considered time-barred under the AEDPA, and (3) he already had been imprisoned for 14 years, because of delays that were the fault of the state, which prejudiced him greatly. The state argued that Maharaj\u2019s case was not yet final for the purposes of triggering the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations because he had not been resentenced, and thus he would not lose his right to seek habeas relief regarding any of his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">The magistrate judge issued a report, recommending that the state\u2019s motion to dismiss be granted without prejudice to Maharaj to allow him to refile his federal habeas petition after the state court had resentenced him. The magistrate judge summarized the lengthy procedural history of the case, which is undisputed by the parties. The magistrate judge recommended dismissing Maharaj\u2019s habeas petition, relying on the Ninth Circuit decision in <em>United States v. Colvin, </em>204 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir.2000), to conclude that the district court should not review the petition until Maharaj\u2019s state judgment had become final after resentencing. The magistrate judge stated that the statute of limitations under the AEDPA would not begin to run until Maharaj had been resentenced, and that, as long as Maharaj timely filed his habeas petition after the resentencing, the state would be estopped from presenting the time-bar argument. The magistrate judge reasoned that, although the habeas petition clearly addressed the non-capital convictions, Maharaj \u201chad painted his claims with such a broad brush [that] the Petition also encompasses the offense for which he is still subject to the death penalty\u201d and that it would be impossible to separate the habeas claims that only applied to the non-capital convictions from the claims that applied to the unsentenced capital conviction. Rl-16-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-8\">The district court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, overruled Maharaj\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, and stated that \u201cthe critical question is whether, under the unusual circumstances presented here, [Maharaj\u2019s] convictions may be now considered separately from and before determination of, the sentence ultimately given for the Young murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The court cited two guiding principles: (1) federal courts should avoid premature interference with ongoing state proceedings, <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and (2) the AEDPA was designed to eliminate successive, piecemeal petitions for ha-beas corpus relief. <em>Id. </em>With these two principles in mind, the court determined that Maharaj\u2019s habeas petition was not ripe for adjudication. <em>Id. </em>The court noted that Maharaj\u2019s petition sought relief from all of his convictions and sentences, and that \u201cthe letter and the spirit of the AEDPA\u201d suggested that it would be appropriate to review Maharaj\u2019s petition only after the state court had resentenced Ma-haraj. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The court also found that the state would be estopped from reversing its position and attempting to raise a statute of limitations defense to a subsequent petition that was timely filed. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>The court dismissed Maharaj\u2019s habeas petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">Maharaj filed a motion for certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), which the district court granted: \u201cthe question of whether a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in a ease in the same procedural posture as this one should be heard, or dismissed without prejudice, is one of first impression in the Eleventh Circuit, and is therefore one on which reasonable jurists may differ.\u201d Rl-21. Maharaj proceeded with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">Maharaj argues that, although he was awaiting resentencing on one of his state convictions at the time he filed his habeas petition, because it has taken more than 15 years for the state court to vacate his death sentence and remand for resentenc-ing, and, because the other four non-capital state court convictions and sentences were final at that time and ripe for review, he should not have to wait any longer to attempt to obtain federal habeas relief. He contends that his non-capital convictions do not implicate the state court\u2019s grant of post-conviction resentencing relief as to the capital conviction. Maharaj also avers that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas claims as to the four final state convictions, by causing further delays in the habeas review process, thwarted Congress\u2019s desire to expedite this process. He further maintains that, if he is not allowed to proceed in habeas as to the final, non-capital convictions and sentences, he will be time-barred from bringing these claims in a federal habeas proceeding after he is resentenced on the capital conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Harrell v. Butterworth, </em>251 F.3d 926, 930 (11th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 1367, 152 L.Ed.2d 360 (2002). Before bringing a habeas petition in federal court, a petitioner must exhaust all state remedies that are available for challenging his conviction, and the petitioner is not \u201cdeemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State ... if he has the right under the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) &amp; (c). The one-year period of limitation for filing a federal habeas petition runs, in pertinent part, from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). In the context of a federal habeas petition, the statute of limitations runs from the date of state resen-tencing and not the date of the original judgment. <em>Hepburn v. Moore, </em>215 F.3d 1208, 1209 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-11\">As the district court noted and the parties contend on appeal, we apparently have not addressed directly whether a district court may consider a state prisoner\u2019s federal habeas petition, when all of the petitioner\u2019s convictions have become final, and four of his sentences have become final, but he is awaiting resentencing on a capital count. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379, (1982), our decision in <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc), and the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Colvin, </em>204 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir.2000), provide sufficient guidance to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-12\">In <em>Younger, </em>the Supreme Court held that, except in extraordinary circumstances, a federal court must abstain from deciding issues implicated in an ongoing criminal proceeding in state court. <em>Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 53-54, 91 S.Ct. at 755. The Court expressed the national public policy against federal court interference with ongoing state proceedings, based in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>part on \u201cthe notion of \u2018comity,\u2019 that is, a proper respect for state functions ... and a continuance of the belief that the National Government will fare best if the States and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 91 S.Ct. at 750. In <em>Rose, </em>which concerned the exhaustion requirement under \u00a7 2254, the Supreme Court stated that the exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional but derives from principles of comity, which \u201cprotect the state courts role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>455 U.S. at 518, 102 S.Ct. at 1203. The Court reasoned that \u201c[rjequiring dismissal of petitions containing both exhausted and unex-hausted claims will relieve the district courts of the difficult if not impossible task of deciding when claims are related, and will reduce the temptation to consider unexhausted claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519, 102 S.Ct. at 1204. If a petitioner fails to exhaust state remedies, the district court should dismiss the petition without prejudice. <em>Id. at </em>519-20, 102 S.Ct. at 1203-04. In <em>Clisby, </em>we expressed our concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions filed by state prisoners and stated that \u201c[pjolicy considerations clearly favor the contemporaneous consideration of allegations of constitutional violations grounded in the same factual basis: .\u2018a one-proceeding treatment of a petitioner\u2019s case enables a more thorough review of his claims, thus enhancing the quality of the judicial product\u2019.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">In <em>Colvin, </em>the petitioner had been convicted of one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and three counts of aiding and abetting in the distribution of cocaine. Colvin appealed his convictions, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. On remand, the district court amended the judgment, and Colvin immediately filed a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. When Colvin filed his habeas petition, the time to appeal the district court\u2019s amended judgment had not yet elapsed. The Ninth Circuit held that, in a case in which an appellate court partially or wholly reverses a defendant\u2019s conviction or sentence and remands to the district court, the petitioner\u2019s \u201cjudgment does not become final, and the statute of limitations does not begin to run, until the district court has entered an amended judgment and the time for appealing that judgment has passed.\u201d <em>Colvin, </em>204 F.3d at 1225. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that this bright-line approach was easy to follow, would avoid speculation and litigation about the finality of the judgment, would allow defendants to exhaust their appeals on direct review before bringing collateral attacks, and comported with that court\u2019s rule that a district court lacks authority to entertain a habeas petition while direct review is pending. <em>Id. </em>at 1225-26. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-8\">Because Maharaj\u2019s resentencing had not occurred at the time he filed his habeas petition, his state judgment had not become final, and thus his habeas petition, which challenged all of his convictions and sentences, was not ripe for review at that time. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice, which will allow Maharaj to refile his habeas petition now that the state court has completed its re-sentencing, was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
