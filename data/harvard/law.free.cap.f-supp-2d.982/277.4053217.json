Defendants moved to dismiss all counts of the CAC <em>(see </em>Dkt. Nos. 357, 360, 364, 366, 368, 373), and the parties have fully briefed the motions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">I. <em>INTRODUCTION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">If ever there was a federal securities fraud case that offered the parties a unique opportunity to depart from scripted litigation strategy and give Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure a fair chance, this was it: an action that could have served as a prime candidate for litigants to test that exceedingly rare prospect.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">At the initial conference on this matter, the Court likened the events surrounding the catastrophic collapse of MF Global Holdings Limited (\u201cMF Global\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) in the closing days of October of 2011 to a massive train wreck in which thousands of people \u2014 passengers, crew, bystanders, and others \u2014 were seriously injured upon sudden impact with a force the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>victims could not see coming. As Plaintiffs relate the events, at the culmination of what occurred at MF Global in the course of a few days, $1.6 <em>billion </em>had disappeared from the company. Cash from customer accounts could not be found. Initially, no one could explain what happened to the money. Much later on, its trail was traced through circuitous international channels to MF Global corporate accounts, where the funds had been improperly commingled and used to cover questionable company transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The Court\u2019s train wreck analogy was meant as a hint giving a form of guidance. As the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur suggests, when an unusual accident strikes during the particular defendant\u2019s watch and control over the circumstances, especially in a case of immense magnitude such as the disaster at issue here, some facts about the calamity\u2019s proximate cause may be presumed: at minimum that someone somewhere did something wrong \u2014 and presumably not anyone directly hurt by the misfortune. Bearing this premise in mind as a starting point, the Court\u2019s observation suggested a practical framework within which the parties could examine the legal issues the case raises and consider pursuing the exceptional route to the most speedy, economical, and just resolution possible. With the assumption up front that something here went terribly awry, the parties could more easily turn to the search for relevant evidence, thus enabling them much sooner to sort out legal issues and to apportion responsibility in a manner consistent with the fuller record. Unfortunately, the suggestion of such an economical shortcut held no sway. Apparently, efficiency was not in the cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">And so, before further investigation into Plaintiffs\u2019 claims as to what set in motion such an extraordinary chain of events, Defendants seem convinced that no one named in this lawsuit could possibly have done anything wrong. So confident are they of the validity of this perception that, at what must have amounted to an enormous expenditure of money, time and energy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> they seek a court ruling dismissing the complaint in its entirety, thus barring any discovery that might shed light on remaining unknowns that bear momentous consequences for the victims who have suffered the losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">MF Global\u2019s demise, however, is not a complete mystery. In their CAC, Plaintiffs compiled an extensive factual recitation, which the Court must accept as true for the purposes of ruling on Defendants\u2019 motions, comprising 695 paragraphs, filling 218 pages, and pleading 14 claims of unlawful conduct arising from the events leading to the eventual disintegration and bankruptcy of MF Global on October 31, 2011. As detailed below, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations suggest a long, knowing, and consistent course of action on the part of the various Defendants, wrongful conduct that cumulatively produced the harmful outcome that came to pass. Moreover, this account is not based on pure speculation or the traditional pleading foundation grounded primarily upon information and belief. Rather, Plaintiffs\u2019 portrayal of the facts possesses an added measure of reliability and plausibility. It draws heavily from the public record of information generated by various investigations performed by government regulators and congressional committees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>As highlights of the most salient of Defendants\u2019 wrongful acts, Plaintiffs assert that MF Global: inflated its profits by-recording deferred tax assets on its balance sheet even in light of evidence, known to the Officers, that the Company would never realize those assets; engaged in a high-risk strategy of investing in European sovereign debt while simultaneously concealing the size of and risk posed by those investments; repeatedly increased its European sovereign debt investments, in spite of concerns expressed on numerous occasions by its chief risk assessment officer and in violation of the company\u2019s own trading limits \u2014 trading limits that started at $500 million and within 15 months exceeded $6 billion in exposure; undertook this risky investment strategy despite numerous internal reports that indicated a lack of sufficient internal controls to manage MF Global\u2019s liquidity and capital requirements; fired a chief risk officer who questioned whether MF Global\u2019s new investment strategy was prudent and replaced him with another officer who initially supported the new strategy, but who later also voiced similar warnings about the company\u2019s financial condition; and used intra-day transfers from various MF Global accounts, including those involving customer funds, to cover increasing liquidity demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Despite these dire signs of mounting crisis, MF Global continued to issue securities in public exchanges, repeatedly assuring investors that everything at the Company was running smoothly, that it possessed sufficient liquidity to cover its financial exposure, and that it had put in place strong internal controls sufficient to check against any management failures.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Plaintiffs purchased MF Global securities issued while, unknown to them, these circumstances were internally-unfolding and the company was unraveling. They brought suit against the numerous Defendants they claim were aware of the events and contributed to bringing them about, specifically the MF Global officers, directors, and underwriters \u2014 all twenty-three of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Defendants, all twenty-three of them, now ask the Court to dismiss the complaint \u2014 every claim in it. Curiously, they suggest that Plaintiffs\u2019 exhaustive pleadings give Defendants both too much detail and too little \u2014 more information than necessary to present a concise statement of the facts, and yet not enough to give Defendants fair notice of why they are being sued. By Defendants\u2019 account, and giving a broad interpretation to the logic and end result of their theories, nothing happened at MF Global for which a single one of the twenty-three Defendants could possibly bear any legal responsibility. As Defendants read the complaint and construe the applicable statutes, nothing in law or legal theory now exists \u2014 not even simple negligence principles \u2014 under which any of the individuals and entities involved in MF Global\u2019s management, or in its issuance of securities during the Company\u2019s destruction, can be held accountable for any of the wrongdoing that Plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The natural implications of this extreme perspective are far-reaching. Defendants\u2019 contentions would suggest that the fall of MF Global Plaintiffs portray either never happened, or, if it did occur, that \u2014 since no one associated with the Company played a causal role in the events \u2014 perhaps the debacle must have been the fateful work of supernatural forces, or else that the explanation for a spectacular multi-billion dollar crash of a global corporate giant is simply that \u201cstuff happens\u201d \u2014 instantaneously, of its own accord, without any knowledge or causal agency whatsoever by any one of the many sophisticated business executives in charge of the company\u2019s day to day affairs. Perhaps worse yet, a fair inference that follows from the conception of the law Defendants advocate is that, even assuming the truth of everything Plaintiffs allege, what transpired at MG Global over the course of the year before the Company\u2019s collapse \u2014 including the sudden unexplained disappearance of $1.6 billion of customer money \u2014 represents the governing industry standard for doing business, the acceptable model for how corporate managers should be permitted to run a company\u2019s affairs in the ordinary course, insulated from accountability that not only Plaintiffs but also the public should rightfully expect from issuers of securities. Were the Court to dismiss the CAC, it would effectively have to find that even assuming the compelling facts pled here, viewed against the applicable standard of review, there is no viable construction of law under which Defendants\u2019 actions would give rise to any plausible claim that some violation of the securities statutes occurred. Such a ruling would be tantamount to raising the pleading bar to unattainable heights, in essence elevating the test so as to demand levels of details and precision far surpassing anything that the threshold of the federal securities laws, or even the <em>Iqbal/Twombly </em>standard, could have contemplated. To end this prologue on a higher lyrical note, if on this record as pled Plaintiffs cannot make out a plausible claim here, they could not make it anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Accordingly, upon a review of Defendants\u2019 numerous motions in the light of Plaintiffs\u2019 account of facts which the Court accepts as true, the Court is not persuaded by Defendants\u2019 arguments. In evaluating the application of the law that Defendants argue would allow the outcome they seek at this stage of the litigation, the Court\u2019s assessment may be simply stated: It cannot be. Thus, for the reasons stated below, Defendants\u2019 motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">II. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 asserted claims arise from events that led to the 2011 collapse of MF Global.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Briefly stated, Plaintiffs allege that MF Global\u2019s public filings and the public statements made by MF Global\u2019s officers materially misled investors in two ways. First, Plaintiffs claim that MF Global failed to record a valuation allowance against its Deferred Tax Assets (\u201cDTA\u201d) until October 25, 2011, even though Generally Accepted Accounting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> required MF Global to take that valuation allowance earlier. Second, Plaintiffs fault MF Global and Defendants for misstatements and omissions related to the Company\u2019s proprietary investments in European sovereign debt through repurehase-to-maturity (\u201cRTM\u201d) transactions (the, \u201cRTM Strategy\u201d). According to Plaintiffs, MF Global and Defendants (1) purposefully concealed the proprietary nature of the RTM transactions, (2) materially misstated and failed to disclose how the RTM strategy posed significant liquidity risks to the Company, and (3) misrepresented and failed to disclose weaknesses in MF Global\u2019s ability to prevent a liquidity crisis of the kind that caused MF Global\u2019s eventual collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">A. <em>THE PARTIES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\n<em>1.Plaintiffs and the Class</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Plaintiffs assert that they bring this action \u201cindividually and on behalf of a proposed class of persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired\u201d certain interests in MF Global between May 20, 2010 and November 21, 2011 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). (CAC \u00b6 1.) The Class consists of persons and entities who acquired, during the Class Period, (1) MF Global\u2019s publicly traded securities; (2) MF Global\u2019s common stock in a June 2010 secondary offering (the \u201cSecondary Offering\u201d); (3) MF Global\u2019s 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2016 (the \u201c2016 Notes\u201d), issued in February 2011; (4) MF Global\u2019s 3.375% Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2018 (the \u201c2018 Notes\u201d), issued in July 2011; (5) MF Global\u2019s 6.25% Senior Notes due August 8, 2016 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), issued in August 2011; and (6) MF Global securities through employee benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">2. <em>Officer Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">Defendant Corzine served as Chairman of the MF Global Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and as Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of both MF Global and MF Global\u2019s broker-dealer subsidiary, MF Global Inc. (\u201cMFGI\u201d), from March 23, 2010 to November 4, 2011. Defendant MacDonald served as MF Global\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) from April 2008 through March 2011.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant Steenkamp served as MF Global\u2019s CFO from April 2011 through the end of the Class Period. The CAC alleges that the Officer Defendants had access to information about MF Global that was not disclosed to the public, and that they \u201cwere all involved in drafting, producing, reviewing and disseminating the financial statements and other reports at issue in this case during their tenure with the Company.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 32.) The CAC also claims that the Officer Defendants \u201cwere able to and did control the content of MF Global\u2019s various press releases, SEC filings and other public statements during the Class Period.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">3. <em>Independent Director Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">The Independent Director Defendants each served on MF Global\u2019s Board during the Class Period. The CAC alleges that the Independent Directors had access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>information about MF Global that was not disclosed to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">4. <em>Underwriter Defendants and Senior Notes Underwriter Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The Underwriter Defendants and Senior Notes Underwriter Defendants each served as an underwriter for one or more of the public offerings at issue: the Secondary Offering, the 2016 Notes, the 2018 Notes, and the Senior Notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">B. <em>FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The CAC outlines two categories in which Defendants made material misstatements or omissions: (1) statements about MF Global\u2019s DTA and net income, and (2) statements about MF Global\u2019s risk appetite, internal controls, and liquidity management, particularly in light of the RTM Strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">1. <em>DTA and Net Income</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\u201cDeferred Tax Assets are losses, credits and other tax deductions that may be used to offset taxable income in the future.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 84.) GAAP permits a company to record DTA as assets on its balance sheet, but only to the extent the company is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to realize the DTA. <em>(Id.) </em>The company must take a valuation allowance against \u2014 that is, not count as an asset on its balance sheet \u2014 the amount of the DTA that the company is not likely to realize.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">GAAP requires the company to weigh \u201call available evidence, both positive and negative,\u201d to determine whether the company should take a valuation allowance against its DTA. (CAC \u00b6 92.) That a company suffered cumulative losses in recent prior years is significant negative evidence against recording DTA. In the face of such evidence, the company must have counteracting positive evidence in order to support its decision not to take a valuation allowance against its DTA. Such positive evidence can include tax planning strategies if those strategies are prudent and feasible and would result in later realization of the company\u2019s DTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">As of the 2010 fiscal year, which ended on March 31, 2010, MF Global had suffered cumulative losses over its previous three fiscal years, both in its U.S. operations and worldwide. During that time, MF Global primarily performed client-based commodities broker services and earned income through commission fees and interest on client accounts. As interest rates fell in the late 2000s, MF Global lost a substantial part of its income base. New CEO Corzine sought to turn around the Company\u2019s fortunes by turning MF Global into an investment bank. The Company implemented a plan to complete that conversion in three to five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">On May 20, 2010 \u2014 the first day of the Class Period \u2014 MF Global issued a press release to report its financial results for both the fourth quarter of the 2010 fiscal year and for the full fiscal year. The press release claimed that MF Global\u2019s financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. MF Global did not take a valuation allowance against its DTA. In an investor conference call held that same day, MacDonald indicated that the DTAs in issue were not \u201cas at risk\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as other deferred tax assets that MF Global held. (Deck of Benjamin E. Rosenberg, Ex. 1 at 6, Dkt. No. 370.) Corzine also failed to answer a question posed to him about MF Global\u2019s DTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>In its 2010 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on May 28, 2010 and signed by all Individual Defendants, MF Global again represented that its financial statements were in accordance with GAAP and did not record a valuation allowance for $117.9 million of MF Global\u2019s DTA. MF Global provided the following disclosure: \u201cWe have recorded significant deferred tax assets reflecting our expectation of using these loss carryforwards against future income. If we are not able to generate profits in these jurisdictions in future periods, we may be required to record valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets.\u201d (CAC \u00b6320.) The 2010 Form 10-K acknowledged that, under GAAP, \u201c[a] valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 321.) The 2010 Form 10-K did not disclose the positive and negative evidence that MF Global weighed to conclude that a valuation allowance was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">On August 5, 2010, MF Global issued a press release with its financial results for the first quarter of the 2011 fiscal year. The results, which claimed to be in accordance with GAAP, showed a small profit. In a conference call held that same day, Corzine emphasized that MF Global had \u201creturned to profitability for the first time in six quarters on a GAAP basis.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 339.) While Corzine and MacDonald noted that MF Global would have to write down some of its DTA, MacDonald assured investors that the remaining DTA was \u201cnot as at risk.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 340.) The next day, August 6, MF Global filed its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of the 2011 fiscal year with the SEC. The Form 10-Q was signed by Corzine and MacDonald and also contained the financial results in the press release, purportedly in accordance with GAAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">MF Global made similar disclosures in November 2010 (for the second quarter of the fiscal year) and February 2011 (for the third quarter of the fiscal year). The Company continued not to record a valuation allowance against its DTA and to represent that its financial statements were in accordance with GAAP. MF Global\u2019s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, filed with the SEC on February 3, 2011 and signed by Corzine and MacDonald, specifically noted that MF Global had not taken a valuation allowance against its DTA \u201cbecause the Company believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. Although realization is not assured, the Company anticipates that realization of these assets will occur.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In May 2011, MF Global disclosed financial information for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and for the full fiscal year; again, the financial information was purportedly prepared in accordance with GAAP. On its 2011 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on May 20, 2011 and signed by all Individual Defendants except MacDonald, MF Global reported a DTA valuation allowance of $19.5 million and a net DTA of $108.3 million. The 2011 Form 10-K included the following disclosure about DTA, identical to the disclosure on the 2010 Form 10-K: \u201cWe have recorded significant deferred tax assets reflecting our expectation of using these loss carryforwards against future income. If we are not able to generate profits in these jurisdictions in future periods, we may be required to record valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The 2011 Form 10-K, unlike the 2010 Form 10-K, offered a justification for MF Global\u2019s decision not to take a valuation allowance against the full DTA. The 2011 Form 10-K acknowledged that MF Global <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>was \u201cin a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position at March 31, 2011 in many jurisdictions in which [it did] business,\u201d and that such a loss position \u201cis considered negative evidence in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 391.) But the Company \u201cconcluded that the weight given this negative evidence is diminished due to significant non-recurring loss and expense items recognized during the prior three years.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>MF Global also identified \u201csufficient positive evidence to overcome this negative evidence\u201d that fell into three categories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">The first is the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences. Second, we forecast sufficient taxable income in the carry forward period. We believe that future projections of income can be relied upon because the income forecasted is based on key drivers of profitability that we began to see evidenced in fiscal 2011. Most notable in this regard are plans and assumptions relating to the significant changes to our compensation structure implemented in fiscal 2011, increased trading volumes, and other macro-economic conditions. Third, in certain of our key operating jurisdictions, we have a sufficient tax planning strategy which includes potential shifts in investment policies, which should permit realization of our deferred tax assets. Management believes this strategy is both prudent and feasible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">(CAC \u00b6 392.) MF Global\u2019s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, filed with the SEC on August 3, 2011, included substantially the same disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The CAC attacks the sufficiency of each category of positive evidence. According to the CAC, GAAP rules generally do not permit projections of future income to overcome the negative evidence from cumulative losses in recent years. The CAC also alleges that MF Global\u2019s new investment strategy, described in detail below, was high-risk and unsustainable, such that MF Global\u2019s \u201cprojections of future income were not sufficient \u2018positive evidence\u2019 to avoid taking a full valuation allowance against the Company\u2019s U.S. DTA.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The CAC also claims that projections of increased income from MF Global\u2019s changes in compensation structure \u201cwere unreliable and, more importantly, could not have offset the Company\u2019s DTA.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 122.) The CAC alleges that MF Global\u2019s increased hiring in certain areas offset layoffs in other areas, such that the Company did not achieve its target compensation-to-revenue ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Finally, the CAC notes that tying MF Global\u2019s tax planning strategies to its \u201cshifts in investment policies\u201d could not offset the Company\u2019s DTA. To the contrary, the CAC claims, \u201cthe Company was simply unable to engage in any \u2018shifts in investment policies\u2019 without first incurring significant additional liquidity strains or losses ... neither of which was \u2018prudent\u2019 or \u2018feasible.\u2019 \u201d (CAC \u00b6 135.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Eventually, MF Global determined that it could no longer avoid taking a valuation allowance against its DTA. On October 25, 2011, MF Global issued a press release with its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. The Company reported a loss of $191.6 million. A valuation allowance of $119.4 million against MF Global\u2019s DTA accounted for more than half of the loss. According to Steenkamp, most of that valuation allowance was taken against the Company\u2019s U.S. DTA. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>CAC alleges that MF Global\u2019s \u201cdisclosure of its (long overdue) valuation allowance against its U.S. DTA significantly contributed to the Company\u2019s collapse.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">2. <em>RTM Strategy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">When Corzine was named MF Global\u2019s CEO, he faced pressure from credit rating agencies to demonstrate that the Company could be profitable in the future. To achieve this goal, Corzine implemented the RTM Strategy, also known within MF Global as the \u201cCorzine Trade,\u201d beginning in July 2010. As MF Global began to implement the RTM Strategy, Corzine emphasized several times that the Company\u2019s new business plan was done to support the Company\u2019s client-based services. The strategy involved coordination between MFGI and MF Global U.K. Limited (\u201cMFG-UK\u201d), which was MF Global\u2019s affiliate in the United Kingdom. Plaintiffs allege that Corzine \u201ccommunicated with MFGI and MFG-UK personnel directly to carry out these RTM transactions.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The RTM Strategy worked as follows: first, MFG-UK purchased European sovereign debt securities on the London Clearing House (\u201cLCH\u201d) exchange. MFG-UK then sold those securities to MFGI. Next, MFGI and MFG-UK entered into an RTM agreement. MFGI thus sold the securities to MFG-UK while the firms simultaneously entered a contract for MFGI to repurchase the securities on the securities\u2019 maturity dates, at the same price plus a pre-negotiated interest payment. MFG-UK, which now owned the securities, then engaged in a similar repurchase transaction with a counterparty through the LCH. The repurchase date on that transaction was scheduled for two days before the securities\u2019 maturity date. MFG-UK thus bore the risk of default on the security, and MFGI was responsible for maintaining liquidity to cover the possible default. MFGI was also expected to provide MFG-UK with funds to cover margin calls or anticipated margin calls from the LCH.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The RTM Strategy provided MF Global with several accounting advantages. First, the RTM transactions could be counted as sales, rather than as loans, even though MFGI and MFG-UK were contractually obligated to repay the final counterparty for the securities. The obligation to repay was thus \u201cde-recognized\u201d \u2014 it did not appear as a liability on MF Global\u2019s balance sheet. The RTM transactions also allowed MF Global to report the transactions as gains at the time of the sale, notwithstanding the subsequent obligation to repay the sale price. Finally, because no liability appeared on MF Global\u2019s balance sheet, the RTM transaction did not factor into MF Global\u2019s value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) calculations. Plaintiffs allege that the RTM Strategy thus allowed MF Global \u201cto invest in high-risk assets while keeping them off its balance sheet, frontload gains and tout misleading VAR metrics \u2014 all of which created the artificial appearance of a turnaround in the Company\u2019s ailing business.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The RTM Strategy also exposed MF Global \u201cto market risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 160.) Market risk existed due to the possibility that the securities might default or be restructured. MF Global also was subject to margin calls from counterparties and to regulatory capital reserve requirements. When the security traded in the RTM transaction fell in value, MFGI was subject to corresponding margin calls that strained liquidity. A failure to post the required margin could cause MFGI to default on the transaction and require MF Global to repurchase the security at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>As part of its risk management strategy, MF Global\u2019s Board imposed limits on trading of European sovereign debt. In March 2010, that trading limit was $500 million. Corzine sought to increase that limit, and his efforts were met with concern by then-Chief Risk Officer (\u201cCRO\u201d) Michael Roseman (\u201cRoseman\u201d). Roseman eventually agreed to increase the trading limit to $1 billion in around July or August 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">By mid-September 2010, MF Global had breached that trading limit. Corzine sought to increase the trading limit to $1.5 billion and also took steps to move the RTM transactions off of MF Global\u2019s balance sheet. Roseman again expressed concern over MF Global\u2019s exposure. But despite Roseman\u2019s concern, MF Global\u2019s exposure to sovereign debt continued to increase, reaching $3.5 to $4.0 billion in late October 2010 \u2014 even though the trading limit had not yet been increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Corzine asked Roseman to request from the Board an increase in the trading limit to $4.75 billion. Roseman expressed concerns about the capital and liquidity risks associated with the increase, and he presented those concerns both to Corzine and to the Board. At a November 2010 meeting, the Board approved the request and increased the trading limit to $4.75 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Even after the November 2010 Board meeting, Roseman continued to express his concerns to Corzine. MF Global eventually dismissed Roseman as CRO in early 2011. Several former MF Global employees believe \u201cthat Roseman was fired because he warned senior management that the Company was taking on too much risk.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 187.) Other MF Global employees shared Roseman\u2019s concerns. But the person hired to replace Roseman, Michael Stockman (\u201cStockman\u201d), publicly supported Corzine\u2019s risk management strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In mid-January 2011, the MF Global Board forbade any increase in the European sovereign debt portfolio without express permission from the Board. Yet on February 3, 2011, MF Global exceeded that limit; Corzine, though made aware of the breach, did not inform the Board. Instead, in mid-February 2011, Corzine and Stockman sought an increase in the trading limit from $4.75 billion to $5 billion, with a temporary increase to $5.8 billion until March 31, 2011. Some Board members \u201cexpressed concerns about the level of exposure,\u201d but the Board approved the increase. (CAC \u00b6 200.) In March 2011, the Board granted a request from Corzine and Stockman to extend the temporary $5.8 billion limit until September 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">By April 27, 2011, the trading limits had been breached yet again. Corzine directed Stockman to prepare a request to increase the European sovereign debt trading limit to $9.75 billion. Stockman, for the first time, expressed concerns to Corzine about MF Global\u2019s ability to support its RTM Strategy. The Board approved the request only in part, increasing the trading limit to $6.6 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The Board heard other concerns about MF Global\u2019s risk management during the Class Period. An April 2010 report from the Company\u2019s Internal Audit Department (the \u201cIAD\u201d) noted that technological limitations prevented MF Global from accurately forecasting liquidity risks. A May 2010 report from the IAD expressed concerns with MF Global\u2019s ability to handle the risks associated with its expansion beyond its traditional client facilitation services. Months later, an October 2010 report from the IAD noted the same problems. The October 2010 report \u201cexpressed concern that the absence of reliable liquidity reporting tools\u201d and the excessive dependence on assistant treasurer Edith O\u2019Brien (\u201cO\u2019Brien\u201d) to manage li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>quidity issues represented risks to MF Global. (CAC \u00b6 211.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Technological concerns and limitations lasted into 2011. In March 2011, an IAD report noted that some regulatory reports were produced through spreadsheets that were \u201ctypically not secure and [were] susceptible to human error.\u201d (CAC \u00b6212.) A June 2011 IAD report referred to liquidity monitoring and forecasting as \u201cmanual and limited\u201d and also identified \u201cnumerous and significant gaps between the policy and existing practices.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 213.) Plaintiffs allege that these issues were not addressed<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that failures in liquidity monitoring directly led to MF Global\u2019s downfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Plaintiffs allege that, in light of the risks that the RTM Strategy posed to MF Global and in light of the Company\u2019s risk management weaknesses, MF Global\u2019s public statements on those subjects were inadequate. In MF Global\u2019s May 20, 2010 press release, Corzine suggested that the Company would seek to expand its activities only after \u201censuring] the appropriate controls [were] in place.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 325.) Cor-zine made similar representations on a May 20, 2010 investor conference call.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">MF Global\u2019s 2010 Form 10-K touted the Company\u2019s risk management. The form also recognized that any new strategies would be conducted within that risk management scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">We expect to increasingly recognize trading income as part of our ongoing activity for our clients in various markets, and to selectively increase our risk taking, generally making fuller use of our current risk appetite and operating within the authority delegated by our board of directors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">(CAC \u00b6 330.) The 2010 Form 10-K stated that MF Global would \u201cconsider the inherent operational risk in new products, systems, and business activities as they are developed or modified.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 332.) Finally, the 2010 Form 10-K assured investors that MF Global would maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to respond to the risks of market events. The same disclosure appeared in several of MF Globafl\u2019s subsequent SEC filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">MF Global\u2019s 2011 Form 10-K contained similar disclosures. The form emphasized that MF Global\u2019s new investment strategies would take place \u201cwithin the authority delegated by [its] Board of Directors.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 400.) The 2011 Form 10-K discussed how MF Global\u2019s Operational Risk Management Framework \u201cestablishes an effective environment\u201d to create risk controls and \u201cto help ensure transparency, awareness, and accountability of risks.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 407.) According to the 2011 Form 10-K, MF Global operated within \u201cdefined risk mandates as delegated by the CRO\u201d and tracked compliance through end-of-day and intra-day monitoring. (CAC \u00b6 409.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The Officer Defendants also stressed MF Global\u2019s commitment to risk management in various other public statements. For example, in an August 5, 2010 earnings call, MacDonald stated that \u201cthe Company maintains a strong liquidity position.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 346.) Corzine and MF Global also downplayed the risks that the Company faced. Corzine told investors that the Company was \u201cnot taking enormous market risk in executing [its] strategy.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 349.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">MF Global\u2019s August 6, 2010 Form 10-Q similarly stated that MF Global\u2019s business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201cdoes not generally present a substantial cash liquidity risk\u201d and that MF Global would \u201chave sufficient liquidity to satisfy all of [its] expected cash needs for at least one year without access to the capital markets.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 350.) The same disclosure appeared in all of MF Global\u2019s SEC filings for the remainder of the Class Period. The Officer Defendants made other public statements to the same effect \u2014 that MF Global had sufficient liquidity to withstand potential stresses on its various investment positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">MF Global did not openly acknowledge the exposure and risk resulting from the RTM Strategy until its February 3, 2011 Form 10-Q. The disclosure came in response to a request from MF Global\u2019s outside auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, for the Company to publicly disclose its RTM exposure. That disclosure read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">The Company also enters into securities financing transactions that mature on the same date as the underlying collateral. The Company accounts for these transactions in accordance with the accounting standard for transfers and servicing and recognizes a gain or loss on the sale/purchase of the collateral assets, and records a forward commitment. The Company derecognizes the collateral assets as sold when the transactions are accounted for as sales, and recognizes the collateral assets as purchased when the transactions are accounted for as purchases. In these transactions, the Company has exposure to the risk of default of the issuer of the underlying collateral assets, such as U.S. government securities or European sovereign debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">(CAC \u00b6 384.) The February 3, 2011 Form 10-Q identified $7.56 billion in derecognized RTM transactions, but contained no further discussions of the specific risks that the RTM Strategy posed. Similarly, the 2011 10-K and the August 3, 2011 Form 10-Q identified the value of derecognized RTM transactions, but did not further disclose any risks from those transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">MF Global\u2019s disclosure in its 2011 Form 10-K garnered attention from federal regulators. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) expressed its concern that, because the RTM transactions exposed MF Global to market and credit risks, MF Global might not have enough capital reserves to cover risks caused by the RTM Strategy and to comply with SEC rules. MF Global resisted FINRA\u2019s attempts to change MF Global\u2019s capital requirements, and Corzine made a personal appeal to SEC regulators. But the SEC accepted FINRA\u2019s interpretation of the SEC rules, and FINRA required MF Global to reserve further capital to cover the RTM transactions. On September 1, 2011, MF Global filed a Form 10-Q/A that amended its previous Form 10-Q to comply with FINRA\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">What MF Global did not disclose, Plaintiffs allege, is that MF Global met those capital requirements only through intracompany transfers. Moreover, the CAC claims, the required change \u201chad a devastating (but undisclosed) impact on the Company\u2019s already-existing liquidity problem\u201d and forced MF Global to rely on more intra-day transfers to meet liquidity demands. (CAC \u00b6 236.) The intra-day transfers included use of funds associated with MF Global\u2019s traditional futures commission merchant (\u201cFCM\u201d) activities \u2014 including from accounts involving customer funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">At the same time, MF Global and its officers sought to assure investors that the RTM Strategy posed minimal risks. At a July 9, 2011 conference, Corzine suggested that MF Global\u2019s principal trading activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ties made the Company \u201cless risky.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 422.) In a July 28, 2011 earnings conference call, Steenkamp claimed that MF Global \u201cbelieve[d] market risk to [the European sovereign debt] trades is minimal as these are held to maturity.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 424.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Indeed, Corzine and Steenkamp held firm on these claims even while MF Global was on the brink of collapse. On October 24, 2011, MF Global issued a letter from Steenkamp that declared that MF Global\u2019s RTMs posed a \u201climited market risk.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 447.) And on October 25, 2011, Corzine stated on an investor conference call that \u201cthe structure of the [RTM] transaction^] themselves essentially eliminates market and financing risk.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">3. <em>MF Global\u2019s Collapse</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Just before MF Global filed its October 25, 2011 Form 10-Q \u2014 in which the Company took the $119.4 million valuation allowance against its DTA \u2014 MF Global\u2019s senior management informed credit rating agencies that it was about to report a substantial loss. As a result, Moody\u2019s downgraded MF Global\u2019s debt to just above junk status.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While Corzine and Steenkamp sought to assure investors that MF Global\u2019s financial position remained strong, the market reacted negatively. MF Global\u2019s stock fell by 48 percent on the day it filed the Form 10-Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Moreover, the RTM Strategy began to unravel. MF Global\u2019s counterparties demanded additional margin to cover the transactions, which in turn raised eyebrows among investment exchanges and government regulators. The credit ratings agencies also downgraded MF Global\u2019s debt yet again, with Moody\u2019s and Fitch lowering MF Global\u2019s debt rating to junk status.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">MF Global struggled to meet the increased liquidity demands. On October 28, 2011, the Company overdrafted one of its accounts with J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. MF Global transferred money from another account to compensate, but that transfer raised questions about whether MF Global had improperly used segregated customer funds from its FCM operations to cover the overdraft.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On October 29, 2011, MF Global discovered a shortfall in its customer funds account, but attributed the shortfall to an accounting error. However, by the early morning hours of October 31, 2011, MF Global instead informed regulators that the shortfall was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">MF Global sought to sell off its assets to obtain the necessary liquidity. On October 30, 2011, the Company reached an agreement to sell its assets to another company, Interactive Brokers, for $1 billion. But that deal fell through when the customer funds shortfall came to light. MF Global declared bankruptcy on October 31. In the end, MF Global\u2019s FCM operations had a $1.6 billion shortfall in customer accounts \u2014 $900 million in domestic accounts and $700 million in foreign accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>C. <em>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">On November 3, 2011, Joseph Deangelis brought the first action in this case.

In order to plead culpable participation, a plaintiff must plead with particularity \u201cfacts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the requisite state of mind,\u201d <em>ie., </em>scienter. <em>Id.; see also In re Global Crossing, </em>2005 WL 1907005, at *12 (S.D.N.Y.

In order to withstand a motion to dismiss, a Section 20(a) claim must allege, at a minimum, particularized facts of the controlling person\u2019s conscious misbehavior or recklessness. <em>See In re Livent, Inc.

Moreover, unlike claims under the Exchange Act, claims under the Securities Act \u201cdo not require allegations of scienter, reliance, or loss causation.\u201d <em>Fait, </em>655 F.3d at 109. Instead, Section 11 imposes \u201c \u2018virtually absolute\u2019 \u201d liability on issuers, and Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) impose liability on other parties \u201cfor mere negligence.\u201d <em>In re Morgan Stanley, </em>592 F.3d at 359 <em>(quoting Herman &amp; MacLean v.

According to Cor-zine, the CAC is not \u201csimple, concise, and direct.\u201d (Corzine\u2019s Motion, p. 3.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cor-zine also claims that the CAC does not adequately identify \u201cwhich of the alleged misstatements are meant to correspond to which of the alleged reasons for the falsity of the alleged misstatements.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The CAC separates its list of alleged misstatements into statements made in each fiscal quarter from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 to the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. Within the section for each fiscal quarter, the CAC separates out the statements made with respect to MF Global\u2019s DTA and net income and the statements made with respect to MF Global\u2019s risk appetite, internal controls, and liquidity management. Then, each subsection lists the various alleged misstatements or omissions during that time period and category. Each allegation contains the statement\u2019s source and, where appropriate, highlights through bold text the particular parts of the statement alleged to be inadequate. Finally, each subsection concludes with a paragraph containing reasons why the preceding statements were false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">The Court finds that the CAC satisfies the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA. The CAC \u201cspecifically identifies] the date, publication and speaker of each of the alleged misstatements or omissions\u201d and \u201ccontain[s] facts supporting the existence and materiality of these problems.\u201d <em>In re NTL, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>347 F.Supp.2d 15, 22-23 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (footnote omitted). The CAC\u2019s use of bold text to highlight particular aspects of the statements alleged to be misleading further supports a finding of sufficient particularity. <em>Cf. In re ITT Educ. Servs., Inc. Sec. &amp; Shareholder Derivatives Litig., </em>859 F.Supp.2d 572, 578 (S.D.N.Y.2012) (faulting complaint for highlighting \u201cmore than half\u2019 of statements quoted \u201cwhile simultaneously-conceding that it is not challenging many of the statements it has chosen to highlight\u201d); <em>In re Alcatel Sec.

The CAC is thus not a complaint that is so \u201c[v]ague and disorganized\u201d as to fail to satisfy Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA. <em>In re ITT Educ. Servs., </em>859 F.Supp.2d at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">The Court also acknowledges that, in some respects, Plaintiffs are stuck between the proverbial rock of Rule 8(a) and the proverbial hard place of Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA. <em>See In re Countrywide Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>588 F.Supp.2d 1132, 1156 (C.D.Cal.2008) (recognizing that \u201cnavigating and reconciling\u201d Rule 8(a), Rule 9(b), and the PLSRA creates \u201can onerous task\u201d for securities fraud plaintiffs). Corzine seeks to take advantage of Plaintiffs\u2019 predicament by claiming both that the complaint is too detailed (and thus fails Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>8(a)) and that it is not detailed enough (and thus fails Rule 9(b) and the PLSRA). But in cases like this one, with particularly complex facts, some flexibility is warranted. <em>See In re New Century, </em>588 F.Supp.2d 1206, 1219 (C.D.Cal.2008) (\u201cThe plaintiff has the responsibility to craft a clear and concise complaint, but the allegations that discharge this responsibility will depend on the type of action, the specific facts, the number of parties, and other variables.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The Court is convinced that the CAC sufficiently achieves the goals embodied within Rule 8(a), Rule 9(b), and the PLSRA, which are \u201cto provide a defendant with fair notice of a plaintiffs claim, safeguard his reputation from improvident charges of wrongdoing, and protect him against strike suits.\u201d <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, </em>493 F.3d at 99. Indeed, Defendants\u2019 briefs in support of their motions to dismiss, which forcefully and directly attack Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of wrongdoing, are themselves proof that Defendants have notice of the claims against them. <em>See Stephenson v. Deutsche Bank AG, </em>282 F.Supp.2d 1032, 1075 (D.Minn.2003) (relying on the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss to find that complaint \u201ceffectively alerted Defendants of the claims against them\u201d). Corzine is correct that the CAC <em>could </em>state more particularly which of the reasons the statements are alleged to be false applies to which of the allegedly false statements. But imposing that requirement on Plaintiffs would serve no valid purpose, and Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA do not require such an extreme level of particularity. The Court thus finds that Plaintiffs have complied with the various pleading standards applicable their Exchange Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">2. <em>Securities Act Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">While Exchange Act claims require proof of fraud and must always be pled with particularity, Securities Act claims must be pled with particularity only where \u201cthe gravamen of the complaint is plainly fraud.\u201d <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 172. Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish their Securities Act claims from their Exchange Act claims. The CAC states that, with respect to the Securities Act claims, \u201cPlaintiffs expressly disclaim any allegations of scienter in these non-fraud claims.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 532.) At the same time, Plaintiffs include a disclaimer: that \u201cany challenged statements of opinion or belief\u2019 for which Defendants are liable under the Securities Act \u201care alleged to have been materially misstated statements of opinion or belief when made.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 disclaimer is made in an effort to comply with the Second Circuit\u2019s decisions in <em>Fait v. Regions Financial Corp., </em>which held that statements of opinion are not actionable under the Securities Act unless those opinions \u201cwere both false and not honestly believed at the time they were made.\u201d 655 F.3d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The Independent Director Defendants seize on this disclaimer to argue that the Securities Act claims do, in fact, sound in fraud and must be pled with particularity. (Independent Directors\u2019 Motion, p. 9-10.) The Independent Directors suggest that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that any opinions were false when made turns the Securities Act claims into claims requiring proof of fraud, which in turn requires Plaintiffs to plead those claims with particularity under Rule 9(b). <em>See In re Deutsche Bank AG Sec. Litig., </em>No. 09 Civ. 1714, 2012 WL 3297730, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2012) (finding that complaint cannot both disclaim allegations of fraud and also allege that defendants subjectively disbelieved their opinions when made). But the Second Circuit\u2019s recent decision in <em>Freidus v. Barclays Bank PLC, </em>734 F.3d 132. (2d Cir.2013), directly undercuts the Indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>dent Directors\u2019 argument.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There, the Second Circuit found that \u201cthe district court erred in stating that claims of disbelief of subjective opinions must necessarily be brought as fraud claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141. To the contrary, to require proof that an opinion was subjectively disbelieved does not also require proof of fraudulent intent. <em>Id.; see also Fait, </em>655 F.3d at 112 n. 5 (\u201cWe do not view a requirement that a plaintiff plausibly allege that defendant misstated his truly held belief and an allegation that defendant did so with fraudulent intent as one and the same.\u201d). It is thus clear that Plaintiffs are correct to say that a complaint can plead that opinions were subjectively disbelieved when made while not also sounding in fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In the alternative, the Independent Directors argue (Independent Directors\u2019 Motion, p. 10) that the CAC does not sufficiently separate its Exchange Act claims (which do allege fraud) from its Securities Act claims (which purport not to allege fraud). <em>Compare In re Adelphia Commc\u2019ns Corp. Sec. &amp; Derivative Litig., </em>No. 03 MD 1529, 2007 WL 2615928, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2007) (finding that Securities Act claims sounded in fraud because complaint relied on same accusations of fraud for both Securities Act and Exchange Act claims), <em>with In re Refco, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>503 F.Supp.2d 611, 613 (S.D.N.Y.2007) (finding that complaint \u201cspecifically pled alternate theories of fraud and negligence\u201d). But the Court need not decide whether Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC sufficiently accomplishes the goal of separating its fraud-based Exchange Act claims from its non-fraud-based Securities Act claims. Even if the Independent Director Defendants are correct that the CAC\u2019s Securities Act claims sound in fraud, Plaintiffs have met Rule 9(b) particularity standard for the reasons described above. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have complied with all pleading standards applicable to their Securities Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">B. <em>MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS OR OMISSIONS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">1. <em>DTA and Net Income</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Plaintiffs allege that MF Global\u2019s public statements contained false or misleading statements or omissions about MF Global\u2019s DTA and net income because \u201cthe Company failed to timely record a valuation allowance against its U.S. DTA in violation of GAAP.\u201d (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 324, 342, 357, 374, 393, 421.) Plaintiffs claim that the valuation allowance should have been taken earlier because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">(1) MF Global\u2019s U.S. operations were operating at a three-year cumulative loss as of March 31, 2010; (2) MF Global did not have evidence \u201cof sufficient quality and quantity to counteract [that] negative evidence\u201d since it was relying on, at best, \u201cunsettled\u201d events dependent on future market conditions that had not yet been demonstrated; (3) MF Global\u2019s projections of income were unreliable and dependent on the undisclosed, unsustainable and high-risk Cor-zine Trade (and only 20% of the profits from the Corzine Trade could be recorded as revenues in connection with the Company\u2019s U.S. operations); (4) MF Global\u2019s plans to realize costs savings from changes to the Company\u2019s compensation structure were unreliable and insufficient to offset losses and benefit from the Company\u2019s U.S. DTA, especially since any costs savings were partially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>offset by increases in payroll expenses due to increased professional headcount; and (5) MF Global did not have \u201cprudent\u201d and \u201cfeasible\u201d tax strategies that would have enabled it to avoid recording a full valuation allowance against its U.S. DTA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">(CAC \u00b6\u00b6 324, 342, 357, 374, 393, 421.) Defendants claim that the statements made about DTA were not materially false or misleading and raise various arguments in support. The Court addresses these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">a. <em>Whether the Statements about DTA Are Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">At the threshold, the Court must determine whether the statements made about MF Global\u2019s DTA were statements of opinion, as the Underwriters and Senior Notes Underwriters (joined by the other defendants) claim. (Underwriters\u2019 Motion, p. 17-19; Senior Notes Underwriters\u2019 Motion, p. 21.) If those statements are opinions, then they are actionable only if they \u201cwere both false and not honestly believed at the time they were made.\u201d <em>Fait, </em>655 F.3d at 113.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">While <em>Fait </em>explained the circumstances under which an opinion can be actionable, it did not comprehensively delineate the difference between a statement of opinion and a statement of fact. At issue in <em>Fait </em>was whether statements about the value of a company\u2019s \u201cgoodwill\u201d constituted fact or opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 110. The Second Circuit noted that the value of the company\u2019s goodwill depended on a \u201cdetermination of the \u2018fair value\u2019 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which are not matters of objective fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also observed that the plaintiff did not identify an \u201cobjective standard\u201d that the defendant \u201cshould have but failed to use in determining the value of\u2019 the company\u2019s goodwill. <em>Id. </em>The Second Circuit concluded that \u201cthe statements regarding goodwill at issue here are subjective ones rather than \u2018objective factual matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111 <em>(quoting I. Meyer Pincus &amp; </em>Assocs., <em>P.C. v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., Inc., </em>936 F.2d 759, 762 (2d Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\"><em>Fait </em>also considered whether statements about the company\u2019s reserves to cover for potentially lost loans constituted statements of fact or opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 112-13. The Second Circuit noted that determinations of loan loss reserves, like determinations of goodwill, \u201creflect management\u2019s opinion or judgment about what, if any, portion of amounts due on the loans ultimately might not be collectible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113. And the court noted that plaintiff again failed to identify \u201can objective standard for setting loan loss reserves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court ruled that statements about loan loss reserves are opinions, rather than statements of facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">The Court finds that, under <em>Fait\u2019s </em>reasoning, statements about the realization of DTA are statements of opinion, not of fact. The GAAP standard on which Plaintiffs rely required MF Global\u2019s management to weigh the available evidence and determine whether the DTA was \u201cmore likely than not to be realized.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 91.) Determining whether to take a valuation allowance against DTA is thus subject to \u201ca very subjective standard.\u201d <em>In re Fannie Mae 2008 Sec. Litig., </em>742 F.Supp.2d 382, 409 (S.D.N.Y.2010); <em>see also Kuriakose v. Federal Home Loan Mortg. Corp., </em>897 F.Supp.2d 168, 181 (S.D.N.Y.2012) (noting that the \u201c\u2018more likely than not\u2019 \u201d standard for writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>down DTA is \u201cnebulous\u201d); <em>Limantour v. Cray Inc., </em>432 F.Supp.2d 1129, 1156 (W.D.Wash.2006) (calling determination to take valuation allowance against DTA \u201ca judgment call based on all available positive and negative evidence\u201d). Determining the value of a company\u2019s DTA, like determining the value of goodwill, does not involve \u201cmatters of objective fact.\u201d <em>Fait, </em>655 F.3d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments to the contrary (Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition, p. 12-15) are unpersuasive. While Plaintiff's are correct that the GAAP standard references the presence of \u201cobjectively verified\u201d evidence (CAC \u00b6 97), the reference relates only to one factor that affects the subjective weighing of positive and negative evidence. The final decision of whether to take a valuation allowance against DTA still requires substantially subjective judgments. <em>Cf. Compuware Corp. v. Moody\u2019s Investors Servs., Inc., </em>499 F.3d 520, 529 (6th Cir. 2007) (\u201cA Moody\u2019s credit rating is a predictive opinion, dependent on a subjective and discretionary weighing of complex factors.\u201d). Plaintiffs have not identified an objective standard that should have been applied. <em>See Fait, </em>655 F.3d at 110, 113. Moreover, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, this ease is not one in which the complaint alleges that a company \u201cengaged in improper accounting practices.\u201d <em>In re General Elec. Co., </em>856 F.Supp.2d 645, 658 n. 2 (S.D.N.Y.2012). This case is not about whether MF Global failed to apply the proper accounting practice, but instead is about whether the applicable accounting practice was applied correctly. Since in this case the applicable accounting practice involves \u201cestimates of subjective values,\u201d Fait\u2019s standard applies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">b. <em>Whether the CAC Pleads Subjective and Objective Falsity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Because the Court concludes that MF Global\u2019s statements about its DTA were opinions, it must next determine whether the statements \u201cwere both false and not honestly believed at the time they were made.\u201d <em>Fait, </em>655 F.3d at 113. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">First, the Court finds that Plaintiffs plausibly allege that MF Global\u2019s statements about its DTA were objectively false. Most significantly, MF Global\u2019s United States operations were in a three-year loss position at the start of the Class Period, which served as significant negative evidence against recognizing the DTA. <em>See Hoff v. Popular, Inc., </em>727 F.Supp.2d 77, 90 (D.P.R.2010) (recognizing three-year loss position as \u201cstrong evidence that at the beginning of the class period it was more likely than not that the Company would not be able to realize\u201d DTA); <em>In re Scottish Re Grp. Sec. Litig., </em>524 F.Supp.2d 370, 389-90 (S.D.N.Y.2007) (same). Despite this, MF Global did not acknowledge its loss position as negative evidence until its 2011 Form 10-K. Disclosures made pri- or to the 2011 Form 10-K also failed to explain the positive evidence on which the Company relied to avoid taking a valuation allowance against its DTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">The CAC further alleges weaknesses in the positive evidence that MF Global used to justify its DTA position. According to the CAC, MF Global\u2019s projections of increased income based on the RTM Strategy could not serve as sufficient positive evidence because it was high-risk and unsustainable. <em>See Hoff, </em>727 F.Supp.2d at 90 (\u201cPopular U.S. did not have a strong earnings history, nor would it have been reasonable for Popular to interpret that the historical losses in its U.S. operations were an aberration or anything but a continuing condition.\u201d). The CAC also explains why MF Global\u2019s changes in compensation structure and tax planning strategies could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>not overcome its existing three-year loss position.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Finally, the fact that MF Global took some small valuation allowances against its DTA during the Class Period makes it more plausible that the Company\u2019s failure to take an allowance against the full value of its DTA was materially misleading. <em>See In re Scottish Re, </em>524 F.Supp.2d at 390 (noting that company\u2019s small valuation allowances \u201cmay have further misled investors to believe that the Company was properly reporting and evaluating its deferred tax assets and taking valuation allowances when needed\u201d). Indeed, MacDonald went so far as to aver that the remainder of the DTA was not as at risk, thus amplifying the misleading nature of the valuation allowances. In sum, the allegations in the CAC, taken as a whole, give rise to a reasonable inference that MF Global made material misstatements with respect to its DTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">To be sure, some courts have dismissed securities fraud complaints that were based on a company\u2019s failure to take a timely valuation allowance against its DTA. But in those cases, the facts pled did not support a plausible claim of falsity. <em>See Kuriakose, </em>897 F.Supp.2d at 181 (\u201cPlaintiffs have alleged no specific facts from which the Court can conclude that Freddie Mac anticipated that it would not have any taxable income.\u201d); <em>In re Fannie Mae, </em>742 F.Supp.2d at 409 (company was not in three-year loss position prior to recording DTA); <em>In re Wet Seal, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>518 F.Supp.2d 1148, 1162 (C.D.Cal. 2007) (\u201cPlaintiffs do not allege any facts showing that the conclusion [that a valuation allowance should not be taken] ... was improperly made....\u201d); <em>Limantour, </em>432 F.Supp.2d at 1157 (company reported profit in year prior to recording DTA). Here, by contrast, the CAC sufficiently alleges objective falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The Court also finds that the CAC plausibly alleges that the Officer Defendants did not honestly believe their stated opinions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> According to the CAC, the Officers (1) were aware of the relevant GAAP accounting standard and (2) knew that the positive evidence on which they relied would not be sufficient for MF Global to realize its DTA. <em>See Hoff, </em>727 F.Supp.2d at 93 (finding such knowledge sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter); <em>In re Scottish Re, </em>524 F.Supp.2d at 393-94 (same).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> From there, Plaintiffs are entitled to a reasonable inference that the Officers subjectively believed that MF Global should take a valuation allowance against its DTA, despite their public statements to the contrary. <em>See Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank v. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc., </em>651 F.Supp.2d 155, 178-79 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (finding knowledge of contrary information sufficient to plead subjective falsity of opinion); <em>cf. In re Deutsche Bank AG, </em>2012 WL 3297730, at *2 (rejecting claim of subjective falsity where plaintiffs \u201cspecifically aver[red] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>none of their claims [were] based on knowing misconduct\u201d). The allegations thus go beyond claiming merely that the opinion was \u201cunreasonable\u201d or that it was \u201cpossible to reach a different opinion ... based on the information available to [the Officers] at the time.\u201d <em>Podany, </em>318 F.Supp.2d at 154. Rather, it can be \u201cplausibly inferred\u201d from the facts alleged that the Officers \u201cknew they were disseminating false and misleading\u201d opinions about MF Global\u2019s DTA. <em>Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, </em>651 F.Supp.2d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Of course, a person\u2019s mere knowledge of facts that cut against his opinion does not conclusively prove subjective falsity. But at this stage of the proceedings, Plaintiffs need only allege facts giving rise to a reasonable inference of liability. The Court finds that Plaintiffs plausibly allege subjective falsity; a fact finder can later determine whether the evidence sufficiently proves subjective falsity. <em>See Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank v. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc., </em>888 F.Supp.2d 431, 456-57 (S.D.N.Y.2012) (denying summary judgment because \u201cplaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer\u201d objective and subjective falsity).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">c. <em>Bespeaks Caution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The Securities Act Defendants claim that the bespeaks-caution doctrine precludes liability for statements made about MF Global\u2019s DTA. (Underwriters\u2019 Motion, p. 22-24; Senior Notes Underwriters\u2019 Motion, p. 23-24; Securities Act Defendants\u2019 Reply, p. 15-16.) They point to various disclosures the Company made in which it warned investors that it might not return to profitability, that its cost-saving strategies might not be successful, and that it consequently might not realize its DTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The Court is not persuaded that these disclosures preclude the alleged misstatements from being material as a matter of law. Rather, the language highlighted by the Securities Act Defendants is \u201cmerely a boilerplate litany of generally applicable risk factors.\u201d <em>Slayton, </em>604 F.3d at 772 <em>(quoting Southland Sec. Corp. v. INSpire Ins. Solutions, Inc., </em>365 F.3d 353, 372 (5th Cir.2004)). The disclosures refer <em>generally </em>to potential unexpected events or contingencies that <em>might </em>have prevented MF Global from realizing the full value of its DTA. But the CAC alleges <em>specific </em>information, known to the Officers, which Plaintiffs assert made the Officers\u2019 opinion that MF Global did not need to take a valuation allowance against its DTA subjectively false. The general statements of risk that accompanied MF Global\u2019s public disclosure were not sufficient to make those allegedly false opinions immaterial as a matter of law. <em>See City of Pontiac Gen. Emps. </em>\u2019 <em>Ret. Sys. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>875 F.Supp.2d 359, 365 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (finding cautionary language insufficient where it did not \u201cspeak[] to the substantive information that plaintiff alleges the defendants misrepresented\u201d); <em>In re American Int\u2019l Grp., Inc. 2008 Sec. Litig., </em>741 F.Supp.2d 511, 532 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (finding cautionary language insufficient \u201cin light of the undisclosed hard facts critical to appreciating the magnitude of the risks described\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The disclosures did not specifically reveal the particular risks allegedly known to MF Global and the Officers. <em>See Slay-ton, </em>604 F.3d at 772 (noting that cautionary language is insufficient where it did not \u201cconvey[ ] substantive information\u201d about the risk at issue). MF Global\u2019s cautionary language thus fell short of the more specific qualifications that courts have found sufficient under the bespeaks-caution doctrine. <em>See, e.g., P. Stolz Family P\u2019ship, </em>355 F.3d at 98 (granting motion to dismiss where offering documents \u201ccau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>tion[ed] prospective investors that future financing was tenuous\u201d and that they could suffer complete loss of investment); <em>Olkey, </em>98 F.3d at 5-6 (granting motion to dismiss where prospectuses specifically warned that changes in interest rates could affect return on investment); <em>Coronel v.

Jan. 26, 2009) (granting motion to dismiss where registration statement and prospectus warned that they gave \u201c \u2018preliminary\u2019 estimates that were \u2018inherently difficult to predict\u2019 \u201d and \u201cwere subject to a \u2018high level of uncertainty,\u2019 \u201d which consequently could affect company\u2019s financial condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">2. <em>RTM Strategy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Plaintiffs allege material misstatements and omissions with respect to MF Global\u2019s \u201crisk appetite, internal controls and liquidity management\u201d because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9n\">(1) the Officer Defendants\u2019 strategic plan to increase principal risk-taking also materially increased liquidity risks without the necessary corresponding increase in capital, liquidity risk management or internal controls; (2) the primary purpose of the Company\u2019s increased principal trading activity was not to facilitate customer transactions but to engage in non-client-related speculative transactions; (3) Defendants\u2019 representations about available capital and liquidity were unreliable given that: (a) the Company\u2019s liquidity monitoring systems were outdated, (b) the Company had no real-time liquidity monitoring system, and (c) the Company tracked liquidity using informal, manual means compiled from spreadsheets and oral reports; (4) even though the Company\u2019s transformation plan did not involve increasing VAR, the plan involved materially increasing off-balance sheet liquidity risks and leverage levels in connection with investments in Euro sovereign debt through RTM transactions; and (5) MF Global exposed client funds to significant risk by relying on regular inter-company transfers from MF Global\u2019s FCM operations to meet the daily liquidity needs of non-FCM operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">(CAC \u00b6\u00b6 336, 354, 370, 386, 416, 443, 459.) Again, Defendants make various arguments to claim that the statements about the RTM Strategy were not materially false or misleading. The Court addresses these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">a. <em>False or Misleading Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Defendants suggest that the alleged misstatements were in fact not misstatements at all. Rather, according to Defendants, MF Global fully disclosed the nature of and risks associated with the RTM Strategy, including the capital, liquidity, and risk management weaknesses that are the focus of the CAC. Plaintiffs respond by highlighting particular disclosures and omissions that they claim to have materially misled investors. The Court finds that CAC sufficiently pleads materially false or misleading statements to plausibly allege that Defendants have committed Securities Act and Exchange Act violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">First, the CAC pleads actionable misstatements with respect to MF Global\u2019s assurances that the Company operated within specified risk limits. Plaintiffs allege that, contrary to those assurances, Corzine and MF Global repeatedly breached the limits set on investments in European sovereign debt. Under those circumstances, Plaintiffs have alleged material misstatements. <em>See In re Lehman Bros. Sec. &amp; Erisa Litig., </em>799 F.Supp.2d 258, 284-85 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (finding similar statement actionable in light of allegations that company \u201croutinely exceeded various risk limits it had created\u201d). Contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Defendants\u2019 claims, that the Board later increased the trading limits does not refute a reasonable inference that the original statement materially misled investors. <em>See id. </em>at 285 (noting that later increase in previously breached limits \u201cis at best in considerable tension with\u201d claim that company adhered to limits).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Second, Plaintiffs plead actionable misstatements about MF Global\u2019s risk controls. MF Global\u2019s public filings and statements described the Company\u2019s internal controls as, among other things, \u201crobust\u201d (CAC \u00b6 331), \u201ceffective\u201d <em>(id.), </em>\u201cadequate\u201d (CAC \u00b6 362), and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and \u201cdesigned to monitor, evaluate, and manage the risks [MF Global] assume[d]\u201d (CAC \u00b6402). The CAC pleads contrary information from MF Global\u2019s IAD that undermines the accuracy of those disclosures. For example, the IAD\u2019s reports to the Board reveal numerous weaknesses that undermine the accuracy of MF Global\u2019s public disclosures. <em>See Cornwell v. Credit Suisse Grp., </em>689 F.Supp.2d 629, 638 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (noting that disclosures stating that internal controls and risk management mitigated risk are actionable where defendants have information to the contrary). Plaintiffs have thus plausibly alleged material misstatements. <em>See In re Lehman Bros., </em>799 F.Supp.2d at 285 (finding actionable statements of company\u2019s confidence in risk controls); <em>In re Bear Steams Cos., Inc. Sec., Derivative, &amp; ERISA Litig., </em>763 F.Supp.2d 423, 494 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (same); <em>In re American Int\u2019l Grp., </em>741 F.Supp.2d at 530 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Third, Plaintiffs plead actionable misstatements with respect to the risks posed by the RTM Strategy. MF Global\u2019s public statements consistently denied that the RTM Strategy posed a substantial risk to the Company. Among other disclosures, the Officers referred to the risk as \u201cminimal\u201d (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 399, 424) and \u201climited\u201d (CAC \u00b6 447), and Corzine told investors that the RTM Strategy \u201cactually makes [MF Global] less risky\u201d (CAC \u00b6422). The CAC simultaneously alleges that the RTM Strategy exposed MF Global to substantial risk and ultimately contributed to the Company\u2019s collapse. Plaintiffs have thus alleged facts giving rise to a reasonable inference that the statements made about the RTM Strategy\u2019s risks were material misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">While Defendants argue that the CAC merely pleads inactionable fraud by hindsight, <em>see Slayton, </em>604 F.3d at 776, the contemporaneous response to MF Global\u2019s disclosure of its risk exposure \u2014 prior to the Company\u2019s collapse \u2014 undermines this claim. As described above, when MF Global disclosed its exposure to European sovereign debt, FINRA and the SEC took action to force MF Global to increase its capital reserves. Moody\u2019s also reacted negatively to MF Global\u2019s revelation that the RTM transactions were proprietary, rather than client-driven.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> These reactions buttress a reasonable inference that MF Global\u2019s statements would have materially misled a reasonable investor. <em>See Litunn, </em>634 F.3d at 716-17. In addition, the CAC\u2019s allegations survive a fraud-by-hindsight objection because Plaintiffs \u201chave sufficiently pled that Defendants had present knowledge of the risk\u201d that was not disclosed. <em>Freudenberg v. E*Trade Fin. Corp., </em>712 F.Supp.2d 171, 192 (S.D.N.Y.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Finally, the CAC pleads actionable misstatements about MF Global\u2019s capital and liquidity management. While MF Global and the Officers repeatedly represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>that the Company had a \u201cstrong\u201d liquidity position <em>(see, e.g., </em>CAC \u00b6 334, 346, 348, 378, 445, 447), Plaintiffs allege that MF Global faced substantial strain on its capital and liquidity and met its requirements only through daily intra-company transfers, and collapsed when RTM counterparties demanded additional margin. These facts plausibly allege material misstatements under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Defendants argue that the claimed misstatements were mere puffery and emphasize that MF Global was \u201cnot required to take a gloomy, fearful or defeatist view of the future.\u201d <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 174. The Court is persuaded, for the reasons described above, that the CAC pleads \u201cmisrepresentations of existing fact\u201d that are not puffery. <em>Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 315; <em>see Freudenberg, </em>712 F.Supp.2d at 190 (rejecting puffery defense where \u201c[defendants denied that E'\"TRADE\u2019S real estate loan portfolio had become more risky\u2014 even though it is alleged that the risks had increased\u201d). Put another way Plaintiffs\u2019 pleading survives an objection that the alleged misstatements were \u201cso vague, broad, and non-specific that a reasonable investor would not rely on [them].\u201d <em>In re General Elec. Co., </em>857 F.Supp.2d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">b. <em>Bespeaks Caution </em>/ <em>PSLRA Safe Harbor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Defendants suggest that the Company\u2019s alleged misstatements concerning the RTM Strategy are protected by the bespeaks-caution doctrine and the PSLRA safe harbor for forward-looking statements. They point to disclosures that the Company might increase trading risk, or might not hold sufficient capital or liquidity to meet market demands, as statements that contain \u201csufficient cautionary language\u201d to defeat any claim of materiality. <em>Iowa Pub. Emps. </em>\u2019 <em>Ret. Sys., </em>620 F.3d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The Court rejects this argument for reasons similar to those stated in the above analysis of the DTA statements: the CAC alleges specific information, known to the Officers, which made their disclosures about the risks of the RTM Strategy subjectively false. The Company\u2019s public filings and statements were thus insufficient \u201cin light of the undisclosed hard facts critical to appreciating the magnitude of the risks described.\u201d <em>In re American Int\u2019l Grp., Inc., </em>741 F.Supp.2d at 532 (internal quotation marks omitted). By superficially warning of possible risks while failing to disclose critical facts, MF Global was akin \u201cto someone who warns his hiking companion to walk slowly because there might be a ditch ahead when he knows with near certainty that the Grand Canyon lies one foot away.\u201d <em>In re Prudential See. Inc. Ltd. P\u2019ships Litig., </em>930 F.Supp. 68, 72 (S.D.N.Y.1996). The disclosures thus do not fall under the bespeaks-caution doctrine, <em>see id., </em>or the PSLRA safe harbor, <em>see Slayton, </em>604 F.3d at 770 (\u201c[C]autionary language that is misleading in light of historical fact cannot be meaningful.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">In sum, the Court finds that the CAC sufficiently pleads facts that plausibly allege material misstatements to survive dismissal at this stage.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>C. <em>EXCHANGE ACT DEFENSES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The Officer Defendants raise several arguments specific to the Exchange Act claims brought against them. The Court addresses these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">1. <em>Strong Inference of Scienter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">To state a claim under the Exchange Act, Plaintiffs must plead facts that \u201cgive rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent.\u201d <em>Kalnit, </em>264 F.3d at 138 <em>(quoting Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 307). While Plaintiffs do not plead facts to show that the Officers had special motives to act fraudulently, that is not fatal to their claim. <em>See Tel-labs, </em>551 U.S. at 325, 127 S.Ct. 2499 (noting that \u201cthe absence of a motive allegation is not fatal\u201d to a claim of fraudulent intent). Plaintiffs instead claim (Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition, p. 47-58) that the CAC demonstrates \u201cfacts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d <em>Kalnit, </em>264 F.3d at 138. However, absent motive, \u201cthe strength of the circumstantial allegations [demonstrating conscious misbehavior or recklessness] must be correspondingly greater.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142 (citation and internal quotation mark omitted). The Officer Defendants counter that the CAC does not sufficiently plead scienter. (Corzine\u2019s Motion, p. 16-24; MacDonald\u2019s Motion, p. 9-16; Steenkamp\u2019s Motion, p. 13-19; Officers\u2019 Reply, p. 12-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter as to each of the Officer Defendants.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> First, with respect to statements made about MF Global\u2019s DTA, Plaintiffs plead either knowledge of or failure by each of the Officer Defendants to conduct a sufficient investigation into facts that would contradict the Officers\u2019 public statements. <em>See Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 308. Each of the Officers demonstrated awareness of the GAAP standards for recognizing DTAs either through public statements or by signing MF Global\u2019s public filings that claimed compliance with the standards. <em>See In re Scottish Re, </em>524 F.Supp.2d at 393 (finding sufficient proof of knowledge of GAAP\u2019s DTA standards where defendants \u201capplied and quoted the standard in the Company\u2019s financial statements both before and throughout the Class Period\u201d). Those signatures created for the Officers \u201ca \u2018duty to familiarize themselves with the facts relevant to the core operations of [MF Global].\u2019 \u201d <em>See Alstom III, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 459 <em>(quoting Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Bombardier Inc., </em>05 Civ. 1898, 2005 WL 2148919, at *63 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 6, 2005)). The CAC also pleads facts sufficient to demonstrate strong circumstantial evidence that, in light of the weaknesses in the positive evidence on which MF Global relied to avoid taking a valuation allowance against its DTA, the failure to take that valuation allowance was reckless. <em>See Hoff, </em>727 F.Supp.2d at 93 (finding sufficient evidence of scienter for failure to take valuation allowance against DTA \u201cto the extent that the danger was either known to the defendants or so obvious that they must have been aware of it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Second, Plaintiffs sufficiently plead a strong inference of scienter with respect to statements made about MF Global\u2019s internal controls and capital and liquidity risks. The CAC sufficiently pleads facts that each of the Officers knew or should have known about the weaknesses in MF Global\u2019s internal controls and capital and liquidity management. For example, the IAD issued several reports during the Class Period that criticized MF Global\u2019s existing policies and noted failures to follow those policies. Yet even in light of this information, the Officers made statements to the contrary and assured investors that MF Global\u2019s internal controls and capital and liquidity management were strong and adequate. \u201cWhile a trier of fact might not ultimately agree,\u201d the Court finds that at this stage the CAC sufficiently pleads facts to give rise to a strong inference of scienter. <em>In re Lehman Bros., </em>799 F.Supp.2d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Corzine and MacDonald suggest that their purchases of MF Global stock during the Class Period negate an inference of scienter. (Corzine\u2019s Motion, p. 23-24; MacDonald\u2019s Motion, p. 15.) To be sure, under some circumstances such purchases might suggest a lack of fraudulent intent. <em>See In re MRU Holdings Sec. Litig., </em>769 F.Supp.2d 500, 516 (S.D.N.Y.2011). But this possibility alone cannot counteract the circumstantial evidence of fraudulent intent described above; such a rule would create incentive for corporate officers to insulate themselves from liability by purchasing stock merely to negate an inference of fraud. <em>See Holmes v. Baker, </em>166 F.Supp.2d 1362, 1378 (S.D.Fla.2001) (rejecting defendants\u2019 claim that insider purchases negated inference of fraudulent intent). Conceivably, as evidenced here, a relatively modest purchase in proportion to the loss amounts attributed to the alleged fraudulent conduct might be enough for officer defendants to claim the protection of such a rule \u2014 even when they possess inside information about the true condition of the company and can control the timing of release of unfavorable information. Thus, even when courts note that insider trades suggest a lack of motive to commit fraud, they then proceed to consider whether the facts pled give rise to an inference of conscious misbehavior or recklessness. <em>See, e.g., Avon Pension Fund v. GlaxoSmithKline PLC, </em>343 Fed.Appx. 671, 673-74 (2d Cir.2009); <em>In re MRU Holdings, </em>769 F.Supp.2d at 515-17; <em>In re Bristol-Myers Squibb Sec. Litig., </em>312 F.Supp.2d 549, 561-63 (S.D.N.Y.2004). Here, for the reasons described above, the CAC meets that threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The Officers also propose various other inferences about their intent, such as a genuine belief that MF Global would succeed and that the Company\u2019s collapse resulted merely from a flawed business plan. (Corzine\u2019s Motion, p. 23-24; MacDonald\u2019s Motion, p. 15; Steenkamp\u2019s Motion, p. 20-21.) They argue that these inferences are \u201cplausible, nonculpable explanations\u201d that negate an inference of fraudulent intent. <em>Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 324, 127 S.Ct. 2499. But at this stage, Plaintiffs need not show that the inference of fraudulent intent is \u201cirrefutable ... or even the most plausible of competing inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, Plaintiffs must only show that the inference of scienter is <em>\u201cat least as likely as </em>any plausible opposing inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 127 S.Ct. 2499 (emphasis in original); <em>see also City of Pontiac Gen. Emps. </em>\u2019 <em>Ret. Sys., </em>875 F.Supp.2d at 372 (\u201c[A]t the motion to dismiss stage, a tie on scienter goes to the plaintiff.\u201d). Given the facts described above which give rise to an inference of scienter, Plaintiffs have met this burden. After discovery, a fact finder will determine whether Plaintiffs can \u201cdemonstrate that it is <em>more likely </em>than not that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the defendant acted with scienter.\u201d <em>Tel-labs, </em>551 U.S. at 328, 127 S.Ct. 2499 (emphasis in original). In this regard, the Court notes that \u201c[bjecause discovery will be going forward in any case\u201d on the Securities Act claims, dismissal at this stage is unwise because \u201ca fact finder will be in a far better position to determine if [the Officers] acted with fraudulent intent following the close of discovery than the Court would be solely on the basis of the pleadings.\u201d <em>Citiline Holdings, </em>701 F.Supp.2d at 516 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">2. <em>Control Persons Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that the CAC sufficiently pleads a primary violation of Section 10(b) and the scienter required to establish culpable participation under Section 20(a). <em>See Alstom III, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 491. The Court also finds that the CAC adequately alleges each Officers\u2019 involvement in MF Global\u2019s operations to demonstrate control in the alleged violations, particularly in light of the generous standard that applies at the pleading stage. <em>See Katz, </em>542 F.Supp.2d at 276. Thus, the Court finds that the CAC adequately states a claim as to Count Two of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">D. <em>SECURITIES ACT DEFENSES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Defendants raise various other arguments in support of their motions to dismiss the Securities Act claims. The Court addresses those arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">1. <em>Liability for Forms 10-Q</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Section 11 holds a party liable for statements or omissions made in \u201cany part of the registration statement, <em>when such part became effective. </em>\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a) (emphasis added). A registration statement includes \u201cany ... document ... incorporated therein by reference.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(a)(8). The Individual Defendants allege that they are not liable under the Securities Act for statements made in MF Global\u2019s Forms 10-Q because those forms never became \u201ceffective\u201d as to them. (Independent Directors\u2019 Motion, p. 11-13.) Plaintiffs counter that the Forms 10-Q became effective as to the Individual Defendants when they were incorporated by reference into the prospectuses that accompanied the offerings of the Secondary Offering, the 2016 Notes, the 2018 Notes, and the Senior Notes. (Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition, p. 66-68.) The Individual Defendants respond that \u201cprospectus supplements do not themselves become effective as to individuals,\u201d and thus the prospectuses (and the Forms 10-Q incorporated by reference in the prospectuses) did not become effective as to the Individual Defendants. (Independent Directors\u2019 Reply Motion, p. 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Under SEC Rule 430B, a prospectus supplement \u201cis deemed to be part of the registration statement\u201d and, \u201cfor purposes of liability under [S]ection 11 of the [Securities] Act <em>of the issuer and any underwriter at the time only,\u201d </em>establishes \u201ca new effective date of the part of such registration statement relating to the securities to which such form of prospectus relates.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.430B(f)(2) (emphasis added). The prospectus creates a new effective date for a director or individual signer only under certain limited exceptions. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 230.430B(f)(4). At least one court has read this language to prohibit imposing Section 11 liability on individual defendants for statements made in a prospectus. <em>See In re Countrywide Fin. Corp. Mortg.-Backed Sec. Litig., </em>932 F.Supp.2d 1095 (C.D.Cal.2013). On the other hand, courts in this District have held individual defendants liable for statements incorporated by reference into a prospectus, <em>see In re Lehman Bros., </em>799 F.Supp.2d at 316 <em>&amp; </em>n. 399, including those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>made in Forms 10-Q, <em>see In re Citigroup, Inc. Bond Litig., </em>723 F.Supp.2d 568, 580, 594 (S.D.N.Y.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The Court need not decide at this juncture whether the Individual Defendants are hable for statements in the Forms 10-Q. No party disputes that the Individual Defendants are liable for statements in the Forms 10-K, and no party disputes that the Underwriters and Senior Notes Underwriters are liable for statements in the Forms 10-Q. In light of the Court\u2019s rulings, discovery on all counts against all Defendants and with respect to all filings will go forward. The Court will have the opportunity to further define the contours of the claims after discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">2. <em>Reliance on Audited Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Section 11 provides underwriters with an affirmative defense where they \u201chad no reasonable ground to believe and did not believe\u201d that the statements in a public filing misstated or omitted material facts. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(b)(3)(C); <em>see also In re Global Crossing, Ltd. Sec. Litig., </em>313 F.Supp.2d 189, 211 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (noting statutory command that \u201cthe burden of proof is on defendants to establish this defense\u201d). The Underwriters and the Senior Notes Underwriters claim that the CAC insufficiently alleges that they were unreasonable in their reliance on audited financial statements. (Underwriters\u2019 Motion, p. 24-25; Senior Notes Underwriters\u2019 Motion, p. 20 n. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Underwriters\u2019 reliance on audited financial statements is reasonable \u201cabsent red flags that the underwriters were in a position to see.\u201d <em>In re Countrywide Fin. Corp., </em>588 F.Supp.2d at 1175. In other words, an underwriter can take advantage of this defense only if its reliance on the audited financial statements was \u201creasonable under the circumstances.\u201d <em>In re Software Toolworks, Inc., </em>50 F.3d 615, 624 (9th Cir.1994). Where \u201cred flags\u201d make such reliance unreasonable, the underwriter must show that its investigation of those red flags was reasonable. <em>Id.; In re WorldCom, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>346 F.Supp.2d 628, 679 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (\u201c[T]he existence of red flags can create a duty to investigate even audited financial statements.\u201d). \u201c[T]he standard for determining what constitutes a reasonable investigation and reasonable ground for belief is the same: \u2018[T]he standard of reasonableness shall be that required of a prudent man in the management of his own property.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re WorldCom, Inc., </em>346 F.Supp.2d at 663 (second alteration in original) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Because the affirmative defense turns on an evaluation of reasonableness, whether the defense is available \u201cis generally a fact issue, rarely suitable for summary judgment, let alone a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>In re Countrywide Fin. Corp., </em>588 F.Supp.2d at 1175; <em>see also In re World-Com, Inc., </em>346 F.Supp.2d at 673 (\u201cIt is equally important to note that what constitutes a red flag depends on the facts and context of a particular case.\u201d); <em>In re Enron Corp. Sec., Derivative &amp; ERISA Litig., </em>258 F.Supp.2d 576, 597 (S.D.Tex.2003) (\u201c[R]easonableness in this context is not a question properly resolved on a motion to dismiss.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Unless the defense \u201cappears on the face of the [complaint],\u201d <em>In re Countrywide Fin. Corp., </em>588 F.Supp.2d at 1182, a court should not dismiss the complaint merely for failure to \u201cnegate such an affirmative defense in their pleading,\u201d <em>In re Global Crossing, </em>313 F.Supp.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Here, the affirmative defense does not appear on the face of the CAC. Indeed, though Plaintiffs need not allege red flags in their complaint, the CAC alleges that a reasonable investigation into the audited financial statements would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>revealed red flags and that a reasonable investigation into those red flags would have revealed MF Global\u2019s material misstatements and omissions. Plaintiffs also explain what a reasonable investigation would have revealed \u2014 specifically, that MF Global did not have sufficient evidence to avoid taking a valuation allowance against its DTA and that MF Global did not have sufficient internal controls to protect itself against a liquidity crisis. The CAC would be sufficient even without pleading red flags. <em>See In re OSG Sec. Litig., </em>971 F.Supp.2d 387, 401, 2013 WL 4885890, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2013) (\u201cPlaintiffs are not required to additionally plead red flags or facts negating the Underwriters\u2019 [reasonable reliance] defense.\u201d). Given that Plaintiffs have pled red flags, the CAC should not be dismissed based on a reasonable reliance defense. Whether the Underwriters and Senior Notes Underwriters did, in fact, reasonably rely on audited financial statements is a question of fact to be resolved after discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">3. <em>Evidence of Purchase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Several of the Underwriters and Senior Notes Underwriters seek dismissal of the Section 12(a)(2) claims (Counts Four, Seven, Ten, and Thirteen) because the CAC does not specifically allege that any named plaintiff purchased securities from those underwriters. (Underwriters\u2019 Motion, p. 3 n. 2; Senior Notes Underwriters\u2019 Motion, p. 25; Underwriters\u2019 &amp; Senior Notes Underwriters\u2019 Reply, p. 3-4.) \u201cA plaintiff has standing to bring a Section 12 claim only against a \u2018statutory seller\u2019 from which it \u2018purchased\u2019 a security.\u201d <em>In re Lehman Bros., </em>799 F.Supp.2d at 310. To have standing against an underwriter, a plaintiff must allege that he \u201cpurchased securities \u2018pursuant to\u2019 the pertinent offering documents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311; <em>see also In re Alcatel Sec. Litig., </em>382 F.Supp.2d 513, 530 n. 8 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (restricting standing under Section 12(a)(2) to plaintiffs who purchased shares \u201cpursuant to (i.e., in)\u201d relevant public offering). The mere ability to trace back securities to the offering, without allegations of direct purchase, are insufficient. <em>In re Lehman Bros., </em>799 F.Supp.2d at 311; <em>see also Local 295/Local 851IBT Emp\u2019r Grp. Pension Trust &amp; Welfare Fund v. Fifth Third Ban-corp., </em>731 F.Supp.2d 689, 712-13 (S.D.Ohio 2010) (dismissing Section 12(a)(2) claims against underwriters from whom plaintiffs did not allege that they purchased securities).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">In Count Four, the CAC alleges that a named plaintiff \u201cpurchased or otherwise acquired stock <em>from\u201d </em>the relevant underwriters <em>\u201cpursuant to </em>the Secondary Offering Materials.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 576 (emphasis added).) In Count Seven, the CAC alleges that a named plaintiff \u201cpurchased or otherwise acquired MF Global\u2019s 2016 Notes <em>in </em>the 2016 Notes Offering.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 609 (emphasis added).) In Count Ten, the CAC alleges that named plaintiffs \u201cpurchased or otherwise acquired MF Global\u2019s 2018 Notes <em>in </em>the 2018 Notes Offering.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 643 (emphasis added).) And in Count Thirteen, the CAC alleges that a named plaintiff received title to the 6.25% Senior Notes from the relevant underwriters <em>\u201cin </em>the 6.25% Senior Notes Offering.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 678 (emphasis added).) These allegations are sufficient to establish standing against the Underwriters and the Senior Notes Underwriters for the purpose of withstanding a motion to dismiss. <em>See In re Scottish Re, </em>524 F.Supp.2d at 400 (\u201c[T]he Complaint adequately alleges that defendants, including the Underwriter Defendants, sold the securities as part of the Offerings, and plaintiffs acquired securities in the Offerings. A reasonable inference is that plaintiffs acquired their securities from the Underwriter Defendants.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The CAC does allege, more particularly, that Plaintiffs purchased certain securities directly from certain underwriters. But such particularity is not <em>required </em>at the pleading stage. <em>See In re Wachovia Equity Sec. Litig., </em>753 F.Supp.2d 326, 374 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (declining to dismiss Section 12(a)(2) claims even though complaint failed \u201cto identify which Underwriter Defendants sold particular securities to the named Plaintiffs\u201d). It is enough, at this stage, for Plaintiffs to allege that they purchased securities \u201cin\u201d or \u201cpursuant to\u201d the relevant offerings. <em>See In re Lehman Bros., </em>799 F.Supp.2d at 310-11; <em>In re Alcatel, </em>382 F.Supp.2d at 530 n. 8. Should it become apparent after a full factual record is established during discovery that Plaintiffs cannot prove direct purchases from certain individual underwriters, those underwriters will have the opportunity to seek judgment as a matter of law in a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Emergent Capital Inv. Mgmt, LLC v. Stone-path Grp., Inc., </em>165 F.Supp.2d 615, 622 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (granting summary judgment on Section 12(a)(2) claim where undisputed facts showed that securities were not purchased through public offering).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">4. <em>Control Persons Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that the CAC sufficiently pleads primary violations of Section 11. Even assuming that Plaintiffs must plead the Officers\u2019 culpable participation, <em>but see In re Bear Steams, </em>851 F.Supp.2d at 773 (noting that most courts in this District do not require an allegation of culpable participation in respect of Section 15(a) claims), the CAC sufficiently alleges culpable participation for the same reasons that it sufficiently alleges scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The CAC also sufficiently alleges control under Section 15(a) for the same reasons that Plaintiffs adequately pled control under Section 20(a). <em>See Alstom III, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 487 n. 49 (noting that control under Section 20(a) and Section 15(a) are \u201cinterpreted in the same manner\u201d). While MacDonald objects to certain counts on the grounds that he did not exercise control after he left the position of CFO, the fact-sensitive issue of control is better addressed after discovery has been completed. <em>See Katz, </em>542 F.Supp.2d at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">V. <em>ORDER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">For the reasons discussed above, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">ORDERED that the motion (Dkt.
