THE FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On December 6, 2016, a special election was held in order to determine whether the mayor of the city of East Cleveland (\"City\") and the president of Council should be recalled. The mayor and the president of Council were recalled as certified by the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections. As a result of the certification of the recall election, the mayor and the president of the Council were removed from office. The vice president of the Council, Brandon King, was sworn in as mayor of the City on December 20, 2016, pursuant to \u00a7 114 of the East Cleveland City Charter (\"Charter\"). Two empty councilperson positions were created as a result of the recall and the elevation of King as the mayor of the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 29, 2016, Nathaniel Martin, Barbara Thomas, and Joie Graham, the remaining members of the Council, convened a special closed-door executive session council meeting in order to interview potential candidates for the two\n   empty councilperson positions. At the conclusion of the closed-door executive session, the Council meeting was continued as a public hearing, without the presence of Graham. Martin and Thomas then \"appointed\" Branch and Erby to fill the vacant councilperson seats. The newly formed Council then voted to remove Guy as Council clerk and appointed Udrija-Peters as the Council clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} A dispute arose between Council members, the mayor, and the law director over the validity of Council's actions in filling the vacant councilperson vacancies and the termination of the Council clerk. On January 23, 2017, King appointed Smith and Pitts to the councilperson seats as previously filled by Branch and Erby. With the support of King, Hemmons, and other city employees, Smith and Pitts took the councilperson seats and excluded Branch and Erby. In addition, Udrija-Peters was removed as Council clerk and Guy was reinstated as the Council clerk through the actions of King, Hemmons, and other city employees. On January 25, 2017, the relators filed their complaint for a writ of quo warranto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Appointments of Smith and Pitts to Council\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Section 100 of the Charter provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   When the office of a member of Council shall become vacant, the vacancy shall be filled by election for the unexpired term by a majority vote of all the remaining members of the Council. If the Council fails within 30 days to fill such a vacancy, the President of Council shall fill it by appointment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The language of Section 100 mirrors the language of R.C. 731.43, which deals with filling vacancies in the legislative body of a village, except that R.C. 731.43 provides that the power to fill a legislative vacancy falls to the mayor if Council does not act within 30 days of the creation of the vacancy. R.C. 733.31(C) provides that any vacancy in the legislative body of a city is to be filled as set forth in R.C. 731.43. We find that a conflict exists between the Charter and R.C. 731.43, because under the Charter only Council or the Council president may fill a vacancy in\n   Council. Contrary to Section 100 of the Charter, a mayor may fill a vacancy in Council pursuant to R.C. 731.43 and 733.31(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The Supreme Court of Ohio has determined that when a conflict exists between a city charter and statutory provisions governing the filling of a legislative vacancy, the charter takes precedence and must be followed to fill any legislative vacancy.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. The portion of Section 731.43, Revised Code, authorizing the mayor of a municipal corporation to fill by appointment a vacancy in the office of a member of the legislative authority of such municipal corporation, conflicts with Section 5 of the Columbus City Charter providing that \"vacancies in council shall be filled by the council for the remainder of the unexpired term.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2.

Simply stated, the charter provision controls over the state statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The language of Section 100 of the Charter provides that the sole authority to fill a councilperson vacancy resides with Council.

For the logic of the respondents argument to succeed, Section 100 of the East Cleveland Charter and R.C. 731.43 must not be in conflict. Because Section 100 of the Charter and R.C. 731.43 conflict, the mayor possesses no authority to fill any vacancy in Council. Compare\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Brown v.

In addition, we find that \u00a7 113(A) of the Charter does not provide the mayor with the power to fill a vacancy in Council, which provides that \"[t]he Mayor shall supervise the administration of all the affairs of the City * * *\n   <em>\n    except the Council and as otherwise provided by this Charter\n   </em>\n   , * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 15} That is not to say that in the absence of a Council president, no appointment could be made. Council could still act to fill the vacancy or Council could act to select a president. Rule 23(C) in the East Cleveland Codified Ordinances provides for the filling of vacancies in the office of president or vice president of Council. It states, \"[w]hen a vacancy occurs in the office of President or Vice President, it shall be filled, by motion, by the vote of three-fifths of the members of Council.\" A vote of two of the remaining three members of Council would be sufficient given that two-thirds is greater than three-fifths.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Therefore, Branch and Erby have demonstrated that Smith and Pitts were unauthorized to hold the office of councilperson by the mayor's appointment.
