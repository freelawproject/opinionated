Janes, appeals the April 18, 2017 judgment entry of the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County, Ohio, denying his motion to suppress. Plaintiff-Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On December 20, 2016, police officers were dispatched to appellant's apartment on a reported domestic disturbance, possibly involving a gun. When the police officers arrived, they heard screams coming from the apartment. They knocked on the door and did not receive a response. They then forced entry and encountered appellant and a woman. The two were detained while the police officers performed a protective sweep of the apartment. When police checked an open closet, they discovered a gun on the top shelf partially covered by a sheet. The gun had been stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 6, 2017, the Richland County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one count of receiving stolen property (the gun) in violation of R.C. 2913.51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 14, 2017, appellant filed a motion to suppress, challenging the search of his apartment and the seizure of the gun without a warrant. A hearing was held on April 17, 2017. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court denied the motion. The decision was memorialized by judgment entry filed April 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} A jury trial commenced on April 17, 2017. The jury found appellant guilty as charged. By sentencing entry filed April 20, 2017, the trial court sentenced appellant to sixteen months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignment of error is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In his sole assignment of error, appellant claims the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} As recently stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio in\n   <em>\n    State v.

He stated as part of his duties, he needed to \"make sure the people are safe and make sure we can locate and look for the gun.\" T. at 11. When he and his partner arrived, they heard screams coming from the apartment. T. at 11-12, 23. It sounded like someone was in distress. T. at 27. They knocked on the door, but did not receive a response. T. at 12. They then forced entry and encountered appellant and a woman. T. at 12-13, 23. Appellant did not have a gun on his person. T. at 15. The police officers did not know how many people were in the apartment and whether there were other victims and/or a perpetrator with a gun. T. at 13, 15, 24. The two occupants were detained while the police officers performed a protective sweep of the apartment. T. at 13-14, 23-24. The purpose of the sweep was to \"check every closet to make sure no one is hiding. Check under the beds, anything that anybody can hide in.\" T. at 14.

I do think it is reasonable for an officer who gets a call about an individual with a gun in a domestic violence situation, for him to investigate. No one would come to the door, and they had to force entry. Made contact with a male and female. At that point, they still don't know if that's the extent of the call. They do the protective sweep. They do see the gun in plain view during the protective sweep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I think it's reasonable for the officer to be where he was doing the sweep through the home.
