CANNON, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 1} This matter involves juvenile delinquency complaints brought against appellant, A.J.F., by the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, in case Nos. 15 DL 1878 and 16 DL 92. These cases were never consolidated below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On December 14, 2015, a delinquency complaint was filed against appellant in case No. 15 DL 1878, charging him with one count of assault in violation of\n   R.C. 2903.13(A), a first-degree misdemeanor if committed by an adult, and one count of disorderly conduct in violation of R.C. 2917.11(A)(1), a minor misdemeanor if committed by an adult. On January 19, 2016, an unrelated delinquency complaint was filed against appellant in case No. 16 DL 92, charging him with one count of sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.06(A)(1), a third-degree misdemeanor if committed by an adult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Both cases came before the magistrate on June 8, 2016. Pursuant to a plea agreement in case No. 15 DL 1878, appellant entered a plea of \"true\" to the disorderly conduct count. The magistrate accepted the plea, declared appellant a delinquent child as to the charge of disorderly conduct, and dismissed the assault charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant pled \"not true\" to the sexual imposition count in case No. 16 DL 92, and an adjudication hearing was held before the magistrate. Both the state and appellant presented witness testimony, at the conclusion of which the magistrate declared appellant a delinquent child as to the charge of sexual imposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On June 9, 2016, the Lake County Juvenile Court approved and adopted the magistrate's decisions in both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On June 20, 2016, in case No. 15 DL 1878, appellant filed objections to the June 8, 2016 magistrate's decision and a motion for leave to supplement the objections. The motion for leave to supplement was granted. Appellant's trial counsel subsequently filed a motion to correct clerical errors in both cases, as the objections should have been filed under case No. 16 DL 92. The Lake County Juvenile Court denied the motion to correct clerical errors on the basis that service was not perfected on all parties. On July 20, 2016, trial counsel filed a renewed motion to correct clerical errors in both cases, which never received a ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 9, 2016, appellant filed supplemental objections to the June 8, 2016 magistrate's decision under both case numbers, although the objections only related to the sexual imposition adjudication in case No. 16 DL 92. On August 23, 2016, the Lake County Juvenile Court considered but overruled appellant's objections and supplemental objections and affirmed its June 9, 2016 entry adopting the magistrate's finding of delinquency on the charge of sexual imposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On September 13, 2016, the Lake County Juvenile Court ordered both cases to be transferred for final disposition to the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas, as appellant was a resident of Geauga County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Juv.R. 11 ; R.C. 2151.271. Certified copies of all legal and social records pertaining to the Lake County Juvenile Court proceedings were to accompany the transfer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Geauga County Court of Common Pleas was then required to \"proceed as if the original complaint had been filed in that court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On September 16, 2016, trial counsel filed, in the Lake County Juvenile Court, a motion to withdraw as appellant's counsel and to appoint Attorney Christopher Boeman for purposes of appeal. The Lake County Juvenile Court purported to grant this motion on September 20, 2016. The order was of no effect, however, as there was no longer a case before the Lake County Juvenile Court upon which it had authority to act.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Tyler\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist. Pickaway No. 92CA22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%20329413\">\n    1992 WL 329413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1 (Oct. 28, 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On November 7, 2016, Attorney Boeman filed two notices of appeal with the clerk of the Lake County Juvenile Court. The clerk subsequently transmitted the records from the Lake County Juvenile Court to this court, pursuant to\n   App.R. 10. The records from the Geauga County Court, which would contain all proceedings subsequent to the transfer, are therefore not before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The notices of appeal, assigned case Nos. 2016-L-114 and 2016-L-115, are essentially identical. They both identify the trial court as \"Lake &amp; Geauga County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Divisions,\" and they both identify the trial court case number as \"15 DL 1878, 16 DL 92 &amp; 16JD321.\" Attached to both notices of appeal is a copy of the same entry from the Geauga County Court in case No. 16JD321, which was issued on October 7, 2016. The entry is signed by the probate/juvenile judge of Geauga County and enters a disposition as to the delinquent child adjudication on the charge of sexual imposition from Lake County Juvenile Court case No. 16 DL 92. Also attached to both notices of appeal is a copy of the August 23, 2016 entry from the Lake County Juvenile Court overruling the objections to the magistrate's finding on the sexual imposition complaint. There is no entry attached regarding Lake County Juvenile Court case No. 15 DL 1878, nor is there any indication as to the disposition of the disorderly conduct count. The notices of appeal both state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Notice is hereby given that [A.J.F.] appeals to the Eleventh District Court of Appeals from the trial court Judgment Entry time-stamped 10/7/2016 at 3:29 PM. Disposition from the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, of a case certified from the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division. Judgment Entry from Lake County involved the Judge's overruling of the minor child's objections to a finding of 'true' after a trial for Gross [sic] Sexual Imposition by a Magistrate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Additionally, both notices of appeal include a copy of an October 13, 2016 entry issued by the Geauga County Court, appointing Attorney Boeman to represent appellant for the purposes of appeal in Geauga County case No. 16JD321.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The only difference between the two notices of appeal is that 2016-L-114 includes a copy of the complaint filed in Lake County under case No. 15 DL 1878, and 2016-L-115 includes a copy of the complaint filed in Lake County under case No. 16 DL 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On December 1, 2016, this court sua sponte consolidated the two appellate cases for purposes of briefing, oral argument, and disposition. It is apparent upon further review that one of these appellate cases should have been dismissed, as they are identical notices attempting to appeal from the same October 7, 2016 entry of the Geauga County Court that entered a disposition on the sexual imposition charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Concord Tp.

R.C. 2505.04 provides, in pertinent part: \"An appeal is perfected when a written notice\n   of appeal is filed, in the case of an appeal of a final order, judgment, or decree of a court, in accordance with the Rules of Appellate Procedure * * * and no step required to be taken subsequent to the perfection of the appeal is jurisdictional.\" An appeal as of right is perfected pursuant to Rules 4(A) and 3(A) of Ohio Appellate Procedure, which provide, respectively, that \"a party who wishes to appeal from an order that is final upon its entry shall file the notice of appeal required by App.R. 3 within 30 days of that entry,\" and \"[a]n appeal as of right shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the trial court within the time allowed by Rule 4.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"Filing is accomplished when actual and timely delivery is made to the correct tribunal.\"\n   <em>\n    Welsh Dev.

The Geauga County Court issued the final appealable order in this case when it entered a disposition on the sexual imposition charge. According to the copy of the entry attached to the notice of appeal, this occurred on October 7, 2016. The notice of appeal was therefore required to be filed in the Geauga County Court within 30 days thereafter. Although it appears the notice of appeal was filed within the time prescribed by law, it was filed in an incorrect tribunal, i.e., it was not filed in the court from which the appeal was taken. Thus, our appellate jurisdiction was not properly invoked.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%20329413\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at *1 (denying jurisdiction where the juvenile erroneously filed a notice of appeal with the county that adjudicated him delinquent rather than the county that entered the final disposition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We recognize that courts sometimes find an end-around when faced with jurisdictional dilemmas that arise from filing defects. The Fourth Appellate District accepted a miscaptioned notice of appeal that was file-stamped in the court of appeals, rather than in the trial court, because \"the clerk of each court of common pleas serves as the clerk for the court of appeals for all appellate cases originating from courts in that county. When appellant handed his notice of appeal to the clerk of courts, or one of her deputies, he handed the notice of appeal to a person who serves both as the clerk of the trial court and the clerk of the appellate court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our court has also accepted appeals as timely filed in identical situations, although our entries have not been published for citation purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The Tenth Appellate District accepted a notice of appeal that was filed in the court of common pleas instead of the\n   probate court in the same county. The appellate court reasoned that, because \"the notice of appeal was clearly labelled as being in the probate division and bore the proper probate division case number, it was a clerical error for the clerk of the general division to file and docket the notice of appeal[.]\"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Tague\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6710807\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/33/142/#p143\">\n    33 Ohio App.3d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 143,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=514%20N.E.2d%20910\">\n    514 N.E.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Dist. 1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} And, in the Supreme Court of New York, the Appellate Division accepted an appeal that was erroneously filed in the improper county, because that clerk subsequently certified the notice of appeal to the clerk of the correct county and the appellee received timely notice.\n   <em>\n    Sinicropi v. Town of Indian Lake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3583575\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/148/799/#p799\">\n    148 A.D.2d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799-800,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=538%20N.Y.S.2d%20380\">\n    538 N.Y.S.2d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Each of these situations is distinguishable from the case sub judice. First, appellate counsel did not file the notice of appeal with this court, as opposed to the trial court, as in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   . If that had occurred, we could have directed our clerk, whom we share with the Geauga County Court, to refile the notice of appeal in the common pleas court and transmit the Geauga County Court record for our review. Second, the notice of appeal was not accepted for filing by the wrong division of the proper court, as in\n   <em>\n    Tague\n   </em>\n   . If that had occurred, we could consider it a clerical error made by the clerk, not a filing error made by counsel. Third, the Lake County Juvenile Court clerk did not discover the error and certify the notice of appeal to the Geauga County Court clerk, as in\n   <em>\n    Sinicropi\n   </em>\n   . If that had occurred, the Geauga County Court would have received notice of the appeal, and the record would have been transmitted to this court for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Additionally, because we do not have a final appealable order before us-nor do we have a complete record before us-we cannot even attempt to conduct a proper appellate review of this particular case. Upon his review of the Lake County Juvenile Court record, appellate counsel filed a motion for leave to withdraw as appellant's appointed counsel, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

We granted appellant 30 days to file a brief or memorandum that raises any additional arguments in support of the appeal, but appellant did not do so. Therefore, because we do not have the entire record before us, which may include transcripts of the dispositional hearing or others, we cannot conduct a full examination of the proceedings to determine whether the case is wholly frivolous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Finally, the statutory filing requirements are essential not only to put the appellee on notice that an order has been appealed but also to provide such notice to the court that issued the order.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

One reason it is crucial for the lower court to receive notice is because \"[o]nce a case has been appealed, the trial court loses jurisdiction except to take action in aid of the appeal. The trial court retains jurisdiction over issues not inconsistent with the appellate court's jurisdiction to reverse, modify, or affirm the judgment appealed from.\"\n   <em>\n    In re S.J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1257860\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/106/11/\">\n    106 Ohio St.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-3215\">\n    2005-Ohio-3215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20N.E.2d%201207\">\n    829 N.E.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The filing error at issue here involved an incorrect tribunal, as opposed to a late filing, thus the Geauga County Court\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   received notice that its final judgment was under review. Even if appellant's sentence was stayed pending appeal (which it does appear occurred from the copy of the entry attached to the notice of appeal), the Geauga County Court was not aware that an appeal had been filed.

Upon review of the Geauga County Court docket in case No. 16JD321, it appears this matter was transferred back to the Lake County Juvenile Court on May 24, 2017, due to a change in appellant's residency. Thus, certified copies of all legal and social records pertaining to the Geauga County Court proceedings were to accompany the transfer, and the Lake County Juvenile Court is now required to proceed, once again, as if the original complaint had been filed in that court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Juv.R. 11 ; R.C. 2151.271.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 29} App.R. 5(A)(1)(b) allows for delayed appeals that originate from delinquency proceedings.
