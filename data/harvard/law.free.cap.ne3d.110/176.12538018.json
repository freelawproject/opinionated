This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} One night in August of 2016, Mr. Harris and his girlfriend (\"A.W.\") were staying at the Days Inn in Elyria to celebrate their friend's birthday. There was testimony at trial from several witnesses that Mr. Harris repeatedly referred to A.W. throughout the evening as his wife and noted that she was pregnant. A group of six workers from Indiana were also staying at the same hotel that night in two separate rooms, and they left their rooms \"latched open\" so they could enter and exit each room freely without being locked out. At one point, A.W. accidentally walked into one of the workers' rooms. She apologized, but asked if they wanted to share her bottle of vodka. They politely declined and she left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Later, some of the workers talked to Mr. Harris and A.W. in the parking lot while smoking and drinking together. Mr. Harris and A.W. soon began to bicker and argue with each other, and Mr. Harris got in his car to leave. A.W. attempted to get into the car as well, but Mr. Harris locked the doors and drove off without her. At some point, A.W. also left the parking lot by herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mr. Harris later returned to the hotel, confronted some workers in the parking lot, and demanded their room key so he could make sure A.W. was not in their room. The workers refused to hand over their room key and Mr. Harris left the area again. The workers encountered A.W. again and she appeared to be shaken, scared, and concerned for her safety. The men allowed her to stay in one of their rooms to keep her safe and calm while she called friends for a ride and a place to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Mr. Harris returned to the hotel once again and knocked on both of the workers' hotel doors, demanding that A.W. come outside. In the second room, the workers and A.W. all remained silent and did not open the door, but instead called 911. Mr. Harris began either banging loudly on the door or trying to kick it in, but he also decided to call 911. The police soon arrived, spoke to everyone involved, and de-escalated the situation. They determined that A.W. wished to stay with the workers and did not want to be with Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris apparently left the area once the police told him he was no longer welcome at the Days Inn that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After the police left, about a half hour passed before Mr. Harris came back to the hotel with more friends. Mr. Harris encountered A.W. somewhere in the hotel, and forcefully pulled her out of the hotel and into a parked minivan. Some of the workers witnessed Mr. Harris \"dragging\" A.W. down the hallway. One of the workers called 911 again, while some of the other men went out to the parking lot and were able to free A.W. from the minivan. The police soon arrived and Mr. Harris was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Mr. Harris waived his right to a jury trial and instead proceeded to a bench trial in this matter. Based on the lack of evidence presented regarding whether Mr. Harris actually shared a residence with A.W., the trial court granted Mr. Harris' Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal as to one count of felony-five domestic violence. Based on the dismissal of the felony domestic violence charge and thus the lack of evidence presented regarding whether Mr. Harris committed these acts to facilitate the commission of a felony, the trial court also granted Mr. Harris' Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal as to one count of kidnapping. The court denied Mr. Harris' Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal as to the three remaining counts. After deliberation, the trial court found Mr. Harris guilty of one count of kidnapping and two counts of abduction. At sentencing, the two abduction counts merged into the kidnapping count and the trial court sentenced Mr. Harris to five years in prison for kidnapping. Because Mr. Harris had previously been convicted of a felony-one aggravated robbery in Cuyahoga County, the trial court ordered the five-year sentence in this case to be mandatory prison time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Mr. Harris now appeals from his convictions and raises two assignments of error for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE EVIDENCE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE FINDING OF \"GUILTY\" AGAINST DEFENDANT-APPELLANT WITH RESPECT TO COUNTS II, III AND IV OF THE INDICTMENT, THE KIDNAPPING AND TWO ABDUCTION CHARGES, THOSE CONVICTIONS WERE AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In his first assignment of error, Mr. Harris argues that his convictions were based on insufficient evidence and against the manifest weight of the evidence.

Mr. Harris claims that he simply wanted A.W. to leave the hotel with him and their friend, while she wanted to remain and \"party\" with the workers. As to his abduction convictions, he argues that the State did not introduce any evidence of force or threat, as the surveillance video does not show Mr. Harris dragging A.W. away, but instead only shows Mr. Harris with his arm around A.W. as they walked into the parking lot together. He further argues that there was no evidence of physical harm, as the police officers who responded to the scene did not testify that they observed any injuries on A.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Upon review of the record, we conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence at trial, if believed, to establish that Mr. Harris committed the offenses of kidnapping and abduction. One of the workers (\"David\") testified that when some of the men were in the parking lot smoking and drinking with Mr. Harris and A.W., Mr. Harris made some crude comments about how he would make A.W. perform oral sex on all of the men and how he would make them all pay to have sexual intercourse with her. David testified that these comments upset A.W. and she began bickering and arguing with Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris got into his vehicle and A.W. tried to join him, but he locked the doors and drove off without her. The workers' supervisor (\"Matthew\") testified that, on his way back to his room, he encountered A.W., who was scared, nervous, worried, twitching, shaking, and crying hysterically. Matthew offered to let her stay in his\n   room or to drive her to wherever she would like to go. Another worker (\"Aaron\") testified that when A.W. arrived at the hotel room, she was scared and crying with makeup running down her face. Aaron testified that \"she was like, please hide me, please hide me, he's going to kill me this time.\" He also testified that A.W. said she was scared and \"not feeling safe.\" Matthew testified that, once inside the room, A.W. would pace back and forth, then sit up against the door, then look out the window. Aaron testified that A.W. was scared, \"freaked out,\" and \"looked like she was fearing for her life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Several workers testified that when Mr. Harris returned again to knock on the doors to their rooms and demand that A.W. come outside, everyone in the second room remained quiet and did not answer him. Matthew called 911 and Aaron testified that Mr. Harris began \"kicking the crap out of the door.\" The 911 call was entered into evidence at trial. Loud banging noises can be heard in the background and are acknowledged by both Matthew and the 911 dispatcher in the call. The police soon arrived and Officer Joseph Figula Jr. testified that A.W. was shaking, frightened, and extremely nervous. A.W. indicated to the officer that she did not want to go with Mr. Harris and wished to stay with the workers instead. Officer Figula told Mr. Harris and his friend that A.W. wanted to be left alone and she did not want to be bothered by them anymore. After speaking to hotel staff, he also informed Mr. Harris and his friend that they were no longer welcome at the Days Inn that night and they needed to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} When Mr. Harris and his friends returned to the Days Inn again later that night, the workers soon became aware that Mr. Harris had found A.W. Matthew testified that while he was trying to call 911 again, he saw Mr. Harris dragging A.W. out of one of the hotel entrances and into the parking lot. He further testified that A.W. was struggling, wiggling, panicking, and trying to get away, but she could not move very much because Mr. Harris had a hold of her hair. The 911 call was played at trial and entered into evidence. Matthew testified that the woman heard screaming in the background of the phone call is A.W. Aaron and David also testified that they saw Mr. Harris dragging A.W. Aaron testified that he could hear A.W. yelling, \"[S]top, stop, stop, you're hurting me, stop\" and \"[D]on't, don't do this, don't do this.\" David testified that Mr. Harris was \"basically manhandling her\" and was forcing her to go against her will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} A surveillance video from a hallway inside of the Days Inn was introduced as evidence at trial. The video does not depict, as Mr. Harris suggests, innocuous footage of him with his arm around his girlfriend as the couple walk out of the hotel consensually together. The video footage is much more chilling than Mr. Harris would have us believe, and instead shows him restraining A.W. in some type of headlock with his right arm as he forcibly pulls or drags her alongside of him down the hallway and through the doorway leading to the parking lot. Mr. Harris' left arm may also be possibly involved in his restraint of A.W., but it cannot be completely seen from the security camera's vantage point. Although A.W. is able to remain on her feet while being forced down the hallway, she is unmistakably resisting Mr. Harris as she struggles against him to no avail. She appears to make a couple futile efforts to grab the stair railing banisters and the door as she is forced out of the hotel and into the parking lot. During their intense struggle down the hallway, the two manage to kick over the entire end of a long doormat as they pass over it. Furthermore, upon viewing the video during his direct examination at trial,\n   Aaron testified: \"Actually, that was a little bit nicer than what [Mr. Harris] was doing when I saw him in the [other] hallway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Aaron also testified that, once in the parking lot, he could see Mr. Harris dragging and hitting A.W. while she was kicking, screaming, and telling him to let her go. David testified that Mr. Harris shoved A.W. into the van and Matthew testified that \"[s]he was drug (sic) into the van.\" Some of the workers went into the van and brought her back out. Matthew testified on cross-examination that A.W. was yelling at Mr. Harris and telling him to leave her alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} After a series of heated incidents in the parking lot, in which the workers managed to separate A.W. from Mr. Harris, A.W. is seen on the hallway surveillance video re-entering the hotel alone. Ten seconds later, Mr. Harris is seen running into the hotel after her, immediately followed by one of the workers. Mr. Harris is seen pulling A.W. by her arms back toward the door to the parking lot before several workers intervene. The police soon arrive and Officer Paige Mitchell enters the hallway. Officer Mitchell testified that when she arrived on scene, she observed A.W. backing away from Mr. Harris when he approached her in the hallway, and that A.W. was upset, frustrated, crying, and pacing. Officer Figula also testified that A.W. was visibly upset, distraught, and appeared terrified at the scene. While Mr. Harris is correct that no police officers testified as to observing any physical injuries on A.W., the existence of physical injuries is not an element of either kidnapping or abduction that the State needs to prove.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We further conclude that any rational trier of fact could have found all of the essential elements of those offenses proven beyond a reasonable doubt, as ample evidence was presented to prove that Mr. Harris forcibly removed A.W. from the Days Inn hotel and restrained her liberty to terrorize her and place her in fear and in risk of physical harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Mr. Harris also argues that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.
