March 22, 2014). On appeal, mother raises three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1.

The trial court erred and abused its discretion in its determination of child support the father is to pay to the mother for the minor child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Finding merit to mother's second and third assignments of error, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Mother and plaintiff-appellee, B.M. (\"father\"), were never married. They lived together from the time of M.C.M.'s birth until they separated on February 1, 2016. Father established paternity through an acknowledgment of paternity and mutual agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In June 2016, mother filed a complaint in juvenile court objecting to an administrative child support order issued by the Cuyahoga County Jobs and Family Services Office of Child Support Services (CJFS-OCSS). In her complaint, she argued that CJFS-OCSS did not properly determine father's income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In March 2017, mother filed a motion for retroactive support in the juvenile court, requesting that the effective date of any child support order be February 1, 2016, the date that father and mother separated. The matter went before the juvenile court magistrate, and father and mother both testified as to their respective financial situations. In addition, both parties submitted a number of exhibits demonstrating their income for the previous\n   few years, including tax returns, W-2 forms, and employment records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The magistrate found that mother was \"compensated well beyond her visible $10,500.00 annual taxable salary\" and, thus, voluntarily underemployed. The magistrate imputed a gross income of $30,000 to mother. As for father, the magistrate averaged his annual income from 2014 through 2016, concluding that he had an average income of $62,523. Based on those determinations, the magistrate ordered that father pay monthly child support in the amount of $594.75 plus a two percent fee when health insurance is provided and $558.45 when health insurance is not provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Both mother and father filed timely objections to the magistrate's decision, particularly contesting the magistrate's income determinations. In addition, after obtaining leave to do so, mother supplemented her objections upon completion of the trial transcript, again arguing that the magistrate's income determinations were improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After review of the magistrate's decision, the trial judge issued two judgment entries adopting the magistrate's order for child support. The first entry overruled mother's supplemental objections, which were identical to those she initially raised. The second entry overruled father's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} It is from this judgment that mother now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The parties produced a number of exhibits, including mother's tax returns showing her taxable income from her secretarial work-which was approximately $10,500 in 2015 and $10,400 in 2016-and mother's lease agreement, which was to run from February 2016 through May 2017 and required her to pay $1,307 in rent. She also testified, however, that she broke that lease agreement in November 2016 after her father paid a penalty cost and currently lives in her parents' house, paying $400 in rent every month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Further, mother testified that she had the following monthly expenses: $270 for her car, $100 for car insurance, and approximately $100 in utility bills as well as a couple hundred dollars in expenditures for gas, groceries, and personal items every month. Mother testified that she was on the family corporation's cell phone plan. Mother acknowledged that her secretarial salary was not enough to cover all of her monthly expenses. She testified that her father assists her financially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 26} As to the first part of the test, the court found that mother was voluntarily underemployed.

The court also noted that, at one point, mother had \"an expensive apartment lease and other reduced monthly expenses, such as gasoline for her car and credit cards paid off every month; yet remain[ed] eligible for food stamps and medical and health insurance from this county.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Foremost, upon review, we find that the court erred in imputing an additional $19,500 to mother. There was no evidence to establish that mother could have found full-time employment as a secretary or marketer making $30,000. Ohio courts have reversed potential-income determinations where (1) the parties failed to produce evidence concerning prevailing salary levels in the geographic area where the parent resides as well as the availability of job opportunities, and (2) the court has failed to rationalize an additional imputation of income.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apps v.
