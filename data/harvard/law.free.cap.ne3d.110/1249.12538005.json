Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 3}\n   </strong>\n   Appellant, Lamone Upkins, was charged with four counts of fifth-degree-felony drug trafficking, seven counts of fourth-degree-felony drug trafficking, and one count of third-degree-felony drug trafficking. Upkins, assisted by counsel, negotiated a plea agreement in the Shelby County Court of Common Pleas whereby he pleaded guilty to two counts of fifth-degree-felony drug trafficking, two counts of fourth-degree-felony drug trafficking, and one count of third-degree-felony drug trafficking. In exchange for his plea, the state dismissed the remaining counts. The agreement included a joint sentencing recommendation of four years of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 4}\n   </strong>\n   The trial court accepted Upkins's guilty plea and sentenced him to an aggregate sentence of four years and ten months of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 5}\n   </strong>\n   Upkins appealed, and the same counsel that represented him in his trial-court proceedings represented him before the Third District Court of Appeals. Upkins's counsel subsequently filed a no-merit brief pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), and a motion to withdraw as counsel. Upkins filed a pro se brief alleging, among other claims, that his plea was not voluntary because he did not understand that the court could reject the sentence that was jointly recommended, that the sentence was based on incorrect information regarding prior convictions, and that his trial counsel was ineffective in multiple ways. Upkins also argued that he should have been appointed new counsel because his present counsel had a conflict of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 6}\n   </strong>\n   The appellate court conducted an independent review of the record and determined\n   that there was no nonfrivolous claim. The court permitted counsel to withdraw, and it dismissed Upkins's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 7}\n   </strong>\n   Upkins filed a pro se jurisdictional appeal with this court. The court rephrased Upkins's fourth proposition of law and accepted jurisdiction over that proposition: \"When appellate counsel also served as trial counsel and moves to withdraw pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

But the results have not been without flaws, and the procedures have not been uniformly applied.

Indeed, there are multiple examples of trial courts being reversed on one issue or another after\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs were filed but rejected. In other words, not only were the appeals not wholly frivolous, as required for the submission of an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief, but assignments of error were eventually sustained.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court specifically stated its approval of the Fourth District's reasoning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 24}\n   </strong>\n   Given that the Fourth and Seventh Districts no longer accept\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs and that many other districts in Ohio continue to accept\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs, there appears to be a conflict among the appellate courts. While this case did not squarely present the conflict issue, this court will likely have to address the conflict in the future. Indeed, Judge McFarland\n   of the Fourth District made a request for his colleagues to certify a conflict on this exact issue in\n   <em>\n    State v. Gillian\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist.

This court could have ordered additional briefing or delayed final adjudication in the instant case until the conflict was resolved. Dismissing this case as improvidently accepted leaves Upkins without redress for a claim that at least two Ohio appellate districts would hold meritorious.\n   <strong>\n    C.

This rule is an exception to the doctrine of res judicata, and it exists to eliminate the conflict of interests that would arise if counsel were required to argue their own ineffectiveness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20N.E.2d%20169\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 26}\n   </strong>\n   This rule makes a lot of sense, but it creates two unintended problems. First, I believe that there are deeply troubling Sixth Amendment implications. Criminal defendants have a constitutional right to counsel on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Douglas v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765282\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/353/#p355\">\n    372 U.S. 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765282\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/353/#p355\">\n    83 S.Ct. 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765282\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/353/#p355\">\n    9 L.Ed.2d 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). When trial counsel also serves as appellate counsel, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, which are normally presented in the direct appeal, are preserved for postconviction proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   at 113,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20N.E.2d%20169\">\n    443 N.E.2d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , fn. 1, and syllabus. While we do not phrase it in this manner, the reality is that the direct appeal is split into two, with the first part being the traditional direct appeal and the second being a postconviction action raising the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The problem is that criminal defendants are not guaranteed counsel during postconviction proceedings. Thus, under the current system, some indigent defendants' direct appeals are split into two distinct actions and, in one of those actions, counsel is not appointed as a matter of course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 27}\n   </strong>\n   Many questions could be raised as to whether such a procedure would withstand constitutional scrutiny, particularly as some Ohio appellate districts do not permit counsel to assert their own ineffectiveness on appeal-rendering ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims unreviewable in the traditional direct appeal,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Tinch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1686408\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/84/111/#p126\">\n    84 Ohio App.3d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20N.E.2d%20529\">\n    616 N.E.2d 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12th Dist.1992) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

This constitutional protection is significantly eroded if a state can devise a procedure that bars traditional direct-appeal claims from being presented in a direct appeal and provides an alternative action for those claims to be heard but then fails to provide indigent defendants with counsel for those alternative actions. In other words, the Ohio procedure arguably robs criminal defendants of some of their Sixth Amendment protections. This case presents an opportunity to review that arguably unconstitutional procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 29}\n   </strong>\n   The second problem is more particular to this case and other cases in which\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs are filed. Upkins filed a pro se brief raising the claims that\n   he believed were not wholly frivolous. Upkins argued that his trial counsel was ineffective. Upkins's counsel was not required to raise that argument because he had a conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1810925\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/2/112/#p113\">\n    2 Ohio St.3d at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20N.E.2d%20169\">\n    443 N.E.2d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , fn. 1, and syllabus. The appellate court determined that there were no nonfrivolous claims and that the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief filed by defense counsel should be accepted and the case dismissed. This leaves the status of Upkins's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in an unusual and problematic position. The appellate court represents that there are no nonfrivolous claims that could be raised, Upkins has argued that there is a nonfrivolous ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, but Upkins's counsel, who filed the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief, was not expected to raise that argument because it is preserved for postconviction. This logically leads to a question: is the ineffective-assistance claim, which was raised pro se by Upkins and reviewed and then dismissed by the appellate court, res judicata for purposes of postconviction proceedings, or are claims presented and adjudicated by the appellate court preserved for postconviction proceedings because Upkins did not have constitutionally required counsel to represent him regarding these claims? Either answer is unsatisfactory and demonstrates exactly why appellate counsel, who also served as trial counsel, should not be permitted to file an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief. This situation, while perhaps unusual, should be addressed by this court. Adopting Upkins's proposition of law would be one potential resolution. The state argued that rulemaking is an alternative method by which these problems can be resolved. Whether it be through case law or by rulemaking, a resolution is needed sooner rather than later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 30}\n   </strong>\n   For the above-stated reasons, I disagree with the court's decision to dismiss this case as improvidently accepted. I would address the proposition of law presented, as I have doubts regarding\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs in general and the propriety of counsel filing an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief after representing a defendant in both the trial court and the appellate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   French, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
