The plea judge imposed a probationary sentence on the defendant requiring global positioning system (GPS) monitoring and prohibiting \"gang affiliation,\" possession of drugs or firearms, and violations of the criminal law. The defendant now appeals the revocation of his probation for violating those conditions.

Because gang involvement would likely involve substantial temptations to commit the sorts of crimes for which the defendant had been placed on probation, the plea judge \"could reasonably conclude\" that avoiding gang affiliation would \"improve the defendant's chances of dealing successfully with his problems.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"859199\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/60/331/#p332\">\n    60 Mass.

Specifically, the condition would deter the defendant from further involvement in similar offenses, prevent harm to potential victims, and direct the defendant away from criminal influences.

A person of common intelligence would understand that a prohibition on gang affiliation directed the defendant not to affirmatively associate himself as a member or supporter of a criminal street gang. Cf. Black's Law Dictionary 70 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"affiliation\" as \"[t]he connection or involvement that someone ... has with a[n] ... organization\"). This would not prohibit the defendant from interacting or living in proximity with gang members so long as the defendant's involvement was passive, and he did not affirm his association with the gang by participating in gang activities or otherwise expressing his loyalty to the gang.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the condition here was not overbroad, and the defendant received \"fair warning\" of what would violate the condition prohibiting \"gang affiliation.\" See\n   <em>\n    Kendrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783105\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/72/#p75\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783105\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/72/#p75\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Adequacy of evidence of probation violations\n   </em>\n   . \"A determination whether a violation of probation has occurred lies within the discretion of the hearing judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bukin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317391\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/516/#p519\">\n    467 Mass. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519-520 (2014).

We have viewed the video, and the probation violation judge (hereinafter, judge) was justified in finding that the defendant's participation in the video was an affirmative act of affiliating himself with the Providence Street Gang. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837122\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/77/444/#p451\">\n    77 Mass.

Although the eyewitness could not identify the defendant, he did identity the motor vehicle used, and two officers identified the motor vehicle as the defendant's. GPS data, moreover, placed the defendant at the scene at the time of the shooting. From this evidence, the judge could find that the defendant was the shooter. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Coates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456719\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/728/#p732\">\n    89 Mass. App. Ct. 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 732 (2016) (identity may be proved by circumstantial evidence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Regarding the February, 2016, incident, a police sergeant testified that the defendant physically resisted apprehension in his home. Once the defendant was restrained, the sergeant observed a firearm and cocaine in the defendant's home. The judge could credit this testimony and find that the defendant unlawfully possessed the contraband. See\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837122\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/77/444/#p451\">\n    77 Mass.

Indeed, regarding this incident, the defendant challenges only the evidence supporting the judge's finding that the defendant was leaving his home at the beginning of this incident. Whether or not the defendant was leaving, the judge's finding of a violation of probation was well supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Use of GPS evidence\n   </em>\n   . We have previously decided that no search in the constitutional sense occurs when the police obtain historical GPS location data concerning a probationer subject to GPS surveillance as a condition of probation.

App. Ct. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (2017). The defendant here signed the probation order and a GPS data disclosure form acknowledging that his physical location as determined by GPS could \"be shared with ... law enforcement\" and that his GPS data was \"not private and confidential.\" See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20296\">\n     ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20296\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[O]nce the defendant consented to the pretrial release condition of the GPS monitoring, it is not reasonable to conclude that he could control or limit how that GPS data would be used, including for a law enforcement purpose\").
