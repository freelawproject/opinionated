The defendant challenges on two grounds the trial judge's instruction on the lesser included offense of assault by means of a dangerous weapon where the Commonwealth proceeded on the theory of attempted battery. He first argues the instruction was not \"suggested by a reasonable view of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nardone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884262\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/406/123/#p132\">\n    406 Mass. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 132 (1989). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To support a conviction of assault by means of a dangerous weapon, the evidence must establish that the defendant had (1) the specific intent (2) to attempt (3) to use physical force against another (4) with a dangerous weapon. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gorassi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285223\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/432/244/#p248\">\n    432 Mass. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248-249 (2000) ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aldrich (No. 1)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776332\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/88/113/#p118\">\n    88 Mass. App. Ct. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118 (2015) (\"[A]ttempt crimes have as an element a specific intent to commit\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the elements of the offense\"). Here, there was evidence that the defendant was one of two people \"waiving [his] knife from left to right\" at a group of individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was observed \"jabbing\" the knife toward the crowd gathered in front of him. The jabbing motion constituted not only a threat of harm, but also an attempted touching. Therefore, because an attempted battery against a group may constitute an assault against each member, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dello Iacono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1154607\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/20/83/#p84\">\n    20 Mass. App. Ct. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84, 89-90 (1985), and the victim was a member of that group, the defendant's argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant's contention that the evidence did not establish the victim's location in the group is equally unavailing. The evidence established that the victim was among the individuals gathered when the defendant jabbed his knife at the group, and that he was ultimately stabbed. The jury could reasonably infer from these facts that the victim was among the people up front and close to the defendant during the assault. Therefore, the trial judge did not err in instructing on this lesser included offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant next asserts that the trial judge erred in his specific intent instruction as to the element of assault. We again are not persuaded. The trial judge instructed on specific intent three times. The first time he properly defined specific intent, quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nickerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"911017\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/388/246/#p253\">\n    388 Mass. 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 253-254 (1983). Even assuming that the trial judge misspoke when defining specific intent the second time that he addressed the jury, he correctly defined specific intent when addressing the jury for a third time. We look to the \"interpretation a reasonable juror would place on the judge's words ... rather than scrutinizing bits and pieces removed from their context.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173016\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/162/#p168\">\n    474 Mass. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168 (2016), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274850\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/464/425/#p434\">\n    464 Mass. 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434 (2013). This third and final instruction to the jury on specific intent, like his first, was proper. Therefore, evaluating the trial judge's instruction as a whole, we are not persuaded that the instruction was erroneous. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1707028\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/45/473/#p476\">\n    45 Mass.

Last, the defendant contends that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury on reckless assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon because the evidence did not support an instruction on that lesser included offense. Reckless assault and battery occurs when \"a wilful, wanton and reckless act ... results in personal injury to another.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5739662\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/16/271/#p274\">\n    16 Mass. App. Ct. 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274 (1983). Here, the evidence indicated that the defendant \"dagger[ed]\" his knife toward a crowd, eventually stabbing the victim in the chest. The jury could have also reasonably viewed this behavior as reckless. See\n   <em>\n    Nardone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884262\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/406/123/#p132\">\n    406 Mass. at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (instruction on lesser included offense should be given where suggested by reasonable view of evidence).
