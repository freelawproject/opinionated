Maroskos, was convicted of misleading a police officer with the intent to obstruct a criminal investigation, in violation of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B. The defendant filed a motion for new trial arguing that his conviction must be reversed because of a recently decided Supreme Judicial Court decision,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457241\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/793/\">\n    475 Mass. 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The defendant asserted that\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   established new requirements for a conviction under \u00a7 13B, and, based on those requirements, there was insufficient evidence to convict him. The defendant's motion was denied. The defendant appealed, arguing that the judge abused his discretion. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . A judge may grant a new trial \"at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done.\" Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20Mass.%201501\">\n    435 Mass. 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). We review a judge's ruling on a motion for new trial \"only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Acevedo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783409\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/435/#p441\">\n    446 Mass. 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441 (2006), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"874767\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/397/303/#p307\">\n    397 Mass. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (1986). The judge denied the defendant's motion for new trial because the judge remained convinced that the elements of the crime, as defined in \u00a7 13B and further explained in\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   , were met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendant argues on appeal that (1) the\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   decision created new law, and, thus, applies retroactively to the defendant; and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant \"misled\" the police as that term is interpreted in\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   . \"[W]here a conviction is final, and the defendant is proceeding with a collateral challenge, new criminal rules should not be applied retroactively unless they fall within either of two very limited exceptions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274522\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/449/#p454\">\n    425 Mass. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 454 (1997) (citation and quotation omitted). We conclude that the\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   decision does not fall within one of the limited exceptions. In fact, the\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   decision merely \"clarif[ies] ... the meaning of 'misleads' as it appears in \u00a7 13B,\" and cites with approval\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fortuna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3845189\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/80/45/\">\n    80 Mass.

Even if we were to apply the rationale in\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   to the defendant's case, we would nevertheless conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that there was sufficient evidence to prove that the elements of the crime were met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying motion for new trial affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-12\">\n    \"The first exception applies if the new rule places certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law ... to proscribe....
