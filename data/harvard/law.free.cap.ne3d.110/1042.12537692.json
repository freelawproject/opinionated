For the reasons that follow, the misuse of a credit card conviction is affirmed, but the identify fraud conviction is reversed and vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The relevant facts of this case are as follows. On April 7, 2016, a two-count indictment was filed charging appellant with identity fraud, R.C. 2913.49(B), a fifth-degree felony, and misuse of a credit card, R.C. 2923.03(A)(2)(F), a fourth-degree felony. The charges stemmed from an incident on March 5, 2016, in Perrysburg Township, Wood County, Ohio, where appellant and another individual were arrested for the alleged unauthorized use of the Best Buy credit card information of a third individual and making purchases totaling $4,907.34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On September 14, 2016, appellant filed a motion to suppress any written, oral, or recorded statements of appellant arguing that her statements to police in the Best Buy parking lot were given under duress and coercion and without appellant first being advised of her rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). A hearing on the motion to suppress was held on December 1, 2016. A Perrysburg Township Police officer and appellant testified. On December 15, 2016, the trial court denied the motion finding that although appellant was not told that she could leave the scene when she was approached by police, she was, in fact, free to walk away. The court further found that once appellant was placed in handcuffs and arrested, no further questions were asked of her. The court found that appellant failed to provide any evidence supporting her assertion that her statements were involuntary or the result of duress, coercion, or threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} A jury trial in the matter commenced on January 5, 2017. Testimony of a Best Buy employee, the arresting officer, and the victim was presented by the state. Appellant testified on her own behalf. At the close of the state's case appellant moved for acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29 ; the motion was denied. Appellant renewed the motion at the close of her case, it was again denied. The jury found appellant guilty of the charges in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant was sentenced on April 21, 2017, to concurrent two-year terms of community control with various conditions. Appellant filed a notice of appeal and raises four assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   First Assignment of Error: The trial court erred when it denied appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Second Assignment of Error: The evidence at appellant's trial was insufficient to support the conviction of identity fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Third Assignment of Error: Appellant's convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Fourth Assignment of Error: Appellant's offenses were allied offenses of similar import and subject to merger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant's first assignment of error challenges the trial court's denial of her motion to suppress statements she believes were made during a custodial interrogation and without first being advised of her constitutional rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v.

Officer Gross testified that he made contact with one of the two suspects on the sidewalk adjacent to the parking lot. He stated that when he made contact with appellant he did not restrict her ability to leave, he did not have his weapon drawn or indicate that she was under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} During cross-examination, Officer Gross clarified that he was the third officer to approach appellant; they all arrived close in time. There were two patrol vehicles parked in the fire lane adjacent to the sidewalk. Officer Gross denied that any of the officers were \"right up in [appellant's] face.\" Officer Gross indicated that he was in uniform and carrying his weapon when speaking with appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant testified that she was questioned in front of the Best Buy store and that she was not read her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Appellant stated that four officers were circled around her, essentially \"[s]houlder-to-shoulder, foot-to-foot,\" and they advised her that she could not leave. Appellant stated that she was questioned before and after she was handcuffed and placed in the police cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Denying appellant's motion to suppress, the trial court specifically found that the witnesses gave conflicting testimony and that it found Officer Gross's testimony to be credible. The court specifically found that appellant's freedom of movement was not restricted during questioning and that once she was handcuffed and placed in the police cruiser any questioning ceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Upon review, we agree that a reasonable person in appellant's position would have understood that during the police questioning there was no formal arrest or restraint on her freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest. Thus, we conclude that appellant was not subject to a custodial interrogation and the trial court properly denied her motion to suppress. Appellant's first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant's second assignment of error asserts that her conviction for identity fraud was not supported by sufficient evidence. \"A sufficiency of the evidence argument challenges whether the State has presented adequate evidence on each element of the offense to allow the case to go to the jury or to sustain the verdict as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The employee stated that the male's identification did not match the cardholder's name. Regarding the information the employee was given, he testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A: But, [appellant] did, she did-she was constantly on the phone while I was doing lookups and she had something written down-had the male write something down on a piece of paper when I was asking questions. * * *. So, I just had to ask the normal questions of, like, phone number and everything on the account-are you an authorized user, * * * date of birth, and they had to type in the soc, and that's how the account was brought up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q: So while you were asking those questions, Miss Edwards was providing information to Mr. Morton?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In addition to the above exchange, reviewing the entirety of the trial transcript we find that the jury did not lose its way or create a miscarriage of justice when it found appellant guilty of complicity on the misuse of a credit card. We further find, however, based on our analysis of appellant's second assignment of error, that the jury did lose its way in convicting appellant of identity fraud. Appellant's third assignment of error is well-taken, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant's fourth assignment of error argues that her identify fraud and misuse of a credit card convictions were allied and subject to merger at sentencing. Based upon our disposition of appellant's second and third assignments of error, we find that appellant's fourth assignment of error is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On consideration whereof, appellant's conviction for complicity in the misuse of a credit card is affirmed; appellant's conviction for identify fraud is reversed and vacated as it is unsupported by sufficient evidence. The matter is remanded to modify the judgment in accordance with this decision. Pursuant to App.R. 24, appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Judgment affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Christine E.
