L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, in Superior Court. The defendant challenges only the denial of his motion to suppress various statements made to law enforcement and hospital personnel. Finding no error in the motion judge's conclusion that the challenged statements were made voluntarily by the defendant and that the defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the morning of July 23, 2010, the defendant and Sophan Yin left 2 Butman Place in Lowell, where they were staying with the defendant's sometime paramour, Debbie Grossi, to purchase \"crack\" cocaine at a nearby apartment located at 342 Westford Street. The purchase did not go as planned; they returned to the house separately without the drugs or the eighty dollars Yin had given the defendant to pay for them. The defendant claimed he had been \"burnt,\" or \"scammed,\" by the dealers at the apartment. Both men were angry and upset and discussed getting their money back. During this time the defendant smoked some crack cocaine and consumed one-half of a pint of vodka and several beers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Around 3:30 P.M. , the defendant, Yin, and Phouvieng Phouthavong left the residence and made the short walk to 342 Westford Street. They followed the defendant to an apartment upstairs. The two women inside the apartment admitted the defendant while Yin and Phouthavong waited outside the door. An argument between the defendant and the women about the money erupted and quickly intensified into a fight. Yin and Phouthavong fled, and witnesses reported two Asian men running out of the apartment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   followed by screams from a woman covered in blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Responding to 911 calls, Lowell police officers and other law enforcement personnel found the two women bleeding heavily from multiple stab wounds to the neck and chest. Both women died before they reached a hospital. Deoxyribonucleic acid evidence mixed with the victims' blood and collected from the apartment and a blood-stained knife recovered nearby matched the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant returned to 2 Butman Place soon after. He was clearly intoxicated and very distressed, telling Grossi, \"I'm going to get blamed for something I didn't do,\" before grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing himself repeatedly. Grossi telephoned 911. Responding officers and paramedics found the defendant on the floor, bleeding heavily from stab wounds to the chest and abdomen, and rushed him to a hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Subsequent investigation resulted in the defendant's indictment on two counts of murder in the first degree and two counts of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress statements he made to hospital and law enforcement personnel from July 23 through July 26, 2010. After an evidentiary hearing, a Superior Court judge denied the motion. The defendant was convicted of two counts of manslaughter on December 17, 2014, and this appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   . \"In reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error 'but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Callender\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899204\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/81/153/#p154\">\n    81 Mass.

The defendant, however, was awake and conversing, and registered sufficient cognitive awareness. His collapsed lung was unlikely to cause additional disorientation or dizziness, especially given that his vital signs were normal. Moreover, although a toxicology report indicated a blood alcohol level of .17, there was no trace of opiates in his system.

Between 7:00 P.M. and 8:00 P.M. , the defendant initiated a conversation with a nursing assistant. The defendant said he was robbed and stabbed while attempting to purchase drugs from two Asian men. According to the defendant, they robbed him of eighty dollars and said they were going to kill him, so the defendant grabbed their knife and started stabbing himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The nursing assistant testified that the defendant did not appear \"crazy.\" Rather, they were able to converse and to understand each other. This is consistent with the testimony of other hospital personnel that the defendant was alert, oriented, and able to communicate normally at the time. Thus, despite the significant pain, intoxication, and medication, there is adequate evidence to support the motion judge's conclusion that the statement was voluntary. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Wills\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"877662\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/398/768/#p776\">\n    398 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   776 ;\n   <em>\n    Liptak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3844606\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/80/76/#p77\">\n    80 Mass.

The last challenged set of statements from July 23, 2010, was made around 8:30 P.M. Detective Felix Figueroa and another officer, being assured by a nurse that the defendant was able to speak with them, first entered the defendant's hospital room at approximately 8:09 P.M. They left shortly thereafter, though, because the defendant appeared too drowsy and distracted by pain to have a productive conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Detective Figueroa returned approximately fifteen minutes later. The nurse repeated that the defendant was fine to talk to the detective, and the detective found the defendant awake, alert, and speaking with family members in his room. The family agreed to let Detective Figueroa speak with the defendant and left the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When asked again what happened, the defendant provided a detailed account of the events leading to his injuries. He described (1) attempting to buy drugs from two women at the Westford Street apartment, with eighty dollars provided by an Asian male, and returning with neither money nor drugs; (2) an ensuing altercation between the women and the two Asian men at Westford Street about the money; (3) being stabbed twice by one of the Asian men during the fight; and (4) fleeing the scene and returning to Butman Place, where he stabbed himself repeatedly because he was depressed. Again, there is ample evidence from which the motion judge could conclude that these statements were voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant was \"much more calm\" and no longer seemed to be in great pain. He had received opiate-based pain medications at 7:00 P.M. which, consistent with expert medical testimony, appeared to calm the defendant and to assist his ability to focus and to converse, rather than making him irrational or unreliable. Witnesses observing him around that time similarly described the defendant as alert, coherent, and conversational, and the attending nurse and the defendant's own family saw no reason he would be unable to talk with police. Additionally, the defendant had been at the hospital for nearly four hours and was no longer legally intoxicated from the alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Significantly, by this point the statements themselves indicate a pattern of rational thinking on the defendant's part. Parts of his story changed, but the defendant consistently minimized his culpability, see\n   <em>\n    Liptak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3844606\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/80/76/#p77\">\n    80 Mass.

See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wolinski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286802\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/431/228/#p232\">\n    431 Mass. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232 (2000) (false accounts to police \"revealed the defendant's rational effort at self-preservation, and ... clearly reflected rational choice\");\n   <em>\n    Bigley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229264\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/507/#p514\">\n    85 Mass. App. Ct. at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding statements were voluntary where defendant \"made statements that reflected his awareness of the serious nature of the charges and the potential consequences in terms of his liberty\"). Moreover, that the defendant's differing accounts increasingly provided details otherwise corroborated by the record further reveals clear thinking. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wilborne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"339559\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/382/241/#p252\">\n    382 Mass. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252 (1981) (defendant's \"ability to recall the detailed chronology of the events recited in the statement 'belie[d] a person whose mind was befogged by any sort of drug' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    Statement number six\n   </em>\n   . Throughout the early morning hours of July 24, 2010, the defendant was administered more pain medication. Around 8:00 A.M. , he complained of pain and was given another dosage, then felt better and fell asleep shortly thereafter. After the defendant awoke later that morning, he described a similar version of events to the attending nurse as he told to Detective Figueroa the prior evening. He added, however, that during the fight at the Westford Street apartment he was stabbed first by one of the women before he wrestled the knife away and stabbed both of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   These statements were made around 10:00 A.M. , when the defendant was alert and oriented, coherent, and able to follow commands and to converse normally while recounting his narrative in detail. See\n   <em>\n    Wilborne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"339559\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/382/241/#p252\">\n    382 Mass. at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the defendant admitted to stabbing the women in self-defense, this version remains consistent with his continuing attempt to minimize criminal liability and deflect blame.

Detective Figueroa and another officer returned to interview the defendant at the hospital around 5:40 P.M. on July 25. The parties do not dispute that the defendant's statements at that time were the product of a custodial interrogation, nor that the defendant signed a waiver of his Miranda rights. The defendant, however, argues that the waiver was not voluntary on account of his condition. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The interviewing officers testified that the defendant was alert, engaged, and conversational at the time of the waiver. He was calm and collected throughout the interview, responded appropriately to all questions, and appeared to consider his responses before answering. The defendant stated that he understood the seriousness of the situation, and there is no reason to think otherwise given the officers' testimony.
