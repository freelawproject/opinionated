To summarize, an Akron Police K-9 alerted to a FedEx parcel sent by Mr. Palmer to California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. The police obtained a search warrant for the parcel and discovered $18,000.00 in cash inside.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Several officers went to Mr. Palmer's house to talk to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.

The court noted that Mr. Palmer's court-appointed counsel argued a suppression motion at two separate hearings. Mr. Palmer then retained counsel, who filed numerous motions on Mr. Palmer's behalf before representing him both at trial and on appeal.

When a trial court denies a petition for post-conviction relief on the basis of an issue of law, such as the doctrine of res judicata, this Court reviews the matter de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nothing in the record suggests that the State withheld or destroyed either cash or a FedEx surveillance video. The purported evidence Mr. Palmer attached to his petition includes a self-serving affidavit and other documentation that was either part of the trial court record or was available to Mr. Palmer at the time of his direct appeal. He has not provided any evidence dehors the record that meets the threshold standard of cogency required to overcome the doctrine of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Mr. Palmer's claims that the trial court did not properly apply the doctrine of res judicata or specifically state on the record which claims were barred by res judicata are without merit.
