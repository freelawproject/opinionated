Ms. Minor walked into the restaurant with the assistance of a cane. Upon leaving the restaurant, Ms. Minor fell and sustained injuries, requiring surgeries. Thereafter, she died on July 7, 2013, caused by cardiac arrest due to acute myocardial infarction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Prior to her death, Ms. Minor told appellant there were peanuts on the floor of the restaurant in the area where she had fallen. On February 10, 2016, appellant filed a complaint against appellee claiming negligence and wrongful death. The complaint alleged Ms. Minor, as a business invitee, slipped on an oily substance on the floor. This complaint was a refiling of a previous complaint that appellant had voluntarily dismissed. On May 25, 2017, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing there was no evidence of what caused Ms. Minor to fall. By order and judgment entry filed June 26, 2017, the trial court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignment of error is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   IN FAVOR OF APPELLEE WINGS AND BREWS, INC.

The moving party cannot discharge its initial burden under Civ.R. 56 simply by making a conclusory assertion the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. Rather, the moving party must be able to specifically point to some evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) which affirmatively demonstrates the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party's claims. If the moving party fails to satisfy its initial burden, the motion for summary judgment must be denied. However, if the moving party has satisfied its initial burden, the nonmoving party then has a reciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial and, if the nonmovant does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party.\" The record on summary judgment must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Williams v.
