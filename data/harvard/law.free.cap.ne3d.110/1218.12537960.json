The complaint sought judicial review under the Boston zoning enabling act (the act), St. 1956, c. 665, \u00a7 11, and also asserted that the board's decision constituted \"spot zoning\" in violation of the plaintiffs' equal protection rights. In a careful memorandum of decision, a judge concluded that the plaintiffs were not \"persons aggrieved\" under \u00a7 11 of the act\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thus lacked standing to pursue their claims. We agree and therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The complaint alleged that the plaintiffs are tenants of residential buildings located at 180 and 190 Green Street in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston. The board granted the developer variances in order to build a forty-five unit, 45,286 square foot, six-story mixed use building at 211 Green Street (the locus). Although this is near where the plaintiffs reside, the plaintiffs have conceded that they are not entitled to the rebuttable presumption of aggrievement.

The plaintiffs base their argument on the principle that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"for purposes of their standing to challenge local legislation that adopts or amends a zoning ordinance or by-law, it is sufficient for ... plaintiffs to have established that they will suffer an adverse impact from the legislative zoning action, without establishing, in addition, that their injury is special and different from the concerns of the rest of the community.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Van Renselaar\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Springfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"65595\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/58/104/#p107\">\n    58 Mass. App. Ct. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 107 (2003). This principle applies to local legislation; the plaintiffs cite no case extending it to zoning board of appeal decisions granting variances to particular property owners. When a board of appeal grants a variance or a special permit, it is not reclassifying a parcel; it is exercising quasi-judicial, not legislative power, and its decision cannot be challenged as spot zoning. See\n   <em>\n    Kiss\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Appeals of Longmeadow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320400\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/371/147/#p156\">\n    371 Mass. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 156-157 (1976) (special permit case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiffs ask us to conclude that variances may have sufficient effect on a parcel to amount to a legislative rezoning, thus permitting a spot zoning challenge by any plaintiff who, even if not aggrieved, meets the standing requirement of\n   <em>\n    Van Renselaar\n   </em>\n   . Again, however, they cite no case so holding, and they offer no standard by which to measure how extensive the effect of a variance or variances must be in order to amount to a rezoning and allow such a challenge. If mere dissimilar treatment of similar parcels were enough, then many zoning variances could be challenged as spot zoning. See\n   <em>\n    Board of Appeals of Hanover\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Housing Appeals Comm\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287275\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/363/339/#p361\">\n    363 Mass. 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361 (1973).
