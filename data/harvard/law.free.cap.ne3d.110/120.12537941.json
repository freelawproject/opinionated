GALLAGHER, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Myocare Nursing Home, Inc. (\"Myocare\"), appeals the judgment entered in favor of William Hohmann (\"Attorney Hohmann\"), Kenneth Boukis, and Hohmann, Boukis &amp; Curtis, L.P.A. (collectively \"Hohmann\"), upon Myocare's legal malpractice claims and the law firm's counterclaim for unpaid legal fees. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Myocare retained Hohmann in June 2011 to commence collection efforts on a judgment Myocare obtained against a third party (\"debtor\"). Originally, Hohmann agreed to undertake the representation for a \"basic contingent fee of 5% and an additional amount depending upon whether or not the claim is contested.\" The debtor had been awarded a multi-million-dollar judgment in an unrelated action filed in Summit County, and at the time, the debtor's case was pending in the appellate court. An appellate bond had been posted with the Summit County Clerk of Courts. Myocare intended to use the debtor's judgment and the bond in that case in order to satisfy the $253,828.66 outstanding debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On June 22, Hohmann filed a creditor's bill action on behalf of Myocare in Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, naming the Summit County Clerk of Courts as a defendant, in an effort to establish a lien on the $2.5 million bond. The debtor, around the same time, executed a settlement agreement in which the bond would be used for partial satisfaction of the judgment he received. Ninety days later, the debtor was to be paid an additional amount of approximately $190,000. Sometime on June 22, the Summit County Clerk of Courts transferred the multi-million-dollar bond to the debtor's attorney, at Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs (\"Buckingham\"), as partial satisfaction of the judgment awarded to the debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Realizing the transfer had occurred, Hohmann immediately contacted the debtor's attorney at Buckingham and notified him of the lien established against the bond. Buckingham paid the debtor's other creditors but retained $260,000 to cover Myocare's lien. Perhaps partially concerned that the lien established by the creditor's bill had been ineffective to prevent the transfer, Hohmann followed up by filing a garnishment of property proceeding in municipal court against Buckingham. In the process, Myocare's judgment lien was transferred to municipal court on June 30, and in mid-July, the notice of garnishment was served. Myocare claims there is a dispute regarding the date of the filing; however, the earliest date that could be considered as the commencement of the garnishment proceedings was June 30. After the filing of the garnishment proceedings, Hohmann was discharged as Myocare's attorney and new counsel entered an appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Before the garnishment action was filed, a second creditor entered the picture. On June 27, First Federal of Lakewood Bank and Trust (\"First Federal\") filed its own creditor's bill action, also in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas,\n   against Buckingham in an attempt to place a lien on the debtor's money. First Federal was owed over $700,000 by the debtor. Both Myocare's and First Federal's creditor's bills were consolidated into one action, and Myocare appears to have abandoned the garnishment proceeding. The creditor's bill actions were settled among the parties with Myocare agreeing to receive $160,733.26 and First Federal agreeing to receive $250,000 as partial satisfaction of their respective judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Myocare then filed a legal malpractice action against Hohmann, claiming that its failure in amending the June 22 creditor's bill to name Buckingham as a defendant caused Myocare to lose its priority to First Federal over the $260,000 Buckingham withheld. The trial court granted partial summary judgment upon the malpractice action in favor of Hohmann. The parties filed a contingent dismissal entry in order to allow Myocare to challenge the interlocutory ruling. Myocare appealed the partial summary judgment in\n   <em>\n    Myocare Nursing Home, Inc. v. Hohmann\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

If a debtor's property is reachable through garnishment proceedings, a creditor's bill cannot be used to encumber that property. Accordingly, it was concluded that a creditor's bill is the appropriate mechanism to secure the interest in potential distributions to heirs of an estate until the distribution actually occurs, at which time the equitable claim converts to a legal one subject to a garnishment\n   proceeding if the distribution is held by a third party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Thus, until the monies upon which the encumbrance is sought are actually distributed to a party to hold on behalf of a judgment debtor, the creditor's bill is the appropriate action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lakeshore Motor Freight Co. v.

However, once a third party attains possession of monies or other property of the judgment debtor, the creditor must file an action in garnishment under R.C.

As long as the clerk maintained those funds, the creditor's bill action was the appropriate action to encumber any potential distribution to the debtor. Once the bond was transferred to the debtor as partial satisfaction of his judgment, and thus once the intangible property become the debtor's tangible property, the monies were the property of the debtor and reachable through an action to garnish property. Buckingham's acceptance of the transfer placed the monies reachable through garnishment because Buckingham was in possession of the debtor's monies.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Mason\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} With that in mind, we note the absence of a fact that would have streamlined our analysis. Nothing from the record establishes when the Summit County Clerk of Courts transferred the bond proceeds to Buckingham, only the day is known. We, therefore, have to address two scenarios: (1) if Myocare's creditor's bill was filed before the transfer, and (2) if the clerk transferred the funds before the creditor's bill was commenced, and thus the lien would not have encumbered the transfer. Under either scenario, however, Hohmann did not commit legal malpractice as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} If Myocare's creditor's bill action was filed before the clerk transferred the funds to Buckingham, Myocare's contingent lien was established upon commencement of the creditor's bill action. In that case, Buckingham was put on notice of the encumbrance after Hohmann contacted Buckingham and provided notification of the lien. To require the creditor to chase down the encumbered property and to name all such recipients in the creditor's bill action would defeat the purpose of the lien being established upon the filing of the creditor's bill. The purpose of establishing a lien is to prevent the occurrence of the debtor of the judgment debtor making payments to the judgment debtor.\n   <em>\n    Union Bank of Rochester v. Union Bank of Sandusky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"510580\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/6/254/#p258\">\n    6 Ohio St. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 258 (1856). In this respect, once the lien is established, the creditor's bill has a lis pendens effect and any party receiving any portion of the encumbered property does so subject to the encumbrance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"510580\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/6/254/#p258\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at syllabus. If Myocare's creditor's bill action was filed before the transfer, Myocare retained priority over the monies held by the Summit County Clerk of Courts such that no further action by Hohmann was required other than prosecuting the creditor's bill action to maintain the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} If, on the other hand, the clerk transferred the funds to Buckingham before Myocare commenced the creditor's bill action, then the monies distributed to\n   Buckingham were the debtor's property; the monies did not belong to Buckingham. Buckingham, as a \"person other than the person against whom judgment was obtained\" in the statutory parlance, was in possession of property of the debtor (the $2.5 million the debtor received through the settlement of the unrelated action). Under R.C. 2716.01(B), the only remedy any creditor had after Buckingham took possession of the debtor's settlement proceeds was through an action to garnish property.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Mason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5552449\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/109/532/#p537\">\n    109 Ohio St.3d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-3256\">\n    2006-Ohio-3256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=849%20N.E.2d%20998\">\n    849 N.E.2d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18 ; R.C. 2716.01(B) (a creditor may garnish the property of a debtor \"only through a proceeding in garnishment and only in accordance with this chapter\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Either way, amending Myocare's creditor's bill against Buckingham was unnecessary. The contingent lien established by a creditor's bill is subject to the creditor's ability to avail itself of R.C. 2333.01, which expressly applies if the debtor lacks sufficient personal or real property on which to levy execution. If Myocare was required to amend its creditor's bill to name Buckingham following the transfer of the funds-in other words, if the lien established by the initial filing was insufficient to encumber the property-such an amendment would have been facially deficient in that Buckingham possessed the debtor's monies that were subject to garnishment proceeding under R.C. Chapter 2716. Whatever lien would have been created by the amended complaint would have failed because a creditor's bill action against Buckingham could not have been successful as a matter of law-the allegation that the debtor had no funds, upon which an action in garnishment would lie, would have been without support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Myocare's entire malpractice claim is predicated upon Hohmann's action, which Myocare believes caused it to lose priority in the initial distribution of the $2.5 million. There is no dispute that Myocare had established a lien on the subsequent distribution of approximately $190,000 that was to occur 90 days after the initial transfer through the timely filed creditor's bill against the Summit County Clerk of Courts. The implications of First Federal's creditor's bill action is irrelevant; Myocare either secured its lien on the entirety of the settlement proceeds that flowed through the Summit County Clerk of Courts through the filing of the creditor's bill action, or it secured its interest in the $2.5 million through the garnishment action that was filed after Buckingham took possession of the debtor's monies. There is no dispute that Myocare was the only creditor to initiate garnishment proceedings against Buckingham. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment upon Myocare's claims. As a matter of law, Myocare was unable to establish that Hohmann committed legal malpractice by failing to amend its creditor's bill action to name Buckingham as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Finally, Myocare claims the trial court's judgment upon Hohmann's counterclaim is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Myocare concedes that when a client discharges an attorney or law firm, the attorney cannot recover on the contingent-fee agreement. The discharged attorney can only recover the reasonable value of services rendered at the time of discharge.\n   <em>\n    Reid, Johnson, Downes, Andrachik Webster v.

In light of that fact, the counterclaim was sufficient to provide Myocare notice of the theory of recovery under which Hohmann was proceeding. Civ.R. 8. In addition, even if we assumed the counterclaim was insufficiently pleaded, the trial court expressly proceeded to consider the quantum meruit theory under Civ.R. 15(B), which provides that if evidence is objected to at trial on the basis that the evidence is not within the issues advanced in the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended.

There was evidence to that effect, and Hohmann attempted to amend the fee arrangement before Myocare discharged his services.
