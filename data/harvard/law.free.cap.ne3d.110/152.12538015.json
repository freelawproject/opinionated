CELEBREZZE, JR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Andrew Diemer, representative of the estate of Michaela Diemer, appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees, Minute Men, Inc. (\"Minute Men\"); and the Cleveland Indians Baseball Company, Inc., and the Cleveland Baseball Company Limited Partnership (collectively \"CIB\"). Andrew claims that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because these companies owed a duty to Michaela, and the companies are independently liable for their negligent retention and promotion of Ronald Hillman to a supervisory position that he used to facilitate the rape and murder of Michaela. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms in part, reverses in part, and remands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Minute Men, a staffing agency, was hired by CIB for facility cleaning services at Progressive Field. Minute Men provided cleanup crews and supervisors to clean the stands, fields, and a few other areas of Progressive Field after each game. During each home game, Dominic Sabetta, project manager for Minute Men, would receive a call from Thomas Evans, a supervisor for CIB, with the number of cleaners required. The number of workers depended on various factors including attendance and whether there were fireworks after the game. During the cleanup, Sabetta was in charge of these workers as the project manager. He had a managing assistant along with two supervisors that reported to him and his assistant. Two crew leaders reported to the supervisors and would often be tasked with specialized assignments such as cleaning the field or dugout of sunflower seed hulls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After Sabetta was informed of the number of cleaners required, he would open the office at Minute Men where people would gather in hopes of working in the clean up crew. He would select people and assign them numbers and badges. Those individuals would then report to the ballpark at a designated time and be placed into various cleanup crews. When there were not enough individuals that reported to the stadium, a Minute Men employee would sometimes drive to a nearby homeless shelter to recruit individuals to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Ronald Hillman was living in a homeless shelter, and began working cleanup at the ballpark for Minute Men on opening day of the 2014 season. He showed himself to be a hard worker and was rewarded several times with a more desirable position running a backpack blower used during the cleanup process for CIB. At some point, a crew leader position became available. It is disputed who recommended Hillman for the position. Likely, Sabetta, or someone from Minute Men recommended Hillman for the position, and with Evans's approval, Hillman became a crew leader. He was issued a two-way radio and credentials identifying him as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} According to Evans's and Sabetta's testimony, a crew leader could not discipline a fellow cleaner, nor could a crew leader select which people would get chosen to work in the cleanup crew. Those decisions took place at Minute Men's office, rather than at the ballpark, and that responsibility was Sabetta's. However, a crew leader could select which individuals would work alongside the crew leader in a more desirable position. Also, the crew\n   leaders could inform a supervisor or Sabetta that an individual was not working out, and that individual would not be invited back to work at the ballpark. Other testimony in the record indicates that crew leaders could select people to work for those individuals that just showed up at the gate during a game, rather than sign up at Minute Men's offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Michaela was informed by a friend, Lisa Honeker, that she could make a little money by working in a cleanup crew at the ballpark. At the time, Michaela, a former nurse, was living in a homeless shelter. Michaela went with her friend to the ballpark the night of August 16, 2014, and sought to work in a cleanup crew. The two did not sign up at Minute Men's office. Honeker averred in an affidavit that Hillman selected Michaela to work in a crew where Hillman was the crew leader and directed her activities while working. According to Honeker, he showed particular interest in Michaela and was hitting on her. Michaela also worked the next night at the ballpark in a cleanup crew where she was again selected by Hillman to work in the park. After that shift, Hillman and Michaela left together in Michaela's car. The two spent some time at a downtown Cleveland casino the following night, and then Michaela was not seen again until her body was discovered in an abandoned house in Cleveland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Hillman was eventually arrested and charged with her rape and murder. In August 2015, he pled guilty to several charges, including rape and murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Hillman had been previously convicted of rape and had been adjudicated a sexual predator prior to his employment with Minute Men.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Andrew then filed suit against Hillman and Minute Men, asserting causes of action for wrongful death, survival, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and claims of assault, battery, and false imprisonment against Hillman. CIB was added later in an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The case proceeded through discovery and appellees filed motions for summary judgment. In separate entries issued January 18, 2017, the trial court granted the appellees' motions for summary judgment. In each journal entry, the court also dismissed Andrew's claims against Hillman without prejudice for failure to prosecute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Andrew then filed the instant appeal, raising three errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I. The trial court erred, as a matter of law, in granting the motion for summary judgment filed by [Minute Men], as well as the motion for summary judgment filed by [CIB].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   II. The trial court erred, as a matter of law, in failing to consider that Minute Men and [CIB] were directly and independently liable for their negligent retention and promotion of Hillman, separately from the doctrine of respondeat superior, which [Andrew] neither pleaded nor alleged in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   III. The trial court erred, as a matter of law, in holding that an employer, who knowingly retains and promotes to supervisor an adjudicated sexual predator with a history of committing violence against women, does not owe a duty of care to protect or warn a subordinate\n   female employee from foreseeable harm posed by that supervisor after work hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Andrew's assigned errors all assert that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment and address only the negligence claims. Therefore, this court will address the negligence claims and the assigned errors together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Summary judgment under Civ.R. 56 provides for the expedited adjudication of matters where there is no material fact in dispute to be determined at trial. To obtain summary judgment, the moving party must show that \"(1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Here, there was an employment relationship, albeit a temporary one, between Minute Men and Hillman, and Minute Men and Michaela. Therefore, for the purposes of summary judgment, there is an employment relationship that satisfies the first element of the above test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Also for summary judgment purposes, taking all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, Hillman was incompetent to work in a position of authority based on his past criminal history. Minute Men argues that the type of work involved was low-wage, unskilled labor that could be done by anyone with a willingness to do it. In fact, the Restatement supports this position for the job of a cleaner: \"One can normally assume that another who offers to perform simple work is competent.\" Restatement of the Law 2d, Agency, Section 213, Comment d. That is the case here when Hillman was working as a general laborer with only slight contact with the public. However, the elevation of Hillman to group leader bestowed more responsibilities, and at least the appearance\n   of authority over his coworkers. The comment goes on to provide, \"[i]f, however, the work is likely to subject third persons to serious risk of great harm, there is a special duty of investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=861%20N.E.2d%20920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Minute Men also had knowledge of Hillman's incompetency. Minute Men employees, including Sabetta, had some level of knowledge of Hillman's criminal convictions. Sabetta, along with another Minute Men employee, conducted a cursory check of Hillman's criminal background in the process of determining whether Hillman qualified for work with another employer. Sabetta likely promoted Hillman, or recommended him for promotion to group leader. Sabetta knew that Hillman had serious felony convictions, but the extent of knowledge is in dispute. Records from the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court docket, which were submitted in this case, and what Sabetta likely examined, reveals that Hillman had several convictions, including one for rape, for which he was declared a sexual predator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The level of care that must be exercised by an employer in making employment decisions depends on the nature of the decision and all the surrounding facts and circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Shivers\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

They address negligent supervision claims. Those cases are not determinative because the duty to supervise necessarily includes an ability to supervise for the imposition of liability on an employer. When employees are not \"on the clock,\" an employer generally has no authority or ability to supervise them. Therefore, liability does not attach for actions that occur when an employee is away from work or not subject to the supervision of the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 26} This case is different. It is more like\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   where the claims asserted are in the negligent hiring, retention, or promotion of an employee where that decision created a significant risk of harm to those that enjoy a special relationship with the employer. The\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   court found no special relationship existed between the victims in that case, but also recognized that had the victims attended one of Waites' clinics and enjoyed that special relationship, a duty may exist and the case may have come out differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Here, the foreseeability of Hillman's actions, given Minute Men's knowledge of his adjudication as a sexual predator and his prior history of raping women, gives rise to a duty to warn or protect others from that danger. Minute Men may not have had an independent duty to investigate Hillman given that its client did not direct it to do any criminal investigations of its employees supplied for the cleaning service, but once Minute Men had knowledge of Hillman's criminal history, a duty arose to not act negligently in the promotion of Hillman to a position that put him in charge of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In the present case, there are questions of fact about the extent to which Hillman's promotion to group leader led to Michaela's death. \"[O]nce a plaintiff establishes that the defendant had a duty, whether the defendant breached that duty is generally a question of fact for the jury. Likewise, proximate cause ordinarily presents a question of fact for the jury.\" (Citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Eastley v. Volkman\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist.

Even though the harm that befell Michaela occurred outside of the work situs and while Hillman was not under the supervision of Minute Men, the act of promoting Hillman to a position of at least apparent authority over Michaela may have proximately caused her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The extent of Hillman's supervisory authority is hotly contested in this case. Minute Men claims that Hillman was not a supervisor and therefore, they are not liable for his actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Addressing the definition of \"supervisor\" in a claim of a hostile work environment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Supreme Court determined \"an employee is a 'supervisor' for purposes of vicarious liability under Title VII if he or she is empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Vance v.

There, the court looked to the Restatement of the Law, Agency, Section 219(2)(d) for guidance, and recognized an exception to the general rule that an employer is not liable for the intentional torts of its employees.

A tangible employment action is defined as \"a significant change in [the victim's] employment status * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 32} However, this is not a Title VII case. The above case law deals with vicarious liability for the actions of a supervisor, but not liability for the independent negligent acts of the employer in promoting or retaining an employee. The\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   court recognized the distinction when it stated, \"we have held that an employer is directly liable for an employee's unlawful harassment if the employer was negligent with respect to the offensive behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   at 2441, citing\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   at 789,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p807\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then went on to analyze an employer's\n   <em>\n    vicarious\n   </em>\n   liability for the actions of a supervisor in creating a hostile workplace. The definition of a supervisor in this context is applicable for vicarious liability claims. Therefore, the narrow definition of a supervisor as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   is not altogether applicable. This is not a vicarious liability claim against Minute Men. Andrew's claim here is that Minute Men had knowledge that promoting Hillman posed a serious risk of harm to other employees and they did that without taking any actions to warn or protect other employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Even if\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   was applicable, according to Honeker, Hillman could determine whether Michaela was assigned to a more desirable position, or even hired in the first place. Her affidavit indicated that Michaela was hired outside the normal process implemented by Minute Men. Usually, temporary employees would arrive at\n   Minute Men's office and sign into the computer systems. In such cases, it was Sabetta's duty to make hiring decisions. However, Michaela did not do this. She arrived at Progressive Field and was selected for employment each night by a group of crew leaders and Sabetta, and specifically Hillman. Hillman also selected Michaela for more desirable work details. Sabetta also indicated that group leaders could recommend that a person not return to work in the clean up crews and those recommendations would be followed. These abilities are consistent with the definition of tangible employment actions set forth in\n   <em>\n    Vance.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Therefore, the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Minute Men is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Claims Against CIB\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The claims against CIB fail based on a lack of foreseeability given the lack of knowledge CIB had in relation to Hillman's criminal background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 36} CIB had no actual knowledge of Hillman's criminal history. There is also no evidence that CIB was aware Hillman engaged in any physical violence or sexual harassment while working at the ballpark. Sabetta did testify that Hillman got into a few arguments and used profanity, but there were no physical altercations. Therefore, Andrew tries to assert claims of imputed or constructive knowledge based on a theory of borrowed or shared employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 37} In the present case, CIB had no actual or constructive knowledge of Hillman's criminal history. \"[O]nly those circumstances which [an employer] perceived, or should have perceived, at the time of their respective actions should be considered.

However, in the absence of circumstances antecedently giving the employer reason to believe that the job applicant, by reason of some attribute of character or prior conduct, would constitute an undue risk of harm to members of the public with whom the applicant will be in frequent contact or to particular persons standing in a special relationship to the employer and with whom the applicant will have close contact, we decline to impose upon the employer the duty to obtain and review official records of an applicant's criminal history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Connes v.

Even if Andrew is correct that it was actually CIB that promoted Hillman to supervisor, there was no prior warning that exposed the degree of risk that would result from his promotion. Hillman had shown himself to be a good worker with no indication that he posed a risk to others. Sabetta testified that Hillman was never violent toward anyone at work, but that he got in a few verbal altercations where he used profanity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Andrew also argues that CIB should have required Minute Men to conduct background checks on the individuals that Minute Men provided under the agreement for the provision of services. However, in Ohio there is no duty for an employer to conduct a background check in all cases. \"Although it may be prudent for an employer to conduct a criminal background check for employment applicants, it is not required by law.\"\n   <em>\n    Saavedra v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Minute Men had some degree of knowledge regarding Hillman's past criminal history and participated in or decided to promote him to a position of authority over others. The extent of that knowledge, the foreseeability of the risk that decision posed to other employees given the extent of that knowledge, and whether that decision proximately caused Michaela's injuries are all material questions for a trier of fact. CIB had no similar knowledge, nor was it required to investigate the employees Minute Men hired for cleaning services. The claims against CIB fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   MARY EILEEN KILBANE, J., CONCURS;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   EILEEN A. GALLAGHER, A.J., CONCURS IN PART AND DISSENTS IN PART WITH SEPARATE OPINION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 53} I concur with the majority's affirmance of the trial court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of CIB. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority's decision to reverse the granting of summary judgment in favor of Minute Men. I do not agree that there is a cognizable claim for negligent promotion under the undisputed facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 54} In this case, it is undisputed that Hillman raped and murdered Michaela at an abandoned house on August 20, 2014, three days after they worked together on a cleanup crew at Progressive Field. It is likewise undisputed that Michaela and Hillman left together in her car after they completed their shift on August 17, 2014 and that Michaela socialized with Hillman at a Cleveland casino the following night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 55} I do not agree with the majority that the duty Minute Men owed to Michaela as a temporary cleanup crew worker extended to protecting her from Hillman's criminal conduct, which occurred outside the workplace, after she had been socializing with Hillman days after her employment with Minute Men had ended. Nor do I believe that a reasonable jury could find, under the facts and circumstances here, that any action or omission by Minute Men was a proximate cause of Michaela's death. Although the majority asserts that \"the act of promoting Hillman to a position of at least apparent authority over Michaela may have proximately caused her death,\" there is no evidence in the record that suggests that the reason Michaela continued to interact and socialize with Hillman after August 17, 2014 had anything to do with her prior employment by Minute Men or that Minute Men had any knowledge of their continued interaction. Michaela's death is a horrific tragedy but it is not one for which I believe Minute Men bears responsibility under Ohio law. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Minute Men.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The negligent infliction of emotional distress claim was actually argued as a negligent hiring, retention, supervision, or promotion claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Andrew does not raise an issue with the trial court's dismissal of the claims against Hillman.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Supreme Court of Ohio was merely quoting those elements without deciding whether the tort actually existed in Ohio.
