He raises four assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1.

The trial court (magistrate and judge) abused its discretion and acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, and contrary to the law and evidence in ordering, for the alleged contempt, a 30-day jail sentence and purge orders consisting of $40,000 or $30,000, respectively, lump sums to be paid by appellant within 30 days of the magistrate's and judge's orders, and $1,000 per month starting within 30 days thereafter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 2} We find no merit to the appeal and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Plaintiff-appellee, Jacqueline Collins, filed a complaint for divorce in February 2015. Shortly thereafter, in June 2015, the parties reached a settlement agreement that was incorporated into the court's judgment entry of divorce. According to the judgment entry of divorce, Lincoln operated a business referred to as Mad Hatter Automotive Service Center. The Mad Hatter was owned by a trust, and Lincoln was the trustee of the trust. The parties also owned a 2007 Hyundai Vera Cruz, a 2001 Honda Accord, a 1998 Lexus GS 300, a house, and other unspecified property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Article 12 of the judgment entry of divorce settled the distribution of marital property and provided that \"Husband shall pay the Wife Eighty Thousand dollars ($80,000) within 60 days of June 4, 2015 or by August 4, 2015 as settlement.\" Article 12 states that \"[i]f Husband fails to give Wife this settlement amount of $80,000[,] this amount shall be considered a lien against the Mad Hatter and the Vera Cruz * * * and Honda vehicles.\" The judgment entry of divorce also prohibited Lincoln from selling the Mad Hatter \"without court approval as long as he owes Wife the $80,000 or any portions of it or owes the wife spousal support.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Article 12\n   provided that the trial court \"retain[ed] jurisdiction to modify and amend this provision in conformity with the intent of the parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Lincoln failed to pay Jacqueline the $80,000 by the August 4, 2015 deadline, and Jacqueline filed a motion to show cause. Lincoln subsequently filed a Chapter 7 petition for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio, which was resolved a few months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Following resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings, a magistrate held a hearing on Jacqueline's motion to show cause. Based on the parties' testimony, the magistrate found that, after the discharge of Lincoln's debts in bankruptcy, Lincoln continued to operate the muffler shop that he has operated for the last 22 years. At the time of the hearing, Lincoln had three employees and owned real property located at 3025 Superior Avenue in Cleveland, where the Mad Hatter was located. Based on this evidence, the magistrate found Lincoln in contempt of court for failure to pay Jacqueline the $80,000 required by the judgment entry of divorce and sentenced him to 30 days in jail. Lincoln could purge the contempt by paying Jacqueline $40,000 by March 1, 2017, and $1,000 per month for 40 months thereafter until the $80,000 marital property obligation is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Lincoln filed timely objections to the magistrate's decision. He argued the magistrate erred in ordering him to pay Jacqueline a specific sum of money because Article 12 of the judgment entry of divorce provided that any amount of the $80,000 that remained unpaid by the due date was considered a lien against the Mad Hatter and the Vera Cruz and Honda vehicles. Lincoln argued that the liens \"provided a built-in remedy\" for failure to pay the $80,000, and that the magistrate lacked authority to sentence him to jail for contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court overruled the objections and found, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A review of the transcript of proceedings establishes that Defendant has failed to pay his former spouse anything towards the $80,000 obligation. There was no mention made at hearing the he had complied with lien safeguards to protect Plaintiff's interest. The Court is unclear whether Mr. Collins has any ownership in this business known as the Mad Hatter but the testimony at trial suggests that he is operating the business as though it were his. At a minimum, the Defendant should have perfected liens on the specified assets. The Court is left to wonder why no mention was made at [the] Hearing before [the magistrate] of liens. The Court is left wondering whether Mr. Collins had the legal authority to even make these liens effective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Obviously, when Defendant filed his Bankruptcy Petition under Chapter 7[,] he was experiencing severe financial problems. But the Court notes that the Bankruptcy Stay was not effective until April 7, 2016. Defendant was to have completed payment to Ms. Collins by August 15, 2015, which is more than eight (8) months beforehand. Defendant is in contempt for having failed to pay Ms. Collins anything towards the $80,000 that he owes her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} As previously stated, the trial court retained jurisdiction in the judgment entry of divorce \"to modify and amend\" the settlement of marital property outlined in Article 12. Accordingly, the trial court modified the magistrate's decision and the judgment entry of divorce as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Defendant is ordered to prepare a Promissory Note, in the sum of $80,000, with simple interest at a rate of 4% per\n   annum from the date of the journalization of this Entry. Defendant's obligation under the note is to pay Plaintiff the sum of $20,000 on or before July 1, 2017. Defendant may make monthly payments of $1,000 on the balance of his obligation commencing August 1, 2017. Defendant shall secure the note by giving Plaintiff a mortgage lien within thirty (30) days from the date of this Order. The Mortgage shall adhere to Defendant's interest in the real property located at 3025 Superior Avenue Cleveland, Ohio 44114. Terms of the note shall be $80,000, payable in accordance with the terms set forth in this Order, until paid in full.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Lincoln now appeals the trial court's contempt order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Invocation of Contempt Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In the first assignment of error, Lincoln argues the trial court erred in proceeding on Jacqueline's motion to show cause because the judgment entry of divorce automatically provided liens against the Mad Hatter and the Vera Cruz and Honda vehicles upon Lincoln's failure to pay the $80,000. He contends the liens provided \"a built-in remedy,\" and that the judgment entry of divorce does not authorize contempt proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} However, it was unclear whether Lincoln owned the Mad Hatter because the judgment entry of divorce states that a trust owned the Mad Hatter. Indeed, the Mad Hatter was named as a defendant in the divorce proceedings. Moreover, the judgment entry of divorce does not describe how the liens would be perfected on the marital assets. Therefore, the liens provision was not a \"built-in remedy\" since the liens did not automatically attach to the marital assets upon Lincoln's failure to comply with the judgment entry of divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The purpose of contempt is to secure compliance with the court's lawful orders.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Lincoln admitted at the contempt hearing that he had not paid Jacqueline any part of the $80,000 required by the judgment entry of divorce and that no liens had been perfected on the marital assets. Therefore, Lincoln failed to comply with Article 12 of the judgment entry of divorce, and the trial court was authorized to use its contempt power to enforce compliance with its prior order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Lincoln nevertheless argues that the trial court could not sentence him to a jail term for failure to pay the $80,000 marital property obligation.

The\n   <em>\n    Sizemore\n   </em>\n   court concluded that using contempt to imprison a party for failing to pay a lump sum judgment would violate Article I, Section 15 of the Ohio Constitution, which provides: \"No person shall be imprisoned for debt in any civil action, on mesne or final process, unless in cases of fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Sizemore\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 17} However, we are not bound by the Twelfth District, and the Ohio Supreme Court has held that \"punishment for violation of divorce decree provisions does not impinge upon the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debts.\"\n   <em>\n    Pugh v.

In overruling Lincoln's objections, the trial court observed that Lincoln might have avoided a contempt finding if he had perfected liens on the marital assets. However, the trial court did not find Lincoln in contempt for failing to perfect the liens; it found him in contempt for failing to pay Jacqueline the $80,000 required under the divorce decree for her share of the parties' marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Moreover, the trial court concluded that perfection of liens on the assets specified in the divorce decree might not have been feasible. The trial court found that it was \"unclear whether [Lincoln] has any ownership in this business known as the Mad Hatter but the testimony at Trial suggests that he is operating the business as though it was his.\" It was also unclear \"whether [Lincoln] had the legal authority to even make these liens effective.\" Because ownership of the assets was uncertain, the trial court exercised its jurisdiction to modify and amend the judgment entry of divorce by fashioning a more specific remedy that no longer required anyone to perfect liens on the marital assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Therefore, the second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

He admitted that the Mad Hatter generates income and that he owns real property, but he failed to provide any documentary evidence establishing an inability to pay the $80,000 marital property obligation.

Again, Lincoln asserts that a jail term violates\n   Article I, Section 15 of the Ohio Constitution, which states, in relevant part that \"[n]o person shall be imprisoned for debt in any civil action * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 32} However, as previously explained, punishment for violation of a divorce decree does not violate the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debts.\n   <em>\n    Pugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1817571\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/15/136/#p142\">\n    15 Ohio St.3d at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20N.E.2d%201085\">\n    472 N.E.2d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And Lincoln failed to meet his burden of establishing that he lacks the ability to pay a lump sum of $20,000 followed by monthly payments in the amount of $1,000. If a $20,000 lump sum payment is beyond Lincoln's means, he should have provided documentary evidence to establish that fact. But in the absence of evidence establishing an inability to make the court ordered payments, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by holding Lincoln in contempt and requiring him to make a lump sum payment of $20,000 followed by monthly payments of $1,000 month until the entire $80,000 is paid in full to purge the contempt order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   MARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J., and FRANK D.
