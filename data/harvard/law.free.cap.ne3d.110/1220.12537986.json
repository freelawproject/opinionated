Jefferson, appeals from his convictions in the Boston Municipal Court of, among other crimes, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, to wit: a flashlight, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A. The defendant maintains five arguments on appeal. First, the defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon because \"there was no showing that the alleged weapon, a flashlight, was used in a manner capable of producing serious bodily injury.\" Second, the defendant argues that the introduction of testimony from the victim's coworker, the first responding police officer, an emergency medical technician (EMT), and the investigating officer regarding the details of the assault were errors that created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice because such testimony was first complaint testimony and did not meet the first complaint requirements. Third, the defendant argues that the judge erred in allowing the victim's rebuttal testimony in evidence as prior consistent statements. Fourth, the defendant argues that the introduction of his prior bad act, i.e., his suspension from work, was not relevant and was unfairly prejudicial. Finally, the defendant claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   .

On September 12, 2015, the defendant went to pick up his paycheck at Domino's Pizza (store). While inside the store, the defendant and the victim interacted with one another. The defendant and the victim \"side hug[ged]\" and the defendant tried to \"press up against\" the victim. The victim pushed the defendant away, telling him to \"[b]ack up.\" The defendant thereafter grabbed another employee's flashlight from a nearby table. The victim tried to \"go around [the defendant]\" in order to \"move towards the back\" of the store when the defendant \"jammed the flashlight\" in her \"frontal area,\" her \"vagina.\" The victim testified that the defendant then \"moved up closer to [her],\" \"went around behind [her] and whispered in [her] ear, 'I don't work here anymore. I can do whatever the fuck I want.' \" The defendant then \"jammed his finger behind [her,] ... cupp[ing her] behind ... [while the defendant's] middle finger went up [her] butt.\" Darius Cardoso, the victim's coworker who was present at the time of the incident, testified that he saw the defendant \"move closer to [the victim]\" so that the defendant was \"around -- a little bit below [the victim's] waist.\" Cardoso then saw the defendant \"hit [the victim] with the flashlight below [the victim's] waist.\" Cardoso also testified that the defendant either \"touch[ed],\" \"hit,\" or \"tapped\" the victim with the flashlight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the evidence\n   </em>\n   .

The victim's testimony at trial that the defendant \"jammed the flashlight\" \"below [her] belt\" in her \"frontal area,\" her \"vagina,\" coupled with Cardoso's testimony that he saw the defendant \"hit\" the victim with the flashlight below the victim's waist is sufficient evidence that would allow the jury to reasonably infer that the flashlight, as used by the defendant, constituted a dangerous weapon.

The common understanding of the terms \"jammed\" and \"hit\" are, respectively, \"to push forcibly\" and \"to cause to come into contact ... to apply forcefully or suddenly.\" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 669, 650 (2005). Using an object to make such contact onto an individual is well within the scope of that which G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A, is intended to protect against. The defendant's conduct with the flashlight was clearly an outward demonstration of force onto the victim, and his use of the flashlight in such a manner falls within the apparent ability to injure requirement. We therefore conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the flashlight, as used by the defendant in this case, was a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Witness testimony\n   </em>\n   . The defendant maintains that it was error to admit the testimony of the (1) victim's coworker, Mark Simon\n   <strong>\n    ;\n   </strong>\n   (2) the first responding police officer, Officer O'Brien; (3) EMT Anderson; and (4) the investigating police detective, Detective Bowen, because such testimony did not satisfy the requirements of first complaint testimony. We need not reach whether such testimony satisfies the first complaint doctrine because the testimony of Simon, Officer O'Brien, and EMT Anderson were admissible under the excited utterance exception. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(2) (2018). While Detective Bowen's testimony does not satisfy the excited utterance exception as the victim's statements were given to Detective Bowen six days after the incident, his testimony was merely cumulative and, thus, not reversible error.

The victim's testimony, consisting of only a \"yes\" in response to the prosecutor's five questions, does not constitute prior consistent statements. Such testimony only confirmed her previous testimony and her conversation with Beltre, her coworkers, Officer O'Brien, and Detective Bowen. Even if it were error to admit the victim's rebuttal testimony, which we do not conclude, such testimony was merely cumulative and so minimal as to be nonprejudical.
