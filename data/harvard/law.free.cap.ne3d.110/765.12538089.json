On August 18, 2006, BONY, through it is attorney-in-fact, Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC endorsed the Note in blank. The Note was secured by an open-end mortgage executed by the appellants on December 22, 1998, in the amount of $100,000.00, pledging three parcels as collateral.

Consequently, the affidavit and the attached documents are adequate to satisfy the requirements for issuing a summary judgment in the context of a foreclosure action,\n   <em>\n    Wachovia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40-45, and the burden shifts to appellant to demonstrate a material fact remains for trial. Appellants \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but [their] response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Dresher, supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Appellants offered the affidavits of appellant, Richard Mallonn II, and appellant's counsel, William C. Behrens. Mr.\n   Behren's affidavit serves only to identify four exhibits attached to the affidavit and describes them as documents received in response to defendant's first set of request for admissions, interrogatories, and request for production of documents. Mr. Mallonn's affidavit describes the note in the foreclosure action but is ambiguous regarding payments made after December 2013. In paragraph 3 he states \"to the best of my recollection, all payments due were made on or around the dates due.\" In paragraph 6 of his affidavit he states \"I made all payments on or around the due dates from September 2007 until Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, refused to accept additional payments.\" Mr. Mallonn's sworn statements do not refute appellee's assertion that the \"last payment received was applied to the May, 2014 payment\" (Rosenthal Affidavit, \u00b6 6) and therefore do not create a genuine dispute over the material fact of default in payment. His contention that he made payments on or around the due dates does not provide evidence that he made timely and full payment of all amounts due under the note prior to the filing of the complaint. Further, he concedes that he stopped making payments on the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Within his affidavit Mr. Mallonn questions the calculation of the amount of the unpaid principal balance and expresses frustration in obtaining an explanation for the calculation. These issues are matters appellants could have pursued through discovery, but chose not to do so. Mr. Mallonn's concerns, frustration, or current questions are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact prohibiting summary judgment. For those reasons we hold that neither Mr. Mallonn's nor Mr. Behren's affidavit raises a genuine issue of material fact that would bar summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 37} For the forgoing reasons, we hold that the appellee satisfied the burden of the movant under Civ.R. 56 and appellants' affidavits and attachments are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. We proceed to review the remaining assignments of error to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Appellants' third assignment of error alleges one discrepancy between the documents attached to the Rosenthal affidavit and the documents provided in discovery and concludes from that alleged defect that Mr. Rosenthal's affidavit should be rejected because it is not based upon personal knowledge or is based upon inaccurate records. Appellant's argument that there are differences in documents provided in discovery by appellee and documents attached to the Rosenthal affidavit is not persuasive. The appellant compares a document captioned Life of the Loan Payment History with a document captioned Detailed Transaction History with no acceptable evidence supporting their argument that the alleged discrepancy is material or that the asserted conflict has an impact on any material fact. Appellant insists that this conflict raises questions regarding the reliability of all of the evidence attached to the Rosenthal affidavit, but the record before the court contains no Civ.R. 56 quality evidence to support that conclusion. Appellant is asking the court to draw an inference that the difference between the documents is material and, from that inference, draw a second inference that the materials attached to the Rosenthal affidavit are unreliable. We must reject the appellant's invitation to stack an inference upon an inference as impermissible.\n   <em>\n    Boles v.

Appellants' third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In their fourth assignment of error, appellants allege an omission in the affidavit of Jesse Rosenthal and the attached documents invalidates the transfer of the note and the mortgage and undermines appellees claim that it is entitled to enforce the note and mortgage. Specifically, they assert that appellee failed to include a copy of the power of attorney authorizing the signature on the second allonge and that therefore appellee is not the holder of the note. They further assert that the assignment is defective due to a difference in the names listed on the documents. Appellees offer no facts to contradict James Rosenthal's statement that appellee is the holder of the note and mortgage, but instead seeks to undermine the truth of that assertion by referring to alleged defects in assignment of those documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Appellants challenge must fail because they have no standing to challenge the assignment of the note and mortgage. \"[B]ecause a debtor is not a party to the assignment of a note and mortgage, the debtor lacks standing to challenge their validity.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank, N.A. v.

We have addressed the appellant's contention regarding the reliability of the affidavit and attached evidence and concluded that the affidavit provides satisfactory evidence in the context of a motion for summary judgment to establish the principal and interest amount due. We have previously held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"* * *an averment of outstanding indebtedness in the affidavit of a bank loan officer with personal knowledge of the debtor's account is sufficient to establish the amount due and owing on the note, unless the debtor refutes the averred indebtedness with evidence that a different amount is owed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    PNC Bank, N.A. v.

Their incredulity regarding the amount due cannot serve as a bar to summary judgment. Appellants' fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Appellants' contend in their sixth assignment of error that the affirmative defenses listed in their answer prevents the grant of summary judgment, but provide no authority for such conclusion. We find this flies in the face of well-established precedent that prohibits parties from relying on the allegations in the pleadings to oppose a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Dresher, supra.\n   </em>\n   Appellants' sixth assignment of error is therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellants next argue, in their seventh assignment of error, that a grant of summary judgment was inappropriate because the action was barred by the statute of limitations. Appellants contend appellee delivered letters dated January 18, 2005 notifying appellants of default and the intent to accelerate the entire amount due if the account was not brought current. Appellants argue that appellee was obligated to bring an action on the note within six years of the date of the letters pursuant to R.C. 1303.16(B), but the record contains no evidence of a continued default after the delivery of the letters. Instead, the record shows that appellants continued to make payments toward the balance due on the note and appellee accepted the payments, refuting any contention that the default was not cured or the appellee pursued an acceleration of the note. The record shows that appellants continued to make payments that were accepted by appellees and:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   It is the general rule that the unconditional acceptance of past-due installments of principal or interest constitutes a waiver of the right to exercise an option under an acceleration clause in a mortgage or deed of trust based upon a default in the payment of such principal or interest, at least where the payment is made before the exercise of the option granted by the acceleration clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 45}\n   <em>\n    Bank One of Dover v.

In fact, the evidence in the record can only be interpreted as a waiver of the right to accelerate in 2005 as payments were made and accepted. Consequently, R.C. 1303.16(B) is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Appellants' seventh assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 48} For the forgoing reasons, the decision of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.
