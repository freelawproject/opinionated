GRENDELL, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Edmund Corsi, appeals from the judgment of the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas, granting plaintiff-appellee, Dale Puruczky, a preliminary injunction against Corsi. The issues to be determined in this case are whether an injunction prohibiting contact with various entities and the public as a whole acts as a prior restraint on free speech and whether service of the Complaint two business days before a preliminary injunction hearing constitutes notice to satisfy the requirements of due process. For the following reasons, we reverse and vacate the February 15, 2017 Order of the Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On January 18, 2017, Puruczky and Puruczky Wealth Management LLC filed a Complaint for Injunctive Relief and Damages against Corsi. The Complaint alleged that Corsi sold Puruczky supplements and treatment for his wife's various illnesses. Puruczky alleged that Corsi had misrepresented his products and that Puruczky \"discontinued the business relationship with Defendant, cancelled orders, and stopped payment on checks issued to Defendant * * *.\" The Complaint contended that Corsi had written a letter containing false, defamatory, libelous and slanderous statements to various entities with which Puruczky did business as a financial planner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Complaint raised claims for Defamation and Defamation Per Se (Count One); Tortious Interference with Contract, based on the contention that the letter authored by Corsi interfered with Puruczky's business relationships (Count Two); Unfair Business Practices (Count Three); and Preliminary Injunction (Count Four).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On the same date, Puruczky filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, requesting that Corsi be prohibited from making untruthful, libelous, and slanderous statements about him. He attached an affidavit outlining the various ways the letter would impact his career. Also attached was a copy of the \"Notice\"/letter purported to be sent by Corsi, which stated that Puruczky failed to pay for some products. It further stated: \"After trusting this man, he has lied to me, deceived me, stolen from me, and passed bad checks to me. * * * I will not stop exposing this man throughout the entire financial community in which I have ties, through public media and the appropriate federal and state agencies until justice is served. I hope there is no negative impact to your company as a result of all the bad publicity Mr. Puruczky will cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} A Temporary Restraining Order was issued on January 23, 2017. It \"restrained and enjoined\" Corsi from contacting entities in relation to Puruczky and \"specifically restrains and enjoins defendant from engaging in malicious, defamatory, libel and tortious conduct against Plaintiff.\" It also set a hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction for January 31, 2017, which was continued at the plaintiffs' request due to failure to obtain service of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After a request to renew, a second Temporary Restraining Order was issued\n   on January 30, 2017, which set the hearing on the preliminary injunction for February 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Puruczky requested an order designating a special process server on February 8, 2017, which was granted on February 9, 2017. On the same date, a document entitled \"Instructions for Service\" was filed, which stated that pleadings to be served by the process server included the Complaint, Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and the Journal Entry-Notice of Hearing. On February 13, 2017, a copy of a summons return was filed, which indicated that Corsi had been served on February 10, 2017. It did not state which documents were served and the docket states \"Service: Summons with Complaint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} A hearing on the preliminary injunction was held on February 14, 2017, at 9:00 a.m. Puruczky and his counsel were present, but Corsi and his counsel did not appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Puruczky testified that his wife had received treatment and vitamins from Corsi, which he described as similar to holistic treatment, although he did not believe Corsi was licensed. At some point, he and his wife decided to discontinue her treatment since they were dissatisfied and stopped payment on a check. Puruczky referenced the letter he believed to be written by Corsi, which described him as passing a bad check, an allegation Puruczky denied. He also denied lying, cheating Corsi out of money, or defrauding him, also referenced in the letter which Puruczky believes was sent to various entities with which he interacts as a wealth advisor, including boards and professional organizations. Regarding the effect that the letter had on his business, Puruczky provided one example, in which a prospective client stated that he had seen \"some disturbing information\" in the newspaper, which related to this lawsuit, filed by Puruczky. The client had called to discuss investing and Puruczky testified that he was \"very\" concerned the client would no longer invest. He did not, however, testify that the client made a decision to that effect. Regarding any other loss of potential clients or business, Puruczky testified \"there is no way for me to know.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On the afternoon of February 14, 2017, hours after the hearing, counsel for Corsi filed a Motion to Dismiss Count for Preliminary Injunction and a Motion to Vacate Temporary Restraining Order. On February 15, 2017, an Order of the Court was filed, finding that the restraining order should be continued \"until further order of the Court\" and making findings in favor of Puruczky on the preliminary injunction, including that irreparable harm existed, he had a likelihood of success, the injunction was in the public interest, and the balance of hardships favored Puruczky. The same restrictions outlined above were set forth, including Corsi not being permitted to contact entities associated with Puruczky or to engage in \"malicious, defamatory, libel, and tortious conduct\" against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Corsi filed his Notice of Appeal on February 24, 2017, and raises the following assignments of error:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"[1.] The trial court erred in granting Appellees' motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction because the temporary restraining order and the preliminary injunction violate Appellant's right to free speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"[2.] The trial court erred in granting Appellees' motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction because the temporary restraining order\n   and the preliminary injunction were not supported by the evidence presented by Appellees at the preliminary injunction hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"[3.] The trial court erred in scheduling and holding the preliminary injunction hearing only four days (two business days) after Appellant was served with the summons and complaint and by failing to give Appellant clear notice of the fact that the hearing had been scheduled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} As an initial matter, we will address the finality of the trial court's order, although it is not challenged by Puruczky. \"[T]he granting of a temporary or preliminary injunction, in a suit in which the ultimate relief sought is a permanent injunction, is generally not a final appealable order.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    RKI, Inc. v.

We find this argument unpersuasive. Those motions were filed just hours after the hearing that Corsi's counsel did not attend, presumably because he was unaware of the hearing or lacked sufficient notice to attend, as will be addressed below. Regardless, these filings related to vacating the previously-issued temporary restraining order and dismissal of the preliminary injunction count. The preliminary injunction had not yet been ruled upon by the trial court, which was granted a day later. The due process argument raised here relates solely to the contention that it was improper to grant a preliminary injunction without Corsi being able to attend the hearing. It would be illogical to raise such an argument before the injunction was even ruled upon, especially considering it would be moot if the\n   ruling was favorable to Corsi. After the injunction was granted, Corsi immediately appealed, raising the due process argument. Although not presently before this court for review, Corsi filed a Motion to Vacate on the same date, also raising the due process argument. Since Corsi raised this argument at the first relevant opportunity, it was not waived and we will consider whether he was denied due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \"[T]he fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Ohio Valley Radiology Assoc., Inc. v.

Corsi was not served with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   notice of the present proceedings, even the Complaint, until four days, and only two business days, before the hearing for the preliminary injunction. The record also does not clearly indicate what documents were served on Corsi on that date and whether such documents included the notice of the hearing. There is no way of knowing what documents were served, aside from the Complaint. The service return does not specify what was served, with the summons stating only that the defendant was being served with a Complaint and had 28 days to respond with an answer. While the instructions for service filed separately do specify that the notice of hearing should be served, it is unclear whether this occurred, and the docket states only that the Complaint was\n   served. Defense counsel's actions seemed to be consistent with the contention that he was unaware of the hearing, as he filed several motions on the date of the hearing, which did not acknowledge the hearing, and he did not appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 22} While in some instances constructive notice is considered sufficient by virtue of the hearing being included on the court docket,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ohio Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825238\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/28/118/#p124\">\n    28 Ohio St.3d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=502%20N.E.2d%20599\">\n    502 N.E.2d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that principle would not apply here. Corsi could not be construed to have constructive notice in advance at the time of the docketing of the hearing date when he had not been served with the Complaint and thus was not yet an active participant in the proceedings. Again, even if he is considered to have had constructive notice as of the date of the service, this provided him only a few days to obtain counsel and prepare for the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Even assuming Corsi was served with the notice of hearing, the summons document stated that he had 28 days to file an answer. As a non-lawyer, he would be placed in the unfair position of having to evaluate multiple documents and determine a hearing was set for only a few days in the future, while not yet having obtained the assistance of counsel. It is also unreasonable to believe that a client and counsel would be adequately prepared to appear at a hearing on an injunction within only two business days. A similar holding was reached by the Eighth District, where the court found that a notice of a dispositive hearing to modify an arbitrator's award totaling only two business days \"was not 'reasonably calculated under the circumstances' to apprise appellant * * * of the pendency of the hearing so as to afford them ample opportunity to present their objections.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Firefighters Local 93 v.

A hearing for which a party is unprepared is meaningless. Further, the evidence also does not show that a delay of a few days would have harmed Puruczky, who presented no evidence that the letter at issue was actually sent to anyone other than himself. Importantly, Puruczky had received a temporary restraining order and an extension of such order, protecting him from alleged harm. Civ.R. 65 allows for a 14-day temporary restraining order and an additional extension \"for one like period.\" The first temporary restraining order in this case was granted on January 23, 2017, and, thus, could have been extended until February 20, 2017, providing Corsi additional time to prepare while still protecting Puruczky.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Given the significance of the injunction, which Corsi asserts acts as a prior restraint on his speech in violation of the First Amendment by essentially banning him from communicating with all entities that interact with Puruczky, as well as the public, allowing Corsi to appear and provide a defense was especially important and necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Following that provision, the order states that it \"specifically restrains and enjoins Defendant from engaging in malicious, defamatory, libel and tortious conduct against Plaintiff\" within the United States. It appears that, at the least, Corsi cannot contact anyone\n   <em>\n    about or in relation to\n   </em>\n   Puruczky, although the order also prevents him from contacting \"the general public,\" without specific reference to whether this relates to Puruczky.

Regardless, while it is accurate that some types of speech are not protected, prevention of such speech typically is permissible after the court has \"regularly conducted an independent review of the record both to be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the unprotected category and to confine the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits in an effort to\n   ensure that protected expression will not be inhibited.\"\n   <em>\n    Bose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202607\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/485/#p508\">\n    466 U.S. at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202607\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/485/#p508\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202607\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/485/#p508\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the trial court did not make a specific finding that speech which had already taken place constituted libel or defamation and cannot assume that future speech will fall into such a category. Corsi is being improperly deprived of the right to speak before a substantive determination of the permissibility of his speech on the merits has been made by the court. The likelihood of success determination for a preliminary injunction does not meet that standard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=327%20N.E.2d%20753\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 33} To the extent the lower court granted preliminary, injunctive relief prior to a final determination that Corsi's alleged letter is defamatory, the relief granted is improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Further, the injunction prevents Corsi from essentially interacting with not only various entities but the public as a whole in relation to Puruczky. This is not a minor restriction on his speech but an all encompassing prohibition on expressing concerns \"to the public\" on a matter which Corsi views as of significant interest, Puruczky's alleged dishonest and improper conduct.
