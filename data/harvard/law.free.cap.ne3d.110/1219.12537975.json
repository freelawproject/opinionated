Upon arriving, the trooper parked ten to fifteen feet behind the vehicle, a sedan, and saw two women engaged in a \"violent struggle\" in its front seat. The trooper called for back-up, got out of his cruiser, approached and opened the sedan's driver's side door, and told the pair to stop fighting. They promptly complied, and he pulled the driver, later identified as the defendant, off of the other woman, later identified as Monique Jackson. He could not tell who was the aggressor. To separate the pair, the trooper ordered the defendant to get out of the sedan and stand to the rear of it, which she did. The trooper stood by her, asked if she was \"okay,\" and offered medical treatment for her bleeding nose, but she declined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The trooper then asked the defendant for her license or identification (ID). She replied that it was in her purse in the sedan and that she would go and get it. The trooper told her that he \"didn't want her to go back to the vehicle because Miss Jackson was still seated in the front seat\" and that he would get the ID out of her purse. The trooper returned to the sedan, where he saw the purse between the center console and the driver's seat. He \"opened up the purse, saw identification that resembled [the defendant], took the ID, and as [he was] retrieving that ID, [he] saw multiple other IDs within the purse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   He returned to the defendant with the ID and asked if it was hers. The defendant replied, \"No, that's not my ID.\" The trooper pointed out that the card bore a State ID number, a name, and a date of birth, and asked, \"Well, what is it?\" The defendant replied that \"it was just a card and it was not an ID.\" By then, back-up officers had arrived. The trooper again asked if the defendant needed medical treatment, and again she declined. She was not in handcuffs. She told the trooper that she and Jackson had been engaged for about a year, had been fighting over some text messages sent by another woman, and were trying to get a phone from each other. The trooper learned the defendant's name and date of birth and determined that she had no driver's license. Both the defendant and Jackson were arrested for assault and battery; Jackson was placed in the trooper's cruiser, and the defendant in a separate cruiser, for transport to a State police barracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trooper then \"went through [the defendant's] purse, before placing it in [his] own cruiser.\" Also, the sedan was subjected to an inventory search. The inventory report did not list the purse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon arrival at the barracks, the defendant was informed of her Miranda rights and indicated that she understood them. The trooper then \"asked her about the IDs that were found in her purse.\" She replied that \"they weren't ID, IDs at all. They were just cards with information on it,\" and that \"they were just fake\" and \"made from a machine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The judge denied the motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the purse, concluding that it was not unreasonable for the trooper to have retrieved the defendant's ID from the purse. The judge denied the motion to suppress the defendant's statements at the scene and at the barracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The sedan was also found to contain (1) merchandise bearing tags from T.J. Maxx and Marshalls retail stores; (2) slips showing that merchandise had been returned to those stores, without purchase receipts, in exchange for gift cards; and (3) gift cards from those stores. The Commonwealth's theory was that the evidence showed a scheme in which merchandise was stolen and then returned without receipts, using fake IDs, in exchange for gift cards, which could then be sold. The defendant was eventually charged, among other things, with receiving stolen property valued at over $250 and with assault and battery. After a jury trial before a different judge, the defendant was found guilty of receiving stolen property, and not guilty of assault and battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Motion to suppress evidence from purse\n   </em>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Lantigua\n   </em>\n   , the police pulled over a car for a traffic violation, ordered the driver out of the car, and asked him for his license and registration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022916\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/38/526/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022916\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/38/526/\">\n    . at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike the glove compartment in\n   <em>\n    Lantigua\n   </em>\n   , the purse here was portable. It could have been retrieved by the trooper and brought to the defendant so she could retrieve her ID herself.

As to the inevitability of discovery during the inventory of the sedan, it suffices to note that the trooper did not leave the purse in the sedan; rather, after searching it again, he took it with him in his cruiser. It was not in fact found during the inventory of the sedan, as shown by its absence from the car inventory report admitted at the suppression hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the judge made no finding that, had the trooper not searched the purse at the scene, he inevitably would have left it in the sedan where it would have been searched as part of a car inventory. Nor is such a conclusion required by the evidence.

But even if we assume (despite the absence of evidence on the issue) that such an inventory search occurred or would have occurred here, the record contains no written procedures governing the conduct of such searches. Thus we cannot determine whether such a search would have been lawful as a general matter, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rostad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894767\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/410/618/#p619\">\n    410 Mass. 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619-620 (1991), or whether any such lawful search would have extended to the contents of closed containers.

Finally, we reject the Commonwealth's argument that any error in admitting the evidence seized as a result of the search of the purse was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We cannot agree that evidence concerning the fake IDs was \"cumulative\"; there was no other evidence of any fake IDs. And the testimony about the IDs from the purse was an important part of the Commonwealth's case. A retail theft investigator for the T.J.X. companies (which include T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) testified that he was able to match the information on the fake IDs to numerous return-without-receipt transactions in a T.J.X. database totaling \"thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\" We are not \"satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not have an effect on the jury and did not contribute to the jury's verdict[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tyree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665125\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/455/676/#p701\">\n    455 Mass. 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 701 (2010).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Prior bad acts evidence\n   </em>\n   .

This allowed the jury to infer that the defendant had been involved in those transactions, which the Commonwealth sought to portray as fraudulent and as showing the defendant's knowledge that the merchandise found in the sedan was stolen. The defendant argues that this evidence of her involvement in prior fraudulent returns was inadmissible because, on a variety of grounds, it was more prejudicial than probative. See Mass. G.

Apart from the IDs, however, the investigator also testified about various receipts and gift cards that the police had found in the defendant's purse or in the sedan.

L. c. 276, \u00a7 1, the trooper could conduct a search incident to arrest \"only (1) for the purpose of seizing evidence of the crime for which the arrest has been made in order to prevent its destruction or concealment or (2) for the purpose of removing any weapon the person arrested might use to resist arrest or to escape.\"\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Blevines\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"201294\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/438/604/#p607\">\n     438 Mass. 604\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 607 (2003), quoting from\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Wilson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"912969\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/389/115/#p118\">\n     389 Mass. 115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 118 (1983).
