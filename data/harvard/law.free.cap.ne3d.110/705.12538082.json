For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This instant appeal arises from the City's denial of Wesolowski's plan to subdivide her approximately 3.42 acres of land into three additional residential lots. Wesolowski has owned the property, which is located in Broadview Heights, since 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Between 1988 and 2007, the City levied a special assessment on the property for sanitary sewer improvements on the determination that the assessment would benefit the houses that could be built on the rectangular-shaped property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Currently, the property has one single-family home on its eastern end toward Broadview Road. The new homes were proposed to be built on the portion extending westward behind the existing home. In early 2015, Wesolowski submitted the first of three applications for approval to create additional lots on her property. The plan included additional land adjacent to one of Wesolowski's parcels that she was going to purchase from her neighbor, Andrew Alai (\"Alai\"). The City conditionally approved her first proposed subdivision layout in May 2015. The approval was conditioned on Wesolowski's agreement to donate one of the newly subdivided lots to the City for use in managing area storm water. Ultimately, the City denied approval in January 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In February 2016, Wesolowski reapplied for approval with an amendment to her initial proposal. The amended proposal contained a total of four lots, with no donation to the City. The second proposal also incorporated the area of property Wesolowski had under contract with Alai. With this additional land, the three newly created lots would be 30,000 square feet, which was the City's minimum lot size. Alai rescinded the purchase offer on March 9, 2016, the same day of the Planning Commission's meeting. The Planning Commission then determined that Wesolowski's plan needed to be corrected and resubmitted before it could be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On March 30, 2016, Wesolowski submitted a revised third version of the proposed subdivision. The third revision contained redrawn property lines and additional information addressing comments from the City and neighboring residents (the size, style, and values of the proposed new homes along with those in the neighborhood). This amended proposal was denied at the April 13, 2016 Planning Commission meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On May 17, 2016, Wesolowski's counsel made a formal written demand to the Planning Commission under R.C. 711.09(C) for a \"certificate in lieu of endorsement of approval\" of her proposed subdivision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 31, 2016, the City's Assistant Law Director replied to Wesolowski in a letter in which he stated that\n   he was just recently able to compile a summary of reasons for the Planning Commission's denial of her minor subdivision because the meeting minutes did not become available until May 18, 2016. The Planning Commission denied the proposed subdivision because the layout is unsatisfactory and the proposal did not comply with the City's Zoning Code, including Section 1246.05-Lot Design. The letter goes on to state that Wesolowski does not have enough property to have an approvable subdivision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Also in May 2016, Wesolowski filed two separate cases in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. In Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-16-863151, she filed a petition for approval of lot-split under R.C. 711.09(C). In Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-16-863175, she filed an administrative appeal from the Planning Commission's April 13, 2016 decision. The trial court consolidated the two cases in July 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In August 2016, Wesolowski filed an amended petition. In her amended petition, Wesolowski sought approval of her amended subdivision plan under R.C. 711.09 and a peremptory or alternative writ of mandamus, or in the alternative, a complaint for declaratory relief. Wesolowski alleges that she has no administrative remedy to compel the City to perform the duty R.C. 711.09(C) imposes on the Planning Commission to issue the demanded certificate in lieu of a written endorsement of approval for the amended subdivision plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} More specifically, she alleges that the City failed to comply with R.C. 711.09(C) and the Broadview Heights Codified Ordinances 1244.03(d) (\"B.H.C.O. 1244.03(d)\"), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Rejection. If the Commission determines that [the sketch plan] is a major subdivision, or the sketch plan is not approved for other reasons, the Commission shall state the conditions to be complied with before it will be approved and return the sketch to the developer with reasons specified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   R.C. 711.09(C) imposes a 30-day time frame to deny an application for plat approval. She alleges that as of May 2, 2016, the 33rd day following her March 30, 2016 sketch plan, the City failed to: (1) return the plan; (2) provide an endorsement reflecting its refusal to approve it; (3) adopt a statement of the grounds for refusing the sketch plan; and (4) provide a statement of the conditions to be complied with before the sketch plan would be approved. She further alleges that on May 17, 2016, 48 days after the submission of her sketch plan, she sent the City a formal demand under R.C. 711.09(C) for the required \"certificate in lieu of endorsement of approval,\" which the City never issued. As a result, Wesolowski contends she is entitled to a declaratory judgment that her amended sketch plan is deemed approved, and the City must issue her the certificate in lieu of written endorsement of approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In September 2016, Wesolowski filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to the mandamus and declaratory judgment claims. The City opposed, arguing that: (1) R.C. 711.09(C) does not apply because, by its plain language, the statute only applies to village planning commissions; (2) the City has its own subdivision regulations under its home rule powers; and (3) Wesolowski has an adequate administrative remedy at law-her R.C. Chapter 2506 appeal. The trial court denied Wesolowski's motion with respect to her mandamus claim, but granted Wesolowski's summary judgment as to the declaratory judgment claim. The trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Wesolowski] is hereby granted a declaratory judgment pursuant to [ R.C. 2721.03 ]. The [ R.C. 711.09(C) ] conditions\n   to [Wesolowski's] entitlement to the demanded certificate of approval have been satisfied, and the City is required by the statute to issue that certificate to [Wesolowski] forthwith. [The City] has not complied with the procedural standards and timeframes of [ R.C. 711.09(C) ] and [Wesolowski's] right to a certificate of approval as provided for in [ R.C. 711.09(C) ] has matured. [Wesolowski's] R.C. Chapter 2506 appeal and all other pending claims are hereby stayed. Pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B) there is no just reason for delay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} It is from this order that the City appeals, raising the following single assignment of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to [Wesolowski] with respect to her declaratory judgment claim and ordering [the City] to issue a certificate to [Wesolowski] pursuant to the subdivision procedures set forth in R.C. 711.09(C) because being a city planning commission, rather than a village commission, this statute does not apply to [the City] and the subdivision of property in the City is governed by the subdivision regulations adopted by City Council pursuant to the home rule powers granted to municipal corporations by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review-Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} We review an appeal from summary judgment under a de novo standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

On its face, R.C. 711.09(C) applies to \"approvals\" by the \"planning commission\" (a city's planning commission) required by \"this section\" ( R.C. 711.09 ). When reading R.C. 711.09 as a whole, it explicitly states where it intends to restrict its operation to only \"village planning commissions\" in R.C. 711.09(B)(1) and the third paragraph of 711.09(C). Therefore, R.C. 711.09(C)'s general reference to \"planning commission,\" without the qualifier, refers to all \"planning commissions\" referenced in section R.C. 711.09, just as R.C. 711.09(C)'s first sentence specifies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In support of its argument, the City relies on\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

In\n   <em>\n    Donnelly\n   </em>\n   , Fairview Park City Council declined to act on the city planning commission's recommendation that the subdivision plat be approved. The plaintiffs then appealed under R.C. Chapter 2506 to the court of common pleas for the city's failure to comply with its zoning code. The common pleas court found in favor of the plaintiffs, and the city appealed. On appeal, this court reversed the judgment of the common pleas court and entered judgment for the city, reasoning that \" 'the order appealed from was a legislative act of the Council of the City of Fairview Park, Ohio, acting in its legislative capacity, and therefore said order was not appealable [to the common pleas court] under Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=233%20N.E.2d%20500\">\n    233 N.E.2d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The issue before the Ohio Supreme Court was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   whether the action of a municipal council, in refusing or failing to approve the recommendation of a municipal planning commission as to a resubdivision of real estate which is authorized and sanctioned by a zoning ordinance, is legislative and nonappealable under Chapter 2506, Revised Code, or administrative and appealable under that Chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=233%20N.E.2d%20500\">\n    233 N.E.2d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The court concluded that the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   failure or refusal of a municipal council to approve a plan for the resubdivision of land which meets the terms of a zoning ordinance already adopted and in existence is an administrative act, and an appeal from such failure or refusal to approve lies to the Court of Common Pleas under Chapter 2506, Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=233%20N.E.2d%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at paragraph three of the syllabus. In reaching its decision, the court stated: \"the test for determining whether the action of a legislative body is legislative or administrative is whether the action taken is one enacting a law, ordinance or regulation, or executing or administering a law, ordinance or regulation already in existence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=233%20N.E.2d%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at paragraph two of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 36} We find\n   <em>\n    Donnelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6702870\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/13/1/\">\n    13 Ohio St.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=233%20N.E.2d%20500\">\n    233 N.E.2d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , distinguishable from the instant case. Here, Wesolowski is seeking a declaratory judgment based on its demand for the City to issue a \"certificate in lieu of endorsement of approval\" under R.C. 711.09(C). Whereas in\n   <em>\n    Donnelly\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff sought administrative relief for the City's failure to act upon a municipal regulation. R.C. 711.09(C) specifically sets forth the remedy for the city's refusal. It provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [w]ithin sixty days after refusal, the person submitting any plat that the commission, commissioner, or legislative authority refuses to approve may file a petition in the court of common pleas of the proper county, in which the person shall be named plaintiff. The petition shall contain a copy of the plat sought to be recorded, a statement of the facts justifying the propriety and reasonableness of the proposed subdivision, and a prayer for an order directed to the recorder\n   to record the plat and may include a statement of facts to support a claim that the rules of the planning authority under which it refused to approve the plat are unreasonable or unlawful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=233%20N.E.2d%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Donnelly\n   </em>\n   , where the relief was an administrative appeal for the city's failure to act upon a municipal regulation, in the instant case, R.C. 711.09(C) specifically sets forth the plaintiff's remedy, which is a petition in the court of common pleas. Thus, any remedy Wesolowski may have in her R.C. Chapter 2506 appeal does not preclude her from obtaining a declaratory judgment on the basis of R.C. 711.09(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment as to Wesolowski's declaratory judgment claim.
