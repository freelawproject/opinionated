On appeal, Appellant contends that 1) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to properly advise him of a plea offer made by the State of Ohio; 2) his convictions for aggravated robbery and failure to comply were against the manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence; 3) the trial court abused its discretion in admitting improper hearsay evidence from Detective Jodi Conkel and/or failing to provide a proper curative instruction; 4) his speedy trial rights under R.C. 2945.71 were violated as a matter of law; 5) a mistrial should have been declared due to improper selection of the alternate juror at trial; 6) he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial when his pro se motions went unaddressed; and 7) cumulative errors committed during his trial deprived him of a fair trial and require reversal of his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Because we conclude Appellant's trial counsel was not ineffective with respect to advising him regarding his plea offers made by the State, Appellant's first assignment of error is overruled. And, we cannot conclude that Appellant's convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence or not supported by sufficient evidence, his second assignment of error is overruled. Likewise, in light of our finding there was no plain error in the trial court's admission of alleged hearsay testimony by Detective Conkel or failure to issue a curative instruction, Appellant's third assignment of error is overruled. Similarly, having concluded Appellant did not preserve his speedy trial argument for purposes of appeal, his fourth assignment of error is overruled. Also, having determined the trial court did not err in failing to declare a mistrial, we must overrule Appellant's fifth assignment of error. Finally, having found no merit to Appellant's sixth or seventh\n   assignments of error, they are also overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A review of the record reveals that on October 16, 2015, an African-American male entered the Super 8 Motel located in the Rosemount area of Scioto County, Ohio, at approximately 4:52 a.m. Accordingly to the hotel clerk, Andrea Meddock, the man was wearing a hunter green sweatshirt with no hood but with a towel or something around his head so that only his eyes could be seen, clear plastic gloves (the type used while dying hair, not medical gloves), and was holding a silver gun. He ordered the clerk to open the safe; however, she fled without giving him any money, and then he fled as well. Scioto County Sheriff's Deputy Brian Nolan responded to the scene, took the statement of the clerk, and radioed dispatch to issue an order to be on the lookout for the suspect. New Boston Police Department Officer Josh Carver was working in the Rosemount area at the time and heard the radio traffic indicating an armed robbery had occurred at the motel. He stationed himself at a gas station on the corner of Rosemount Road and State Route 139 and pointed his lights toward oncoming traffic so he could watch for the suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Shortly thereafter Officer Carver saw a vehicle coming down Rosemount Road with what he described as two African-American individuals. When the individual in the passenger seat completely laid the seat down in what appeared to be an effort to hide, after passing a Sheriff's cruiser traveling the opposite direction with lights and sirens, Officer Carver decided to follow the vehicle. The vehicle, a maroon colored Pontiac Bonneville, initially stopped pursuant to a traffic stop initiated by Officer Carver; however, as Officer Carver approached the passenger side of the vehicle and was able to view an African-American male, the driver of the vehicle sped off. A high-speed chase ensued with the car stopping one time while on Route 139, at which point the driver of the vehicle jumped, or stumbled, out of the car. The passenger then got into the driver's seat and the chase continued. Officer Carver chased the vehicle down Route 139 and over Houston Hollow Road at speeds up to 80 M.P.H., around curvy and poorly lit residential areas. The chase ended with the vehicle flipping over. The suspect fled and was not apprehended. Upon doing an inventory of the vehicle, law enforcement recovered a hunter green sweatshirt with no hood, clear plastic, non-medical gloves, and a nickel-plated semi-automatic pistol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The original driver of the car, later determined to be an African-American female named Danielle Foster from Dayton, Ohio, was later picked up by the Sheriff's office and was taken to the jail for questioning. Detective Jodi Conkel interviewed Ms. Foster the next day at the jail. Ms. Foster initially told Detective Conkel she had agreed to drive an unknown man to Scioto County to pick up money that was owed to him by a friend. During the interview, Ms. Foster told her she stopped at the McDonald's in Rosemount to get a drink through the drive-thru, at which point the man used her phone to call his friend to make arrangements, but that the friend did not answer. She further told her that the man then left for about fifteen to twenty minutes, but that she didn't know where he went. When he came back, he gave her directions over what appeared to be Rosemount Road and towards the area where Officer Carver was stationed. She explained that she was initially the driver of the vehicle and that she drove off after the traffic stop because the man held a gun to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Upon further investigation, which included listening to jail calls, talking to someone who claimed to be Danielle Foster's sister, and speaking with the jail in Dayton, Ohio, where Ms. Foster had been held on a previous occasion, Detective Conkel confronted Ms. Foster again and stated she knew Appellant, Toby Lamb, II, was the individual that was with her. Ms. Foster admitted the same. Subsequent investigation, which included obtaining a DNA standard from Appellant, and testing of the items recovered from the vehicle, revealed that Appellant's DNA was located on the thumb of one of the gloves found in the car. While Appellant's DNA was not found on the sweatshirt, he could not be excluded as a wearer of the shirt. No DNA testing was performed on the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Based upon these events and this evidence, Appellant, Toby Lamb II, was indicted on November 19, 2015, for one count of aggravated robbery, a first degree felony in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) and (C), along with a firearm specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.145(A). He was also indicted for one count of failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer, a third degree felony in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B) and (C)(5)(a)(ii), and one count of receiving stolen property, a fourth degree felony in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A) and (C). Appellant was not apprehended until June 17, 2016. Appellant was thereafter arraigned and counsel was appointed. The matter proceeded to a jury trial on March 6, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The record reveals that although the trial initially began and a jury was selected and seated on March 6, 2017, the trial judge came under a disability and the trial was not reconvened until March 13, 2017. Further, when the trial was reconvened, a visiting judge took over the case and heard the trial. The State introduced several witnesses at trial, including: 1) Andrea Meddock, the hotel clerk; 2) Deputy Brian Nolan, the Scioto County Sheriff's Deputy who first responded to the hotel and who later inventoried the vehicle; 3) Officer Josh Carver, the New Boston Police Officer who was involved in the high-speed chase; 4) Danielle Foster, Appellant's co-defendant; 5) Detective Dan Malone, the evidence officer with the Scioto County Sheriff's Department; 6) Devonie Herdeman, a forensic scientist in the DNA Section at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCI); and 7) Detective Jodi Conkel, who interviewed Danielle Foster at the jail and later obtained DNA samples from Appellant. Appellant introduced only one witness, his son, Toby Lamb, III, who testified that his father had attended his freshman football game on the night in question, had stayed the night with him and his mother and then took him to school the next morning at 7:00 a.m. He also admitted on cross-examination that his mother owns a maroon Pontiac Bonneville and that it was reported stolen sometime between October 14 and October 16, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The record further reveals that because it was the original trial judge's practice to do so, thirteen jurors were initially seated on the jury, rather than twelve, with the practice of randomly selecting one juror to be eliminated as an alternate prior to the start of deliberations. When it was time to eliminate the alternate juror, a number was drawn out of a basket, and the juror whose number was drawn was the only African-American on the jury. At that point, defense counsel objected. However, the juror was eliminated\n   and the matter was submitted to the remaining jurors. Appellant was ultimately convicted of aggravated robbery, with a firearm specification, and failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer, as charged in the indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court then sentenced Appellant to an aggregate term of fifteen years in prison in an April 5, 2017 sentencing entry. It is from this judgment entry Appellant now brings his appeal, setting forth seven assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"I.

More specifically, Appellant argues that a plea offer was discussed the morning of the first day of trial which involved him pleading to second degree felony robbery in exchange for a sentence of three years and nine months. Appellant contends he advised his counsel he wanted to \"sleep on it\" but that when the trial resumed a week later with a different judge, the offer was no longer available. Thus, Appellant does not claim his counsel failed to advise him of the terms of the plea offer, but rather that his counsel failed to advise him of the time limit in which to accept the plea offer. The State denies such an offer was made. Instead, the State contends that two formal offers were made and put on the record, both of which were rejected by Appellant, and that neither of them involved a sentence of three years and nine months or were made the morning of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Criminal defendants have a right to counsel, including a right to the effective assistance from counsel.\n   <em>\n    McMann v.

R.C. 2911.01 defines aggravated robbery and provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"(A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (1) Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender's person or under the offender's control and either display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Additionally, R.C. 2941.145 governs specifications concerning use of firearms to facilitate offenses and provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"(A) Imposition of a three-year mandatory prison term upon an offender under division (B)(1)(a)(ii) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code is precluded unless the indictment, count in the indictment, or information charging the offense specifies that the offender had a firearm on or about the offender's person or under the offender's control while committing the offense and displayed the firearm, brandished the firearm, indicated that the offender possessed the firearm,\n   or used it to facilitate the offense. * * *\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Further, R.C. 2921.331 defines failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer and provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"(B) No person shall operate a motor vehicle so as willfully to elude or flee a police officer after receiving a visible or audible signal from a police officer to bring the person's motor vehicle to a stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (C)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (5)(a) A violation of division (B) of this section is a felony of the third degree if the jury or judge as trier of fact finds any of the following by proof beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (ii) The operation of the motor vehicle by the offender caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Here, Appellant essentially contends that the State did not prove his identity as the perpetrator of the crimes at issue. He does not argue the State failed to prove any of the specific elements of these offenses, but instead argues the State failed to prove he was the person who committed the crimes. However, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, the jury was presented with the following testimony and evidence at trial: 1) hotel clerk Andrea Meddock testified an African-American male wearing a hunter green sweatshirt and clear plastic gloves presented himself at the Super 8 Motel on the night in question, holding a silver pistol and demanded money; 2) law enforcement testimony that a high-speed chase ensued thereafter on a curvy, winding road at night which resulted in a vehicle crash, and a subsequent search of the vehicle yielded a hunter green sweatshirt and clear plastic gloves; 3) DNA testing performed on these items revealed Appellant's DNA on one of the gloves, but did not indicate Appellant's DNA was on the sweatshirt; 4) expert testimony explained the lack of Appellant's DNA on the sweatshirt does not eliminate him as wearer of the shirt; 5) co-defendant Danielle Foster testified at trial and identified Appellant as the individual with her in the car on the night at issue, stating she parked at a McDonald's (which evidence revealed was right near the Super 8 Motel) and waited on him while he exited the car and later returned, and then became involved in a high-speed chase; and 6) the vehicle involved in the high-speed chase, which contained an item with Appellant's DNA on it, was owned by Appellant's son's mother, who had reported the car stolen some time between October 14 and October 16, 2015. The jury also viewed videos of the hotel surveillance system and the cruiser cam and body cam footage from the officer involved in the high-speed chase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We find that the jury could have reasonably concluded, based upon this evidence, that the State proved each and every element of the offenses at issue, and proved Appellant was the individual who committed these offenses. Despite Appellant's argument that Danielle Foster's testimony should have been discounted, a review of the record reveals that the trial court properly instructed the jury with regard to its consideration of accomplice testimony as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his or her complicity, moral turpitude, or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect\n   his or her credibility and make that testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Despite this admonition, it is clear the jury weighed the evidence and testimony, including the accomplice testimony in favor of the State, which was within its province to do as the trier of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In light of the foregoing, we cannot conclude that Appellant's convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence, that the jury lost its way, or that Appellant's convictions were such a manifest miscarriage of justice that they must be reversed. Moreover, \"[w]hen an appellate court concludes that the weight of the evidence supports a defendant's conviction, this conclusion necessarily also includes a finding that sufficient evidence supports the conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State argues this testimony was merely cumulative to the trial testimony provided by Danielle Foster and already heard by the jury and that the admission of the Conkel's additional testimony was harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 27} \"A trial court has broad discretion in the admission or exclusion of evidence, and so long as such discretion is exercised in line with the rules of procedure and evidence, its judgment will not be reversed absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion with attendant material prejudice to defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Rather, it is a question of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the convictions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168882\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/18/#p24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; citing\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   at 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168882\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/18/#p24\">\n    87 S.Ct. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Here, Detective Conkel testified Appellant's co-defendant's sister told her that Appellant was the person with Danielle Foster on the night at issue, thus implicating Appellant in the crimes. These statements constituted impermissible hearsay and should not have been admitted at trial and further, no curative or limiting instruction was requested or given. In\n   <em>\n    Gerald\n   </em>\n   , the focus of our analysis was on statements allegedly made by co-defendants that were repeated to the jury through Detective Conkel's testimony, and those co-defendants did not testify at trial and were not subject to cross-examination. Even so, we found the admission of the improper co-defendant testimony to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in\n   <em>\n    Gerald\n   </em>\n   in light of the fact we had already determined, without relying on the improper hearsay testimony, that Gerald's convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Gerald\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The focus of this portion of our analysis is not co-defendant statements admitted through law enforcement testimony of a co-defendant that did not testify at trial, as in\n   <em>\n    Gerald\n   </em>\n   , but rather the co-defendant's sister's statements, which were made to Detective Conkel during the course of her investigation. Nevertheless, we find the admission of Danielle Foster's sister's statements to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the other evidence introduced by the State to establish Appellant's guilt, as discussed above, as well as our finding, much like in\n   <em>\n    Gerald,\n   </em>\n   that Appellant's convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Further, in light of our plain error standard of review and Ms. Foster's testimony that Appellant was with her on the night these offenses occurred, as well as the DNA evidence linking Appellant to gloves matching the description of those worn during the robbery and found in the vehicle after the high-speed chase, we cannot conclude that admission of the co-defendant's sister's statement changed the outcome of the trial. Accordingly, we reject Appellant's argument that the trial court abused its discretion, or as we have discussed, committed plain error, in admitting this hearsay testimony and failing to provide, sua sponte, a curative instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Appellant further contends his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object sooner and for failing to request a curative instruction. As set forth above, in order to establish constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) that his counsel's performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived him of a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Having found none of these errors changed the outcome of the trial or resulted in plain error, we similarly conclude Appellant has not proven the prejudice required in order to demonstrate a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

A review of the record indicates that this particular trial court's procedure involves the seating of thirteen jurors instead of twelve for the entire trial, based upon the rationale that alternate jurors who are selected prior to trial may not pay close attention, and sometimes even sleep, during the trial. Rather than identifying the alternate juror at the beginning of trial, the court randomly draws a number out of a basket at the close of evidence and prior to deliberations, and eliminates the juror whose number is drawn. In this particular case, employing this procedure resulted in the elimination of the only African-American on the panel as the alternate juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Further review of the record reveals that the original trial judge explained this procedure on the record at the time the jury was initially seated, and that Appellant failed to object to the procedure in general at that time. Because thirteen jurors had already been seated when the visiting judge took over the case, the new judge had to continue with this jury procedure. The record further reveals that Appellant failed to object to the visiting judge employing the court's procedure at the time the alternate juror was actually eliminated just prior to deliberations. In fact, the record reveals that Appellant did not object until it was determined that the juror to be designated as the alternate was the only African-American on the jury.

The court may direct that not more than six jurors in addition to the regular jury be called and impaneled to sit as alternate jurors. Alternate jurors in the order in which they are called shall replace jurors who, prior to the time the jury retires to consider its verdict, become or are found to be unable or disqualified to perform their duties. Alternate jurors shall be drawn in the same manner, have the same qualifications, be subject to the same examination and challenges, take the same oath, and have the same functions, powers, facilities, and privileges as the regular jurors. The court may retain alternate jurors after the jury retires to deliberate. The court must ensure that a retained alternate does not discuss the case with anyone until that alternate replaces a juror or is discharged. If an alternate replaces a juror after deliberations have begun, the court must instruct the jury to begin its deliberations anew. Each party is entitled to one peremptory challenge in addition to those otherwise allowed if one or two alternate jurors are to be impaneled, two peremptory challenges if three or four alternate jurors are to be impaneled, and three peremptory challenges if five or six alternative jurors are to be impaneled. The additional peremptory challenges may be used against an alternate juror only, and the other peremptory challenges allowed by this rule may not be used against an alternate juror.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 49} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, there is no indication from the record before us that Appellant's trial counsel joined in or adopted the motions. Thus, Appellant's pro se motions were not properly before the court.\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. As set forth above, such \"hybrid representation\" is prohibited and the trial court was not permitted to entertain the motions. As such, they were properly stricken from the record. For these reasons, we find no merit to Appellant's sixth assignment of error. Accordingly, it is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR VII\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 58} In his seventh and final assignment of error, Appellant contends cumulative error committed during his trial deprived him of a fair trial and require reversal of his convictions. Under the doctrine of cumulative error, \"a conviction will be reversed where the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of the constitutional right to a fair trial even though each of [the] numerous instances of trial court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, we have found no error, plain or otherwise, that changed the outcome of the trial or that would amount to cumulative error. Accordingly, after reviewing the entirety of the proceedings below, we do not find Appellant's convictions should be reversed because of cumulative error.
