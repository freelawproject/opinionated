Concluding that the defendant's exiting the motor vehicle without being asked to do so and then looking repeatedly into the front seat area provided the police officer with reasonable suspicion to issue an exit order and conduct a patfrisk, we reverse and remand for further proceedings to consider the defendant's other ground for suppression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In reviewing a decision on a motion to suppress, we adopt the subsidiary findings of fact of the motion judge, \"which we accept absent clear error, reserving for independent review his ultimate findings and his conclusions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Charley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20223\">\n    91 Mass.

Then, in the short time of the officers' approach, he turned to \"look[ ] back into the front seat area\" on \"more than one occasion.\" This provided the officer with reason to suspect the presence of contraband within the defendant's wingspan. That the contraband could have been narcotics as easily as it could have been a weapon is of no moment for reasonable suspicion purposes. \"The officer was not required to know the exact nature of the object being concealed in order to have an objectively reasonable concern for his safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Meneide\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456694\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/448/#p452\">\n    89 Mass.

See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Greenwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3839904\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/78/611/#p616\">\n     78 Mass. App. Ct. 611\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 616 (2011). Here, however, the exit order was justified only by a reasonable suspicion of danger, and thus \"[t]he standard for a patfrisk is the same as the standard required to justify an order to the occupants of a vehicle stopped for traffic violations to leave the vehicle.\"\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837270\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/77/259/#p269\">\n     77 Mass.
