GALLAGHER, P.J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Torrance Johnson, appeals his convictions and sentence. He claims the following two errors:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Johnson's guilty plea to the amended charges was not made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, and, as a result, the court's acceptance of that plea was in violation of Johnson's constitutional rights and Crim.R. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Johnson's convictions for (1) improperly discharging a firearm into a habitation, (2) felonious assault, and (3) discharge of a firearm on or near a prohibited premises should have been merged into a single conviction on only one of those allied offenses of similar import. The trial court's failure to merge in these circumstances violated Ohio merger law and Johnson's rights to due process and against being subjected to double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} We find no merit to the appeal and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Johnson was charged with six counts of improperly discharging a firearm into a habitation, one count of having a weapon while under disability, one count of aggravated menacing, one count of receiving stolen property, four counts of felonious assault, and one count of discharging a\n   firearm on or near a prohibited premises. The discharging a firearm into a habitation and discharging a firearm on or near a prohibited premises counts included one- and three-year firearm specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The charges resulted from an incident that occurred in August 2016. Following an argument, Johnson's wife locked herself in a bathroom. Johnson, who had been drinking, took a handgun and fired two rounds above the bathroom door where his wife was hiding. Still angry, Johnson went outside and fired two more shots into the house. At the time Johnson fired the shots, his wife, children, and other relatives were present in the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Pursuant to a plea agreement, Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of discharging a firearm into a habitation with a three-year firearm specification, one count of having a weapon while under disability, one count of receiving stolen property, and one count of discharging a firearm on or near a prohibited premises. Johnson also pleaded guilty to one count of felonious assault, which was amended to change the name of the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The court sentenced Johnson to six years in prison on the discharging a firearm into a habitation conviction to be served consecutive to the three-year firearm specification on that count, for an aggregate nine-year sentence. The court also sentenced Johnson to 24 months for having a weapon while under disability, 12 months for receiving stolen property, six years for felonious assault, and 24 months for discharging of a firearm on or near a prohibited premises conviction, to be served concurrently with the nine-year sentence on the discharging a firearm into a habitation conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Johnson now appeals his convictions and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Guilty Plea\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, Johnson argues his guilty pleas should be vacated as involuntarily made because the trial court failed to ensure that he understood the factual basis for the allegations alleged in each count. Johnson also contends that despite his protestations of innocence with respect to the felonious assault charge, the trial court failed to comply with the additional requirements established in\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.

Crim.R. 11(C) sets forth certain constitutional and procedural safeguards with which the trial court must comply prior to accepting a guilty plea to ensure the voluntariness of the plea. As relevant here, Crim.R. 11(C)(2) provides that the trial court shall not accept a guilty plea in a felony case without personally addressing the defendant and doing all of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (a) Determining that the defendant is making the plea voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charges and of the maximum penalty involved, and, if applicable, that the defendant is not eligible for probation or for the imposition of community control sanctions at the sentencing hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (b) Informing the defendant of and determining that the defendant understands the effect of the plea of guilty or no contest, and that the court, upon acceptance of the plea, may proceed with judgment and sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (c) Informing the defendant and determining that the defendant understands that by the plea the defendant is waiving the rights to jury trial, to confront witnesses against him or her, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in the defendant's favor, and to require the state to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial at which the defendant cannot be compelled to testify against himself or herself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court must strictly comply with those provisions of Crim.R. 11(C)(2) that relate to the waiver of constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    State v.

If a trial court fails to substantially comply with one of the nonconstitutional aspects of Crim.R. 11(C)(2), a determination must be made as to whether the trial court partially complied or completely failed to comply the requirement at issue.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, if a defendant received the proper information during the plea colloquy, we may presume that he understood it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12532680\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/100/1247/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Johnson asserts that he did not understand the nature of the charges against him because he only had a ninth grade education and because the trial court failed to explain the elements of each offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} However, neither a detailed recitation of the elements of the charges nor an inquiry as to whether the defendant understands the elements of the charges is required unless the totality of the circumstances indicate that the defendant did not understand the charges.\n   <em>\n    State v.

He indicated that he could read and write and was not under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or medications\n   that would affect his ability to understand the proceedings. And Johnson's competency was never raised as an issue in this case. Therefore, the record is devoid of any circumstances indicating that Johnson was unable to understand the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Before explaining the charges, the court invited Johnson to ask any questions he may have during the plea proceedings. In this regard, the court instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [I]f you have any questions of me about anything I say or, perhaps a question I might ask you that you don't quite understand, let me know and I will clear it up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Likewise, if you would like to have the opportunity to speak with [your lawyer] about something in private, let me know. I will make sure that happens as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Does that sound like a plan?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Tr. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} During the colloquy, the trial court identified each charge by name with its felony classification and described the range of potential penalties associated with each charge, including the maximum penalties. (Tr. at 14-17.) The court also explained the potential aggregate sentence Johnson could receive, ensured that Johnson understood that he was forfeiting the firearm and magazine used in the crimes, and explained the terms of postrelease control. (Tr. 18.) After reviewing the charges and penalties, but before accepting Johnson's pleas, the court again asked if Johnson had any questions about anything the court had discussed up to that point in the proceedings, and Johnson replied: \"No, sir.\" Although Johnson had indicated that he understood all aspects of the proceedings, the court nevertheless inquired further:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: Do you feel that you have a complete understanding of what it is that you are pleading to, what the maximum penalties might be, and all the rights that you have that you are giving up or waiving?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The trial court discussed all the information necessary for Johnson to make an informed decision regarding his guilty pleas. Therefore, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we may presume that Johnson understood the nature of the charges to which he pleaded guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Johnson nevertheless argues that his guilty pleas should be vacated because the trial court failed to comply with the additional requirements of an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea. When a defendant makes an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea, the trial court has a duty to make further inquiries to ensure the voluntariness of his plea.\n   <em>\n    State v.

An\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea occurs when a defendant pleads guilty while simultaneously maintaining actual innocence of the charges.\n   <em>\n    Alvelo\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Johnson contends he asserted his innocence of the felonious assault charge when he told the court, moments before pleading guilty, that he was \"not trying to hurt anybody.\" The state, however, maintains that Johnson never asserted his innocence and that Johnson's statement that he did not intend to hurt anyone was an expression of regret rather than a declaration of innocence that would elicit an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   inquiry. We must, therefore, determine whether Johnson's assertion that he did not intend to hurt anyone constitutes a protestation of innocence that would give rise to an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   , the defendant stated: \"I'm not guilty, but I plead guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   at 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The United States Supreme Court determined that Alford's\n   assertion that he was not guilty was sufficient to require the trial court to inquire as to whether Alford had a rational basis for pleading guilty.

R.C. 2901.22(B) states that \"[a] person acts knowingly,\n   <em>\n    regardless of his purpose\n   </em>\n   , when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Johnson admitted that he fired gunshots into an occupied structure. Although he may not have specifically intended to hit a particular person with a bullet, he knew that by firing a gun into an occupied structure, he was creating a substantial risk that someone would be hit by a bullet. He knew that his conduct could\n   cause serious physical harm to someone. Therefore, Johnson never denied the charges; he simply expressed remorse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Padgett categorically denied the charges against him, not once, but twice. Alford's assertion of innocence was clear and unequivocal. Indeed, Alford never wavered from his claim of innocence during a subsequent hearing on his claim of innocence. Johnson asserted that he never meant to hurt anyone but admitted in the same breath that his conduct \"was wrong,\" and that he could \"not make an excuse\" for it. Moreover, Johnson never denied committing the offenses. Unlike Alford and Padgett, who never conceded guilt, Johnson admitted that he committed the crimes and took full responsibility for them. We agree with the state that Johnson's remark that he did not mean to hurt anyone was an expression of remorse rather than an affirmative declaration of innocence and was, therefore, insufficient to trigger an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The fact that the state purported to name an individual as the victim of the discharging into a habitation crime, as demonstrated from the inclusion of separate charges for discharging into a habitation each naming a different occupant, is noteworthy. The problem with the state's position is that not all crimes are committed against identifiable victims. The discharging into a habitation statute punishes an individual for discharging a firearm into a habitation to prevent the victimization of those possibly present. It is for this reason that the crime is deemed committed against the habitation. Likewise, discharging a firearm over a road reflects the legislative attempt to prevent\n   motorists from being harmed. Therefore, and setting aside the issue of multiple shots being fired for the sake of this discussion, discharging a firearm into a single habitation with multiple people present cannot lead to multiple convictions for that act-although it could possibly lead to multiple convictions for felonious assault of those inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 38} The state's charging instrument in this case emphasizes the importance of recognizing that there is no need to resort to\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   as the only mechanism to analyze allied-offense issues.\n   <em>\n    State v.
