We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On September 12, 2016, Newton was indicted for two counts of rape, two counts of gross sexual imposition, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of sexual battery. The case proceeded to a bench trial and during the testimony of the alleged victim, J.E., it was revealed that the investigating detective assigned to the case, Jessica Page, had lost or destroyed a relevant diagram drawn by J.E. during a recorded interview. Upon examination, Page lied in an attempt to conceal her role in the matter. After the testimony of J.E., Page and a second detective involved in the case concluded, the trial court granted a motion to dismiss the case that was made by the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Our review here is limited to the issue as to whether the trial court erred in granting Newton's motion to dismiss and dismissing the case with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 2015, J.E. alleged that Newton sexually assaulted her twice in 2013 in an equipment room at Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio during the spring of her eighth grade year. J.E. described the alleged incidents at trial as follows: J.E. was a pitcher on a school softball team coached by Newton. During the second half of April, 2013 the team was practicing indoors in the \"big gym\" at Laurel. Newton approached J.E. and asked her to accompany him, alone, to a separate, smaller gym in the school for pitching practice. Newton and J.E. left the big gym and stopped at the \"equipment room\" located in a hallway between the two gyms. Newton opened the door to the equipment room and J.E. entered for the purpose of retrieving a bucket of balls located inside to be used for pitching practice. After J.E. entered, Newton closed the door behind them, approached J.E. and ran his hands underneath J.E.'s shorts and underwear, rubbing her vagina. When the incident ended, Newton apologized and J.E. exited the room and returned to practice in the big gym with her teammates. She did not tell anyone about what had happened. J.E. testified that she had accompanied Newton alone to pitching practice in the small gym several times during the next two weeks and nothing untoward had occurred at those times. J.E. further testified that approximately two weeks after the first incident in May 2013, a second incident occurred in a virtually identical fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Detective Jessica Page of the Shaker Heights Police Department was assigned to the case and conducted a recorded interview with J.E. on March 23, 2015, during which J.E. described the equipment room, later identified as room G0003, as containing shelves, bats, helmets and soccer balls. Later in the interview, J.E. noted that the room was an art room for a\n   period of time while the school was being renovated. J.E. drew a diagram of the school that set forth the relevant rooms including the equipment room. Page took the diagram and entered it into their file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Detective Page admitted at trial that she described herself as J.E.'s \"advocate\" and made a number of statements during the first interview that the state concedes were inappropriate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1) She described J.E.'s suggestion that Newton should be killed as an \"appropriate response\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2) I'll do whatever my victim wants me to do;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3) I like sending people to prison though, don't get me wrong. So I will be here and I'll walk with you through the whole thing and I'll fight as hard as I can and I'll get as much evidence as I can * * * and I'll try and find everything I can find to help you;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   4) You are not a bad witness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   5) You're putting the truth about what happened to yourself out there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   6) \"Once someone is accused of being a sexual impositionist or someone who touches you know young ladies and takes advantage of their trust theres (sic) no going back from that whether you're convicted or not.\" Referencing Michael Jackson, Page stated, \"the first thing that's gonna come up when you google his name is Mark Newton tried as [an] essentially rapist.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After reviewing the recording of the first interview, Detective Page noticed that J.E. whispered something into her sleeve during a brief period when Page was out of the room. Page asked another Shaker Heights detective, Detective Walter Siegel, to review the video of the interview. Detective Siegel testified at trial that he listened to the relevant segment repeatedly and believed that J.E. whispered \"I don't think she has the room right\" in reference to the diagram created during the first interview. Based on this discrepancy, Detectives Page and Siegel conducted a joint interview with J.E. on April 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} During the second interview, J.E. denied making such a statement and the detectives questioned J.E. about her description of the equipment room. J.E. drew a second diagram featuring only the equipment room and circled the locations inside the room where the softballs were stored. It is impossible to discern from the video of the second interview where on the diagram J.E. placed the buckets of softballs. J.E. also described the room as musty, smelling of dust and containing catcher's equipment. J.E. contradicted this description at trial, testifying that the catcher's equipment had been in the room during a previous year and was not present at the time of the incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After the video of the second interview was played during the cross-examination of J.E., the trial court held a sidebar to address the second diagram. J.E. was excused from the courtroom and it was established that, prior to trial, Newton's counsel had requested that the state turn over the second diagram in discovery. The prosecutor explained that she had been informed by Detectives Page and Siegel that there was no second diagram.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} To address this discrepancy, the trial court allowed the parties to examine Detective Page. Page admitted that J.E. drew a second diagram during her second recorded interview and that she did not turn the diagram over to the prosecutor or Newton's counsel. Page testified that she did not know where the second diagram was, that she did not destroy it and that she did not think she had lost it but it might have been \"shredded.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Page was examined extensively about why the lost diagram had not been brought to the attention of the prosecutor or defense prior to trial. Page initially lied to the trial court, stating that she informed the prosecutor the week before trial that she believed there was a second diagram but that she could not find it. Upon further examination, however, Page admitted that she did not tell the prosecutor about the second diagram. According to Page, she did not remember the second diagram being created until the prosecutor contacted her about the defense's discovery request. At that point she informed the prosecutor and Detective Siegel that there was no second diagram. She subsequently reviewed the video from J.E.'s second interview and learned that a second diagram had been created. After she was unable to locate the diagram in her case file or desk, she chose not to inform Detective Siegel or the prosecutor of its existence prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Page admitted that she knew that the diagram contained information that could potentially be exculpatory for Newton. This was supported by the fact that Newton filed a notice of alibi prior to trial asserting that it was impossible for the alleged offenses to have occurred in the \"equipment room\" as claimed by J.E. because during the relevant time period that room was being used as an art storage room. Newton's notice of alibi noted his intent to present witnesses who would establish that the room did not contain any athletic equipment during that time, in contrast to J.E.'s allegations. Instead, Newton's attorney intended to establish that the room contained artwork and art tables. Page also conceded that J.E. had testified at trial that the softballs were lined up only along the side of a particular wall but in the video from the second interview J.E. appeared to draw the balls \"all over the place.\" Aside from being inconsistent with J.E.'s trial testimony, such placement of the balls may have been inconsistent with the location of any art tables the defense intended to establish had been in the room. The precise locations of the balls in the second diagram could not be ascertained from the video of the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Following the examination of Detective Page, Newton's trial counsel moved to dismiss the charges against him due to the destruction of evidence. The trial court held its ruling on the motion in abeyance until the testimony of J.E. and Detectives Siegel and Page had been completed in order to determine if Newton's counsel could fairly cross-examine the witnesses about the contents of the missing diagram. During her cross-examination, J.E. denied drawing the location of the balls in a manner inconsistent with her prior testimony but conceded that the details of the diagram could not be discerned from the video of her second interview. J.E. admitted that the trial court would just have to take her word for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} After the conclusion of the testimony of J.E. and the two detectives, the trial court revisited Newton's motion to dismiss. After hearing arguments from the parties, the court issued a written decision dismissing the charges against Newton with prejudice. The court found that Detective Page concealed, suppressed or destroyed materially exculpatory evidence in bad faith. The court stated that it had considered lessor sanctions short of dismissal but concluded that \"no lesser sanction could ever be appropriate under the facts of this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I.
