For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant sets forth the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court erred in denying the Motion for Summary Judgment of Plaintiff-Appellant, Aquatic Renovation Systems, Inc., as to Plaintiff-Appellant's claims against the Defendant-Appellee, Village of Walbridge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} This case concerns the validity of an agreement between appellee, village of Walbridge (\"the village\"), and appellant for a new liner for the village's swimming pool (\"the pool\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 18, 2012, the village council adopted an ordinance which authorized the village's mayor to enter into an agreement\n   with appellant for a new liner for the pool in the sum of $52,720.08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On May 2, 2012, a Contract Agreement Form between the village and appellant was signed by Edward Kolanko, the acting mayor of the village, and a representative of appellant and witnessed by Janice Sawaya, of the village, and another person. The contract provided for the installation of a new liner for the pool in the sum of $52,720.08, with the work to be substantially completed by May 21, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On May 9, 2012, before appellant began work on the pool, the village had an engineer conduct a preliminary evaluation of the condition of the pool. An engineering field service report, completed on that day, stated the pool was in need of significant maintenance and repairs, which needed to be undertaken before the liner was installed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On May 25, 2012, Kenneth Frost, the village's administrator, wrote to appellant's representative indicating appellant's work on the pool could not be completed by May 21, 2012, through no fault of appellant, but the village wanted to go forward with the project after the pool was inspected and repaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On June 1, 2012, appellant submitted to the village an application and certificate for payment of $15,763.30, for liner material as well as work for design and submittals, less eight percent retainage. On July 16, 2012, the village issued a check to appellant for $15,763.30. Thereafter, the village had repairs to the pool completed; appellant was not involved in the repair work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On April 8, 2013, appellant submitted a quotation to the village for installation of the pool liner for the balance due of $36,956.78. Mayor Kolanko signed and initialed the quotation on April 12, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On June 13, 2013, a change order submitted by appellant to the village in the amount of $3,142.60 was signed by Frost, for the village. The order was also signed by a representative of appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On June 28, 2013, the mayor and appellant's representative conducted a walk-through of the work appellant had performed. Mayor Kolanko and a representative of appellant signed a New Installation, Multi-Division Work Order Form, which set forth that appellant arrived at the pool on June 4, 2013, and completed work on the pool on June 28, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On July 3, 2013, Frost notified appellant that the liner had lifted away from the walls and floor of the pool due to a water leak. Appellant sent a representative to the pool to address the issue. The representative surmised part of the problem was a leaking pipe. Appellant provided a pump to the village to remove the water from the liner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In the fall of 2013, appellant's representative suggested to Frost that a pressure test should be performed. The test was undertaken and the result was \"unable to achieve pressure.\" Appellant's representative informed Frost of the test result and made other suggestions to resolve the issue, to no avail. Appellant requested payment from the village for the completed and approved work, but the village refused to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On January 15, 2016, appellant filed its complaint against the village setting forth three causes of action. Appellant alleged it entered into two contracts with the village: the first contract was dated May 2, 2012 (\"first contract\"), and the second contract was dated April 12, 2013 (\"second contract\"). Appellant alleged in its first cause of action that the village breached the second contract, and sought damages in the amount of $36,956.78. Appellant alleged in its second cause of action\n   that the village was liable to it under the legal theory of quantum meruit. In its third cause of action, appellant alleged the village received a benefit as a result of the work appellant performed, thus the village was liable to appellant for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On March 24, 2016, the village filed its answer as well as a counterclaim for breach of contract by appellant. In the answer, the village admitted the parties entered into the first contract, but denied there was a second contract between the parties. In the counterclaim, the village alleged the parties entered into the first contract, and appellant breached that contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On October 28, 2016, appellant filed a motion for summary judgment on its claims and the village's counterclaim. On November 14, 2016, the village filed a motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim as well as appellant's claims. Appellant responded to the village's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On May 15, 2017, the trial court issued its judgment, finding neither the first contract nor the second contract constituted a valid contract as neither agreement complied with the statutory law. The court further found appellant was not entitled to recover under the theory of quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The court granted summary judgment to the village on appellant's claims, and granted summary judgment to appellant on the village's counterclaim. Appellant appealed the court's decision to grant summary judgment to the village on appellant's claims. The village did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We review a trial court's summary judgment decision on a de novo basis.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Appellant also contended Indiana law governed the second contract. Appellant asserted, however, under either Indiana or Ohio law, the second contract was valid and the village breached the second contract causing appellant's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The village countered it entered into one binding contract with appellant-the first contract. The village maintained the second contract was a quotation solely for the purpose of acknowledging the contract price of $52,750 and that the village already paid appellant $15,763.30. The village submitted it never intended for the second contract to be a new contract or to extinguish the first contract. The village asserted the first contract was authorized by village council pursuant to Ordinance 10-12. The village argued appellant's argument\n   that the mayor entered into the second contract with appellant is misplaced because under R.C. 731.14, village contracts must be signed by the village mayor and the clerk, and under R.C. 731.141, village contracts must be signed by the village administrator and the clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In reply, appellant argued the village's contention that the second contract was not properly executed was raised for the first time in the village's summary judgment motion and not as an affirmative defense in its answer, and it is misguided. Appellant reasoned if the village's argument that the second contract is not valid due to noncompliance with the statutory law, then the first contract would also have no effect because the statutory law was not followed. Appellant insisted the enforcement of the second contract is consistent with the statutory law and the codified ordinances of the village. Appellant observed Ordinance 10-12 authorized the mayor of the village to enter into an agreement with appellant to install a pool liner. Appellant noted although the village had a village administrator prior to the first contract, the administrator did not sign the first contract, only the mayor signed it. Appellant further contended the village ratified the second contract, and even if the second contract was void, it was made in good faith and appellant incurred considerable expenses, thus appellant is entitled to recover payment for services rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellant's First Cause of Action-Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 22} \"In order to declare the existence of a contract, both parties to the contract must consent to its terms; there must be a meeting of the minds of both parties; and the contract must be definite and certain.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Episcopal Retirement Homes, Inc. v.

Appellant argued R.C. 731.14 does not require the village to exercise its legislative authority to execute a contract by ordinance. Appellant further argued although the village had an administrator, the ordinance granted authority to the mayor to enter into an agreement with appellant. Appellant asserted an ambiguity was created in the ordinance's enactment, but the purpose and effect of the ordinance was carried out by the village and the mayor. Appellant claimed specific sections of the Codified Ordinances of the\n   village of Walbridge governed construction of the village's ordinances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Upon review, it is undisputed that at all times relevant, the village had a village administrator. It is further undisputed that the second contract was only signed by the mayor; it was not signed by the village administrator or the clerk. As such, we conclude R.C. 731.14 does not apply. We must now determine whether R.C. 731.141 and/or Ordinance 10-12 apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 34} R.C. 1.51 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 35} At the outset, we note the specific sections of the Codified Ordinances of the village of Walbridge upon which appellant relied are modeled after the rules of construction set forth in the Ohio Revised Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Upon review, the general provision, R.C. 731.141, does not conflict with the specific or local provision, Ordinance 10-12. The ordinance granted authority to the mayor to enter into an agreement with appellant, but did not specify the steps necessary to ensure the formation of a valid contract. The statute, however, required that all village contracts must be signed by the village administrator and the clerk. Compliance with the ordinance does not preclude compliance with the statute. Thus, the statute and ordinance can operate concurrently, and both apply. Since the second contract was not signed by the village administrator and the clerk, it did not comply with R.C. 731.141. We therefore find the second contract is not valid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Toledo v. Corr. Comm. of Northwest Ohio\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

Appellant suggested that the village ratified the second contract because the village, in its motion for summary judgment, set forth that the second contract was \"simply a confirmation of a different textured liner.\" Appellant claims this sentence is conclusive proof that the second contract was intended to and did substitute the terms of the first contract.
