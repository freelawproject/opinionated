L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    h\n   </em>\n   ). In this consolidated appeal, the defendant contends the Commonwealth failed to establish that he did not possess a valid FID card and, further, that the posttrial motion judge (who was also the trial judge) erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress the firearm and ammunition evidence on the grounds that the police violated the knock and announce rule.

[that] such ineffectiveness has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available substantial defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Seino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12552435\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/96/149/\">\n    479 Mass. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472 n.12 (2018), citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96-97 (1974). When a defendant bases his ineffective assistance claim on the failure to file an evidentiary motion, the proper question is whether filing the motion \"might have accomplished something material for the defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802523\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/693/\">\n    473 Mass. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 703 n.10 (2016), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Satterfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"324020\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/373/109/#p115\">\n    373 Mass. 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115 (1977). Failure to pursue a futile motion is not ineffective assistance of counsel. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vieux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1038712\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/41/526/#p527\">\n    41 Mass.

Since the defendant brought his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a motion for a new trial, we review the judge's decision for a significant error of law or for an abuse of discretion. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brescia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4319608\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/381/#p392\">\n    471 Mass. 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Here, trial counsel had no reason to believe that suppression of the firearm and ammunition on the basis of a violation of the knock and announce requirement would have had any chance of success. Even after extensive postconviction discovery, the only evidence that points to a violation of the knock and announce rule is the defendant's own self-serving affidavit, which the motion judge was free to reject. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pingaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772152\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/41/#p48\">\n    44 Mass. App. Ct. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48-49 (1997) (judge free to disregard self-serving affidavits). All other evidence suggests that the \"SWAT\" team executing the search warrant complied with the knock and announce requirement. The officers swore out affidavits explaining that an unannounced entry could cause a drug or contraband dealer to suspect attack or theft by a rival dealer and would place them in greater danger of attack. For that reason, the officers explained their additional preference for adhering to a knock and announce protocol. They had no reason to believe they departed from that command and safety protocol here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a futile motion, and we discern no abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Judgments affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying motion for new trial affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The jury acquitted the defendant of possessing another firearm without a license, possessing that firearm without an FID card, and accessory to a felony after the fact.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Contrary to the defendant's assertion, the witnesses' trial testimony does not contradict these claims.
