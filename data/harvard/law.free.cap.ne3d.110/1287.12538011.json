GALLAGHER, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, city of South Euclid (\"the City\"), appeals the decision of the South Euclid Municipal Court to grant the pretrial dismissal of two cases alleging criminal trespass against appellee, Charles A. Turner, upon his motion to dismiss. Upon review, we reverse the decision of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In each of the two underlying cases, S.Euclid M.C. Nos. CRB 1600738 and CRB 1700174, Turner was charged with criminal trespassing in violation of South Euclid Codified Ordinances (\"SECO\") Section 541.05(a)(4) and R.C. 2911.21(A)(3), respectively. The charges arose from incidents occurring on December 20, 2016, and March 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The trial court's opinion set forth the underlying facts as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 20, 2016, Defendant Turner stood in the parking lot of the South Euclid Municipal Complex next to a vehicle bearing a raised hood with a sign, wedged between the vehicle body and (raised) hood which read: \"Mayor Welo Supports Police Brutality By Police Chief. Off. McCann &amp; Others.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 7, 2017, Defendant Turner appeared in the lobby of the South Euclid Municipal Complex with a sign hanging from a string around his neck which read: \"Mayor Welo Supports Brutality By Police Chief.\" In each instance, Defendant Turner was criminally charged with violating South Euclid Trespassing Codified Ordinance 541.05(a)(4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Prosecution contends and Defense does not dispute that prior to the December 20, 2016 incident, representatives from the City of South Euclid posted what the Prosecution has referred to as \"Mayor Welo's Rules and Regulations.\" Said \"rules\" provided the basis for the Trespassing charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The \"rules\" state in part:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The South Euclid Municipal Center includes the interior walkways, corridors, lobby [and] parking lot,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Said buildings are restricted to those individuals or groups who have legitimate business dealings with the City of South Euclid and/or who have previously been issued a permit to use said buildings. No person or persons without prior approval of the Mayor and/or Safety Director or his or her designee shall do any of the following in the South Euclid Municipal Center, Community Center or Service Department... Conduct any protests, demonstrations, carry or possess any type of sign, posted, notice or plaque... Failure to cease and desist and vacate the premises when asked to do so by [a] law enforcement officer may result in the imposition of criminal charges. The issuance of a permit to use any of the Municipal Center or Community Center shall not be basis [sic] on or influenced by race, color, creed, religion, gender, age, disability status, sexual orientation, national origin or political affiliation. Effective this 15th day of December 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Turner filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the charge in each case. He argued that under the facts of the case, the criminal trespassing ordinance and statute were unconstitutional \"as applied\" to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court found \"[b]ased upon the facts as agreed to by the Prosecution and Defense, 'Mayor Welo's Rules and Regulations' is unconstitutional both\n   on its face and as applied.\" The court determined that \" 'Mayor Welo's Rules and Regulations violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution\" and granted the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The City filed this appeal pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A). Under its first assignment of error, the City argues that the motion to dismiss should have been denied because it raised matters that were not capable of determination without a trial on the general issue. We agree and find that the trial court erred in dismissing the underlying cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 7} We review the decision to dismiss an indictment de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nor is this a case where the motion to dismiss\n   did not embrace what would be a general issue at trial, but rather challenged an ability to defend the case and the right to receive a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3839177\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/119/375/\">\n    119 Ohio St.3d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-4493\">\n    2008-Ohio-4493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=894%20N.E.2d%20671\">\n    894 N.E.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18 (finding the motion did not embrace what would be the general issue at trial, but instead \"it alleged that the FBI's enforcement of federal child pornography laws against his expert compromised his constitutional right to a fair trial by restricting the expert's ability to perform tasks deemed necessary to Brady's defense.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Rather, this case is analogous to\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Kalman\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was charged with criminal trespass for entering a restricted area in a courthouse and surrounding premises to place protest stickers on a directory after he was given notice that he was no longer permitted to return to the site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-9. Kalman filed a pretrial motion to dismiss, arguing that he had a privilege to be on the ramp and the stairs immediately below the directory because the area was a public forum open to free expression of speech.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. The trial court denied the motion, and appellant was convicted of the charge following a bench trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. On appeal, Kalman argued that enforcement of the criminal trespass statute violated his right to free speech under the United States and Ohio Constitutions, while the state argued that Kalman did not have a \"privilege\" to be within the restricted area under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. The appellate court noted that it was inappropriate for the trial court to consider the issue via a pretrial motion to dismiss because the determination required consideration of a general issue for trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11, fn. 1. The concurring opinion elaborated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Crim. R. 12(C) provides for filing a motion to dismiss only where it addresses a defense or issue that is \"capable of determination without a trial of the general issue.\" Here, the issue of whether Kalman had a privilege, constitutional or otherwise, to be at the specific location was central to deciding the ultimate issue of criminal trespass. In essence, Kalman's pretrial motion to dismiss was a motion for summary judgment, which the criminal rules do not authorize. See Katz &amp; Giannelli, Baldwin's Ohio Practice, Criminal Law (3rd ed.), \u00a7 47:4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Kalman had two choices to put the issue of privilege before the court: 1) go to trial and make a Crim. R. 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal or 2) enter into a stipulation of facts and submit the case to the court on written memoranda. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

Similar to this case, in\n   <em>\n    Gaines\n   </em>\n   the record revealed that the trial court violated Crim.R. 12(C) where its \"decision dismissing the indictments clearly shows that the trial court considered the alleged facts of the case and applied Ohio and federal cases to the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.

Accordingly, the trial court erred by prematurely considering a general issue for trial and in granting Turner's motion to dismiss. We are not persuaded by Turner's argument that the case should be dismissed in the interests of justice pursuant to the court's plenary authority under Crim.R. 48(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The first assignment of error is well taken.
