For the reasons that follow, we reverse, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 12, 2013, Ms. Matus had lunch with friends at a restaurant operated by The Jacts Group in a building constructed by Golden Dawn. Upon leaving the restaurant, Ms. Matus was injured when she fell walking from an elevated area to the ground level of the restaurant near a single riser stair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Ms. Matus thereafter filed a complaint against The Jacts Group and Golden Dawn on March 11, 2015. Ms. Matus' deposition was conducted and a site inspection of the restaurant took place, however, Ms. Matus voluntarily dismissed the case on February 19, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Ms. Matus re-filed her complaint against The Jacts Group and Golden Dawn Enterprises, asserting claims of negligence against the defendants on February 15, 2017. On March 23, 2017, the trial court ordered that all discovery conducted in the previous case would apply in the present matter. Thereafter, The Jacts Group and Golden Dawn filed a joint motion for summary judgment on April 10, 2017. On May 24, 2017, Matus filed a motion for leave of court to amend her complaint and a motion for an order that requests for admission one through six directed to The Jacts Group and Golden Dawn be deemed admitted. Ms. Matus filed a response to the motion for summary judgment on June 2, 2017. The trial court ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of The Jacts Group and Golden Dawn. The trial court did not expressly rule upon Ms. Matus' motions for leave to amend her complaint or for an order that requests for admission one through six directed to The Jacts Group and Golden Dawn be deemed admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Ms. Matus filed this timely appeal, raising three assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    The lower court erred when it granted summary judgments for the appellees.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In her first assignment of error, Ms. Matus contends that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of The Jacts Group and Golden Dawn. For the following reasons, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In their motion for summary judgment, The Jacts Group and Golden Dawn argued that Ms. Matus' claim failed as a matter of law because she had already traversed the step at issue or, in the alternative, because the step constituted an open and obvious condition. Under Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriate when:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1)[no] genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for\n   summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Temple v.

In support of their claims, The Jacts Group and Golden Dawn heavily relied on statements Ms. Matus made during her deposition. However, a review of the record shows that Ms. Matus' deposition was never filed in this case nor was it attached as an exhibit to either of the parties' motions below. Further, neither party has attempted to supplement the record on appeal to include Ms. Matus' deposition. Consequently, although the record does contain photographs of the step at issue and the deposition testimony of a woman familiar with the step, it is devoid of any deposition testimony from Ms. Matus regarding her ability to appreciate the danger of the step at the time of the incident. As stated above, the existence of attendant circumstances, or lack thereof, is considered as part of the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether a reasonable person would have discovered the danger of the step.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gardner\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.

In response, Ms. Matus argued that\n   <em>\n    Raflo\n   </em>\n   was inapplicable because it was decided during a time when Ohio law recognized contributory negligence as a complete bar to a plaintiff's tort claim. Nonetheless, a review of the trial court's judgment entry shows a lack of any analysis on the issue of whether Ms. Matus was or was not charged with the knowledge of the presence of the abnormality of the step at issue due to her having previously traversed the step.
