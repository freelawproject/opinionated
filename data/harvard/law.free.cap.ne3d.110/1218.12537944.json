Wolff. Richard Wolff died on January 16, 2016, shortly before judgment entered in the Probate and Family Court, and Ruth Wolff, in her capacity as personal representative of his estate, was substituted as the defendant for purposes of this appeal.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   This appeal arising out of the Probate and Family Court concerns alimony and life insurance provisions contained in a surviving separation agreement executed by former spouses, Richard Wolff (husband) and Janice Wolff (wife). The wife principally challenges (1) the amount of alimony overpayments she is required to repay to the husband, and (2) the termination of the husband's obligation to maintain life insurance. We affirm in part and vacate in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The parties were divorced in 1986 pursuant to a judgment of divorce nisi (divorce judgment) incorporating their surviving separation agreement. The separation agreement required the husband (1) to pay monthly alimony to the wife of $1,350, which amount would eventually be reduced by the wife's Social Security benefits when she turned sixty-eight;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) to maintain a $100,000 insurance policy on his life, naming the wife as beneficiary thereof. The separation agreement provided that the husband's alimony and life insurance obligations would both terminate in the same manner: upon the wife's death, remarriage, or cohabitation \"with an unrelated adult male in the style of a marriage\" for at least two years. If the husband failed to maintain the life insurance coverage required by the separation agreement, the wife would \"have a first lien and claim against the assets of the [h]usband and against his estate.\" However, the wife would \"have no right with respect to the assets of the estate of the [h]usband\" if the husband's obligation to maintain life insurance \"terminate[d] in accordance with the [a]greement\" prior to his death. With the exception of the alimony provisions, which were modifiable \"by order of the [c]ourt\" if the husband became \"totally disabled,\" the separation agreement could only be modified pursuant to \"an instrument signed and acknowledged\" by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On October 3, 2014, the wife filed a complaint for contempt alleging the husband had failed to maintain the life insurance coverage required by the separation agreement. On November 6, 2014, the husband filed a complaint for modification seeking to terminate his alimony and life insurance obligations on the basis that he was \"totally disabled,\" his previous life insurance policies had expired, and he was unable to obtain new life insurance due to his \"heart condition.\" On February 5, 2015, the husband filed a complaint in equity seeking reimbursement from the wife for his alleged overpayment of alimony between March of 2001 and September of 2014. The husband claimed the wife failed to provide him with accurate information regarding her Social Security benefits when she turned sixty-eight, resulting in total overpayments of $48,713.80. In her answer to the husband's complaint in equity, the wife admitted the husband had overpaid alimony but disputed the amount of overpayments, asserting the husband only overpaid by $42,004 between March of 2001 and September of 2014. The wife further asserted that, between 1986 and 2000, the husband had underpaid alimony by approximately $7,240. The wife also filed a counterclaim in equity, asserting the husband's life insurance obligation was not modifiable and requesting that the husband be required to place $100,000 in escrow, payable to the wife in the event he predeceased her. The contempt, modification, and equity matters were subsequently consolidated by the Probate and Family Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On March 4, 2015, the husband filed a motion for summary judgment on his complaint in equity, which the wife opposed. Following a hearing on March 20, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   a judge of the Probate and Family Court allowed the husband's motion for summary judgment and entered a partial judgment finding the husband had overpaid alimony in the amount of $48,713.80 between March of 2001 and September of 2014. The remaining matters, including the wife's complaint for contempt, the husband's complaint for modification, and the wife's counterclaim in equity, were scheduled for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A one-day trial was held on September 17, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 16, 2016, approximately four months after the trial concluded, the husband died. On January 28, 2016, the judge issued a final judgment (1) terminating the husband's alimony and life insurance obligations retroactive to November 13, 2014, the date of service of the husband's complaint for modification, and (2) requiring the wife to reimburse the husband in the amount of $48,713.80 by June 1, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge found the husband to be \"totally disabled,\" thus warranting modification of his alimony obligation in accordance with the separation agreement. The judge further found the husband had \"proven ... something more than a substantial change in circumstances\" sufficient to modify his life insurance obligation. The judge specifically found the husband's life insurance policies with \"Hutton and CNA\" expired when he attained the age of seventy and one-half years, and \"due to his health conditions[,] he is unable to pass a physical exam or qualify for new insurance.\" The judge expressly rejected the wife's claim that the husband's life insurance obligation was part of the property settlement, instead finding the life insurance was intended \"to secure the payment of [the husband's] alimony obligation.\" The judge concluded the husband had \"no continuing obligation to provide insurance\" once his alimony obligation terminated, and the wife \"suffered no harm from his failure to maintain insurance since his obligation was terminated while he was still alive.\" The present appeal by the wife followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

Here, the judge entered summary judgment in the husband's favor, finding he had overpaid alimony in the amount of $48,713.80 between March of 2001 and September of 2014. The judge noted that although the wife sought \"offsets for amounts that she claims were underpaid prior to 2001, and claim[ed] that the [h]usband did not make all of his support payments between 2001 and 2014, she has not filed any [c]omplaints addressing those issues.\" We cannot fault the judge for declining to consider evidence of any alleged underpayments made prior to March of 2001, as the wife did not file a complaint seeking to recoup those amounts, and the husband's complaint in equity only sought reimbursement for overpayments made after March of 2001. That said, the precise alimony overpayment figure found by the judge of $48,713.80 was clearly erroneous as it included payments made by the husband prior to March of 2001. See Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 52(a) (\"Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\");\n   <em>\n    Millennium Equity Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mahlowitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668956\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/627/#p636\">\n    456 Mass. 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636-637 (2010) (finding is \"clearly erroneous\" where it leaves reviewing court with \"a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\" [quotation omitted] ).

Because the separation agreement expressly provides for the termination of life insurance under certain circumstances, the husband's obligation to maintain life insurance is, in essence, subject to modification.

However, the wife points to no evidence in the record, nor are we aware of any, establishing that the husband was able to obtain life insurance at the time of the trial in September of 2015. Indeed, the judge's findings and the record evidence suggest otherwise, given that the husband was eighty-two years old, suffered from \"multiple physical issues that impact[ed] his daily ability to function,\" and required \"a feeding tube to eat, drink and take his medication.\" Moreover, the judge's finding that the husband was unable to qualify for life insurance was based on her assessment of his credibility -- a finding that \"is close to immune from reversal on appeal except on the most compelling of showings.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnston\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022431\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/38/531/#p536\">\n    38 Mass.
