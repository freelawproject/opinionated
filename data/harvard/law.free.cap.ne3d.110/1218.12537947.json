After review, we conclude that the defendant already received credit for the time he served and that awarding him additional jail credit would be \"double counting\" and inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On August 5, 2010, the defendant was arraigned on four charges of rape of a child. He was held on bail and on October 14, 2010, pleaded guilty to three of those charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On one count, the defendant received a sentence of two and one-half years in the house of correction, committed, with credit for 167 days spent in custody before the plea. On the remaining two counts, he received a sentence of no less than two and no more than ten years in State prison, suspended for three years of probation, with certain conditions, the probation to begin \"from and after\" the committed portion of his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant was charged three times with violations of the terms of his probation. Each time, he initially was held without bail pending a final hearing, but was then placed back on probation. Finally, on February 27, 2014, he was \"brought into court from District Court on new charges.\" The judge found probable cause that the defendant had committed a probation violation, specifically a new criminal offense, and held him without bail. On September 24, 2014, after a hearing, the judge found that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation by committing a new offense and sentenced him to the suspended sentence. At that time, he was given credit for 233 days, deemed already served, awaiting the various violation hearings while he was on probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   That new criminal charge -- the one that triggered the probation violation hearing -- is the case before us. On March 24, 2014, while already in custody on the probation case, the defendant was indicted on a new, unrelated charge of rape. On March 2, 2015, he pleaded guilty in that case, and was sentenced to four to six years in State prison (with no jail credits), that sentence to run concurrently with the revocation sentence he was already serving. Notably, this new sentence was not \"ordered or required to commence on the same date as the [revocation] sentence[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3832759\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/74/912/#p914\">\n    74 Mass. App. Ct. 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 914 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 18, 2017, the defendant, acting pro se, brought a motion to correct the mittimus in this case to reflect 388 days of pretrial detention he spent awaiting trial. On August 4, 2017, the motion judge denied the motion, concluding that the defendant was \"entitled to no jail credits\" in the present case because \"the entire period of his detention, up to his sentencing in [the present] case, was credited to his revocation sentence.\" On appeal, the defendant claims this was error because, in fact, he was in custody for all of the time between his arraignment and the time that he pleaded guilty in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant is correct that he was held on this case for all of that time. The docket sheet shows that bail was set at $100,000 at the time of his arraignment and remained at that amount until the time of the plea. However, for all of the time between the defendant's arraignment on this case and the time of his plea, he also was held on his open probation case, either before the violation hearing or afterwards, when he was serving his sentence after being found in violation of the terms of his probation for the new offense. The motion judge so found, saying \"the entire period of his detention, up to his sentencing in [the rape] case, was credited to his revocation sentence. The defendant is not entitled to double counting of jail credits. As the Supreme Judicial Court has stated: 'care should be taken to ensure that a prisoner is not banking time or getting double credit for time.'

In his order, the judge found that the defendant was held in custody beginning on February 7, 2014. Again, although the record before us is not entirely clear, it is likely that any\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    discrepancy is accounted for by time that the defendant was held on District Court bail before he appeared in Superior Court. It is true that the probation violation for which the defendant was sentenced was, in fact, the new offense that is the case before us. Nonetheless, in the end, the two cases involve separate, unrelated, though similar, serious criminal offenses, separated in time. It is neither inappropriate nor unfair for the defendant to serve the two sentences separately -- although, in fact, the judge in the present case ordered the second sentence to run concurrently with the probation violation sentence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
