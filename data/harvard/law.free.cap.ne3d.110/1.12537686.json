Blanton, Jr., appeals the judgment entry on sentence filed November 9, 2016 in the Adams County Court of Common Pleas. Blanton was convicted by a jury on three counts: (1) kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(B) (2) ; (2) felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A) (1) ; and (3) assault, in violation of\n   R.C. 2903.13(A). On appeal, Blanton asserts eight assignments of error. However, having fully reviewed the record, we find no merit to the arguments raised in the eight assignments of error. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant's assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant's convictions arise subsequent to his involvement in jail fights which occurred at the Adams County Jail during the month of June 2016. Appellee has indicated in its brief that Appellee agrees with the statement of the case and statement of facts as set forth in Appellant's brief. Therefore, we relate the facts as set forth in Appellant's brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant, an 18-year-old male, was confined in cell block E4 of the Adams County Jail in June 2016, awaiting trial in another matter, along with inmates Gary Lunsford, Robert Long, Mark Mefford, Josh Gray, Zachary McKee, and Devon Michaels. The security and surveillance system at the Adams County Jail consists of a \"catwalk,\" a hallway between the exterior wall of the building and the housing units; a video camera at each end of the catwalk to capture images of activities in the main area of the cell block; and a \"call box.\" The inmates engaged in \"rough-housing\" and \"horseplay,\" which Appellant attributes to a lack of supervision by jail personnel. The inmates harassed each other with \"towel-snapping\" and organized \"fighting\" for entertainment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In mid-June, Lieutenant Micah Poe, the jail administrator, began noticing that the inmates were coming out of the cell with injuries. Inmates Gary Lunsford, Josh Gray, and Mark Mefford were observed with bruising. Lunsford was noted to have visible injuries to his head, stomach, and back, so he was referred for treatment at Adams County Hospital, and an investigation of the matter was initiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After taking statements from the inmates, Poe recommended the filing of criminal charges against McKee, Michaels, and Appellant. On July 8, 2016, an Adams County Grand Jury indicted Appellant for several felony offenses allegedly occurring during this period of time. The indictment contained five counts which alleged as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Count 1: On or about June 5 and June 17, 2016 in Adams County Ohio Denny Blanton Jr. did by force, threat or deception remove Gary Lunsford from the place where the other person was found, or restrained the liberty of Gary Lunsford with purpose to terrorize, or inflict serious physical harm on the said Gary Lunsford, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A) (3), Kidnapping, a felony of the first degree;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Count 2: On or about and between June 18 and June 19, 2016 in Adams County, Ohio Denny Blanton Jr. did by force, threat or deception knowingly, under circumstances creating a substantial risk of physical harm to Gary Lunsford, restrain Lunsford of his liberty, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(B)(2), Kidnapping, a felony of the first degree;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Count 3: On or about June 5 and June 18, 2016 in Adams County, Ohio Denny Blanton Jr. did by force, threat or deception remove Josh Gray from the place where the other person was found, or restrain the liberty of Josh Gray with purpose to terrorize, or inflict serious physical harm on the said Josh Gray, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A) (3), Kidnapping, a felony of the first degree;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Count 4: On or about and between June 17 and June 18, 2016 in Adams County, Ohio Denny Blanton Jr. did knowingly cause serious physical harm\n   to Gary Lunsford, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), Felonious Assault, a felony of the second degree; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Count 5: On or about and between June 5 and June 18, 2016 in Adams County, Ohio Denny Blanton Jr. did knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to Josh Gray, in violation of R.C. 2903.13(A), Assault, a misdemeanor of the first degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant was arraigned, entered pleas of not guilty, and the matter was placed on the court's trial docket. On October 27, 2016, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment due to the Adams County Sheriff's Office's failure to preserve video footage from the jail surveillance system between the dates of June 5, 2016 to June 18, 2016. The matter came on for hearing on October 31, 2016. The trial court did not actually receive testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding the deletion of the video footage, but made its ruling based upon the representations and arguments of counsel. Appellant did not attend the hearing on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant ultimately proceeded to a three-day jury trial beginning on November 7, 2016. The State presented its evidence, largely through the testimony of victim Gary Lunsford, Lieutenant Micah Poe, other inmates Robert Long and Mark Mefford, and Dr. Richard Durbin of the Adams County Medical Center. The defense presented evidence via the testimony of Deputy Chelsea Phelps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} At the close of trial, the trial court granted Appellant's Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal as to Count 3 which alleged the kidnapping of Josh Gray. The jury found Appellant not guilty of Count 1, which alleged the kidnapping of Gary Lunsford during the June 5 to June 17 time frame. The jury found Appellant guilty of the three remaining counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant was sentenced to consecutive 6-year prison terms on the kidnapping and felonious assault counts, and a concurrent 6-month jail term on the misdemeanor assault count. Prior to Appellant's trial in this case, he had been convicted in Adams County of kidnapping and rape, both counts containing violent sexual predator specifications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court ordered that Appellant's sentence to be served consecutively to the previously imposed sentences in the earlier case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} This timely appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth, where pertinent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"I.

Appellant points out the crime of felonious assault requires proof that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to Gary Lunsford. Appellant argues his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to prove he acted either as a principal offender or as collective participant, given the video evidence and testimony regarding the timing of Lunsford's being \"sucker punched\" by one of the other inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 12} A claim of insufficient evidence invokes a due process concern and raises the question of whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the\n   verdict as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the trial court instructed the jury as to the above definitions in almost verbatim language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 15} At trial, the jury saw surveillance footage from the jail's video system which showed the attack on Gary Lunsford by Appellant and the two other inmates. Lunsford identified his attackers as he testified and the tape was shown. In support of his argument hereunder, Appellant points to an approximate 2-4 minute interval between the time when Lunsford sustained a \"sucker punch\" by another inmate, Zach Mckee, and when Appellant \"entered\" into the fray. Appellant argues this evidence eliminates him as the principal offender of the infliction of the blow that allegedly resulted in the serious physical harm to Lunsford. Appellant also argues that the testimony is insufficient to\n   permit a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted collectively to cause serious physical harm to Lunsford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Based upon our review of the videotape and the testimony, however, we disagree. As the State played the videotape, Gary Lunsford identified himself and several other inmates: Robert Long, Mark Mefford, Zach McKee, Devon Michaels, and Appellant. Mark Mefford testified that during the time frame between June 5, 2016 and June 20, 2016, fights were organized in the cell by Appellant. Specifically, Mefford testified: \"Blanton, he was the main spoke of it, he kept saying, I want to see some wrestling, I want to see some action in here, and it was for their amusement.\" Mefford testified the fighting occurred \"almost every night to every other night.\" Specifically, Mefford testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q: Okay, with regard to the organized fighting, would you call that organized fighting that took place?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A: That's what it escalated to, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q: Who in the cell was responsible for that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A: Most of it was Mr. Blanton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q: What was his role in that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A: Pretty much what they call egging it on?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A: More or less that it was all his idea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court: Who is he and his?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A: Mr. Blanton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Gary Lunsford also testified these activities were going on daily during the two weeks prior to his being injured. And, Lunsford also identified Appellant as the instigator of the wrestling and fights. Lunsford testified \"if you didn't fight, especially if you didn't do what they said they was going to beat you up.\" He testified \"they\" referred to Zack McKee, Devon Michaels, and Appellant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Regarding the June 18, 2016 altercation, Lunsford testified that McKee, Michaels, and Appellant \"made him wrestle\" Josh Gray. If he refused, his alternative was to fight the others. On that day, when Lunsford and Gray wrestled and one was pinned, Appellant would restart the match. Lunsford testified that at one point, McKee \"sucker punched\" him. While Lunsford was lying on the ground, Appellant was hitting him. However, Lunsford testified he did not recall Appellant hitting him because he was unconscious. He was incapacitated and unable to move.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Inmate Mark Mefford's testimony also described the June 18, 2016 incident:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A: That night, Mr. Blanton got the idea that they were going to throw, he said we were going to throw the mats on the floor and see a wrestling match. And when he put the mats on the floor he said that he, Mr. Blanton, said that he wanted Zack McKee and Josh Gray to wrestle for them for their amusement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q: Was it Zack McKee or Gary Lunsford?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A: Gary Lunsford and Josh Gray.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q: So how long did you observe that wrestling match?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A: Approximately about 20 to 30 minutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A: Josh and Gary Lunsford.

There, Johnson claimed that despite the fact that he hit his victim in the face, the evidence was clear that the injuries to his victim's shoulder and head were not from Johnson's punch, but from a fall to the ground or possibly from the unrest that ensued after prison guards intervened in the prison fight. Johnson argued that the evidence failed to demonstrate that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to his victim, Officer Meier. Johnson pointed out while he may have knowingly caused physical harm to the officer in starting the incident by punching him in the head, it was the officer who escalated the incident by attempting to throw Johnson to the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 23} We were not convinced by this argument.

The Defendant\n   is also responsible for the natural and foreseeable consequences, or results, that follow in the ordinary course of events from his actions. There may be more than one cause of the victim's injury. However, if the Defendant's act was one cause, the existence of other causes is not a defense to this case. The test of foreseeability is not whether the Defendant should have foreseen the injury in its precise form or as to a specific person.

Here, Miller, a juvenile convicted of felonious assault at a party, stressed the fact that the testimony establishes several other people were kicking the victim in the head before he became involved in the fight.

Assuming, for purposes of this point, that they did, a party cannot then jump on top of the victim bargaining only for a \"regular\" assault by hitting the victim in a manner that may not, under normal circumstances, cause serious physical harm. If, in fact, appellant did not enter the melee until the victim had already suffered serious physical harm, his actions are all the more inculpatory. Harm heaped on top of serious physical harm must itself be considered serious physical harm even if under different circumstances it may not have risen to that level.

Dr. Richard Durbin, the emergency room doctor who treated Lunsford at Adams County Regional Medical Center on June 21, 2016, testified Lunsford had \"obvious\" injuries to his face, and gave a history of being \"knocked unconscious.\" Based on the subjective history, Dr. Durbin ordered a CT scan of the head and x-rays of the left elbow and chest.

Appellant argues the State's evidence demonstrated, at best, an effort by Appellant to restrict Lunsford's freedom of choice and therefore, should have been prosecuted for violation of the coercion statute, a misdemeanor of the second degree. Appellant asserts that the State improperly elevated, to first degree felony level, conduct that the General Assembly intended to punish less seriously as a misdemeanor. R.C. 2905.12 (A)(1), coercion, provides that \"No person, with purpose to coerce another into taking or refraining from action concerning which the other person has a legal freedom of choice, shall * * * [t]hreaten to commit any offense.\" However, we are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Lunsford testified he was unable to get medical help for two days after the attack because McKee, Michaels, and Appellant told him he was not allowed to \"hit the call box.\" They told him if he tried to call for help, he would \"get the same treatment again.\" Lunsford specifically testified Appellant told him, \"don't move or your (sic.) going to get it again.\" Because he didn't want to get attacked again, Lunsford\n   covered his head whenever a jailer walked through so he wouldn't be seen. When the inmates' food trays were served, he would lay on his bunk covered up. Lunsford testified either McKee, Michaels, or Appellant would get his tray and hand it to him so Lunsford's injuries would not be discovered and no one would get into trouble.

(Internal citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Appellant asserts that restraining Lunsford's freedom to seek medical help, if it occurred, represents conduct punishable by two separate statutes with different penalties. Under the general statute of kidnapping, R.C. 2905.01(B)(2), a conviction results in a first-degree felony. Under the special provision of coercion, R.C. 2905.12(A)(1), a conviction results in a misdemeanor. Therefore, appellant contends that the statutes are definitely in conflict and the special provision of coercion must prevail. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 54} To be considered irreconcilable, the statutes must first prohibit the same conduct, specifically the conduct of which appellant was convicted. Appellant would have this court conclude that threatening Lunsford directly or indirectly is the same conduct constituting coercion and kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 55} If appellant had committed coercion by threatening Lunsford in some manner in order to prevent him from seeking medical attention, separate conduct still exists that results in more than a violation of coercion. This separate conduct\n   is the fact that Appellant's threat also created a substantial risk of physical harm to Lunsford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Appellant is correct in asserting that inherently, kidnapping includes the act of coercion. However, acts committed under the coercion statute do not necessarily violate the kidnapping statute. A person coerced into refraining from action he or she is legally permitted to do may face a substantial risk of personal or professional harm, but not necessarily a substantial risk of physical harm. Violations of the two statutes result from different conduct. The statutes prohibit separate and distinct offenses and therefore, the statutes are reconcilable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Appellee chose to prosecute Appellant on the conduct of kidnapping and not for the conduct of coercion. \"The mere fact that appellant's conduct violates more than one statute does not force the state to prosecute him under the lesser statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Sufronko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 509,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20N.E.2d%20596\">\n    664 N.E.2d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Oldaker, supra,\n   </em>\n   to be applicable as to both Appellant's sufficiency arguments regarding his felonious assault and kidnapping convictions. Oldaker was charged and convicted of two counts of kidnapping after he held his victim at gunpoint and forced him to ride with Oldaker and at least one other person to a garage in order to repossess a car that had been sold to the victim. The victim, Brandon Cremeans, was tricked into the vehicle by his cousin, Michael Cremeans, and assaulted by another person, Fisher, prior to Oldaker's entry into the situation. Oldaker challenged the sufficiency of the evidence convicting him, arguing that because he did not restrain Brandon, did not deceive or trick Brandon into going to the house where the physical harm occurred, and played no role in Fisher's felonious assault of Brandon. However, we found Oldaker's arguments meritless. We reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   \"Both Brandon and Michael Cremeans testified that Oldaker held Brandon at gunpoint and forced him to ride with them from Fisher's residence to the garage so that they could repossess the car that Fisher had sold to Brandon. And Deputy Sheriff Huff testified that on that day, Oldaker called him and told him that he \"had Brandon.\" This constituted sufficient evidence that Oldaker,\n   by threat of force, knowingly, under circumstances that created a substantial risk of physical harm to Brandon, removed him from the place where he was found-the Fisher residence-and restrained him of his liberty. No evidence of deceit or a trick on his part was required to convict him of kidnapping because R.C. 2905.01(B) specifies that the offense may be committed by \"force, threat, or deception.\" (Emphasis added.) And the mere fact that Oldaker may not have been involved in the felonious assault does not mean that he did not act \"under circumstances that create a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the victim.\" He threatened Oldaker with a gun and although he had reason to believe that Brandon had been seriously injured, he continued to restrain him and deprive him of the opportunity to receive the immediate medical attention that his eye injury needed. After viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of kidnapping proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   {\u00b6 62} In this case, the jury apparently believed the State's witnesses, despite the fact that all but Lieutenant Poe and Dr. Durbin had criminal backgrounds. They must have found credible the testimony that Appellant's actions restrained Lunsford of his liberty and acted in a manner which created a substantial risk of serious physical harm to him. For the foregoing reasons, Appellant's second assignment of error has no merit and is hereby overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR THREE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Appellant next contends the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard, or in the alternative abused its discretion, when it denied his request for an instruction on simple assault as a lesser-included offense of felonious assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 64} \"When the indictment, information, or complaint charges an offense including degrees, or if lesser offenses are included within the offense charged, the defendant may be found not guilty of the degree charged but guilty of an inferior degree thereof, or of a lesser included offense.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Oliver appealed multiple convictions, including one for participation in a gang. Oliver pointed out that he was charged solely as a principal offender and there was no evidence in the record to support a complicity instruction. Oliver further maintained that, over his objection, the trial court gave a second complicity instruction which only served to aggravate the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   {\u00b6 77} The appellate court noted that complicity is among the offenses that can be used to establish a pattern of gang activity, which is an element of participation in a criminal gang. The State argued that the court mentioned complicity merely while defining a term found within a charged offense. The State noted that the trial court clarified to the jury that Oliver had been charged as a principal offender and the State clearly argued that Appellant was the principal offender in its closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   {\u00b6 78} In\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   , while providing jury instructions, the court defined the offense of \"participation in a criminal gang\" and further defined several terms found within the definition, including the term \"complicity.\" The trial court stated: \"[t]he defendant is charged with complicity in the commission of the aforementioned crimes.\" The trial court then defined complicity. After the trial court provided the jury instructions, the judge met with both counsel in chambers to discuss the jury instructions that had just been given. The prosecutor brought up the fact that they had given the complicity instruction without telling the jurors that Oliver had been charged as a principal, but in the alternative, he could be charged as a complicitor. Both the State and the defense requested that the definition of complicity be taken out of the instructions before being handed to the jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   {\u00b6 79} However, the trial court determined that the instruction would not be removed and decided to give another instruction\n   to clarify that Appellant had been charged as a principal but, in the alternative, the jury could consider him as a complicitor. The defense objected and stated that the complicity instruction should have either been stricken or left as is, even though he had objected to the instruction. The jury was brought back into the courtroom and the court clarified the issue of complicity by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   \"And the issue of complicity, this Defendant, Christian Oliver, is charged as a principal offender. In all offenses alleged in the indictment, he's charged as a principal offender, and as an alternative to a principal offender, he may be considered a complicitor for purposes of complicity.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   {\u00b6 80} The appellate court found that while the complicity instructions were somewhat confusing, Oliver had neither alleged nor shown prejudice. Because Oliver was unable to demonstrate prejudice, he could not show that reversible error occurred. Based upon our review of the record, we cannot say that the trial court's possibly misleading complicity instruction caused prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   {\u00b6 81} The comment to Ohio Jury Instructions, Vol. II, Title V, Criminal Subject Matter Instructions states: \"If the defendant is charged with the principal offense and the evidence would support a theory that he/she was complicit, use this instruction\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   \"1. The state of Ohio has presented a theory that the defendant acted in complicity with the principal offender in the commission of (insert name of offense[s] ).

The trial court gave the first paragraph of the model instruction almost verbatim. We do not find the instruction given here to be an incorrect statement of the law, but an incomplete one. Despite the lack of a second paragraph, we do not find the incomplete construction rose to the level of prejudicialnot to pursue every possible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   {\u00b6 83} Here, the instruction conformed to the evidence at trial. While Appellant was charged as the principal offender, at no time did the trial court or the parties refer to him as such. Furthermore, the surveillance footage and testimony established that Appellant both acted not only as an instigator of the violence, a principal offender, but also as a complicitor who contributed to the violence which reigned in the atmosphere on E4 and who joined in the beating of Lunsford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   {\u00b6 84} And, while the trial court did not define the burden of proof, date, jurisdiction, venue, and culpable mental state as to an actual charge of complicity, the trial court had previously defined those terms as to the felonious assault and kidnapping counts.

The hearing on the motion to dismiss was conducted in Appellant's absence. In assignment of error number five, Appellant contends the prosecutor focused on the importance of the surveillance footage at trial, but the court deprived him of his constitutional and procedural rights when it denied his motion without receiving testimony from him on the disputed issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   {\u00b6 87} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

We find, Appellant, not the State, bears that burden. Here, the State did not fail to preserve the videotape after appellant specifically requested the evidence. On October 6, 2016, the trial court conducted a final pretrial hearing. Trial was scheduled for November 7, 2016. On the record, counsel for both parties advised the court that discovery had been received. Defense counsel specifically acknowledged receipt of the jail video evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   {\u00b6 91} The trial court also inquired of counsel whether or not there were pending motions. Defense counsel advised there were none; however, on October 14, 2016, defense counsel filed a subpoena for additional surveillance footage, and on October 27, 2016 defense counsel filed a motion to\n   dismiss. The motion to dismiss hearing was heard on October 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   {\u00b6 92} At the motion hearing, which arguably should be referenced as a pretrial conference in chambers because no testimony was taken and the court made his ruling on the motion based upon the representations of counsel, defense counsel pointed out the jail was under constant 24-hour surveillance. He pointed out the surveillance video obtained in discovery showed only 157 minutes of footage related to the alleged felonious assault on June 18, 2016, and nothing before or after. Defense counsel argued as he prepared for trial, he realized there must be video footage of the alleged kidnapping which occurred afterwards. At that point, he issued a subpoena for the alleged materially exculpatory evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   {\u00b6 93} At the October 31, 2016 conference, the State described the surveillance footage provided in discovery as being limited to June 18, 2016, 157 minutes in \"mixed matched order.\" The State represented that the surveillance footage as evidence of the felonious assault occurring on the 18\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   was provided to them on June 20, 2016, and that they did not further investigate until June 24, 2016. However, once they determined to pursue kidnapping charges, the video footage was no longer available. The State represented that the video surveillance system which records is \"one tape that erases after six days and starts recording over top of it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   {\u00b6 94} The above facts demonstrate that the burden did not shift to the State, to prove that the withheld evidence was materially exculpatory, because the defendant made only a general request for discovery earlier in the proceedings. By the time Appellant made a specific request, on October 14, 2016, the surveillance footage was no longer available, in accordance with the routine procedures of the jail and the surveillance system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   {\u00b6 95} We next consider whether this additionally requested surveillance footage was material exculpatory or potentially useful and, if the latter, was it not provided as a matter of bad faith on the part of the State. On appeal, defense counsel has argued the requested surveillance footage was materially exculpatory as relates to the kidnapping count. At the October 31, 2016 conference, defense counsel argued that as to the alleged kidnapping, when Lunsford was allegedly not allowed to show himself to the jailer or accept his own food tray, the 157 minutes provided demonstrated that was not true because he was up walking around and out of his bunk on multiple occasions after the assault. The trial court inquired \"It's going to show that he did go up and get his own tray?\" Defense counsel replied \"He did or did not, you know.\" Defense counsel also argued: \"The video is going to show one of two things, either that they did commit the crime, or they did not commit the crime. It has to be on there, they are under surveillance.\" Counsel, at the hearing and on appeal, only speculates as to what the requested surveillance footage may have shown and in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Rivas, supra,\n   </em>\n   such speculation is not sufficient to establish materiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   {\u00b6 96} The trial court ultimately ruled that there was no suggestion that the alleged discarded video evidence was materially exculpatory, or that potentially useful evidence was destroyed in bad faith. We agree with the trial court's ruling. In our view, defense counsel's argument then and on appeal is based on pure speculation. Therefore, Appellant has failed to carry his burden to show that the requested surveillance footage was materially exculpatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   {\u00b6 97} Further, the record reveals Appellant made his own argument as to the materiality of the requested surveillance footage. At sentencing, Appellant disclosed that he had personal knowledge of the exculpatory nature of the discarded video footage and bad faith on the part of the investigator in failing to preserve it. Appellant informed the trial court as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   \"* * * I'd like to tell everyone in this courtroom that Lieutenant Poe did commit perjury on the stand. He showed me video of the assault I committed on Mr. Lunsford. It was not at the angle as we saw in this trial. It was video from the other camera in which Poe said only showed the catwalk. Poe also testified that during an investigation he saves all the video to review for a long period of time. * * * Lieutenant Poe of Adams County Ohio Jail did knowingly destroy evidence, whether he believed it or not. Whether he believed it was necessary or not, the fact that the prosecutor said on record this was a continued event and we have not one witness who was there that is not a criminal. Nor do we have evidence of involvement of mine being that of destruction of video. Lieutenant Poe deleted video that proved Gary was not knocked out. Because like Dr. Durbin said you lose muscle control and Gary not once in the video I saw from the other camera lost muscle control.* * * Also, Your Honor, when I went downstairs to get changed out I took a look at the cameras downstairs and you can see in that cell from the other camera. Lieutenant Poe lied on that stand and he showed me the video that you can see Gary Lunsford protecting himself and protecting my punches. But, you can't see that in the video we saw here. But he deleted if for that very same reason, he didn't want you guys to know that Gary was not ever knocked out, that is a lie born by the prosecution. And I don't know who deleted that video but whoever did is guilty of destruction, tampering with records, tampering with evidence and Lieutenant Poe is guilty of perjury.* * * And if you want yourself you can go downstairs and look at that camera, you can see in that cell. And the video that Lieutenant Poe showed me you can see Gary protecting hisself (sic), but at the angle we saw here you can't see Gary protecting hisself (sic), and that's why they chose that one over the other one.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   {\u00b6 98} In\n   <em>\n    Fox,\n   </em>\n   we held that for missing videotape footage to constitute materially exculpatory evidence, the defendant must present evidence that the missing footage captured the events at issue and would allow him to challenge the substance of the allegations, not merely the facts that occurred before or after the events at issue. If no one has reviewed the videotape, a defendant will generally be unable to show that the missing footage contained materially exculpatory evidence.\n   <em>\n    Fox, supra,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. While defense counsel's argument on appeal is that the requested surveillance footage would be materially exculpatory as to the kidnapping count, Appellant indicated at sentencing the materially exculpatory footage somehow exonerates him as to the felonious assault conviction. Based on the record before us, the facts demonstrate that no one seems to know what was on the alleged materially exculpatory surveillance footage. And, taking Appellant's statements at sentencing as truthful, that he saw the alleged materially exculpatory footage that was later unavailable, any evidence of Lunsford, the victim \"protecting himself and protecting [Appellant's] punches,\" is irrelevant to Appellant's guilt on either the felonious assault or kidnapping counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   {\u00b6 99} Based upon the foregoing, we find the requested surveillance footage was\n   not materially exculpatory. Appellant cannot show the missing footage provides evidence which exonerates him or in any way challenges the substance of the allegations. Furthermore, in the event the surveillance footage could be somehow considered potentially useful, there has been no showing of bad faith. To establish bad faith, a defendant must show more than an accidental erasure of the tape or that the tape was reused in accordance with routine procedures.\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 38 (Internal citations omitted.)

The entire hearing was conducted on the record. A review of the record demonstrates that Lawwill's interests were more than adequately protected. A review of the transcript also reveals that Lawwill's presence would have made little contribution to the hearing at issue. Further, Lawwill failed to timely object, thus constituting waiver of the argument.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Consequently, the\n   <em>\n    Lawwill\n   </em>\n   court declined to find plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   {\u00b6 103} In this case, we must consider whether Appellant was deprived of a fair and just hearing on the motion to dismiss by his absence. Essentially, Appellant argues the trial court had a duty to hear his testimony on the issue of the additional surveillance footage and its value to his defense. We have carefully reviewed the record in its entirety and based on it, we disagree with Appellant, that his presence was required at the motion to dismiss hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   {\u00b6 104} The record reflects the trial court raised the issue of when Appellant should be returned from the state prison to Adams County for the purposes of trial at the final pretrial on October 6, 2016. Defense counsel requested Appellant's return for the Friday prior to trial. The trial court advised, since trial was to begin on Monday, November 7, 2016, that it would order Appellant's conveyance to occur on the 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   or 4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of November. However, Appellant thereafter subpoenaed specific surveillance footage on October 14, 2016 and filed a motion to dismiss based on the failure to provide the footage on October 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   {\u00b6 105} At the October 31, 2016 hearing on the motion, the trial court immediately addressed the issue of Appellant's absence. It is clear the court felt compelled to proceed with the hearing, when it stated, \"I know of no other means of preparing counsel for the matters in the event that it does proceed to trial other than to proceed without the defendant.\" The court then asked if the attorneys wished to be heard on the issue. Both defense counsel and the State's counsel declined further discussion about Appellant's presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   {\u00b6 106} Based on the evidence contained in the record before us, Appellant's argument that he was deprived of his constitutional and procedural rights to confrontation by his absence at the October 31, 2016 hearing has no merit. The record supports these findings: (1) that Appellant's interests were adequately protected by his counsel; (2) that Appellant's presence would have contributed little; and (3) that the failure to timely object constitutes a waiver of this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   {\u00b6 107} We find that while Appellant's counsel has zealously argued that the alleged materially exculpatory surveillance footage contained evidence which challenged the substance of the kidnapping count, the record reflects, as set forth in detail above, had Appellant been present at the October 31, 2016 conference, he may have made a quite different argument which would not have contributed to his defense. Based on the foregoing, we find no merit to Appellant's fifth assignment of error. It is hereby overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR SIX\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   {\u00b6 108} In this assignment of error, Appellant argues the trial court foreclosed his cross-examination of Lieutenant Poe at trial regarding his failure to preserve all the video surveillance footage and this limitation violated Appellant's federal and state constitutional right of confrontation. At trial, the prosecutor objected to defense counsel's attempt to cross-examine Lieutenant Poe about the missing and allegedly relevant surveillance footage. The trial court sustained the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   {\u00b6 109} Appellant contends he still retained a right to cross-examine Lieutenant Poe regarding this subject in the jury's presence for purposes of challenging the completeness of the video footage that was offered into evidence, its value as collaborative evidence, and the integrity and thoroughness of the investigation. He argues denial of the opportunity to cross-examine on this issue violated his right of confrontation and right to present a complete defense. Appellant asserts the jurors were\n   left with the false impression that the surveillance footage contained the only relevant images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   {\u00b6 110} A defendant's right to cross-examine the State's witnesses is guaranteed by both the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\n   <em>\n    State v.

I'll sustain the objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   {\u00b6 113} In opening, defense counsel planted the idea the jury should cast doubt on the completeness of the footage. Counsel stated in opening:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   \"You will likely see some video footage as you can imagine a jail cell is under constant video surveillance. All the allegations are to alleged to have been in that jail cell, any actions occurred in that jail cell. You'll see some video footage approximately consisting of about 157 minutes. That's all the video footage that was ever retained or kept from that jail cell. We have all these five crimes, three of which being kidnappings, one felonious assault and one assault, but they didn't manage to keep any of the video footage that alleged show these things.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Then, in closing, defense counsel emphasized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   \"Mr. Poe testified that there was only around 157 minutes of footage, he was the one that decided what to keep. He didn't keep any more. He did talk about how they only retain footage for so long but he got footage of the 18\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , he didn't get anything on the 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   when Mr. Lunsford was allegedly confined to his bed. There was no footage of that. Nor was there footage of anything prior, we didn't have any of that, it wasn't kept.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   {\u00b6 114} Based upon our review of the transcript, we find no confrontation clause violation by the trial court's sustaining the objection and not allowing defense counsel to question Lieutenant Poe as to whether or not he \"did not feel it was a good idea to keep the remaining [footage.]\" First, Appellant was not foreclosed from appropriate cross-examination. If a trial court allows cross-examination to expose a motive to lie, then \"it is of peripheral concern to the Sixth Amendment how much opportunity defense counsel gets to hammer that point home to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    McKelton,\n   </em>\n   quoting\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   at 708.

Similarly, since defense counsel was able to plant the idea in opening that the surveillance footage was suspect, and present through cross-examination that Lieutenant Poe did not give the prosecutor's office any video footage before and after the June 18, 2016, and the jury was able to draw their own conclusions from that testimony, it is within the trial court's discretion how much more counsel got to advance that point. At sidebar, defense counsel argued he was only trying to question whether or not he kept any other footage and the trial court found that question had been asked and answered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   {\u00b6 115} More importantly, we find the question as to whether or not Lieutenant Poe \"felt it was a good idea to keep remaining [footage]\" to be an unfair question, which could have caused confusion, given the fact of the trial court's ruling that there was no bad faith on the part of the officer's in not providing additional footage. The trial court ruled the footage not provided was not materially exculpatory nor potentially useful and there had been no bad faith as it was no longer available due to routine procedures. In\n   doing so, the trial court was required to make a legal analysis. Had the court allowed the defense counsel to continue with the line of questioning, both parties may have engaged in further questioning which may necessarily have involved consideration of legal conclusions or extrinsic matters. We are mindful that \" '[a] trial court retains \"wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, * * * or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Potts,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-5555\">\n    2016-Ohio-5555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20N.E.3d%201227\">\n    69 N.E.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3rd Dist.), \u00b6 76.

At sentencing, Appellant's statement on this issue, previously set forth herein, demonstrated not only that Appellant admitted to assaulting Gary Lunsford, but also that Appellant's argument about the alleged missing video was meritless. Appellant stated that the alleged missing video showed Lunsford \"protecting himself and protecting my punches.\" Any evidence of Lunsford protecting himself at some point before or after the assault which was represented on the surveillance footage is irrelevant to the analysis of Appellant's guilt as to his kidnapping conviction, as argued by his counsel on appeal. Moreover, surveillance footage showing Lunsford protecting himself from Appellant's punches is certainly irrelevant to Appellant's guilt as to the felonious assault conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   {\u00b6 123} Here, even if defense counsel was aware that the sentiments Appellant made at sentencing were likely to come out if Appellant testified at the motion to dismiss hearing, defense counsel made a wise strategic decision not to insist on his client's presence. \"An appellant is not deprived of effective assistance of counsel when counsel chooses, for strategic reasons, not to pursue every possible trial tactic.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant's accusations that Lieutenant Poe allegedly destroyed or tampered with footage that showed Lunsford protecting himself, and that such footage, if it existed, is somehow relevant or exonerates Appellant on one or both counts, is not rational conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   {\u00b6 124} Based on the above, we find counsel's representation was not deficient due to his failure to object to Appellant's absence at the motion to dismiss hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   <em>\n    2. Failure to raise and argue the doctrine of impossibility as to the second kidnapping count.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   {\u00b6 125} As we discussed at length in the second assignment of error, Appellant's doctrine of impossibility argument has no merit. Nothing in the research has indicated that Appellant's victim had no right to move about freely in his jail cell or that, as a general rule, an inmate cannot be held captive by other inmate in a jail or prison cell. Furthermore, the committee comments demonstrate that it is possible to kidnap a person by restricting their movement for only a short distance and if only for a brief period of time.

Based on the above analysis, such an argument would have also been without merit. Defense counsel was not deficient for failing to make a motion which had no merit and would have been denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Often times, with respect to \"lesser-included offenses,\" defense counsel will make the strategic decision not to request a lesser-included offense jury instruction in the hopes that the jury will outright acquit the defendant on the charged offense, having not been given the option to find guilt as to the lesser-included offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   {\u00b6 129} Appellant argues that the complicity jury instruction was incomplete and misleading. However, it could be considered reasonable trial strategy to go for \"all or nothing,\" taking the chance that jurors would be confused and the confusion would result in an outright acquittal on the felonious assault and/or kidnapping counts. Given that Appellant was not charged with\n   complicity nor was he specifically identified using the language \"principal offender,\" yet there was evidence of complicity, we find counsel's silence as to the incomplete complicity instruction to be a debatable, yet reasonable trial strategy. As such, we do not find counsel's performance to be deficient in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   {\u00b6 130} Based upon the foregoing, we do not find Appellant's trial counsel's performance fell below an objective level of reasonable representation.

The State also requested those sentences ordered to be served consecutive to each other and consecutive to the prison term that Appellant was currently serving. The State pointed out the offenses Appellant was convicted of occurred while he was incarcerated awaiting trial. Based on Appellant's criminal history, the State argued that consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public from future crime and to punish Appellant for his offenses. Appellant's counsel responded by pointing out Appellant was already serving three mandatory prison terms of 10 years to life, to be served consecutively, and that adding 19 years on top of that was excessive. Counsel argued \"I'm not sure how much more protected the public can be.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   {\u00b6 137} Appellant also given the opportunity to speak on his own behalf. We have set forth a long portion of Appellant's comments at sentencing, infra. At sentencing, Appellant wished to emphasize that he had seen a video that showed the \"assault [he] committed on Mr. Lunsford, * * * not at an angle as [seen] in trial.\" Appellant also emphasized \"We have not one witness who was there who is not a criminal.\" He reiterated that Lunsford could be seen on the alleged missing surveillance footage \"protecting himself, and protecting [Appellant's] punches.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   {\u00b6 138} Ultimately, the trial court imposed a stated prison term of six years on Count 2, felonious assault, and a stated prison term of six years on Count 4, kidnapping. The terms of incarceration were to run consecutive to each other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the court ordered that Appellant's consecutive sentence on Counts 2 and 4 be served consecutively to his term previously imposed felony sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   {\u00b6 139} This colloquy between the trial court and Appellant sheds some light on the trial court's thoughts on the issue of sentencing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   THE COURT: I guess, Mr. Blanton, you have theorized that there wasn't serious physical harm because he didn't lose consciousness, is that your theory? * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   Mr. Blanton: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-272\">\n   The Court: Why does Mr. Lunsford have to protect himself at all? You're talking about, you're showing the other tape would have shown him in a defensive position protecting himself as you were pummeling him and getting back up when he did get up. Why does he have to protect himself at all?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-273\">\n   Mr. Blanton: Can I give you one more aspect, Your Honor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n   The Court: Sure, if you would like to answer the question first though, why does he have to protect himself at all?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-275\">\n   Mr. Blanton: He doesn't have to, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   The Court: But you forced that upon him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   Mr. Blanton: I guess, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-278\">\n   The Court: And your argument is he just didn't pass out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n   Mr. Blanton: He was never unconscious, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-280\">\n   The Court: I understand that is your position. You had another statement you wanted to make?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-281\">\n   Mr. Blanton: Yes, Your Honor. * * * After investigating the crime Lieutenant Poe * * * later moved me from the cell, and all this would have been on video if he would have saved the video. * * * But, they put me back into that cell with [Gary Lunsford], he allowed that, he didn't say, look, I'm scared of him, keep him out of here, now this is when the situation already came to light. * * * Gary allowed them to put me back in there and we were actually hugging, I apologized to him, we were crying. There was no me being a bully and all those inmates and that would have been on camera, but mysteriously the camera is gone, Your Honor. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   {\u00b6 140} Appellant cites the following comments by the trial judge in support his argument that he was punished for exercising his right to jury trial. The trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-283\">\n   \"All right. Well, and I realize that you don't practice law, but there is such a distorted view as to the law and the theories that because you hugged him after you had beat him savagely that somehow that wipes the slate clean. * * * You know, one of the things that is so perplexing is that\n   <em>\n    the Court rarely participates in plea negotiations\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) because of the gratuitous nature of the plea negotiations you were offered almost an opportunity what I would call no harm no foul, * * * and you could have pled and no additional sentence compared to what you have. And somehow in your justification you decide that no, you want to challenge all of this knowing videotape is out there that just showed savage beatings, but that was your call. I do agree with Mr. Kelley that you were the least culpable of the three actors. And it broke my heart to watch your mother see her son violently attack animalistic a helpless individual. * * * When I watch what you and Mr. McKee and Mr. Michael did in that cell and the fear that you placed, when I considered how would I be, would I still not genuflected at the altar of fear, and I think I would have by this brutality. * * * But you know what I was really hoping you would say. I was afraid of them, that is the reason I did all this, they were threatening they were going to hurt me, and that's the reason I did all this. But you don't offer that, you don't offer anything of that nature. And so it was an independent act, a collective act as well that you decided to terrorize a whole cell of individuals. And the last thing I would say is that you were awaiting trial on charges that carried as you now know very serious penalties, and you knew at that time * * *. That other act happened * * * on or about February 22, 2016, less than four months pass and you're engaging in violent criminal behavior in a jail cell that you know there are videos. * * * That didn't seem to affect you. You just continued on with your beating of helpless individuals and your manipulation and threats of helpless individuals.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   {\u00b6 141} Upon rendering the sentence, the trial court stated that it had considered\n   R.C. 2929.14 and found that the consecutive sentence was necessary to protect the public from future crime. The court further found that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the Appellant's conduct. When the court reached the R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) factors, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-285\">\n   \"I have sentenced a lot of people, you apply on all of these. The court found that (a) Appellant had committed one or more of the multiple offenses while he was awaiting trial; (b) that the multiple offenses were part of a course of conduct; and that the offenses Appellant committed were so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of the course of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of his conduct. (c) And the third factor the Court finds that your history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender? * * * So the Court finds all of those factors and justifies, at least in the Court's self-serving mind on that matter that consecutive sentences are necessary.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   {\u00b6 142} The trial court further remarked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   \"I guess what I found most alarming, Mr. Blanton, and I didn't catch it because I've got a small screen up here, but in closing argument when they played, poor Mr. Lunsford, which I believe was unconscious * * *. But when he tries to get up that wasn't good enough for you. So, you savagely beat him some more. For what reason? For what good?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   {\u00b6 143} Importantly, in concluding the sentencing, the Court commented:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-289\">\n   \"Now before I tell you your appellate rights I just want to explain something because you're not involved in law. A Court of Common Pleas we have no investigatory powers. So all of your complaints about these other people that committed crimes the only way I can involve myself is if they are brought to court and indicted for those charge. (Sic.) So I don't want you to think it's fallen on deaf ears that I can do some investigation. I can't. * * * I have to wait until the evidence is presented in this courtroom with charges.\n   <em>\n    I saw the videotape for the first time today as did the jury or for the first time maybe yesterday as did the jury.\"\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   {\u00b6 144} In this case, we do not find the record supports the conclusion that Appellant was punished for exercising his right to a jury trial. We find the record here supports the imposition of consecutive sentences. We find the sentencing transcript reflects that the trial court explicitly made the required findings for consecutive sentences pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a)(b) and (c). And, we further find Appellant's consecutive sentence is also not clearly and convincingly contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   {\u00b6 145} When sentencing an offender, each case stands on its own unique facts.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

(Internal citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   {\u00b6 146} Here, the record reflects the trial court considered all the factors required of the applicable statute. We also find no appearance of impropriety due to simply noting that \"the Court rarely participates in plea negotiations.\" The trial court could have imposed the maximum sentence on each count, but instead, imposed a lesser sentence of six years on each, well within the statutory range. Notably, the trial commented as to the three participants, Appellant was the \"least culpable.\" The trial court's comments about\n   plea negotiations are part of the court's comments as a whole which reflect the court's grave concern about Appellant's violent conduct and apparent lack of remorse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   {\u00b6 147} For example the trial court also discussed the fact that the DVD the jury saw demonstrated Appellant participated in \"savage beatings\" and \"violent attacks.\" The trial court had not seen the DVD until it was played for the jury. In particular, the trial court, along with the jurors, observed the victim, who appeared to be unconscious and tried to get up, being beaten again. And has been noted previously, Appellant's convictions for assault and kidnapping in the Adams County Jail occurred while he was awaiting trial for charges of kidnapping, assault and rape, for which he was eventually convicted. Taken together, these demonstrate Appellant's criminal history, danger to the public, and the seriousness of his course of conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   {\u00b6 148} For the foregoing reasons, we find the record clearly and convincingly record supports Appellant's consecutive sentences, and his sentence is not contrary to law.
