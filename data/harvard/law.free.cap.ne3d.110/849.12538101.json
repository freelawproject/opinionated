JONES, SR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} This matter involves the issue of whether the probate division of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court had jurisdiction over a complaint alleging breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, fraud, conversion with regard to an estate, and that sought a constructive trust and an accounting. For the reasons that follow, we answer in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellant, Sami Sosnoswsky, was gifted money to be placed into a trust until she turned 18 years old. Judith Lieber, Sosnoswsky's mother, was custodian of the account. From 1973-1980, the following amounts were to be placed in the trust: $19,000 from Sosnoswsky's grandmother, $6,057.40 from her grandfather, and $50,000 from her father. Sosnoswsky has alleged that the trust is currently worth about $2,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In February 2016, defendant-appellee John Koscianski was appointed the guardian of the estate and person of Judith Lieber. On December 12, 2016, Sosnoswsky filed a complaint in the probate division of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. She filed a second complaint in the court's general division on December 29, 2016. The complaints were virtually identical in that they named the same defendants and alleged that, due to Lieber's fraudulent conveyance of the funds, Sosnoswsky never received any of her trust money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Koscianski filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the general division pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(1). The court stayed the case pending decision by the probate division on the complaint Sosnoswsky had filed with that court. On April 28, 2017, Sosnoswsky voluntarily dismissed her complaint without prejudice in the probate court and moved to reinstate her general division case to the active docket. The general division trial court granted her motion to reinstate the case to the active docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Koscianski moved to renew the original motion to dismiss in the general division. The general division trial court granted Koscianski's motion, holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to R.C. 2101.24, it is well settled that the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction, unless otherwise provided by law, as to all matters set forth in R.C. 2101.24 and as to all matters pertaining directly to the administration of estates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]his instant matter involves a ward [Lieber] that is currently under guardianship in the Cuyahoga County Probate Court. The Court finds that Plaintiff's claims are controlled by Ohio Rev. Code 2109.50 through Ohio Rev. Code 2109.56 and the Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction of this matter. As such, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is granted for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Civ. R. 12(B)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Sosnoswsky filed a notice of appeal, raising one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court erred in granting the defendant's motion to dismiss complaint on the ground that the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas lacked subject matter jurisdiction in accordance with Civ.R. 12(B)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In her sole assignment of error, Sosnoswsky claims that the trial court erred in dismissing her complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Civ.R. 12(B)(1). The standard of review for a Civ.R. 12(B)(1) dismissal is whether any cause of action cognizable by the forum has been raised in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Prosen v.

The issue, as the parties have framed it, is whether the probate court has\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over Sosnoswsky's claims.

She filed a nearly identical complaint in the general division on December 29, 2016. The sole difference in the complaints was that Sosnoswsky filed her complaint in the probate division pursuant to R.C. 2109.50 - 2109.56, that concern actions in probate court with regard to fiduciaries who conceal or embezzle assets. Her subsequently filed complaint in the general division named the same parties and asserted the same causes of action as the complaint filed in the general division without citing to R.C. 2109.50 - 2109.56. Both complaints requested a constructive trust and an action for accounting and alleged a breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, fraud, and conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 16} We also find that if the general division determined the case, it would have a certain impact on the case that was first filed in the probate division. The two cases both concern the \"whole issue\"; therefore, even if Sosnoswsky's complaint was properly filed in the general division, the jurisdictional priority rule applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Sosnoswsky contends that even if her case were decided in her favor in probate court, Koscianski could argue on appeal that the decision was void because the probate division did not have jurisdiction over those claims. We disagree. The general division trial court has found the probate court has jurisdiction over Sosnoswsky's claims and this decision affirms the trial court's finding. Thus, a future appeal on that basis would most likely be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We are cognizant of the fact that Sosnoswsky dismissed her complaint in probate court prior to the general division trial court's ruling dismissing her claims in the general division. But the dismissal in probate court was made pursuant to Civ.R. 41(a) and was without prejudice; therefore, with the operation of the savings statute,\n   Sosnoswsky can refile her claims in probate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Finding that the general division trial court did not err when it determined that the probate division had jurisdiction over Sosnoswsky's claims, the trial court's decision is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The sole assignment of error is overruled; judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   PATRICIA ANN BLACKMON, J., CONCURS; MELODY J.
