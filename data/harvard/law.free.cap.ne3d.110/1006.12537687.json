Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Joshua Rohlman, appeals the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, awarding appellee, Veronica Rohlman, the sum of $102,981.97 \"as and for spousal support\" after finding appellant in contempt for failing to comply with the terms of the parties' final judgment entry of divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The facts in this case are not in dispute. The parties were divorced on April 28, 2010. The final judgment entry of divorce, which was agreed upon by the parties, contains two provisions that are relevant to this appeal. First, the entry states: \"Neither party shall pay spousal support to the other and this provision shall be non-modifiable.\" The second relevant provision provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   In the event of a monetary recovery by [appellant] as a result of the injuries he sustained on or about January 1, 2009, [appellee] shall be entitled to a portion of that recovery as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   b. If [appellant's] gross recovery is less than $500,000, [appellee] shall receive 18% of the gross recovery as and for spousal support, loss of services, and as a full and complete division of property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On November 25, 2015, appellee filed a motion to show cause in light of appellant's failure to pay her 18 percent of the $425,000 settlement he received as a result of the aforementioned injuries. The matter proceeded to a hearing before a magistrate who, on June 15, 2017, found appellant in contempt of the court's final judgment entry of divorce for failing to pay appellee $76,500, which represented her 18 percent share in appellant's gross recovery from his lawsuit. Additionally, the magistrate awarded appellee $25,000 in attorney fees and $1,481.97 as litigation expenses, for a total award of $102,981.97. In its entry, the magistrate stated that appellee was awarded $102,981.97 \"as and for spousal support.\" The trial court subsequently adopted the decision in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Four days later, appellant filed his objections to the magistrate's decision, in which he argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction to characterize its award as spousal support because the final judgment entry of divorce specifically provided that no spousal support would be awarded and that the spousal support issue was not modifiable. Appellant also took issue with the trial court's classification of attorney fees and litigation expenses as spousal support under R.C. 3105.73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Upon review, the trial court issued its decision denying appellant's objections on July 19, 2017. Appellant's timely notice of appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On appeal, appellant assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Trial Court Erred by Converting an Unpaid Property Settlement, Attorney Fees, and Court Costs into Spousal Support in Direct Contravention of O.R.C. Sections 3105.18 and 3105.73.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In his sole assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court ran afoul of R.C. 3105.18 and 3105.73 when it classified its $102,981.97 award as spousal support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 8} An appellate court will not reverse the decision of a lower court in a contempt proceeding absent a showing of\n   an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Rather, appellant's argument is limited to the classification of the award as spousal support. First, appellant asserts that the trial court improperly modified the final judgment entry of divorce by ordering him to pay spousal support, where the divorce entry stated that no such spousal support would be ordered and that the spousal support prohibition was non-modifiable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Relevant here, R.C. 3105.18 provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (B) In divorce and legal separation proceedings, upon the request of either party and after the court determines the division or disbursement of property under section 3105.171 of the Revised Code, the court of common pleas may award reasonable spousal support to either party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (E) If * * * a continuing order for periodic payments of money as spousal support is entered in a divorce or dissolution of marriage action that is determined on or after January 1, 1991, the court that enters the decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage does not have jurisdiction to modify the amount or terms of the alimony or spousal support unless the court determines that the circumstances of either party have changed and unless one of the following applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In the case of a divorce, the decree or a separation agreement of the parties to the divorce that is incorporated into the decree contains a provision specifically authorizing the court to modify the amount or terms of alimony or spousal support.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Referencing R.C. 3105.18(E)(1), appellant insists that the trial court had no jurisdiction to award spousal support to appellee upon its finding of contempt. We find no merit to this argument. By its express terms, R.C. 3105.18(E)(1) applies to \"a continuing order for periodic payments of money as spousal support.\" There is no such order contained in the final judgment entry of divorce, and the trial court did not order appellant to make periodic payments of money to appellee as spousal support. Thus, R.C. 3105.18(E)(1) is inapplicable in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Further, we disagree with appellant's assertion that the trial court modified its prior entry. Indeed, the entry directed appellant to pay appellee 18 percent of the gross proceeds of his settlement, which amounts to $76,500. The entry stated that this payment would be made to appellee \"as and for spousal support, loss of services, and as a full and complete division of property.\" When appellant failed to make the required payment, he was found in contempt and the court simply ordered appellant to comply with the divorce entry by making the $76,500 payment, along with attorney fees and court costs that appellee incurred as a result of appellant's noncompliance with the divorce entry, as and for spousal support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant challenges the court's classification of its award as spousal support because the divorce entry included a provision that disallowed spousal support. However, as noted above, the entry also provided for the 18 percent payment\n   and treated it as, inter alia, spousal support. Given these conflicting provisions, we find that the divorce entry, which appellant drafted, is ambiguous. On that issue, appellant asserts, with no supporting evidence, that the language \"as and for\" was really intended to mean \"in lieu of.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \" 'A judgment entry to which the parties voluntarily agree and/or consent is essentially a contract between the parties.' \"\n   <em>\n    Capital Income &amp; Growth Fund, LLC v.

Appellant's suggestion that the 18 percent payment was to be made to appellee in lieu of spousal support amounts to a complete modification of the divorce entry's language for appellant's benefit, in violation of the aforementioned principle that ambiguous contracts are to be construed against the drafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Next, appellant argues that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay spousal support without first considering the spousal support factors under R.C. 3105.18(C)(1), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (1) In determining whether spousal support is appropriate and reasonable, and in determining the nature, amount, and terms of payment, and duration of spousal support, which is payable either in gross or in installments, the court shall consider all of the following factors:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (a) The income of the parties, from all sources, including, but not limited to, income derived from property divided, disbursed, or distributed under section 3105.171 of the Revised Code ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (b) The relative earning abilities of the parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (c) The ages and the physical, mental, and emotional conditions of the parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (d) The retirement benefits of the parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (e) The duration of the marriage;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (f) The extent to which it would be inappropriate for a party, because that party will be custodian of a minor child of the marriage, to seek employment outside the home;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (g) The standard of living of the parties established during the marriage;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (h) The relative extent of education of the parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (i) The relative assets and liabilities of the parties, including but not limited to any court-ordered payments by the parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (j) The contribution of each party to the education, training, or earning ability of the other party, including, but not limited to, any party's contribution to the acquisition of a professional degree of the other party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (k) The time and expense necessary for the spouse who is seeking spousal support to acquire education, training, or job experience so that the spouse will be qualified to obtain appropriate employment, provided the education, training, or job experience, and employment is, in fact, sought;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (l) The tax consequences, for each party, of an award of spousal support;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (m) The lost income production capacity of either party that resulted from that party's marital responsibilities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (n) Any other factor that the court expressly finds to be relevant and equitable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Regarding the $76,500 payment appellant was ordered to pay appellee pursuant to the terms of the divorce entry, we find that the foregoing spousal support factors are inapplicable because the spousal support was agreed upon by the parties in the divorce entry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

In its order overruling appellant's objections to the magistrate's decision, the trial court noted several facts that support its classification of the attorney's fees and litigation expenses as spousal support. Specifically, the court found that appellant was aware that he owed appellee money, yet he purchased a home, removed significant amounts of money from his bank accounts during the pendency of this case, and spent what the court described as an \"inordinate amount of money\" less than one month after appellee filed her motion to show cause. Despite his clear obligation to pay appellee her share of his settlement proceeds, appellant chose to withhold the funds, forcing appellee into extensive litigation.
