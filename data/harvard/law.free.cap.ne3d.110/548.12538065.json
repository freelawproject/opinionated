GRENDELL, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Joseph A. Paolucci, appeals the denial of his Motion to Suppress by the Lake County Court of Common Pleas. The issue before this court is whether the R.C. 2935.03(D) requirements for effecting an extra-jurisdictional arrest are satisfied where a municipal police officer begins following a suspect after observing marked lanes violations but does not stop the suspect until after he has left the territorial jurisdiction of the municipality. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 19, 2016, the Lake County Grand Jury indicted Joseph A. Paolucci for Operating a Vehicle under the Influence of Alcohol, a Drug of Abuse, or a Combination of Them (Count 1), a felony of the third degree in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) with the specification that he \"has been previously convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or more violations of division (A) or (B) of R.C. \u00a7 4511.19 * * * within twenty years of committing this offense\" pursuant to R.C. 2941.1413, and Driving in Marked Lanes (Count 2), a minor misdemeanor in violation of R.C. 4511.33(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 7, 2016, Paolucci entered a plea of \"not guilty\" to all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 14, 2016, Paolucci filed a Motion to Suppress, to which the State responded on April 25, 2016. Paolucci filed a Supplemental Motion to Suppress on May 25, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On May 27, 2016, a hearing was held on the Motion to Suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On July 15, 2016, the trial court entered an Order Denying Motion to Suppress Evidence. The court made the following relevant findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 22, 2015, at about 12:26 a.m., Officer [Donald] Swindell [of the Mentor Police Department] * * * saw the defendant operate a motor vehicle, a silver 2011 Chevrolet Camaro, northbound on S.R. 306 and commit a marked lane traffic violation by at least one tire drifting completely over and left of the double-yellow lane divider just north of the eastbound exit/entrance ramps of S.R. 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The officer * * * followed the defendant as he entered the westbound ramp from S.R. 306 to S.R. 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The officer was behind the defendant when he saw the defendant commit a second lane violation, by at least one tire going completely left of the left-hand yellow longitudinal lane marking on the ramp.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   While traveling westbound on S.R. 2 in the right-hand lane, just east of the Mentor-Willoughby corporation line, but in the City of Mentor, according to the officer, the defendant crossed the left-hand broken lane line into the center lane with at least one tire, constituting a third marked lanes violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The officer activated his emergency lights at the top of the exit ramp. The defendant turned right onto Lost Nation Road and immediately turned left on Reeves Road and stopped shortly after turning onto Reeves Road.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The officer had reasonable suspicion from the defendant's erratic driving to believe that the defendant was either committing serial marked lane violations or that the defendant was an impaired driver, or both. The officer's police training indicated that further investigation was necessary to buttress his reasonable suspicions and determine his method of approach. The officer followed the defendant for about 45 seconds outside the City of Mentor to the next exit on S.R. 2. The facts support a finding that the\n   pursuit of the defendant by the officer began within his jurisdiction and without unreasonable delay after the marked lane offenses were committed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The officer complied with R.C. 2935.03(D) in pursuing, arresting, and detaining the defendant outside the jurisdiction of the Mentor Police Department, because the officer's pursuit took place without unreasonable delay after the offense was committed, the pursuit was initiated within the City of Mentor, and the offense involved was an offense for which points are chargeable pursuant to R.C. 4510.036.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On January 27, 2017, Paolucci entered a written plea of \"no contest\" to the first count of the Indictment, Operating a Vehicle under the Influence of Alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On March 9, 2017, the trial court sentenced Paolucci to serve a definite term of incarceration of twenty-four months for Operating a Vehicle under the Influence of Alcohol and an additional one-year term for the specification and imposed a mandatory fine of $1,350. Paolucci's driver's license was permanently revoked, his vehicle was declared forfeit, and he was ordered to undergo mandatory drug and alcohol treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On April 12, 2017, Paolucci filed a Notice of Appeal. On appeal, Paolucci raises the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"[1.] The trial court erred by failing to grant a motion to suppress when Mentor Police violated the guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures established by Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution, by initiating a traffic stop for a minor misdemeanor outside of police jurisdiction and without statutory authority to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Properly speaking, the pursuit began immediately after Swindell observed the first marked lanes violation on S.R. 306 when he began following Paolucci. That Swindell did not immediately effect a stop was reasonable. As he explained at the suppression hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I was following the vehicle just to observe his driving. His lane violations * * * weren't endangering other people; however, they were violations nonetheless. So I was following the vehicle to see how his driving was continuing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Also, Swindell effected the stop less than a minute after leaving the territorial jurisdiction of Mentor. The delay in effecting the actual stop in circumstances such as these has been found reasonable.\n   <em>\n    State v. Black\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

Hence, many cases have held that an officer begins pursuit within her own jurisdiction when she radios descriptive information to fellow officers who eventually stop and arrest a suspect in another jurisdiction. In\n   <em>\n    Terrace Park v. McBride\n   </em>\n   (Dec. 11, 1985), Hamilton App. No. C-850061 [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1985%20WL%204304\">\n    1985 WL 4304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], unreported, a police officer saw two cars driving erratically, one driven by the defendant. The officer stopped one of the cars and radioed to another officer to detain defendant's car, which had already left the officers' jurisdiction. Defendant was detained for fifteen minutes until the first officer arrived to arrest him. The court found the officer's action to be a \"pursuit\" under R.C. 2935.03. The Eighth District Court of Appeals held in\n   <em>\n    State v. Majors\n   </em>\n   (Mar. 23, 1989), Cuyahoga App. No. 56410 [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1989%20WL%2027769\">\n    1989 WL 27769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], unreported, that an arrest was authorized by R.C. 2935.03 where a police detective investigating an earlier breaking and entering came upon a car driven by the defendant which matched a prior radio description, stopped the car and held it while witnesses were summoned for purposes of identifying the suspect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In a similar drunk driving case, the court held in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Counsel's interpretation is nonsensical since, if marked lanes violation was listed in divisions (C)(1) through (14), division (C)(15) would be redundant. Rather, \"reported under this section\" refers to the bureau of motor vehicles' duty to \"maintain records of convictions * * * for any violation of a state law or a municipal ordinance regulating the operation of vehicles\" as provided for by R.C. 4510.036(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
