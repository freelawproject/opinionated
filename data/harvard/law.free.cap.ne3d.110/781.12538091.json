She was taken to jail and arraigned the following day by video link, at which time she entered into an uncounseled guilty plea. The court sentenced her to a fine and ten days in jail, but suspended her jail sentence on the condition that she obey all laws for two years and serve six months of community control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Subsequently, Ms. Milano filed a motion to withdraw her guilty plea. Because the audio recording of her plea hearing was incomplete, she attached to her motion to withdraw the partial recording and an affidavit. In her affidavit, she averred that the court had accepted her guilty plea without informing her of certain items, including the effect of her plea. She further averred that, had she been properly advised, she would have retained counsel and would not have pleaded guilty. Upon review, the trial court denied her motion to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Ms. Milano now appeals from the court's judgment and raises one assignment of error for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING [MS.] MILANO'S MOTION TO WITHDRAW HER GUILTY PLEA WITHOUT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING WHERE [MS.] MILANO, A PREGNANT, PRO-SE DEFENDANT ENTERED HER GUILTY PLEA AT HER FIRST ARRAIGNMENT AND THE RECORD CONTAINS NO INDICATION THAT SHE WAS ADVISED OF HER CONSTITUTIONAL TRIAL RIGHTS, THE STATUTORY PENALTIES OF THE CHARGE, THE ELEMENTS OR NATURE OF THE OFFENSE, OR THE EFFECT OF A GUILTY PLEA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In her assignment of error, Ms. Milano argues that the trial court erred when it denied her motion to withdraw her guilty plea.

Thus, this Court cannot conclude that the trial court advised Ms. Milano of the effect of her plea in writing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-3496\">\n    2016-Ohio-3496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203403006\">\n    2016 WL 3403006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 9, quoting\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Even assuming the trial judge remembered a plea he accepted by video link more than a year earlier, he never indicated that he recalled telling Ms. Milano about the effect of her guilty plea. He only recalled the fact that, during the colloquy, he had reviewed with Ms. Milano the acknowledgement and waiver of rights form. Yet, the form did not address the effect of her plea. \"Due to the lack of any indication in the record that the trial court informed [Ms. Milano] of the effect of [her] guilty plea, [this Court] determine[s] that there [was] a complete lack of compliance\n   with Crim.R. 11.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-480\">\n    2016-Ohio-480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20542633\">\n    2016 WL 542633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} As noted, \"[a] trial court's 'complete failure to comply with [ Crim.R. 11 ] will result in [the vacating] of [a] plea, regardless of whether prejudice has been shown.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8, quoting\n   <em>\n    Beach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-3445\">\n    2015-Ohio-3445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20N.E.3d%20187\">\n    41 N.E.3d 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 31. Because the record supports Ms. Milano's contention that she did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently enter her plea, it was unreasonable for the trial court to deny her motion to withdraw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-3496\">\n    2016-Ohio-3496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203403006\">\n    2016 WL 3403006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 11-13.

In this particular instance, however, the trial court approved a partial transcript and indicated that it was denying Ms. Milano's motion because it specifically recalled having reviewed the acknowledgement and waiver of rights form with her during her plea hearing. The court never claimed that it orally notified Ms. Milano of the effect of her guilty plea, and the acknowledgment and waiver of rights form itself is part of the record. Thus, Ms. Milano has not predicated her argument upon a silent record. Under these unique facts and circumstances, this Court declines to presume regularity due to the absence of a complete transcript.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
