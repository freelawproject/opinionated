L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, and on her claim of intentional interference with advantageous business relations. The defendants had terminated Tam's employment as a property manager for the Federal Management Company (company), and Tam argues that the defendants' explanation for the termination provided a false reason and, as a result, her dismissal was unlawful discrimination. The defendants counter that Tam failed to offer evidence of pretext or discriminatory animus to support her claim of discrimination. We affirm, essentially for the reasons well explained in the judge's thoughtful memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . On March 27, 2012, defendant John Desjardins, senior property manager at the company and Tam's direct supervisor, went to Mason Place, an affordable housing property located in the Chinatown section of Boston, to reprimand the maintenance technician for losing his master keys. Desjardins, along with Tam, presented the technician with a written warning that the technician acknowledged and signed; the technician then asked to speak with Desjardins privately. The technician told Desjardins that, at that time, there were several apartments in the building that were listed as rented, but that, in fact, were unoccupied. He showed Desjardins four such apartments that appeared to be vacant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Tam had worked as property manager at the facility since May, 2005. In addition to overseeing the day-to-day operations of the property, Tam was responsible for compliance with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations. Complying with those regulations required Tam to verify that each tenant's apartment was the tenant's primary residence; in addition, as part of the annual HUD \"section eight\" recertification process, Tam was required to obtain an original signature from each tenant on the appropriate form. Tam was aware that failing to obtain an original tenant signature on the HUD recertification form was grounds for termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The following week, Desjardins returned to the facility, accompanied by Peter Lewis, the vice president of the company. The two presented to Tam a \"rent roll\" for the facility and asked her to identify every unit in the facility that was unoccupied. In addition to the four units Desjardins had seen the previous week, Tam identified four more unoccupied units. After reviewing the tenant files for each of those eight units, Desjardins and Lewis found that some of the tenant signatures that appeared on the HUD recertification forms looked different from the signatures on corresponding rent checks and other papers in the respective tenant files. The two concluded that some of the tenants had not personally signed the HUD recertification forms; this lapse directly violated HUD regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 18, 2012, Lewis and Desjardins met again with Tam and presented her with a letter terminating her employment. The letter stated that the reason for her termination was \"a violation of company policy\"; Lewis and Desjardins then verbally explained to Tam that she had violated company policy when she failed to obtain original tenant signatures on the HUD recertification forms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Tam's departure, the company undertook to fill her position with a candidate who spoke, as Tam did, Mandarin and Cantonese.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A previous applicant for a different position within the company declined the position, and the company then placed advertisements in various publications, including a Chinese language newspaper. Desjardins determined that none of the nine candidates who applied for Tam's position possessed the required experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the meantime, in May, 2012, the company temporarily filled the position with Rob Vreeland, a then current employee who had been displaced after a contract expired at another facility managed by the company. Vreeland was a forty-five year old white male, who did not speak Mandarin or Cantonese. Eventually, in June, 2012, after failing to find a qualified candidate from the pool of applicants, the company stopped its search and placed Vreeland permanently into the property manager position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 16, 2015, Tam filed suit against the defendants, alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color, age, and gender in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (counts I through III), and intentional interference with advantageous business relations (count IV). After an April 17, 2017, hearing, the defendants' motion for summary judgment was allowed. The judge acknowledged the defendants' concession that Tam had established a prima facie case, but found that the defendants had \"put forth credible evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating [Tam]'s employment.\" He concluded that Tam had failed to establish that the defendants' stated reasons for termination were a pretext and therefore allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Tam timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"We review a grant of summary judgment de novo to determine 'whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    DeWolfe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hingham Centre, Ltd\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275193\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/464/795/#p799\">\n    464 Mass. 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 (2013), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Juliano\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272388\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/527/#p529\">\n    461 Mass. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529-530 (2012).
