(\"Dickson\"), regarding appellant's claim for legal malpractice. Specifically, appellant argues that genuine issues of material fact existed that precluded the granting of summary judgment. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The instant matter arose from a dispute between appellant and Dickson regarding Dickson's representation in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-11-766580, a nursing home negligence case. The negligence case settled in January 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-15-850029, appellant filed a complaint for legal malpractice against Dickson on August 20, 2015. On February 4, 2016, appellant filed a notice of voluntary dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a). The trial court dismissed the case without prejudice on February 5, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant refiled her legal malpractice claim against Dickson on February 3, 2017. Appellant requested $25,000 in compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney fees, and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On April 7, 2017, Dickson filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing\n   that appellant's claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations and that she failed to establish damages. Appellant filed a brief in opposition to Dickson's summary judgment motion on June 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On July 10, 2017, the trial court granted Dickson's motion for summary judgment. The trial court's judgment entry provides, in relevant part, \"construing all facts in favor of [appellant] and finding no genuine issue of material fact remains, the court hereby grants [Dickson's] motion for summary judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} It is from this judgment that appellant filed the instant appeal on July 28, 2017. She assigns one error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I. The trial court erred in granting [Dickson's] motion for summary judgment finding that there are no genuine issues of material fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In order to obtain summary judgment, the moving party must show that \"(1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Appellant further asserted that she did not discover the information in the trial court's September 9, 2014 judgment entry in CV-11-766580 until May 2017. The trial court's judgment entry, addressing Dickson's motions to intervene and to withdraw as appellant's counsel, provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The stipulation for dismissal and judgment entry, filed on 1/11/2013, in the instant action states that \"the attorneys for the respective parties, do hereby stipulate the within case has been settled, to be dismissed with prejudice at defendant's cost, at a sum approved by both parties'.\" The stipulation for dismissal was an unconditional dismissal[.] It did not state that this court shall retain jurisdiction over any and all post dismissal settlement issues and dispute. The stipulation for dismissal dated January 11, 2013, dismisses the case with prejudice, without any further filings as to the dismissal or settlement agreement in the instant action. Therefore, this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain [Dickson's] motion to intervene in order to assert claim for unpaid attorney's fees and costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, appellant suggested that after she fired Dickson, he purposefully withheld her case files and was uncooperative, aggressive, verbally abusive, and disrespectful towards her to ensure that the statute of limitations expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 15} After reviewing the record, we find that appellant's legal malpractice claim falls outside the one-year statute of limitations under both the \"cognizable event\" test and the termination of the attorney-client relationship test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The language of appellant's March 21, 2014 letter was patently inconsistent with a continued attorney-client relationship between appellant and Dickson. Accordingly, the question of when the attorney-client relationship between appellant and Dickson was terminated was properly decided as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steindler\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

She did not, however, allege that Dickson continued to do any work\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   her, or that he provided any legal counsel to her relating to the nursing home negligence case at any time after the case was settled in January 2013 or after she fired Dickson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Based on the foregoing analysis, we find that appellant filed her original legal malpractice complaint more than one year after the attorney-client relationship terminated. Accordingly, appellant's sole assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Based on our determination that appellant's claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations, we need not consider, as an alternative basis for granting summary judgment in favor of Dickson, whether appellant failed to establish damages proximately caused by Dickson's alleged breach of his professional duty arising from the attorney-client relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to appellant, as we must, we find that appellant failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact in order to defeat Dickson's motion for summary judgment, and that reasonable minds can only conclude that appellant's legal malpractice claim was time-barred under both the \"cognizable event\" and the termination of the attorney-client relationship tests. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Dickson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   MARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J., and LARRY A.
