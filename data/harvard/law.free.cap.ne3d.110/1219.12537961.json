We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Factual background\n   </em>\n   . The offenses arise from the defendant's relationship with two young girls in his girl friend's extended family: Amy\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Barbara.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amy is the defendant's girl friend's niece and Barbara is Amy's younger half-sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   When she was a child, Amy would visit her father, who lived in a house with a number of family members, including Amy's aunt, the defendant's girl friend (aunt). Amy testified that beginning when she was \"a little girl in elementary school,\" the defendant would sexually abuse her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The first time this happened, she was five or six years old, and was watching cartoons on a bed at the house shared by her father and aunt. The defendant put a pillow over her eyes, pulled down her pants and underwear, and put his tongue and hands on her vagina. When he did this, she urinated on herself. The incident ended when the defendant heard someone approach and quickly put her clothes back on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The abuse continued over time, and when Amy was eight or nine, the defendant moved into a separate apartment with Amy's aunt and their infant son. Amy visited her aunt's apartment frequently on the weekends and after school, and the defendant would sexually abuse her every time she stayed at their apartment. The majority of the abuse happened in her cousin's room, where she would sleep when she stayed with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After everyone was asleep, the defendant would come into the room and pull Amy's pants down. He would put his tongue on and in her vagina, and touch her vagina and chest with his hands. He also sometimes put her hand on his penis and used it to masturbate himself. He would not speak to her during the assaults, a number of which occurred while Barbara was sleeping in the same room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As Amy continued to grow older, the offenses continued, but she \"gained a little bit of courage\" and began to push the defendant away physically. As she became stronger, she noticed that he attempted abuse less and less frequently, and eventually stopped altogether when Amy was in high school. Ultimately, during a period of time in high school after the assaults had ended, Amy first disclosed the abuse to a boy friend, and made him promise not to tell anyone about what she had told him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Barbara testified that because of her relationship with Amy, she was very close to Amy's aunt while growing up, and stayed at the apartment the aunt shared with the defendant approximately every other week. The defendant began to sexually abuse Barbara when she was six years old, waking her up by touching her chest under her shirt. While she pretended that she was asleep, he pulled down her pants, touched and penetrated her vagina with his fingers, and put her hand on his penis. When he was done, he pulled her pants back up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After this, the defendant would sexually abuse Barbara each time she stayed at his home, always touching her chest and digitally penetrating her vagina, and sometimes using her hand to touch his penis. When she was eight or nine years old, the defendant also began putting his tongue on and in her vagina. When she was nine, he began to penetrate her vagina with his penis. He did not speak during these assaults, which continued until Barbara was fourteen or fifteen years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Barbara first disclosed the abuse to a close friend when she was in high school. Shortly after this, she and Amy disclosed the abuse to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . a.\n   <em>\n    Juror bias\n   </em>\n   . The defendant challenges the judge's refusal to excuse for cause a member of the venire who, through \"therapy or 12-step groups,\" had been acquainted with both perpetrators and victims of sexual violence. The defendant used a peremptory challenge to remove that juror, juror number (no.) 112, and later stated for the record his intent to use peremptory challenges to remove other jurors had his challenges not already been exhausted. Accordingly, the defendant's challenge of juror no. 112 for cause is preserved for review.

The judge then asked if there was anything about the allegations that would affect the juror's ability to afford the defendant a fair trial, and the juror answered, \"I don't think so.\" When asked whether he or anybody he knew was a victim of sexual assault, the juror stated that he had participated as a member of therapeutic groups that included adults who had been sexually assaulted as children. When the judge asked if, in light of those connections, he could render a fair, just, and impartial verdict based on the evidence, the juror responded, \"I think it would certainly make me alive to the realities of the consequences for someone who is a victim.\" The judge then refocused the juror on the original question, asking if he thought he \"could do it,\" and the juror responded in the affirmative. Later in the voir dire, the juror indicated that he had also been acquainted with people \"through those same circles\" who had perpetrated sexual assaults. When asked if, given this, he would be able to render a fair, just, and impartial verdict in the case, he responded, \"Yes. My sense is that it would be a wash. Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"As a general principle, it is an abuse of discretion to empanel a juror who will not state unequivocally that he or she will be impartial.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Colton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451883\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/1/#p17\">\n    477 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17 (2017), citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Long\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823709\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/419/798/#p804\">\n    419 Mass. 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 804 (1995).

The defendant argues that the judge erroneously denied his request for two additional peremptory challenges when, after he had exhausted his sixteen initial challenges, two seated jurors were excused for hardship. He contends that had he known that the jury had three seats left to fill (rather than a single seat), he would have chosen to use his challenges differently. The defendant cites no authority, nor is this panel aware of any authority, in support of the proposition that a judge who unexpectedly excuses a sitting juror during empanelment is mandated to offer additional peremptory challenges to the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant received and exercised the sixteen peremptory challenges to which he was entitled, pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Mass.%20889\">\n    378 Mass. 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). \"[T]here is no support in this record that additional challenges were required in order to obtain an impartial jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Leahy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2822459\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/481/#p495\">\n    445 Mass. at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lattimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"898104\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/396/446/#p450\">\n    396 Mass. 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450 (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    First complaint\n   </em>\n   . The defendant claims that evidence presented by the Commonwealth at trial gave rise to multiple violations of the first complaint doctrine, and created reversible error. Specifically, the defendant challenges testimony regarding a conversation between Amy and Barbara about the defendant's abuse, and testimony regarding the content of Barbara's sexual abuse intervention network (SAIN) interview. We review for abuse of discretion. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849734\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/581/#p583\">\n    83 Mass.

Of the short series of questions eliciting this information, the defendant objected only to the question \"do you remember when that was?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On cross-examination of Amy, defense counsel revisited this conversation repeatedly. He asked whether Barbara had indicated during the conversation that she had told a friend before telling Amy about the abuse. He asked as well whether during the conversation Amy had told Barbara about a dream she had had about the defendant. He also extensively questioned Amy about her and Barbara's life circumstances and family relationships at the time of the conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defense counsel continued to explore the conversation on cross-examination of Barbara,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   inquiring about similar topics, and additionally asking whether the conversation included discussion of their mother. He then cross-examined Barbara extensively about prior statements she had made identifying the August, 2010, conversation with Amy as the first time she had disclosed the abuse, in contrast to her trial testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On redirect, the prosecutor asked Barbara if her \"whole conversation in August of 2010 [with Amy was] about the dream.\" Barbara responded in the negative, and over repeated objections, the prosecutor elicited a description of the conversation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"She called me and said that she had a dream that Kenny was out to get her. And I said, what do you mean. And she said that he was trying to kill her. And I said, why are you having dreams like that.... She asked me did Kenny ever do anything to me. I said, what do you mean. She said, did he ever touch you. And I told her, yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Barbara then testified that Amy had told her \"what had happened to her\" as well. On recross, defense counsel again examined Barbara as to her inconsistent statements regarding her first disclosure of abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We discern no prejudice from any error in the Commonwealth's introduction of evidence regarding the conversation between Barbara and Amy, as the conversation formed an essential part of the defense at trial. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668562\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/838/#p851\">\n    456 Mass. 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851 (2010) (\"Where the inconsistencies contained in the cumulative first complaint testimony were more important to the defense than the Commonwealth, there is no harm to the defendant\"). That Amy and Barbara discussed the abuse in August of 2010 was essentially part and parcel of the defense case. Throughout the trial, the defendant forcefully argued that in the summer of 2010, the two collaborated in fabricating the allegations in order to gain sympathy from family members while managing difficult personal circumstances. He also argued that one of the sisters (Barbara) was not credible because she was inconsistent in who she claimed she had first disclosed the abuse to.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Testimony elicited by the prosecutor about the content of the conversation \"contained no repetition of the horrific details of the abuse\" and was fairly brief.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Revells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3840124\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/78/492/#p499\">\n    78 Mass. App. Ct. 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499 (2010). Because the challenged testimony was not unduly inflammatory and, most importantly, because the defendant expansively capitalized on it throughout the trial, its admission did not prejudice the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    SAIN interview\n   </em>\n   . Defense counsel cross-examined Barbara extensively about her SAIN interview, inquiring about the procedure and setting of the interview, and playing a small portion of it for the jury. He then highlighted the contradiction between Barbara's trial testimony and statements made in her SAIN interview as to the identity of the first person she had told of the abuse, and the age at which the abuse began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defense counsel inquired of Barbara whether she had said during the SAIN interview that she \"didn't have a good memory of what happened,\" and that she did not recall what the defendant did to her at one of his residences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   He elicited that she had said during the SAIN interview that she thought Amy would be present during the interview, that she wanted her present, and that she had a \"better recollection\" of what happened when Amy talked about it. He additionally asked whether she had \"rehearse[d]\" her testimony with people at the district attorney's office prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On redirect, the prosecutor elicited a brief summary of Barbara's SAIN interview. Over the defendant's objection, Barbara testified that she had told the SAIN interviewer that the defendant \"made [her] touch him,\" touched her breasts and vagina, \"performed oral sex\" on her, kissed her, and put his penis \"inside of [her].\" At the conclusion of this series of questions, the prosecutor asked, \"And all those details you told the interviewer, are those the same things that you've testified about?\" Barbara responded in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The brief summary of Barbara's SAIN interview was proper. The defendant's cross-examination of Barbara insinuated that she was, at the time of the SAIN interview, unable to recall the abuse in any meaningful way without contemporaneous coaching from Amy. It was proper to allow the Commonwealth to elicit evidence in summary form demonstrating that Barbara's memory of the assaults at the time of the SAIN included the pertinent details of the offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The first complaint doctrine \"does not exclude testimony that 'is otherwise independently admissible' and serves a purpose 'other than to repeat the fact of a complaint and thereby corroborate the complainant's accusations.' \"\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668562\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/838/#p851\">\n    456 Mass. at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657181\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/453/214/#p220\">\n    453 Mass. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220-221, 229 (2009). Here, admission of subsequent complaint testimony was proper because it \"was received for the independent purpose of rebutting the inferences raised by the defendant's inquiries ... and was necessary for a fair understanding of the Commonwealth's case.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833356\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/75/505/#p510\">\n    75 Mass.

There was no error in Barbara's summary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We note, however, that Barbara's testimony affirming that the details she had told the SAIN interviewer were \"the same things that [she had] testified about,\" was not admissible.

[The cousin], the beloved cousin. What did they gain? Think about [Barbara] talking about how hard it is to lose [that cousin].

No way. Painful details, painful consequences of telling.\" Though inartful, the statement did not constitute error. The prosecutor was entitled to argue that Amy and Barbara had no motive to lie as a response to the defendant's forceful argument that the two had fabricated the abuse together to gain family support. Though the phrase \"[p]ainful details\" is unfortunate, it appears in context to have been a reference to the level of detail in the witnesses' testimony, rather than to any subjective discomfort the testimony may have caused Amy and Barbara.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   To the extent that the jury may have misunderstood this reference, the remark was brief and fleeting, and gave rise to no prejudice in the context of a closing argument spanning approximately twenty pages of transcript.

The defendant argues that a number of statements in the prosecutor's closing argument constituted unfair disparagement of the defense and burden-shifting. In particular, he challenges statements in which the prosecutor suggested that defense counsel was making an \"illogical, unfounded accusation\" against Amy, and that he \"want[ed the jury] to think this is all one big lie for some unclear motive.\" He also challenges the prosecutor's exhortation not to \"let him blame [Amy] for what this guy did to [Barbara].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Prosecutors are permitted to forcefully argue the \"inherent implausibility or unreliability\" of a defendant's claim or theory of defense.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gerhartsreiter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3847312\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/82/500/#p513\">\n    82 Mass.
