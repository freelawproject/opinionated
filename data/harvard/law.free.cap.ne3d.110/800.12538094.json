For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In August 2016, Johnson was charged in a ten-count indictment. Count 1 charged him with aggravated murder. Count 2 charged him with murder. Counts 3, 4, 6, and 7 charged him with felonious assault. Count 5 charged him with attempted murder. Count 8 charged him with discharging a firearm at or near a prohibited premises. Counts 9 and 10 charged him with having a weapon while under disability (\"HWWUD\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The matter proceeded to a jury trial, at which the following evidence was adduced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On July 5, 2016, Maurio Ayers (\"Ayers\") was killed in a drive-by shooting on Thornhill Drive in Cleveland. Charles Wright (\"Wright\"), who lives on Thornhill Drive, was also shot and injured in the incident. Melton Peoples (\"Peoples\") was visiting with Wright when the shooting occurred. Peoples testified that Ayers stopped by in his car around 8:30 p.m. Peoples and Wright approached the street and stood on the sidewalk talking with Ayers for approximately 15-20 minutes when another vehicle approached. Peoples described the car as a dark grayish, tanish, brownish color. As this vehicle passed, Wright said \"[t]hat * * * Zach [Johnson] right there.\" There were some issues between Ayers and Johnson because Ayers allegedly stole some drugs and money from Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Johnson's car turned back around toward Peoples, Wright, and Ayers. Peoples testified that he observed two or three people in the car with guns pointing out the windows. Peoples then dropped to the ground for safety and was able to avoid injury. He heard approximately six to eight gunshots. Ayers was shot in the back, and Wright was shot in the foot. After the shooting, Ayers told Peoples and Wright that he was going to the hospital and sped away in his car. He subsequently crashed into a nearby church at the corner of Thornhill Drive and Arlington Avenue, where he died of his gunshot wound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Meanwhile, Peoples and Wright ran into Wright's house. Before the police arrived, Peoples fled to his sister's house, but returned to the scene after learning that the shooting was fatal. Both Peoples and Wright spoke to the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Derrick Miller (\"Miller\") testified that Johnson confessed to killing Ayers when they were both in county jail awaiting trials in their respective cases. Miller explained that it is common for inmates to discuss the crimes they committed that brought them to jail. He knew both Johnson and Ayers prior to his incarceration. During one of these conversations with Johnson, Johnson told Miller that he murdered Ayers in revenge because Ayers had robbed him of drugs and money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} According to Miller, Johnson staged a drug deal in order to come into contact with Ayers to kill him. Johnson allegedly told Miller that he used a machine gun known as a \"Mack 90,\" but the casings found at the scene came from a hand gun. Miller also told a Cleveland detective that Johnson was driving a black BMW that night. Miller admitted that he agreed to testify against Johnson in order to obtain a favorable plea agreement with the state in his own case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The defense called another inmate, Quentin Allison (\"Allison\"), to testify as a rebuttal witness to Miller's testimony. Allison testified that inmates rarely discuss their cases, especially with strangers, but some inmates \"snitch\" to get their time reduced. Allison admitted, however, that Johnson is one of his childhood friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The state presented testimony from DNA and ballistics experts. There was no DNA evidence on the bullet casings found on the scene that linked Johnson to the crimes. Nor was the ballistics expert able to identify any gunshot residue on the victim, which indicated that the muzzle to target distance was not close.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The state also presented the testimony of Todd Wiles (\"Wiles\"), a crime analyst with the Cleveland Police Department. He has been an analyst for 25 years. He has been to both federal and state law enforcement training academies for multiple cell phone analysis courses and is an active member of the International Association of Crime Analysts. The trial court accepted Wiles to testify as an expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Wiles testified that cell phone data placed Johnson's cell phone near the crime scene at the time of the shooting. However, Wiles conceded that determining a cell phone's location from cell tower data is not precise because the towers cover an area \"roughly a quarter of a mile\" in size. As a result, Wiles was unable to pinpoint the exact location of Johnson's cell phone at the time of the shooting. Through the data, Wiles was only able to narrow the range to a particular area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Cleveland Police Detective Arthur Echols (\"Detective Echols\") testified that Johnson lived at two different addresses, including 1105 Carlyon Road in East Cleveland. Johnson's sister testified that he was living at the Carlyon address at the time of the shooting. Detective Echols estimated that the Carlyon Road address was \"a quarter of mile to half a mile away\" from the crime scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Detective Echols attempted to set up a meeting with Wright to conduct an interview, but Wright was uncooperative with the investigation. In order to facilitate a meeting, Detective Echols met with Wright when he was scheduled for a meeting with his parole officer. Detective Echols had generated a photo array, with Johnson as the suspect. As a result of the photo array and Echols's interview with Wright, the police issued an arrest warrant for Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} At the conclusion of trial, the jury found Johnson guilty of all charges and the trial court found him guilty of the two HWWUD charges. After merging allied offenses, the court sentenced Johnson to a total of 31 years to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Johnson now appeals, raising the following six assignments of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court erred in allowing cell phone site testimony as it was both a discovery violation and was not\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   tested. The court also erred in qualifying the state's witness as an expert and admitting his testimony as such, as his conclusions were unreliable and were not within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The court violated [Johnson's] right to confrontation and due process when it improperly allowed the admission of incriminating and impermissible hearsay statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Three\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The state failed to present sufficient evidence of the offenses charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Four\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [Johnson's] convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Five\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Johnson] was denied due process and a fair and impartial trial as guaranteed by the 5th, 6th, and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Article I Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution based on prosecutorial misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Six\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Johnson] was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Cell Phone Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In the first assignment of error, Johnson argues the trial court erred by allowing Wiles to testify as an expert on cell phone analysis. He contends his testimony should have been excluded as a discovery violation and because the court failed to determine whether Wiles's expert testimony was scientifically reliable as required by Evid.R. 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

Wiles merely compared cell phone records that showed the location of cell towers \"hit\" by Johnson's cell phone at the time the murder occurred with the location of the crime scene.

The state also identified new witnesses to its witness list. These witnesses were discovered from Johnson's phone records because they spoke to him on his phone during the relevant time period.

The trial court indicated it would continue the trial for a month if necessary. Defense counsel objected to the admissibility of the evidence, but declined the continuance, citing his client's need to finish the trial.

As a result, this testimony was not testimonial hearsay. Peoples merely recounted Wright's present sense impression.

Therefore, there was no violation of the Confrontation Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 40} With regard to Andrea, Ayers's mother, Johnson contends that she provided testimonial hearsay.

She did not reiterate the name of her son's assailant, nor did she describe the manner of his death. This testimony was not offered to prove the circumstances of Ayers's death, but to explain how the case unfolded. Thus, there was no testimonial hearsay presented by Andrea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 42} With regard to Detective Echols's testimony, Detective Echols explained that Wright did not cooperate with the homicide investigation and that he had to \"ambush\" Wright during his visit with his parole officer in order to get Wright to identify the shooter.

Here, defense counsel specifically referred to \"trial strategy\" when deciding to decline the trial court's offer of a continuance on the day of trial.

Specifically, the state said, \"[Wright] tells [Andrea] who did the shooting, the one name that he knows.\" The context of the statement was that the evidence consistently pointed to Johnson as the shooter.
