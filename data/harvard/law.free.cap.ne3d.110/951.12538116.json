The trial court sentenced Fears to four years in prison on the Aggravated Burglary charge. On the Robbery charge, Fears was given a four year suspended prison sentence, with a mandatory five years of post-release control, and five years of community control to begin upon Fears' release from prison on the Aggravated Burglary charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On November 23, 2016, Fears was released from prison and placed on probation/community control. On April 4, 2017, a\n   \"Notice of Hearing Probation Violation\" was filed alleging that Fears had violated his probation. Fears pled to the violation and was found guilty by the trial court. By Judgment Entry filed May 8, 2017, Fears' community control was continued with the addition that he pay a $200.00 sanction and successfully complete \"Thinking for a Change.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 27, 2017, a \"Notice of Hearing Probation Violation\" was filed alleging that Fears had violated his probation. The Notice set forth in three separate counts the alleged violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 12, 2017, a probation violation hearing was conducted by the trial court. Fears admitted to the allegations contained in Counts 2 and Count 3 but denied the allegations contained in Count 1\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . T. September 15, 2017 at 4-5. A hearing was held concerning Fears' violation of Count 1, which alleged that Fears \"On or about 06/10/17... entered [a residence] without the consent of the person authorized to give consent\" and further, \"On or after 05/28/17...changed your residence without obtaining permission from your supervising officer.\" Id. at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The only witness called by the state during the revocation hearing was the probation officer, Mary Gates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Gates testified that Fears is on Community Control for the Robbery charge and Fears is on Post-release Control for the Aggravated Burglary charge. T. at 7. Gates testified that she went to the location that Fears was supposed to be residing on two occasions and no one answered the door. Gates left her card in the door on both occasions. T. at 9. Fears testified that she spoke on the telephone with Fears' wife on May 30, 2017, and she reported that he had not been home since May 28, 2017. T. at 10. Gates testified that on June 12, 2017, an officer from the Mansfield Police Department contacted her informing her that Fears went to the residence of his wife, kicked the door in and was shot by an alleged boyfriend who was at the home. T. at 11-13; 20. Gates also testified that The Northern Ohio Fugitive Task Force was attempting to locate Fears after this incident. T. at 13-14. Gates contacted the task force because she was in fear for the safety of Fears' wife. T. at 15. Fears further testified that Fears' wife had told her Fears was staying with his father in Cleveland. T. at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After his arrest, Gates met with Fears who told her that he never changed his address and was still living in Mansfield, not Cleveland. Fears claimed his wife was lying and trying to set him up. T. at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After listening to the testimony of Mary Gates, the Court ruled that Fears was guilty of changing his residence without obtaining permission from his supervision officer. The Court said it based its ruling for a number of reasons. The first reason the Court stated was that Fears' wife said so and that her testimony is uncontracted. T.at 40. The Court stated that Fears' wife had been a reliable reporter in the past so there was no reason to disbelieve her testimony. T. at 40. The Court also stated in its ruling that on June 10, 2017, that Fears could not get into his residence without kicking in the door. T. at 40, 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On July 13, 2017, a Community Control Violation Journal Entry was filed. The Court accepted Fears' admission to Community Control violations Count 2 and Count 3 and found Fears guilty of Community Control violation Count 1. Fears was\n   sentenced to 3 years of prison on the underlying charge of Robbery, along with 3 years of mandatory Community Control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Fears raises one assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"I. THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO AFFORD THE APPELLANT A FULL AND FAIR PROBATION REVOCATION HEARING AS REQUIRED BY DUE PROCESS AND GUARANTEED BY THE FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Law and Analyses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In finding that Fears was guilty of Count 1 of his probation violation/community control violation, Fears argues that the trial court violated his right to confront and cross-examine his accusers and erred in permitting the probation officer to testify to the hearsay statement alleged made by Fears' wife. However, Fears did not raise the constitutional argument at trial. Fears only objected to hearsay in the form of the Mansfield Police detective telling Gates that Fears had kicked the door in to his wife's residence and was shot by the wife's boyfriend.
