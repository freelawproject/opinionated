In the first trial of this cause in the District Court there was a judgment for the defendant, the Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company of New York, which was reversed by this court. The reasons for reversal are fully stated in the opinion. 259 Fed. 55,-C. C. A.-. This court in that case construed the contract in suit, and among other things held that the parties\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-9\">\u201cintended that kind of a loss which, in ordinary nomenclature and thought, comes into existence when the liability of the assured becomes irretrievably fixeu.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">The petition avers in substance that the liability of the assured has been irretrievably fixed by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The answer admits the truth of this averment. Therefore the District Court properly sustained the motion for a judgment on the pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
