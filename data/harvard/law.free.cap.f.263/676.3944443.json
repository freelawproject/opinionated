The Advance-Rumley Thresher Company, a corporation, was plaintiff below, and the appellant was defendant. The plaintiff was the owner of two tracts of land in the city of Grand Forks, U\u00ed. IX Each was in the business portion of the city. One was situated on Seventh street and International avenue and consisted of four platted lots known as lots 1, 3, 5, and 7, in block 7 in Griggs addition. The other was situated on Third street and consisted of a portion of one lot known as lot 12 in block 32 in original town site of Grand Forks. On each tract was a business building. Tho defendant had resided in Grand Forks for 30 years and had had contracts in connection with the building or repairs of each of the buildings. He was also engaged in the real estate business and knew the values of each of the tracts. The defendant in May, June, and July, 1918, had conducted negotiations by letters and telegrams with plaintiff for the purchase of tho Seventh street property, and had finally offered to pay $6,000 therefor. Tho plaintiff had accepted this offer subject to the approval of the board of directors. The directors at a meeting held soon thereafter voted to accept the bid and authorized the corporation\u2019s officers to execute a deed. A deed was executed and sent to the defendant in care of a local bank, and the defendant received the deed and paid $6,000 to the bank for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit; but this deed described the Third street properly, which was worth $15,000. This suit was brought to cancel this deed on the claim that it was executed by mistake.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The chief defense presented was that the execution of the deed was the result of plaintiff\u2019s negligence, and hence it was entitled to no relief. It was shown that plaintiff\u2019s place of business is at La Porte, Ind., and that it conducts a large business in the sale of machinery in many of the states and also in foreign countries. It owns hundreds of tracts of land in the United States. The title papers to these lands are kept in separate packets in a vault connected with its comptroller\u2019s office at La Porte. The comptroller\u2019s secretary arid stenographer, Mr. Neekerman, acts as custodian of these files. After the plaintiff\u2019s board of directors had authorized the conveyance of the Seventh street property, its comptroller turned over the correspondence and telegrams that had passed between it and the defendant to its general attorney, Mr. Winn, and asked him to prepare the papers for the sale of the property. Mr. Winn told his stenographer to see Mr. Neekerman and to obtain the file relating to the property at Seventh street and International avenue in Grand Forks. The stenographer did not ask Mr. Neekerman for this file, but for the Grand Forks property file. Mr. Neekerman knew there were two separate tracts in Grand Forks owned by the company, but he selected the file relating to the Third street property and gave it to the stenographer, presuming it was the one desired. Mr. Winn received this file from the stenographer, supposing it related to the Seventh street property. He made no comparison of the papers in it with the correspondence between the defendant and the company. On \u2022examination of some documents in this file, Mr. Winn became doubtful of the state of the title to some of the property to which it related. Thereupon on \u2022July Tth, he wired a message to the defendant that the company would convey its title \u201cto land we own between spur track and street in lot twelve, block thirty-two, Grand Forks, for six thousand dollars cash. Advise by wire where to send papers.\u201d In reply, the defendant, the same day, wired a message to plaintiff as follows: \u201cSend papers to First National Bank, Grand Forks, conveying to me property you own between spur track and street in lot twelve, block thirty-two, original town site, Grand Forks, six thousand dollars. Ad-' vise by wire, at my expense when you have mailed papers.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-4\">Mr. Winn prepared a deed, which is dated the next day, conveying the Third street property to the defendant on the supposition that it conveyed the Seventh street property as had been authorized by the board of directors, but relying only on the file his stenographer had brought him for the description of land conveyed. He presented the deed to the vice president of the company, who was authorized to execute such deeds. He told him that it was a deed of the property at Seventh street and International avenue, whose conveyance the board of directors had authorized, and the vice president, on this assurance, signed it without reading it. Some delays ensued and messages were exchanged between the plaintiff and the defendant relating to the furnishing of an abstract of title, hut on July I8th the deed was mailed to the bank at Grand Forks, with instructions to deliver it To defendant upon- his payment to it of $0,000. At once on its arrival at the bank the defendant paid the money and received the deed. Soon afterwards plaintiff began this suit. The trial court found that the deed was executed and delivered under a mistake of facts and without culpable negligence and also under circumstances which charged the defendant with knowledge or belief that a mistake had been made, and canceled the deed upon terms that are not now .in question.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b690-5\">George A. Bangs, of Grand Forks, N. D. (George R. Robbins, of Grand Forks, N. D., on the brief), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b690-6\">N. C.

It is the general rule that a written contract or deed cannot be annulled, in the absence of fraud, by proof that a party to it did not read it before he signed it, because it was his legal duty to read it or to have it read to him, and a failure to read it or to have it read to him is gross negligence. Upton, Assignor, v. Tribilcock, 91 U. S. 45, 23 L. Ed. 203; Chicago, St. P., M. &amp; O. Ry. Co. v. Belliwith, 83 Red. 437, 28 C. C. A. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In this case the vice president had the assurance of Winn, the general attorney for the company and its trusted legal advisor, who had served the company for many years, that the deed was for the Seventh street property which the directors had voted to convey. Reliance on such a statement was not negligence. In the practical conduct of the affairs of large modern business organizations, action upon such reliance is the common and necessary method of managing its business, or, in other words, it is what ordinarily prudent men constantly do.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is also said that the stenographer was negligent in failing to call for the file she had been told to obtain, that the document clerk was negligent in failing to ascertain the proper one of the two files relating to the Grand Forks properties, and that Mr. Winn was negligent in failing to- compare the description o\u00a3 the property in the file brought to him, with the description referred to in the correspondence with defendant, before he sent his message to defendant and when he prepared and sent the deed to 'defendant. Appellant claims that a party cannot be relieved from the consequences of a mistake, if the party making the mistake had the means of knowledge of the true state of facts, and made the mistake because of his want of ordinary care, and in support of this principle are cited cases such as Gryrnes v. Sanders, 93 U. S. 55, 23 L. Ed. 798; Files v. Brown, 124 Fed. 133, 59 C. C. A. 403; Burk v. Johnson, 146 Fed. 209, 76 C. C. A. 567; Great Western Mfg. Co. v. Adams, 176 Bed. 325, 99 C. C. A. 615; Bailey v. Fisle Mfg. Co., 238 Fed. 257, 152 C. C. A. 3. The authority of these cases is undoubted, but the rule that is applicable to the facts in this case is supplied by the statutes of North Dakota. Section. 5934 of the North Dakota Civil Code (Compiled Raws 1913) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">\u201cA party to a contract may rescind tilo same in the following cases only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\u201c(1) If the consent o\u00a3 the party rescinding, or of any party jointly contracting with him was given by mistake or obtained through duress, menace, fraud or -undue inhuonce exercised by or with the connivance of the party as to whom he rescinds or of any other party to the contract jointly interested with such party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Section 5854 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">\u201cMistake of fact is a mistake not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake and consisting in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">\u201c(1) An unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact past or present material to the contract; or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-12\">\u201c(2) Belief in the present existence of a thing material to the contract which does not exist, or in the past existence of such a thing which has not existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> An enlargement of equitable rights given by a state statute may be administered by the United States court as well as by the courts of the state. Case of Broderick\u2019s Will, 21 Wall. 520, 22 L. Ed. 599; Holland v. Challen, 110 U. S. 15, 3 Sup. Ct. 495, 28 L. Ed. 52; Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436, 20 Sup. Ct. 919, 44 L. Ed. 1140; Devine v. Los Angeles, 202 U. S. 313, 26 Sup. Ct. 652, 50 L. Ed. 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Under the provisions of the North Dakota Code which has been quoted, the mistake of fact which authorizes a decree of rescission or cancellation is \u201ca mistake not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake,\u201d and may consist in an unconscious forgetfulness of a present or past fact material to the contract. The Supreme Court of North Dakota in the case of Benesh v. Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., 14 N. D. 39, 103 N. W. 405, quoted this statutory definition of mistake and applied it to a written contract agreeing to convey more land than the grantor intended to convey and held a rescission to be authorized. It also repelled the suggestion that relief should be denied because of the grantor\u2019s negligence in failing to examine accessible papers from which a correct description of the property could have been obtained, holding that failure to avail one\u2019s self of the means of knowledge did not bar relief from mistake provided there is no \u201cneglect of a legal duty.\u201d The acts of the stenographer, document clerk, and general attorney of the plaintiff upon which the defendant relies as constituting negligence cannot be said to be the neglect of legal duties, but were acts of unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of facts. Not every act of negligence is a neglect of legal duty. 2 Pom. Eq. Jur. \u00a7 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The evidence was clear and convincing that plaintiff\u2019s deed was executed and delivered under a \u201cmistake\u201d as defined in the state statute. The evidence is also convincing in support of the trial court\u2019s finding that Bailes knew, or at least suspected and had good reason to know, when he received the deed, that a mistake had been made by the vendor. The parties had long negotiated for the sale of the Seventh street tract and the transaction had practically been closed, and neither party had suggested the sale of the Third street tract. The price mentioned in Winn\u2019s telegram was identical with the price agreed on in the prior negotiations as to the other property. It was a grossly inadequate price for the Third street property, and defendant was aware of that fact. The defendant showed unusual haste and secrecy in accepting the deed before he had examined the abstract of title, and many circumstances indicate that he knew he was obtaining a deed to property that the grantor did not intend to convey. His position is not that of a favorite in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The decree of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b692-7\">SANBORN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aa7W\">(dissenting). I am unahle to bring my mind to the conclusion that the vendor of valuable real estate 1 does not owe to his vendee the legal duty to ascertain and use in his negotiations for the sale and in his conveyance thereof, a description which clearly identifies the property, or to the conclusion that when he not only fails so to do, but actually uses one throughout the negotiations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>and in his conveyance which clearly describes another tract, he does not fail in the discharge of his legal duty to his vendee. This was what the thresher company did, and, although it did this by means of its agent and employes, it is not less liable to the legal and equitable consequences of its inexcusable negligence than an individual would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Moreover, this is a suit in equity by the thresher company versus Bailes, its vendee, and the real question is: Has Bailes in this transaction failed to discharge any duty he owed to his vendor, or has he committed any injustice or inequity towards him? The record contains no evidence of any such failure, or of any such act. He accepted a plain telegraphic offer by the thresher company to sell to him a clearly described tract of land, took the thresher company\u2019s deed, and paid the thresher company its price for it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">\u201cA court of equity,\u201d says the Supreme Court, \u201ccan act only on the conscience of a party; if he has done nothing that taints it, no demand can attach upon it, so as to giro any jurisdiction. * * * Strong as a plaintiff\u2019s equity may be, it can in no case be stronger than that of a purchaser, who lias put himself in peril by purchasing a title, and paying a valuable consideration, without notice of any defect in it, or adverse claim to it.\u201d Boone v. Chiles, 35 U. S. (10 Pet.) 177, 210, 9 L. Ed. 388; Steinbeck v. Bon Homme Mining Co., 152 Fed. 833, 339, 81 C. C. A. 441, and cases there cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">It seems to me that the defendant below was such a purchaser, that his equity was superior to that of the negligent thresher company, and that the decree below should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
