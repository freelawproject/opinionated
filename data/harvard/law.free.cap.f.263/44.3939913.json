It arises out of what is contended is a grossly extortionate charge of $1,900, made by the said Dilkes, owner of the tug Sybil, for towing the Norwegian barque Lygslimt from Lynnhaven Roads (which is within the capes) to Baltimore.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>It Is insisted that, uiE an agreement was entered into at all between the master of the barque and the master of the tug Sybil, such agreement was tbe result of a false and fraudulent representation, made by the master <em>of </em>the <em>fug </em>to the master of the barque (a foreigner, for the first time in this port), that the regular towage rat\u00a9 from Lynnha^en Roads to Baltimore was $1,900, and because the master of the Bygslimt, who spoke but little English, believed that whatever figure he agreed to was subject to revision by the United States Shipping Board; his vessel <em>being </em>subject <em>to </em>government regulailon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-4\">The case is unique in several particulars: (1) That the libelant was in effect accorded two hearings on his libel-; and (2) that claim is made by Dilkes as the owner of the tug Sybil, of which Powell, Ms agent, was master, when, from the evidence and argument of counsel, it appears that the coni rad made by the master of the tug for such towage was not only without authority of Dilkes, the owner of the tug, but against bis direct order and instructions, whose agent the master of the tag necessarily was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">Ati admittedly legal tender was made by the claimant of the barque of $1,200 for such towage, because of the 1 rilling amount: of difference involved, and despite the fact that the towage hud been obtained by fraud and misrepresentation, and that the Lygslimt had suffered damage because the agreement of towage had not been completed in two particulars, viz.: (a) Thai; the tug did not proceed with reasonable dispatch, taking 55 hours to reach the port of Baltimore, due to several breakdowns of the tug, whereas under normal conditions Baltimore should have been made in from 24 to 20 hours at the maximum, the weather being altogether favorable; and (b) because the master o\u00ed the tug failed to dock Ms tow, as per agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\">At the first hearing the court announced that it was prepared to decide the cace against the libelant, but, being anxious to hear the master of the barque, continued the case until January 10th, for that purpose, although then prepared, by reason of the fraudulent misrepresentation as to towage rate, and because of the extortionate charge, to hold as indicated. At the second hearing, in addition to finding fraudulent misrepresentation as to regular towage rale, the court being impressed, owing to the difficulty in getting the master\u2019s testimony, with his slow apprehension of English, realized that it was impossible for him to deal on fair terms with Rowell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\">The court also found that the master\u2019s belief was that the rate agreed upon was subject to review by the Shipping Board; and that there was under the circumstances, no such meeting of minds as would justify the court <em>in </em>holding the barque to the extortionate charge made, in the case. Accordingly a decree was entered in favor oi! the libelant for $1,400, less the docking costs of $148, or a net decree of $1,252, without interest, and each side to pay its own costs, To this decree appellant excepted, and the case now comes here on appeal.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-8\">Clifton S.

Powell did say that the sum be asked was tbe rate. I find that this captain was scarcely capable, through his slow apprehension of English, of dealing on fair terms. I find that being, as ho supposed, at all events, in some relation to the Shipping Board, he assumed that any rate he agreed to, if it was not a fair one, would not be binding anyhow. He assumed that it would be subject to review by some proper authority. Under those circumstances, I do not think there was any such meeting of minds as would justify me in holding the bark to the extravagant, almost extortionate charge that was made in this case. I think it is exceedingly likely that, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Capt. Powell liad not been called back, very shortly after he left the bark, he would himself have come back. I don\u2019t know, but I think it is highly probable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The learned judge saw the witnesses and heard them testify, thus being afforded an opportunity to determine as to their credibility, and to weigh the evidence where there was any conflict. In this case, the captain was unable to speak the English language well, and, of course, had greater difficulty in understanding the same when spoken by another. Capt. Jansen, master of the Lygslimt, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201cQ. Tell the court in your own words what happened with reference to this tug\u2019s towing yon up the bay, and in the first place tell the court if you hailed the tug, or did the tug speak you, do you remember? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cQ. Did you hail the tug Sybil, or did the tug speak you? A. The tug came alongside and spoke to me and wanted a tow. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cQ. Then what was said? A. About 6 o\u2019clock in the evening\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">\u201cQ. Was it dark then? A. No; not quite dark; nearly dark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">\u201cQ. What was said to you by the tugboat master? A. I asked him how much he charge. Then he said $1,800. I offered him $1,400, and he said, T won\u2019t take it.\u2019 I offered him $1,500. He said he would not take less than that, and then he said $1,800 was the rate. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">\u201cQ. What did he say at the time, just before he took you in tow? A. We did not speak any more; he said it was the rate, and did not speak any more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">Counsel for the appellant sought by cross-examination of Capt. Jansen to show that what Capt. Powell said to Capt. Jansen was that the amount he proposed to charge was his rate, and in reply to the questions propounded Capt. Jansen stated most positively that what Capt. Powell said was that the proposed charge was <em>the </em>rate, as is shown by the following questions and answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-12\">\u201cQ. Then didn\u2019t he .say this to you, \u2018All right, that is my price, and you can either take it or leave it?\u2019 A. He did not say \u2018my price.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-13\">\u201cQ. Never said that? A. He said, \u2018That is <em>the </em>rate.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-14\">\u201cQ. You say he did not say that was his price? A. No; he said \u2018that is the rate.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-15\">\u201cQ. Did he say <em>his </em>rate? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-16\">\u201cQ. Just said it was <em>the </em>rate? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-17\">The fact that the captain was under the impression that the Shipping Board had the power to finally determine as to whether the charge was a correct one is shown by his testimony as to this point. The captain, while testifying, was asked, among other things, why he agreed to pay $1,900, and in reply thereto said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-18\">\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand. We got contract where we have the Shipping Board\u2019s contract. They pay all my expenses in the port; Shipping Board and Suffern were to pay all my expenses in the port (court).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-19\">In addition to the captain\u2019s statement we have that of the pilot, who' corroborates the captain\u2019s version as to what was said about the rate. The pilot, under the court\u2019s interrogatories, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-20\">\u201cThe Court: There was nothing said by the captain of the Sybil to the-effect that this was the regular rate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-21\">\u201cThe Witness: \u2019 Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-22\">\u201cThe Court: What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-23\">\u201cThe Witness: He said: \u2018That is what they are getting \u2014 towboats are getting \u2014 to tow barques to Baltimore.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u201cQ. (by Mr. Eorbes): What amount? A. $1,800 and $1,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cQ. You heard Cai&gt;t. Powell make that statement to Capt. Jansen? A. Yes : Capt. Powell forgets, but I know those were Ms words; exactly, sir, absolutely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Thus it will be seen that the testimony of the master was corroborated by the witnesses. It is true that this testimony is contradicted by Powell, the master of the tug Sybil; but the court evidently did not believe his statement, finding in favor of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Counsel for appellant insists that, inasmuch as Davis testified that he informed Jansen that the rate was higher than the usual rate, and also told him, \u201cThe price is rather high to tow to Baltimore,\u201d Jansen had no right to rely upon any statements that may have been made by Capt. Powell as an inducement to enter into the agreement, contending that, if the means of knowledge as to the rate were at hand, Jansen is precluded from claiming that he was defrauded through a false misrepresentation as to the facts upon which he relied, and that it was liis duty to have availed himself of the knowledge which he thus obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">It being well established that Powell made a false statement upon which Jansen relied, he cannot now consistently contend that Jansen should not have believed what he said as to the proper rate. We think this contention is untenable, and therefore cannot be sustained. We think the court below was warranted in holding as he did. This view is sustained by the case of The Schiedam (D. C.) 48 Fed. 923; where Brown, J. (the court) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">\u201cWhile a sum agreed on in advance and in the presence o\u00a3 danger may therefore limit the salvor, it has little or no binding effect upon the other party. A11 courts of admiralty freely <em>examine </em>into the circumstances in the interest of the latter, and award no more than a reasonable sum, without regard to the amount agreed on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">In the case of Boggs v. The Loutra, Fed. Cas. No. 1601, reported in 3 Fed. Cas. 804, it was held, per syllabus, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">\u201cIn moderate weather, a tug brought a Portuguese brig from 15 to 20 miles below Sandy Hook into New York Harbor; and her agents libeled the brig for $2,000, alleging that she was disabled and in distress, and that her master had agreed to pay that sum. For the brig, it was shown that she only required a pilot, that no one aboard could speak English, and that she only intended to offer 200 Portuguese milreas ($224), which had been tendered. Held, that the service was a towage merely, for which $221 was a reasonable compensation, and that even if the master agreed to pay $2,000, under apprehension of losing his vessel, the <em>contract </em>was exorbitant and not enforceable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">In the case of The Sophia Hansen (D. C.) 16 Fed. 144, Judge Benedict said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">\u201cIf this action was based upon a contract made between the master of the schooner that grounded on the West bank and the <em>tug </em>that pulled her off, as a contract for towage, the libelant could not recover, for the reason that the court would not enforce an agreement to pay $1,000 for a few hours of ordinary towage service; such an agreement being clearly unconscionable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">There it was held that an agreement to pay $1,000 for a salvage service was not conclusive, and should be considered in connection with the other facts bearing on the question as to the nature and value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>service. Accordingly, the $1,000 agreed upon was reduced to $500, although this was a salvage service, and therefore a higher order of service than a towage service.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">As we have stated, Jansen was a foreigner, and unable to speak the English language correctly, and it is obvious that he was at a great disadvantage in dealing with the master of the tug, who was at home, and perfectly familiar with the rates and conditions for services of this character. It is established beyond question that the facts upon which Jansen relied were false, and calculated to mislead the foreigner, who was practically helpless, and from the very nature of tilings had to rely upon the statement' of the master of the tug as to what was a proper charge. It is evident that Jansen was unable to successfully cope with the master of the tug. Under the circumstances, the parties were not on equal terms in any sense of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Therefore we think the learned judge below was amply warranted in reaching the conclusion that this contract should be modified, so as to conform to the customary rates for towage. It follows that the decree of the lower court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
