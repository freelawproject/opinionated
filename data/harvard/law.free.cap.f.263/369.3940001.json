Decree for libelant (255 Fed. 231), and claimant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AfA\">Reversed and remanded, with directions to dismiss libel.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-17\">Libelant was 19 years old when ho received the injuries hereinafter stated. Although without previous sea experience (as he testified), ho regularly shipped on the Santa Barbara as an \u201cordinary seaman.\u201d After he had so served for something over two months, the vessel was lying off Iquique, Chile, at which time libelant by his own account was strong, healthy, and apt for physical labor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-18\">The smokestack of the steamship was stayed by the usual guys leading to shackles fastened near the smokestack head. Contiguous to the upper end of each or most of these guys hung a pulley block, through which a chain or rope might be reeved and used (inter alia) for hauling up to the top of the smokestack a boatswain\u2019s chair in which men might sit for cleaning and painting the stack. Opinions differ as to the advisability, and indeed the safety, of maintaining chains or lines in these pulley blocks when at sea; the cap- \u25a0 tain of the Santa Barbara preferred not to have them in place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-19\">At Iquique libelant was ordered to \u201cshin up\u201d a guy and reeve a rope through the pulley block at the upper end thereof, in order that the chair might ho rigged and raised or lowered at will. He had never done this particular work before, and there is some evidence that he protested; but we find that the work was suitable to his apparent strength, and that no reason existed for his not doing it as well as any other member of the crew. He climbed the guy, and found difficulty in reeving the rope, owing either to the smoke and dirt naturally accumulated at the smokestack head, or because the gaunt line he carried up was rather large for the pulley, or for both reasons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-20\">He was not compelled to remain aloft any longer than he felt able, but he stayed up \u201c10 or 15 minutes.\u201d He says he then felt tired, started to descend, lost his grip on the guy, and fell to tlie deck, breaking his kneecap, and suffering contusions. Ho received surgical attention from shore doctors both at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Iquique and at Balboa. On arrival in New York be was sent to tbe Marine Hospital, but refused to stay there, because the first meal offered him elicited tbe comment: \u201cThat ain\u2019t no meal for a man with a broken knee wbo bas got a good stomach; I want to eat.\u201d Thereupon he went to his home, which happened to be in New York, and remained either there or in a local hospital until cured as far as he probably can ever expect to be. He walked either not at all or with a crutch for about six months; one leg is probably somewhat \u201cstitt\u201d for life. No other injury was serious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">This libel was filed on the theory that for various reasons the Santa Barbara was not in a \u201cseaworthy condition,\u201d that by reason of such condition libelant had received the injuries aforesaid, and that he was therefore entitled to recover the expense of his \u201csurgical and medical treatment\u201d and to a large additional sum by way of indemnity or \u201cdamages.\u201d The trial court held that libelant could not recover for \u201cmaintenance and cure,\u201d because he \u201cwas not warranted in arbitrarily leaving the Marine Hospital without some good reason,\" but that he was entitled \u201cto a substantial sum for the injury [he had received] on the ground that the owners failed to supply and maintain in good working order the pulley and chain in question.\u201d Decree for the lib\u00e9lant accordingly for $4,125.65, and claimant appealed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-5\">Burlingham, Veeder, Masten &amp; Fearey, of New York City (Morton L.

Hanrahan v. Pacific, etc., Co., 262 Fed. 951, \u2014\u2014 C. C. A.-, and Roeblings, etc., Co. v. Erickson, 261 Fed. 986,-C. C. A.-, both filed November 12, 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The reason given below for awarding indemnity \u2014 that \u201cthe owners failed to supply and maintain in \u00bfood working order the pulley and chain in question\u201d \u2014 is not sustained by the law applicable to the proven facts. The chains were supplied; whether unseaworthiness would have resulted, had that not been done, is a matter not before us. Whether they should be \u201cmaintained,\u201d or retained in the pulleys, and left stretched along the guys contributing weight without strength, while the steamer tossed at sea, is a matter wholly within the discretion of the captain. If that discretion was unwisely exercised, it was at most no more than his personal negligence in handling or mishan- , dling good and proper appliances duly furnished by the owners. As , nothing was defective in fit or material, and everything suggested as proper even by libelant\u2019s proctor, was provided for the ship, we hold that no unseaworthiness was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Whether unseaworthiness in law may not be produced by non-use or misuse of good and sufficient adjuncts to or appliances of a good ship, and whether the resulting condition can give rise to action for indemnity under the doctrine of The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, 23 Sup. Ct. 483, 47 L. Ed. 760, are also questions not now before us, because it is plain that libelant, whether properly rated as ordinary seaman or landsman, was set a task not unsuited to his strength, and received (by his owh account) injury solely from overtaxing that strength.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>It is certain that the absence of chains or ropes in the blocks contributed to the ship\u2019s capacity to resist the perils of the sea, and therefore made for seaworthiness, rather than the opposite. Their insertion for purposes of cleaning or repair was as simple as it was necessary, and to hold that unseaworthiness arose when cleaning time came, although it had not previously existed, is quite impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Libelant\u2019s injury was peculiarly within the rule as to maintenance and cure. It was proffered, and rejected by libelant. His conduct in leaving the Marine Hospital leaves us without any basis for allowance in his favor. There is some testimony as to his subsequent expenses, but everything that he preferred to procure for himself he might have had without any such expenditure.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Decree reversed, without costs, and cause remanded, with directions to dismiss libel, also without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
