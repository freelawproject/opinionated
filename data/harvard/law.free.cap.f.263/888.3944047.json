Judgment for defendant, and plaintiff brings error.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AlY\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b901-13\">Defendant here and below (Warren Company) had a quantity of \u201cleather buffings,\u201d whereof the unit is called a \u201cside.\u201d The goods had been obtained hy Warren Company for use in making their own product \u2014 valises and the like. They were found unsuitable, and it was desired to sell them. Plaintiff below, Nitke, went to defendant\u2019s factory, looked at the buffings, which were all in one room, and was told (as he said) that there were about 3,000 sides in all. The men with whom he talked testified that they told him about 2,000 sides.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b901-14\">After this conversation, Nitke according to his own testimony said: \u201cI will tell you, at 18 cents [a foot] I will take the entire lot; but at 18% cents, t want you to give me 500, and give me an option for the balance for two weeks after the receipt of the 500.\u201d This was accepted, and the bargain reduced to writing; Warren Company agreeing to send 500 sides to Nitke at 18% cents a foot, and \u201cwill give two weeks\u2019 option on balance of about 2,000 sides.\u201d The shipment was made, Nitke exercised his option within an agreed extension thereof, and hy uncontradicted testimony he received all the buffings in the lot he had seen, and all defendant had; but it turned out that the lot contained no more than about 1,000 sidos.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b901-15\">Thereupon this action was brought, wherein Nitke pleaded a contract to sell and deliver to him 2,000 sides, and demanded damages for a breach, viz. the neglect to deliver more than about 1,000. The above material facts appearing, the trial court directed verdict for defendant, and this writ was taken.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b901-16\">Henry L.

Brawley v. United States, 96 U. S. 168, 24 L. Ed. 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-20\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> A subsidiary question, also for the court, was whether the 2,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>or 3,000 sides, mentioned or written by the parties, were words of \u201cexpectation and estimate only,\u201d or amounted to an \u201cundertaking that the quantity should be so much.\u201d McConnel v. Murphy, R. R. 5 P. C.218.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> In construing the written document, \u201cit is a fundamental rule\u201d that one should \u201clook, not only to the language employed, but to the subject-matter and the surrounding circumstances,\u201d and avail oneself \u201cof the same light which the parties possessed when the contract was made.\u201d Merriam v. United States, 107 U. S. 441, 2 Sup. Ct. 540, 27 L. Ed. 531. More specifically this case demanded that \u201cthe obviously dominant measure\u201d of what the vendee was to get should be discovered. Smoot v. United States, 237 U. S. 42, 35 Sup. Ct. 540, 59 L. Ed. 829. The written contract itself does not reveal this. It speaks of a \u201cbalance,\u201d and one asks \u2014 balance of what? As soon as the surrounding circumstances are revealed by the vendee\u2019s own evidence, it is plain that what was meant was the balance of the lot Nitke saw and bargained for.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The only peg then left on which to hang plaintiff\u2019s case is the phrase \u201cabout 2,000 sides.\u201d Undoubtedly the variance between 2,000 sides and what the vendee got is very gross; and the rule of construction is that, when a quantity named is qualified by such words as \u201cabout,\u201d or \u201cmore or less,\u201d their scope is restricted to such \u201caccidental or immaterial variations in quantity as would naturally occur in connection with\u201d that particular transaction. Hadley, etc., Co. v. Highland, etc., Co., 143 Fed. 242, 74 C. C. A. 462. But when it is fairly inferable that what was intended to be and was the subject-matter of contract was a particular lot of goods, then the quantity specified \u201camounts to no more than a rough estimate of the probable quantity, which, in the absence of fraud, is not regarded as binding on either party.\u201d United States v. Pine River, etc., Co., 89 Fed. 911, 32 C. C. A. 411, affirmed 186 U. S. 279, 22 Sup. Ct. 920, 46 L. Ed. 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">In this case there is neither allegation nor evidence of fraud; there was no more than a very bad guess hy an employe of defendant. A verdict for plaintiff could have rested on nothing but an assumption that the parties bargained for something other than the lot of buffings Nitke saw, or that Warren Company defrauded their customer. The first possible foundation is swept away by the law, and the second by lack of both evidence and appropriate pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
