Fairbanks, On January 5, 3011. it went into the hands of receivers. At that time it was indebted to appellee in the sum of S329,4(55.62, for the payment of which the appellee held as collateral security 96 shares of the capital stock of the Gold Bar Dumber Company. On December 20, 3910, the Washing!, on-Alaska Bank sent by express to the appellee, at Seattle, gold coin, bullion. and currency to the value of $301,000 to be applied on said indebtedness, but after the appointment of the receivers the Washington-Alaska Bank seized the said $103,000 while it was in the hands of the express company in transit. Their right to da so was upheld by this court in Dexter Horton National Bank v. Hawkins, 190 Fed. 924, 111 C. C. A. 514. On March 26, 3912, the appellee presented its claim to the receivers of the Washington-Alaska Bank, and the same was allowed in the sum of $129,465.62.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-9\">Prior thereto, and during the year 3913, the receivers paid to unsecured creditors dividends amounting in the aggregate to 50 per cent, of their claims. Thereafter the then receiver and the appellee entered into a written agreement, which was signed by the receiver on July 13, 3912, and by the appellee on November 22, 1912, wherein it was recited that the appellee was entitled to receive payment of a 50 per cent, dividend on its claim, as had been paid to other creditors: that the appellee held shares of the Gold Bar Dumber Company stock as collateral security; that it was the desire of the receiver that the collateral lie not sold or converted without his consent prior te' June 1, 1913, and that he would pay to the appellee, on account of the dividends which it was entitled to receive, the sum of $25,000, and pay the balance of the 50 per cent, as fast as funds were available, and before December 1, 1912, if possible; that in consideration thereof the appellee agreed not to soil or convert its collateral prior to December 1, 1912, without the receiver\u2019s consent; and that, if the balance of the dividend due it were paid it by that, date, it would not convert the collateral prior to June 1, 1913. The receiver further agreed that, should any further dividends, be declared and paid to other creditors, the appellee should receive the same rate of dividends as other creditors until its claims wen\u00bb paid in full.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-10\">Pursuant to the'agreement the receiver paid the appellee $25,000, but made no further payments. On April 9, 1933, the appellee commenced its suit in equity in the superior court for King county, state of Washington, against the Washington-Alaska Bank and its. receiver, to foreclose its lien on the collateral and for judgment. Judgment was duly rendered in accordance with the prayer of the complaint for $126,907.80, which was the amount of tire claim, after deducting the $25,000 payment and adding interest. The collateral was sold for $100,000, leaving a balance due on the appellee\u2019s judgment, on January 30, 1911, of $27,248.76. Upon the foregoing facts the court below entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>its order directing the receiver to pay to the appellee $27,225.47, with interest at 6 per cent, per annum from January 30, 1914, out of any funds in his hands belonging to the insolvent estate and applicable to the payment of debts, before making any further payment to other creditors. It is from this order that the appeal is taken.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-4\">De Journel &amp; De Journel, of San Francisco, Cal., and Roy V.

The court below applied the rule established in Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, 173 U. S. 131, 19 Sup. Ct. 360, 43 L. Ed. 640, that the creditor can prove for and receive dividends upon the full amount of his claim, regardless of any sums received from his collateral after the transfer of the assets from the debtor in insolvency, provided that he shall not receive more than the full amount due him, and held that any doubt as to the applicability of the rule was dissolved when consideration was had of the <em>terms </em>of the <em>contract between the </em>receiver and the appellee, a contract which was made with the approval of the court below, and the fact that at the time when the contract was made the value of the Gold Bar stock was considered both by the appellee and the receiver to be far in excess of the appellee\u2019s claim against the Washington-Alaska Bank, and the fact that the validity of the Contract was established in the suit in the Washington state court, judgment in which was affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court. Dexter Horton Nat. Bank v. Wash.-Alaska Bank, 86 Wash. 452, 150 Pac. 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We are not convinced that the court below was in error in so ruling. A pledge which secures an interest-bearing debt secures the interest as much as the principal of the debt. In Richmond &amp; I. Const. Co. v. Richmond, N. I. &amp; B. R. Co., 68 Fed. 105, 116, 15 C. C. A. 289, 300 (34 L. R.

Act March 24, 1909 (Laws Nev. 1908-1909, p. 251). Wc are unable to agree that the said banking law of Nevada has any bearing upon the question of distribution of assets here involved, -notwithstanding that the bank was incorporated under the general incorporation law of Nevada. A marked distinction is observed between the laws of the state which became a part of the charter of the corporation and those laws of the state which regulate corporations in their manner of doing business in the state. The former will follow the corporation when it engages in business in another state.. The latter will not. In Jesson v. Noyes, 245 Fed. 46, 157 C. C. A. 342, this court held that the Washington-Alaska Bank was bound by the provisions of the general incorporation laws of Nevada prescribing the powers of directors of corporations. We so held on the ground that that law entered into the charter of the bank and controlled the action of its directors in whatever state they might go to do business. But the act of the Legislature of Nevada of March 24, 1909, was enacted after the incorporation of the Washington-Alaska Bank, and its purpose was to regulate corporations engaged in the banking business in the state of Nevada, and to protect depositors in such banks. In 12 R. C. L. p. 25, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201cA corporation created by the laws of another state, therefore, does not bring into every state where it transacts business the general legislation or judicial decisions of the state in which it is organized, but such general laws and regulations or the decisions of the courts of a sister state are controlling only within its own limits, and such state has no power to give them force or ei'Cect in other jurisdictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In 2 Mor. Priv. Corp. \u00a7 967, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\u201cThe charter contract alone is recognized. It is tho charter alone which is recognized by the laws of comity, and not the general legislation of the state in which the corporation was formed. The general laws and regulations of a state are intended to govern only within the limits of the state enacting them, and a state would have no power to give them extraterritorial force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">In Guilford v. Western Union Tel. Co., 59 Minn. 332, 61 N. W. 324, 50 Am. St. Rep. 407, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\u201cIt is only the charter of the corporation, constituting the agreement between it and its stockholders, which will be recognized as binding in other states, and not the general laws of the foreign state, affecting merely the remedy, which govern only within the state enacting them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">In Warren v. First Nat. Bank of Columbus, 149 Ill. 9, 38 N. E. 122, 25 L. R. A. 746, it was held that the charter alone of a foreign corporation, and not the general legislation of the state in which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>was created, will have effect to limit its powers outside of the state, and that a New York statute prohibiting assignment or transfers by insolvent corporations has no extraterritorial force and does not affect the validity of an assignment by an insolvent corporation executed in Ohio of a transfer of funds in Illinois. In Ohio Life Ins. Co. v. Merchants Ins. Co., 11 Humph. (Tenn.) 1, 53 Am. Dec. 742, it was held that the general law of a state prohibiting corporations from engaging in the banking business, unless expressly formed for that purpose, has no force beyond the limits of the state, but that it is otherwise if such a restriction is contained- in the charter. In Borton v. Brines-Chase Co., 175 Pa. 209 (34 Atl. 597) it was held that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">\u201cA general assignment or confession of judgment may be made by a foreign insolvent corporation in Pennsylvania, tliougli tbe laws of its own state prohibit insolvent, corporations from doing so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Of similar import is Pairpoint Mfg. Co. v. Phila. Optical Co., 161 Pa. 17, 28 Atl. 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In East Side Bank v. Columbus Tanning Co., 170 Pa. 1, 32 Atl. 539, it was held that the statute of New York forbidding preferences by insolvent corporations did not render void a preference judgment taken in Pennsylvania against an insolvent corporation organized under the laws of New .York, but holding its entire property in Pennsylvania. In Franklin Trust Co. v. State of New Jersey, 181 Fed. 769, 104 C. C. A. 629, where a corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey, but whose business interests and all of its property were in another state, had become insolvent and was being wound up in that state, it was held that a franchise tax imposed upon it under the law of New Jersey, after the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, could not be enforced in the court of the foreign jurisdiction, and given priority of payment over the claims of bona fide local creditors. In United States Mortgage Co. v. Sperry (C. C.) 24 Fed. 838, Judge Gresham held that a New York corporation doing business in Illinois was not bound by the New York statute which provided that no loan should be made at a rate of interest exceeding the legal rate, which in New York was 7 per cent. In Boehme v. Rall, 51 N. J. Eq. 541, 26 Atl. 832, the court held that, where a foreign corporation execute's in New Jersey a mortgage on property within that state to resident creditors to secure payment of debts contracted and payable there, the mortgage will not be held invalid because the execution thereof was contrary to the general statute of the state in which the corporation was incorporated. There are numerous other decisions sustaining the doctriiie above declared by the text-writers and announced by the courts, notably White v. Howard, 38 Conn. 342; Hannis Dis. Co. v. Baltimore, 114 Md. 678, 80 Atl. 319; Castle's Adm\u2019r v. Acrogen Coal Co., 145 Ky. 591, 140 S. W. 1034; Fowler v. Bell, 90 Tex. 150, 37 S. W. 1058, 39 L. R. A. 254, 59 Am. St. Rep. 788; Com. Nat.

A. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> In brief, the Washington-Alaska Bank, as its name indicates, was incorporated in Nevada for the purpose of engaging in business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>elsewhere than in that state. As to its corporate powers it was governed by its charter, but when it engaged in the banking business in Alaska it became subject to the local laws. Depositors and others who dealt with it as a bank were not required to search the statute of Nevada to ascertain what their rights were. They were entitled to rely upon the laws of the territory where the bank was engaged in business. The act of March 24, 1909, was, as its title indicates, a general act to define and regulate the business of banking, and to create a state banking board and a bank examiner. In the body of the act are found numerous expressions of the purpose to regulate banking \u201cin this state.\u201d It. contains no indication of the intention of the Legislature to inject any of its provisions into the charters of banking corporations theretofore or thereafter to be incorporated. Two years later the Legislature passed a new act \u201cto regulate banking and other matters relating thereto\u201d (St. 1911, p. 291), which expressly repeals all prior acts and parts of acts in conflict, with its provisions. It gives no preference to claims of depositors or others. That it was the intention to repeal the act of 1909 in toto is further shown in the Revised Laws of Nevada of 1912, where the law of 1911 is restated, and a note in volume 1, p. 209, declares that the latter act supersedes the act approved March 24, 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> The appellant contends that the judgment in the foreclosure proceeding is void, for the reason that no permission was obtained from the court below to bring the suit against its receiver, and Barton v. Barbour, 104 U. S. 126, 26 L. Ed. 672, is cited as holding that consent to sue a receiver is jurisdictional. This contention was not made in the court below, and it is not embraced in any of the assignments of error. It is based upon the proposition that the judgment of foreclosure is absolutely void for want of jurisdiction. In Barton v. Barbour a plea to the jurisdiction was interposed, and the question before the Supreme Court was the sufficiency of that plea. In the foreclosure suit in question here, not only was there no plea to the jurisdiction, but the court below directed its receiver to appear and answer the suit, which he did without raising the defense that prior permission had not been given to bring the suit. In 3 Street\u2019s Fed. Eq. Prac. 2676, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\"><em>\u201cIt </em>is a general principle of equity practice that a suit camiot be brought against a receiver, in his capacity as such, to recover any properly in his hands, or to recover on any debt, demand, or claim whatever against him, unless upon previous leave first duly obtained. This rule applies to suits brought either in that court or in any other court; and if an unauthorized suit he brought against the receiver, he may successfully plead the disability of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We think the instruction which the Alaska court gave to its receiver is in effect an order permitting the institution of the foreclosure suit, and the. fact that the receiver in compliance therewith appeared in the suit and defended the same, and acquiesced in the course of the plaintiff in prosecuting the same, should be held to have cured the informality which attended the commencement of the proceeding, and that the judgment in the foreclosure suit cannot be regarded as abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>lutely void. Elkhart Car-Works Co. v. Ellis, 113 Ind. 215, 15 N. E. 249; Mulcahey v. Strauss, 151 Ill. 70, 37 N. E. 702; Flentham v. Steward, 45 Neb. 640, 63 N. W. 924; In re Young (D. C.) 7 Fed. 855; Naumberg v.

If the cash in the hands of the receiver, available for such purpose, be insufficient to pay the claims of the depositors, the court in which the receivership is pending, or a judge thereof, shall determine the amount required to supply the deficiency, and cause the same to be certified to the State Banking Board, which shall thereupon draw against the depositors\u2019 guaranty fund in the amount required to supply such deficiency, and shall forthwith transmit . the same to the receiver, to be applied on the said claims of depositors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">\u201cSec. 59.

The delay in realizing on this pledge was not the fault of the petitioner, and therefore it is necessary to ascertain what sum of money at 6 per cent, interest per annum on January 4, 1911, would amount to $99,954.95 on January 30, 1914. This sum is $84,421.41. The petitioner would therefore be entitled to participate in dividends, the same as other creditors, calculated <em>on the sum of </em>$45,014.21. Dividends of 16% per cent, each were declared January 9, April 8, and November 7, 1911, respectively, and were not paid to petitioner. Calculating interest thereon from the date declared to August 8, 1912, on which date the petitioner was paid the sum of $25.000, it is found that by the payment; of the $25,000 the petitioner was overpaid to the extent of $833.75. Enturo dividends would be calculated on tlie sum of \u00a715,044.21, but from the first dividend or dividends declared the sum of $833.75' would be deducted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The court, however, holding the contract to be valid and binding upon the parties to it, summarized their rights thus, and gave judgment accordingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201cThe claim on January 5, 1911, was for the sum of $129,465.62, on which there ivas a payment of $25,000 August 6, 1912. The proceeds of <em>the sale of </em>the Gold Bar stock January 30, 1914, amounted to $99,954.95. There was therefore due tho Dexter Horton Bank cn that date the sum of $27,225.47. The petitioner asks for interest on this sum at 8 per cent per annum from January 30, 1914. In my opinion tho Washington courts have determined that the original contract was a contract under the laws of the state of Washington. Interest will be allowed at 6 per cent, per annum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">In the case of Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, 173 U. S. 131, 19 Sup. Ct. 360, 43 L. Ed. 640 (adhered to in Aldrich v. Chemical National Bank, 176 U. S. 618, 636, 20 Sup. Ct 498, 44 L. Ed. 611) the Supreme Court distinctly adjudged inapplicable to cases lijce the present one the rule governing cases arising under the bankruptcy laws, which the court declared proceeds upon the principle of election, permitting the creditor to prove his whole debt by surrendering his security, or, in the event of his holding it, to prove only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>for any existing deficiency after extinction of the security, hut that where, as in the present case, there is a secured creditor of an insolvent national bank, he \u201cmay prove and receive dividends upon the face of his claim as it stood at the tim\u00e9 of the declaration of insolvency, without crediting either his collaterals or collections made therefrom after such declaration, subject always to the proviso that dividends must cease when, from them and from collaterals realized, the claim has been paid in full\u201d \u2014 the court further saying, near the end of' its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">\u201cWhatever Congress may be authorized to enact by reason of possessing the power to pass uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies, it is very clear that it did not intend to impinge upon contracts existing between creditors and debtors, by anything prescribed in reference to the administration of the assets of insolvent national banks. Yet it is obvious that the bankruptcy rule converts what on its face gives the secured creditor an equal right with other creditors into a preference against him, and hence takes away a right which he already had. This a court of equity should never do, unless required by statute, at the time the indebtedness was created.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">There is here express recognition of what, it seems to me, would otherwise be very plain, that the rules governing courts of equity in the distribution of insolvent estates are never so applied as to violate any statutory provision regulating the rights of the parties. The court below was bound to take judicial notice of the statutes of Nevada, under which the insolvent bank was organized and which constituted its charter. Bank v. Francklyn, 120 U. S. 751, 7 Sup. Ct. 757, 30 L. Ed. 825; Lamar v. Micou, 114 U. S. 223, 5 Sup. Ct. 857, 29 L. Ed. 94; Owings v. Hull, 9 Pet. 607, 9 L. Ed. 246; Jesson v. Noyes, 245 Fed. 46, 157 C. C. A. 342; Merchants Exchange Bank v. McGraw, 59 Fed. 972, 8 C. C. A. 420; Story\u2019s Eq. Plead. (10th Ed.) \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Equally clear is it, I think, that all parties dealing with this national bank, including, of course, the appellee Dexter Horton National Bank, were charged with notice that its very charter expressly declared that claims of its depositors for deposits, and claims of holders of exchange against it, shall \u201chave priority over all other claims, except federal, state, county and municipal taxes,, and subject to such taxes shall at the time of closing of the bank be a first lien on all the assets of the banking corporation from which they are due and thus under receivership.\u201d In Chemical National Bank v. Armstrong, 59 Fed. 372, 8 C. C. A. 155, 28 L. R. A. 231 (referred to with approval by the Supreme Court in the cases of Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville and Aldrich v. Chemical National Bank, supra), Judge Taft, speaking for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">\u201cThe suspension of the bank, and its seizure by the Comptroller and his appointee, the receiver, work, by operation of law, a transfer of the title to the assets of the bank from the bank to the Comptroller and receiver, in tru\u00e1t to reduce the assets to money, and apply them, as directed by the National Banking Act \u2014 first, to the redemption of the circulating notes of the bank; and, second, in ratable distribution to the creditors of the bank. Scott v. Armstrong, 146 U. S. 499, 13 Sup. Ct. 148 [36 L. Ed. 1059]; White v. Knox, 111 U. S. 784, 4 Sup. Ct. 686 [28 L. Ed. 603]. * * * It is true that under the Bankruptcy Act it was provided that a secured creditor, if he would prove for Bis full claim, must surrender his collateral, or else be content to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>for the difference between his full claim and the value of Ms collateral. Rev. St. \u00a7 5073. The bankruptcy law is not now in force, however, and it was expressly held in the case of Cook County Nat. Bank v. U. S., 107 U. S. 445, 2 Sup. Ct. 561 127 L. Ed. 537], that the priorities and method of distribution under the bankrupt law had no application to the winding up of insolvent national banks. It was said that the National Banking Act contained within itself a complete system for distributing the assets and determining the priorities, and that a priority secured to the United States under the bankrupt law would not bo enforced in their favor under the banking act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The cases above cited clearly recognize the controlling force of statutory law prescribing how the distribution of the assets of an insolvent corporation, organized tinder and by virtue of its provisions, shall be made, regardless of whether the insolvent bank be a national or a state bank. I am, of course, aware of the distinction that exists between the laws of a state which merely regulate corporations in their maimer of doing business within it and the laws of the same state which become a part of the charter of a corporation which has been incorporated under its laws. That the latter will follow such corporation when it engages in business outside of the slate of its incorporation I do not understand to be questioned. But it is contended, and by the majority of this court in effect held, that the purpose of the above-mentioned act of the state of Nevada of March 24, 1909, was merely to regulate the hanking business carried on in that state, and to provide for the distribution of the assets of insolvent banks within Nevada only. If so, I readily concede that that statute has nothing to do with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">A number of cases are cited where, state courts have refused to give effect to charter provisions of foreign corporations doing business within their state, some upon the ground that they conflict with the rights of local creditors, or with the laws or public policy of the state within which it was sought to enforce such charter provisions, and some because of the construction that the true intent of the particular legislation in question was that it should not become a part of the charter of the corporation organized under its laws, but apply only to its business within the state, An apt illustration of the latter is the case of Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Cohen, 179 U. S. 262, 21 Sup. Ct. 106, 45 L. Ed. 181. That company was organized under the laws of New York, which state enacted a statute providing that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u2022\u2022No life insurance company doing business in the state of New York shall have power to declare forfeited or lapsed any policy hereafter issued or renewed by reason of nonpayment of any animal premium or interest, or any portion thereof, except as hereinafter provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The insurance policy there involved contained a stipulation that it should not be binding until the first premium had been paid and the policy delivered, bolh of which acts were done in the state of Montana; the contract thereupon becoming a Montana contract, and governed by its laws. In Montana, there being no statutory provision to the contrary, the failure to pay the annual premium worked, in accordance with the terms of the policy, a forfeiture of all claims against the company. The court held that the provision of the New York statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>quoted had no application to a policy issued by the company in another state, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">\u201cThe New York statute does not purport to change any insurance company charter. On the contrary, its obvious purpose is only to reach business transacted within the state. Proceeding on the accepted principle that a state may determine the conditions,- the meaning and limitations of contracts executed within its borders, the language of the statute reaches contracts made within the state. * * * It is not doubted that a contract by an insurance company of New York, executed elsewhere, may by its terms incorporate the law of New\u2019York, and make its provisions controlling upon both the insured and the insurer. And it is urged that, although there is nothing in tliei imlicy to indicate this, the language of the application has that effect. It recites that it is \u2018subject to the charter of such company and the laws of said state,\u2019 and the contract refers to the application, and declares that it is issued \u2018in consideration of the application for this policy and of the truth of the several statements made therein.\u2019 While the contract is based upon the application, yet the latter is only a preliminary instrument, a proposal on the part of the insured, and a stipulation that it shall be controlled by the charter and the laws of the state is not tantamount to a stipulation that the policy issued thereon shall also in like manner be controlled. That such language was incorporated into the application is not strange. Its meaning is clear, and is that no local statute as to the effect of statements or representations or any other matter in the application should in those respects override the provisions of the charter and the laws of New York. In other words, if by the charter or the laws of New York any statement in an application is to be taken as a warranty, no local statute-declaring that all statements in an application are to be taken as simply representations shall override the terms of the charter and the New York law. But that is very different from a provision that the contract issued upon such application should also be in all its respects controlled by the laws of New York.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">It will be observed that there is not in the Nevada statute here involved, as there was in that of New York involved in the case just cited, a reference to the <em>place </em>where the incorporation shall be doing business, but the positive declaration that the term \u201cbank\u201d or \u201cbanking corporation,\u201d used in the Nevada statute, <em>shall be construed to mean any incorporated banking institution which shall have been incorporated under the laws of that state as they existed prior to the taking effect of the act of March \u00a34, 1909, </em>and of such banking institutions'as should thereafter become incorporated thereunder, with the further express declaration, contained in section 61, that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\u201cBach section of this act, and every part of each section, is hereby declared to be independent sections and parts of sections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">As is well said by counsel for the appellant, depositors are practically certain to be, holders of exchange are very likely to be, residents of the jurisdiction where a bank does business. Correspondent banks are in many instances, as in that at bar, concerns in foreign jurisdictions. \u201cWhat principle of public policy requires that such resident depositors and hblders -of exchange shall not be paid out of insolvent estates before such foreign correspondent banks are paid therefrom ?\u201d asks counsel. I know of none, nor do I know of any principle of the common law which forbids it; and it is not claimed that there is any statute in force in Alaska to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">It does not seem to me that the Nevada statute can be properly so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>construed ?.s to limit its provisions to such business as is done by the banks or banking institutions, therein referred to, within the state of Nevada, but that the provision in question was an alteration of the laws under which the appellant bank was incorporated; that is to say, an alteration of its charter, which was expressly authorized by article 8, \u00a7 1, of the Constitution of Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In my opinion the judgment should be reversed, with directions to the court below to dismiss the petition, at the petitioner\u2019s cost.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
