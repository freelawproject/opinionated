Covey, filed in this court on July 8, 1919, his petition in two counts against the United States of America, as defendant, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">Count One.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">That the plaintiff is a resident of Cherokee, Cherokee county, Iowa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">That the defendant, the United States of America, is a sovereign power and nation, and that by an act amending an act of Congress entitled \u201cAn act to authorize the establishment of a Bureau of War Bisk Insurance in the Treasury Department,\u201d approved by the President -of said sovereign power, the United States of America, on October 6, 1917, the defendant granted permission to bring suit against the United States of America in the District Court of the United States in and for the district in which plaintiff is a resident for and on account of the things hereinafter stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-10\">That on the 21st day of March, A. D. 1918, the plaintiff enlisted in the United States Army and served therein until honorably discharged' therefrom on account of wounds received at Chateau Thierry, France, while engaged in battle against the Imperial German government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-11\">That the plaintiff was discharged from the United States Army on June 5, 1919, and a copy of said discharge is hereto attached and made a part hereof as fully and' completely as if set out herein, and marked \u201cExhibit A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-12\">That on the 5th day of April, 1918, pursuant to the terms of the before mentioned act of Congress, the plaintiff applied for insurance against death or permanent total disability as contemplated in said act, in the sum of ten thousand dollars, .and was issued a policy of insurance, a copy of which is hereto attached, marked \u201cExhibit B,\u201d and made a part hereof as fully and completely as if set out herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-13\">That by. the terms and conditions, of said contract or policy of insurance the plaintiff is, and has been since the 1st day of August, 1918, entitled to the sum of ten thousand dollars as set out in said policy of insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-14\">That on the 24th day of May, 1919, plaintiff made claim for said sum under the terms of said policy by addressing a letter to the Bureau of War Bisk Insurance, Washington, D. C.,.said letter stating the conditions and requesting payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-15\">That again on the 7th day of June, 1919, after being discharged from the United States Army, the plaintiff mailed another letter to the Bureau of War Bisk Insurance, demanding that he be furnished with information, so as to enable him to prove his claim under said policy and collect the amount due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-16\">That he has never received any. answer to either of said letters, and has never received any payment under policy, or any other payment on account of said total permanent disability, from the United States of America or any other person or corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-17\">That he orally requested information from his superior officers at the United States General Hospital No. 26, at Ft. Des Moines, Iowa, as to the method of collecting his Claim and as to the amount he was to be allowed. That said officers and \u00e1gents of the United States of America furnished him no information relative thereto, except an oral statement that plaintiff would be allowed 20 per cent, permanent disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-18\">That, contrary to the important notice printed on the hack of said policy of insurance, reading as follows: \u201cIt will not be necessary to employ an attorney, claim agent, or other person to secure benefits under this certificate\u201d \u2014 it is nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>essary to employ an attorney to collect said sum, and your plaintiff has agreed to pay his attorney the sum of one thousand dollars therefor, or 10 per cent, of the amount recovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">Further, your plaintiff is informed and believes it is the policy and intent, of said agents and officers of the United States of America, both in the United States Army and in the Burean of War Risk Insurance, to delay payment on insurance policies so issued, and it is further their policy and intent to construe all cases as not to be permanent total disability, as the plaintiff knows of no person who lias been allowed permanent total disability, but admits that there have been a few such cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">But your plaintiff is informed and believes it is rather their purpose and intent to force said persons to accept alms from charitable organizations, such as the Red Cross, or to re-enlist in the United States Army, in order to got any benefits from said policies of insurance. That all of said policies and intentions are in direct contravention of said act of Congress, and if continued will deprive all wounded soldiers, sailors, and marines from deriving their just benefits under said act. That said act wTas passed for the purpose of furnishing a just compensation to the soldier, sailor, or marine who received injuries or was disabled in the service of the United States, and to prevent him from becoming an object of bounty of charitable organizations. That your plaintiff is informed and believes that the aforesaid notice printed on the back of said policy of insurance is for the purpose of lulling the beneficiary into passive acquiescence in the foregoing unlawful policies and intentions, and to prevent the collection of just claims against the United States under said policies of insurance, and in contravention to the policies and desires of a just and thankful government, Congress, and people. That said notice heretofore referred to is false, and the publication of the same on the back of said policy of insurance is unlawful and against public policy, and if allowed to continue would undermine fixed government and the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">That plaintiff, Leo L. Covey, was wounded by shrapnel in battle at Chateau Thierry, France, during the month of July, 1918, and sustained injuries therefrom that permanently and totally disabled him, as contemplated in the aforesaid act of Congress and said contract or policy of insurance, and is entitled to the benefits of said policy from and after August 1, 19J8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">That plaintiff has paid the sum of sixty-four dollars premium on said policy of insurance after said injury occurred, the same being deducted from his pay while in the United States Army, which said sum is now owed him by the United States of America under the terms of said policy of insurance and said act of Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-9\">That during all of the time of the life of said policy of insurance the plaintiff paid promptly premiums on said policy, the same being deducted from his pay in the United States army, and plaintiff has performed all of the conditions of said contract or policy of insurance necessary to enable him to recover thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-10\">And that said Director of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance has neglected and failed and refused to make any payment or settlement under said policy, and has neglected and failed to comply with said act, and the terms thereof, all bough he has had actual notice of plaintiff\u2019s rights, and the United States of America has actual notice of plaintiff\u2019s rights, through said director and through its officers and agents in the Bureau of War Risk Insurance and in the 'United States Army.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-11\">Wherefore plaintiff, Leo L. Covey, demands judgment against the United States of America, on-this the first count of his petition, in the sum of eleven thousand and seventy dollars and forty cents, and for costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-12\">Count Two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-13\">For a second, further, separate, and distinct cause of action against the defendant, the plaintiff makes all of count one of this petition a part of this count as fully and completely as if set out herein, in so far as the same is applicable, and further states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>That on the 6th day of October, 1917, the President of the United States of America approved the act heretofore referred to in count one and the same became a law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-4\">That among other things said act was an offer by the United States of America to insure any person entering the military service of the United States of America against partial or total disability or permanent total or partial disability on account of sickness, disease, or wounds received in the line of duty and not through any misconduct on the part of the insured; the United States agreeing to pay said premiums as a part of the compensation of said person for enlisting or entering the military or naval service of the United States of America and as a part of the compensation for such service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">That on March 21, 1918, about six months after the passage and approval of said act of Congress, the plaintiff enlisted and served in the United States army until honorably discharged therefrom on June 5,1919, and complied with all the other terms and conditions of said act or offer. That from the time of his so enlisting until wounded a contract of insurance was in full force and effect by and between the United States of America and this plaintiff, entirely separate and apart from the written policy heretofore referred to in count one of this petition, and insuring the plaintiff against partial or total disability incurred in the line of duty and not through any misconduct on the part of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">That under the terms of said act and said contract of insurance the plaintiff is entitled 'to receive for a permanent total disability the sum of thirty dollars per month for the balance of his life after being discharged from the United States Army, and to receive said amount independent of any other policy of insurance, in writing or otherwise, for which he paid an additional premium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">That the natural expectancy of the plaintiff is about thirty years from June 5, 1919, and he is therefore entitled to the sum of ten thousand eight hundred dollars to be paid to him under the terms and conditions of said contract of insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-8\">That his condition is resultant through no misconduct of his own, but is the result of wounds received in battle as hereinbefore set out in count one hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">That he has furnished notice to the Bureau of War Bisk Insurance' as provided .in said act and pursuant to the terms of said contract, by mailing letters to said bureau, and by applying to officers in the army of the United States of America.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-10\">That the United States of America and the Bureau of War Bisk Insurance have actual notice of his condition and injury and have failed and neglected and refused to make any payments or settlement under said contract of insurance, even although huge sums have been appropriated by the Congress of the United States to pay said claims and to enable said Bureau of War Bisk Insurance to provide itself with clerical, legal, and other assistance necessary to expedite the settlement of said claims. That it has been nearly twelve months since said injury, but your plaintiff has never received any communication of any kind or nature from said Bureau of War Bisk Insurance. That said Bureau of War Bisk Insurance has access to the records of tire War and Navy Departments and the assistance of the Medical Corps of the Army and Navy, and it is the duty of all of said organizations, and it was their duty, to ascertain the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and to\u00a1 have the same ascertained before the discharge of the plaintiff from the United States Army, and to have begun payments when the plaintiff ceased to draw pay from the United States Army.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-11\">That it has been necessary for the plaintiff to secure the services of an attorney to collect his claim, and he has agreed to pay him therefor the sum of one thousand and eighty dollars, or 10 per cent, of the amount recovered, all of which sum the plaintiff is entitled to recover as a part of a judgment against the defendant pursuant to the terms of said act, and the same is far less than the reasonable value of said services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">That plaintiff desires nothing under either count of this petition by way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>charity, but if he is not entitled to said claims as a matter of right under existing law then he wants this petition dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-4\">Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment against the defendant on this the second count of his petition in the sum of eleven thousand and eight hundred and eighty dollars, and for costs, and demands judgment on both counts of his petition in the aggregate sum of twenty-two thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars and forty cents, together with the costs of this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">[Signed] G. P. North,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">Attorney for the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Which petition is subscribed and sworn to by the plaintiff. The discharge and enlistment record is set out as Exhibit A. Exhibit B reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-8\">The United States of America, Treasury Department, Bureau of War Risk Insurance, Washington, D.

O., in order to secure a prompt settlement. There will be no expense in connection with proving a claim, and, collecting the amount due, other than small fees to notaries. It will not he necessary to consult or employ an attorney, claim agent, or other person to secure benefits under this certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-20\">The plaintiff claims of the defendants upon both counts of the petition the aggregate sum of $22,950 and some cents, together with costs of the action, but upon what theory the claim of $11,000 and over upon each count is made is not clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-21\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The defendants have filed a motion to strike out parts of count 1 of the petition, paragraph 1 of which motion reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-22\">\u201cThat by the terms and conditions of said contract or policy of insurance the plaintiff is, and has been since the first day of August, 1918, entitled to the sum of ten thousand dollars as set out in said policy of insurance\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-23\">\u2014for the reason that the same is a conclusion of the pleader, incompetent, and irrelevant. Standing alone, the part thus assailed might be a conclusion; hut in connection with the other allegations of count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>1 of the petition, viz. \u201cthat the plaintiff enlisted- in the United States Army, was accepted and entered the service, made application to the Bureau of War Risk Insurance, and was granted a policy of insurance (a copy of which is set out); that he served in the army, was wounded, honorably discharged, and made application to the Bureau of War Risk Insurance for payment of such policy\u201d \u2014 it can hardly be said that such allegations are immaterial or irrelevant, and said paragraph 1 of the motion to strike will be and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Defendants also move to strike certain parts of the petition described in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of their said motion, because immaterial, irrelevant, and redundant, which said grounds are each overruled, for the same reason that paragraph 1 of the motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Paragraphs 5, 6, <em>7, </em>and 8 of defendants\u2019 motion to strike are each sustained upon the ground that each of the parts of the petition thus assailed is wholly immaterial, irrelevant, and redundant, and such parts of the pleading will be and are stricken therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> By paragraph 9 of their motion the defendants ask that plaintiff be required to make more specific the allegations of the petition therein quoted, which paragraph is sustained, and plaintiff required to comply with such paragraph, so far as known to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Said motion is therefore overruled in part and sustained in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Counsel for the defendants have also filed a demurrer to count 2 of the petition upon the following grounds: (1) The plaintiff does not have capacity under the laws of the United States to bring said cause of action in this court. (2) This court is without jurisdiction, under the laws of the United States, to hear and determine the cause of action alleged and set forth in count 2 of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">By this demurrer the defendants challenge the right of the plaintiff to maintain this action upon count 2 of the petition upon the grounds: (1) That plaintiff has not capacity to maintain this action; and (2) that the court is without jurisdiction to determine this controversy.' Just what the plaintiff\u2019s want of capacity to maintain this suit is', is not clear, unless it be that the plaintiff\u2019s citizenship is not alleged, which it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">By the alleged want of jurisdiction to determine this controversy it may be that it is because it is not alleged that the Congress has consented to this suit being brought against the United States. Of these in their order:</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">1. If the alleged want of capacity is a failure to show the plaintiff\u2019s citizenship, that may be amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> 2.

The reason for the establishment of such Bureau is \"stated in the preamble to the act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-6\">\u201cWhereas, the foreign commerce of the United States is now greatly impeded and endangered through the absence of adequate facilities for the insurance of American vessels and their cargoes against the risks of war; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">\u201cWhereas, it is deemed necessary and expedient that the United States shall temporarily provide for the export shipping trade of the Unite.d States adequate facilities for the insurance of its commerce against the risks of war.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">That such insurance would be within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States can hardly be doubted.

Section 405, p. 410 (see Comp. St. Ann.

In the absence of such disagreement there is nothing for the court to determine, and the Bureau of War Risk Insurance is fully authorized and empowered to adjust the plaintiff\u2019s claim and award to him the amount it may find upon investigation to which he may be entitled under his policy of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> Whether or not this court <em>sitting in admiralty </em>would have jurisdiction of the plaintiff\u2019s suit may be doubted, but it would depend upon the contract or policy issued to him, and the circumstances or manner in which he was injured.
