Policies cover \u201con merchandise, principally manufactured paper stored in the lower main building of the casein factory * * * [at] Bellows Falls, Vt.,\u201d and contain the usual provision that they are \u201cvoid,if the insured has concealed or misrepresented * * * any material fact or circumstance concerning this insurance or the subject thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-6\">Defendant maintained no agency in Vermont, and had no license in or from that state. It is a French corporation, and had as its general agents in this country James &amp; Co., of New York; it also had as general agents for Boston and its suburbs Field &amp; Cowles of that city, in whose office was one Barton, to whom desk room was furnished rent free, and who himself had authority to issue insurance in the name of defendant in a part of Field &amp; Cowles\u2019 territory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-7\">Plaintiff is a corporation having many plants in divers parts of the country, and in respect of some, if not much of its New England property had, for some years before issuance of the policies' in suit, gotten much of its insurance through Barton. An officer or agent of plaintiff in New York, telegraphed and wrote to Barton in Boston telling him to \u201cinsure contents of lower building casein warehouse, Bellows Falls, Vt.,\u201d in an amount greater than the policies in suit, and authorizing him to \u201crenew line * * * covering paper stored in lower building of [said] casein warehouse.\u201d Plaintiff gave no other instructions or information, and we infer, from absence of evidence on the point, that it thought Barton needed nothing more; he had visited the locality, but (as he testified) not very recently. Barton preferred to obtain so much of the desired insurance as he allotted to defendant from and through James &amp; Co., because some six months earlier \u201cI made a connection with James &amp; Co., and began to divert from Field &amp; Cowles all risks outside of Massachusetts.\u201d He testified that he \u201chad risks all over the New England States,\u201d and placed them \u201cin the same way [he] placed\u201d this insurance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-8\">James &amp; Co. issued the policies in suit on Barton\u2019s written request, and (as we must assume after the verdict) in such writing Barton misrepresented material facts concerning the subject of this insurance, viz., the contents of the casein factory were not \u201cprincipally manufactured paper,\u201d but stock and rags of a more inflammable nature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-9\">The trial judge sent to the jury, not only the nature of the factory contents, but the question whether Barton was in respect of the policies in suit the agent of plaintiff or defendant. A general verdict for defendant having been rendered, and judgment entered accordingly, plaintiff took this writ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-10\">Stetson, Jennings &amp; Russell, of New York City.

With the tangled and dubious question of acts within what has been called such agents\u2019 apparent authority, we are not now concerned. Cf. Mechem Agency (3d Ed.) \u00a7 1049. A policy once issued is a written contract, to be interpreted in a federal court as required by Northern, etc., Co. v. Grand View, etc., Ass\u2019n, 183 U. S. 308, 349, 22 Sup. Ct. 133, 46 L. Ed. 213, limiting Insurance Co. v. Wilkinson, 13 Wall. 222, 20 L. Ed. 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> In the affair now before us, the insured undoubtedly employed Barton first; but he was both an insurance agent and an insurance broker, as we are assured by his own evidence. It is not impossible for a man so to do business (Mannheim, etc., Co. v. Hollander [D. C.] 112 Fed. 551), and function at different times in both capacities. It is the question in this case, In what capacity was Barton acting when he asked James to issue the policies in suit? And most of plaintiff\u2019s exceptions rest on the belief that as matter of law he was defendant\u2019s agent, and the court should have so directed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> This can only be true if there was no \u201cevidence before the jury \u25a0 \u2014 whether it be weak or strong \u2014 which does so much as tend to prove the issue on the part of\u201d the side against which such direction is given. Hickman v. Jones, 9 Wall. 197, 19 L. Ed. 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> Assuredly that is not true in this case; and it is sufficient to refer to Hough v. City, etc., Co., 29 Conn. 10, 76 Am. Dec. 581, cited with apparent approval in Northern Assur. Co. v. Grand View Bldg. Ass\u2019n, 183 U. S. 324, 22 Sup. Ct. 133, 46 L. Ed. 213, for an illustration of a jury issue far less obvious than the present. A similar course was pursued in Mohr v. Insurance Co. (C. C.) 13 Fed. 74, and Queen, etc., Co. v. Union Bank, 111 Fed. 697, 49 C. C. A. 555, where the insured applied \u201cto persons known to have authority * * * to issue policies of insurance,\u201d something' weighing far more heavily against the insurer than anything shown here, for that Barton had np right whatever to issue a policy on goods in Vermont is admitted. The error of plaintiff\u2019s argument is in assuming that an agent for one purpose, must be an agent for another; he may be, or the principal may be estopped from asserting the contrary; and it is the possibility that carries the issue to the jury. Whether under all the evidence herein, a verdict for the plaintiff could have been sustained, is not before us, and no opinion is expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> Plaintiff complains, further, that it was not permitted to put in evidence certain formal .papers filed in a public office in Massachusetts and showing Barton\u2019s agency. But Barton had already testified to his agency, its nature and extent, and those papers added nothing thereto. It is a mistake to suppose that, when a thing is proved, either party has a legal right to prove it over again in a way he likes better. At the most, the matter is one for the discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> Again complaint is made (in substance) that defendant was permitted to show by Barton\u2019s own testimony that he was plaintiff\u2019s broker or agent. This is argued under cover of authorities holding that- agency cannot be proved by the \u201cacts and declarations\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>alleged agent \u2014 a proposition not doubted. Baldwin v. Connecticut, etc., Co., 182 Mass. 389, 65 N. E. 837. But here we have Barton\u2019s evidence, and that an agent can testify to his own agency is certainly true. Livingston v. Swanwick, 2 Dall. 300, Fed. Cas. No. 8,419.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">We do not think it necessary to discuss the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
