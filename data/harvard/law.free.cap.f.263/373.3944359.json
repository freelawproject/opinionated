The margins of most of the pages are ornamented with reproductions of drawings representing military scenes, and the cover is of white paper bearing on its front the title aforesaid and a drawing of General Pershing. The pamphlet was designed to be sold on the streets or bought in quantities for gratuitous distribution by the buyer, as is asserted in argument and not denied. As the publication was timely, the sales were remarkably large, and were to a considerable extent made through the individual defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-4\">The alleged infringement is a pamphlet of substantially the same size, bound in white paper and entitled \u201cGeneral Pershing\u2019s Official Story of the American Expeditionary Forces in France.\u201d Defendants\u2019 pamphlet has likewise portraits of General Pershing on the cover and an interior page, but evidently not reproduced from the same original drawings or photographs as plaintiff\u2019s. It consists (as does plaintiff\u2019s) of the General\u2019s official report set forth on the same number of, pages, and it is ornamented, not with pictures on the margin, but with representations of the corps and divisional badges of the A. E. F. in tinted ink on the page centers and supplemented by two of the three poems contained in plaintiff\u2019s pamphlets, but these two sets of verses were reprinted by both plaintiff and defendants by permission of the owners of the copyright thereof. Defendants\u2019 pages containing the poems are ornamented by drawings suggestive of war, but entirely different in detail from those of plaintiff\u2019s, though in both books the picture on the page bearing a poem is evidently thought to be appropriate to the subject of the poem.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">The court below dismissed the bill, and plaintiff took this appeal.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-6\">Dunn, Goodlett, Massie &amp; Scott, of New York City (Ralph E.

What is registered is a \u201cclaim to copyright.\u201d Act March 4, 1909, c. 320, \u00a7 10 (Comp. St. \u00a7 9531). There is no provision for examination, as in the case of patents, and probably for that reason the act (section 3 [Comp. St. \u00a7 9519]) declares that protection is extended to \u201call the copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted.\u201d The inference is that there may be in that for which claim is made much to which the protection of the act cannot extend. This is but recognition of law existing long before the present statute. Black v. Allen Co. (C. C.) 42 Fed. 618, 9 L. R. A. 433, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">This action rests on copyright alone, though the pleadings contain an abandoned suggestion of unfair competition. Therefore the first inquiry is: What does the plaintiff\u2019s pamphlet contain that is copyrightable matter ? Certainly not General Pershing\u2019s official report, that being a. public document. Admitting this, plaintiff rests on the doctrine of Callaghan v. Meyers, 128 U. S. 617, 9 Sup. Ct. 177, 32 L. Ed. 547, and thereby necessarily likens the addenda, the ornamentation, and indeed the \u201cget-up\u201d of his pamphlet, to the original matter specified in that well-known decision as the original matter commonly added by reporters to judicial decisions. Considering that the official report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>standing alone, could not be copyrighted, we pass over the question whether what the plaintiff added, or any substantial portion thereof was in its nature copyrightable; we prefer to deal only with infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> \u201cInfringement\u201d is a word not defined in our statute. It is assumed to be something already known to the law (section 25), and where the subject of copyright is a book, infringement consists in the copying of some substantial and material part thereof (Chatterton v. Cave, 3 App. Cas. 483). In this instance, defendants may be said to have copied nothing that was copyrightable in plaintiff\u2019s pamphlet, assuming that all was copyrightable except the report. What defendants did was to learn by handling plaintiff\u2019s pamphlet that there was a good market for the report, and so they imitated plaintiff\u2019s attractive get-up therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">This conduct may be called mean, but it is not punishable under the Copyright Act (Comp. St. \u00a7\u00a7 9517 et seq.). It is even possible that defendants\u2019 printers set up'the official report from a copy of plaintiff\u2019s book; identity of pagination leads to that suspicion; but legally that is not of sufficient importance to constitute infringement of copyright. Banks, etc., Co. v. Lawyers\u2019, etc., Co., 169 Fed. 386, 94 C. C. A. 642, 17 Ann. Cas. 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">But, however unattractive in a business or moral sense defendants\u2019 conduct has been, it was open to any one to print and publish the public document in question, and there is as much original additional labor in defendants\u2019 selection of pictures as there was in plaintiff\u2019s selection of different pictures. In this sense the later publication, made up of matter open to the whole world can itself be called original and new. Chautauqua School v. National School, 238 Fed. 151, 151 C. C. A. 227. Assuming, then, that plaintiff\u2019s pamphlet contains any copyrightable matter, we are of opinion (1) that defendants\u2019 is not an infringement; and (2) that it may itself be pronounced a new and original work, in the very broad sense the law compels us to attach that name to trivialities having pecuniary value. Hein v. Harris (C. C.) 175 Fed. 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The decree appealed from is affirmed, but, under the circumstances, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
