N. Y. \u00a7 797, by being placed in' the post-office at Caledonia directed to plaintiff\u2019s attorney at Rochester, and affidavits of defendant and his attorney stating that such was their recollection were filed. The envelope in which the answer was sent was postmarked at Caledonia \u201cMarch 26. \u201d The postmaster at Rochester testified that it could not have been mailed on March 26th, as it appeared by the postmark, of his office, that it was not received there until March 28th. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney made affidavit that early in the morning of March 27th he received mail matter postmarked at Caledonia on March 26th. <em>Held, </em>that an order refusing to set the judgment aside would not be disturbed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b201-16\">Appeal from special term, Monroe county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-17\">.

The last day for answering was the\"26th day of March, 1889. The affidavits of the defendant and his attorney are measurably positive that the answer which had been prepared was mailed upon that day by the attorney at the village of Caledonia, properly addressed to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. In corroboration of this, the envelope thereof with the postmark-clearly indicating the words and figures, \u201cMarch 26,\u201d is produced. In opposition to these facts there appears a strong affidavit by the assistant postmaster at Rochester to the effect that such mailing could not have taken place on the 26th of March, inasmuch as it was equally clear by the postmark at Rochester that the letter was not received at Rochester until the 28th. One of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys also testifies that he received, early in the morning of the 27th, mail matter from Caledonia that was mailed on the 26th. The rule is unquestioned that the party addressed takes the hazards of the mail, and that, if an answer is actually deposited in the post-office within the time limited by the statute, the service is sufficient. Yet we are not bound by the appearance of the postmark upon an envelope; for it is not incredible that in the small uncommercial districts there is not that carefulness in changing the stamps that prevails in larger towns. The affidavits of the defendant and bis attorney cannot be deemed to be conclusive upon this matter, for the reason that they speak only from recollection; hence it is that the judge at special term might well entertain doubts as <em>to the </em>principal fact involved in the motion, and, so entertaining them, he seems to have, made a proper disposition of the motion. The order should be affirmed with $10 costs, and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
