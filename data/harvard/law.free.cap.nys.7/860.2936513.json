The department of parks not having ratified or accepted the work, or taken any action in the matter, the property owner cannot claim benefits which would have arisen had that department legally constructed it; and, if it was constructed by the proper authorities, there is no basis for the reduction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b884-11\">8.
