Gui\u00f3n against David T. Williams and Isaac M. Hunt, executors of Benjamin L. Gui\u00f3n, deceased, to compel defendants to transfer to plaintiff two certificates of stock belonging to her, but held by defendants\u2019 testator in his own name. Plaintiff was the widow of defendants\u2019 testator, and they had lived together for 52 years before his death. There was evidence that plaintiff had a large amount of money, which was in the care and under the management of her husband. After his death there were found in his box in the safe-deposit vaults four certificates of stock, in an envelope marked, in his own handwriting, \u201cM. A. Gui\u00f3n,\u201d and on the envelope was the following indorsement, signed by him: \u201c50 shares American Express, 50 shares Wells, Fargo, 50 shares Adams, 50 shares Bock Island, standing in my name, which my executors will transfer to M. A. Gui\u00f3n.\u201d The Adams, and Wells, Fargo, Express certificates were issued to \u201cB. L. Gui\u00f3n, in trust for Martha A. Gui\u00f3n.\u201d The American Express certificate was issued to Benjamin L. Gui\u00f3n, trustee, New York. The Chicago &amp; Bock Island stock stood in the name of B. L. Gui\u00f3n, individually. There was evidence that a large part of plaintiff\u2019s money was used by her husband to pay for this American Express Company stock; that the certificates of the American Express and of the Bock Island had both been originally made out in the name of \u201cB. L. Gui\u00f3n, in trust for M. A. Gui\u00f3n,\u201d but the words \u201cfor M. A. Gui\u00f3n,\u201d had been erased from the American Express certificate, and the words \u201cin trust for M. A. Gui\u00f3n\u201d from the Bock Island certificate; that the words \u201cin trust for M. A. Gui\u00f3n\u201d had been originally written at the instance of B. L. Gui\u00f3n, but had been erased, because the rules of the companies were such as to make it inconvenient to have stock issued in trust for a specific person; that the dividends on this stock were paid to plaintiff\u2019s husband, and by him deposited to the credit of plaintiff. There was judgment for plaintiff. Defendants appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b811-6\">Argued before Barnard, P.

The testimony was taken before a referee appointed for that purpose, with power to take the same and report it to the court, with his opinion. Besides taking the testimony and reporting the same to the court, with his opinion, the referee undertook to make findings of fact and law, and to decide the case against the plaintiff. That was beyond the scope of his authority, and his findings have neither place nor influence in the case. When the case was presented to the judge at special term he found no difficulty in deciding the case in favor of the plaintiff, and'did so by appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judgment has been entered upon such findings; and the defendants appeal therefrom, and from the order granting an additional allowance to the plaintiff. There is no merit in eithei1-\u2018appeal. The testimony was abundant to establish the claim of the plaintiff, and left no excuse for the defense of the action. As we fully concur in the opinion rendered by the judge at the special term, it is neither profitable nor necessary to make a lengthy examination or statement of the case here. The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
