Their finding is satisfactory. The exceptions taken apply to the refusal of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>judge to dismiss the complaint because it alleged a gift <em>inter vivas, </em>and the testimony established, if anything, a gift <em>causa mortis, </em>and no proper demand was proved. The evidence clearly established a demand, with notice of the plaintiff\u2019s rights; and in defiance of such demand and notice the money claimed was paid to another. The complaint alleged an absolute gift and transfer, and under this the plaintiff was allowed, without objection, to prove a gift <em>causa mortis, </em>and the trial judge properly allowed the plaintiff to amend his complaint, then and there, by alleging a gift <em>causa mortis, </em>(Code, \u00a7 723;) in other words, by making the pleadings conform to the proofs. No one was misled or surprised, and the amendment was in furtherance of justice. We have failed to discover any error, and the judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
