The recognizance was forfeited on said last-named day. On subsequently learning that it had been forfeited, the surety produced the prisoner, and surrendered him, on June 3, 1889. His cause was set down for trial the next day. His witnesses attended at that time. The complainant did not appear, the officer not being able to serve him with a subpoena, and the prisoner was then discharged. If the affidavit of the subpoena server is to be taken as sufficient evidence that the complainant was notified to appear in court, then we must assume that the reason why the cause was never tried was because of his neglect to prosecute. It does not appear that any obstruction to justice was caused by any act of the prisoner or his surety. The prosecution was for assault and battery. I think the judgment on the recognizance should be discharged. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
