Gammond against the Bowery Savings Bank to recover money deposited by Michael Galligan, who made an absolute gift of it, accompanied with his bank-book, to plaintiff, and subsequently died. The book contained the following among other regulations: \u201c Drafts may be.made personally, or by the order in writing of the depositor, or by letters of attorney duly authenticated.\u201d The defense was that no legal demand could be rqade for the money except by compliance with this rule. The trial judge ordered judgment for the amount of the deposit, and interest, and defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b345-19\">Argued before McAdam, C.

As he says: \u201cThe alleged contract of deposit does not limit nor impair the absolute right of the depositor as a creditor of the defendant;\u201d and that \u201cit refers only to the proof upon which the depositor may require a payment to himself, or to another at his request. \u201d It did not prevent the creditor from passing the demand by general or specific assignment, by gift or bequest, or by operation of law, such as bankruptcy proceedings, or the appointment of a receiver, in the life-time of the creditor, or by the appointment of an administrator, or qualification pf an executor, after death. In either of these cases the fund would pass to and be assets in the hands of the assignee, donee, beneficiary, or legal representative, on whom the title devolved, (see <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>2 E. D. Smith, 305,) without a written order or power of attorney signed by the depositor and duly authenti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>coted, according to the rules of the bank. For these reasons the plaintiff acquired good title to the fund, and the judgment rendered awarding it to her must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
