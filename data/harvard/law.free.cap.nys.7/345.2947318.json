The learned judge ignores the views which were expressed by this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Trustees, (Coppers </em>Case,) 21 Hun, 184. In that case, a receipt similar to the present, but more favorable to the holder\u2019s contention, was fully considered, and its inadequacy to confer a legal and enforceable right pointed out. The question there was whether a <em>mandamus </em>would lie. Incidentally, we held that it was \u201ceven doubtful whether equity would decree a specific performance. \u201d Upon that question a definite opinion was reserved. It was enough for the denial of the <em>mandamus </em>that the right, if any existed, was an equitable one, and such as could not be enforced at law. We endeavored to show that there was absolutely no legal right, and that an equitable right was extremely doubtful. This latter question is now before us for a decided and definite opinion. To its accurate solution a clear statement of the precise facts is essential. , Let us, for the monent, assume that burial has been arbitrarily refused. Thus, it is said, McGuire has been denied his \u201cproperty rights.\u201d What, then, are these property rights? They-\u2022rest exclusively upon the receipt given <em>in extenso, </em>in Mr. Justice Daniel\u2019s opinion. There is not a particle of evidence in the case of any paroi agreement, except such as may be implied from the possession of that paper. What took place between the parties when Mr. John McGuire paid the \u00a910 specified in the receipt to Mr. D. Brennan, the \u201csuperintendent of the office of Calvary Cemetery, \u201d we know not. What their bargain was is entirely un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>disclosed. Whether it was a bargain for the burial of one person, or of two- or more persons, for the burial of McGuire himself, of his family, of both, or of Catholics outside of his family, are all mere matters of conjecture. What we know is that, as the result of some undisclosed paroi agreement, Brennan gave McGuire a receipt for $10, specifying that such sum was the \u201camount-of purchase money of a grave,\u201d the location of which is indicated by some-words and figures which appear beneath Mr. Brennan\u2019s signature. 1 have-said that the receipt in the <em>Coppers Case </em>was more favorable than this to the holder\u2019s contention; for there it read, \u201camount of purchase money of' a plot of ground, eight feet by eight feet. \u201d That receipt was also more complete and specific, in that it particularized and numbered the graves for which the plot of ground should be utilized. I quote the form of this enumeration: \u201c4 graves, 5, 6, 7, 8.\u201d Here we have nothing of the kind. There is proof in the case that the located grave would hold four bodies, -and perhaps even more; but who shall say that the parties contemplated packing the earth (two-feet by eight) in such an extremely economical fashion ? Is it to be implied from a receipt for the purchase money of a grave,\u2014that receipt standing alone, and without a <em>scintilla </em>of evidence tending to pluralize the expression?' I cannot think it. How, upon these facts, what in law were Mr. McGuire's-precise property rights? Were they such as can be specifically enforced by his administrator in a court of equity? That is the real question. How, in the first place, it is very clear that the right of burial is either an easement or a license. If an easement, it is an interest in the land; if a license, it is not. In the former case, the right is permanent; in the latter, it is personal and. revocable. There are some subtle suggestions in the old cases with regard, to irrevocable licenses founded upon good consideration. It seems to me,, however, that, when we talk of an irrevocable license founded upon a good, consideration, we simply run into the domain of easements. However that may be, it is not claimed that McGuire here acquired an easement; nor, indeed, could such a claim be defended, for the simple and sufficient reason, that there was no grant. The learned counsel for the plaintiff rests his claim, upon the purchase of a license or privilege which he contends was irrevocable, and enforceable by bill for specific performance. If, however, McGuire acquired no interest in the land, as is fully conceded in the appellant\u2019s second point, and as is unquestionably the law, it is difficult to see what basis there-can be for a decree that the land be perpetually burdened.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">If the plaintiff proceeds as the successor of a mere license, he is met by the-principle of revocation, and also by the rule that courts of equity will not. specifically enforce such privileges. Mr. Pomeroy, in his work on Specific Performance, (section 132,) says that in certain states a paroi license to enter upon and occupy land of the licensor, and to do acts thereon, \u201cif partly executed by the licensee, so that injury which is technically called \u2018 irreparable \u2019 would be caused by its revocation, will be specifically enforced. * * *- This rule is undoubtedly opposed to the common-law doctrine concerning licenses as it prevails in England and in most of the American states.\u201d In a note to this section it is said that the proposition stated in the text is most strongly maintained by decisions of the Pennsylvania courts. These Pennsylvania cases (notably <em>Rerick </em>v. <em>Kern, </em>14 Serg. &amp; R. 267) were considered by Duer, J., in <em>Jamieson </em>v. <em>Millemann, </em>3 Duer, 255. That learned judge-said: \u201cIt cannot, however, be denied that the supreme court of Pennsylvania * * * has held that a paroi license may, in special cases, have ithefull operation of a grant; but the decisions in Pennsylvania stand alone, and will be found, upon examination, to proceed upon a doctrine which is peculiar to the courts of that state. * <em>* * </em>As evidence of the law that we are-bound to administer, \u201d these decisions \u201chave no authority whatever.\u201d Judge Duer also points out the distinction between an executed license, the effect of which is merely to suspend the enjoyment of an easement, (as in <em>Winter </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>Brockwell, </em>8 East, 308,) and a license warranting acts to be done by the licensee upon the lands of the licensor. In the former case the doctrine is nothing more than that, by a paroi license without a deed, the enjoyment of an easement may be waived or extinguished. This doctrine of <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Brockwell </em>(and also of <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Rawson, </em>3 Barn. &amp; C. 332, and <em>Liggins </em>v. <em>Inge, </em>7 Bing. 682) is said to be wholly inapplicable when \u201cthe effect of holding the license to be irrevocable would be to give to the licensee a permanent interest or easement in these lands of the licensor;\u201d and the learned judge adds that this \u201chas been determined in numerous cases in the English courts, in those of our sister states, and emphatically in our own.\u201d See the cases cited by Judge Duer in support of this latter statement,-, page 260, to which I add <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>4 Sandf. Ch. 73. As Chief Justice Savage said in <em>Mumford </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>15 Wend. 393, \u201cto decide that a right to a permanent occupation of the plaintiff\u2019s land maybe acquired by paroi, and by calling the agreement a \u2018license,\u2019 would be in effect to repeal the statute. \u201d It follows that as plaintiff has no grant, and consequently no easement, and as his license is revocable, and cannot be specifically enforced, he has no property rights whatever which will authorize a court of equity to grant him the extraordinary remedy of a mandatory decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The question remains whether a case has been made out for a specific performance of a paroi agreement for the grant of an easement. In <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Lueksinger, </em>84 N. Y. 38, this question was considered upon facts somewhat analogous to those now before us. The court first discussed the claim of license, holding that \u201ca right of drainage through the lands of another is an easement, requiring for its enjoyment an interest in such lands, which cannot be conferred by paroi license. It can only be granted by \u2018 deed or conveyance in writing.\u2019\u201d The head-note disposes of the question of consideration in these words: \u201cA mere license to drain is not made irrevocable by the fact that a valuable consideration was paid therefor.\u201d In answer to the remaining contention, namely, that courts of equity would give effect to paroi agreements for the grant of easements when founded upon a valuable consideration, Danforth, J., observed that \u201cthe contract which equity will regard as equivalent to the grant required at common law or by the statute must be a complete and sufficient contract, founded not only on a valuable consideration, but its terms defined by satisfactory proof, and accompanied by acts of part performance unequivocally referable to the supposed agreement;\u201d and again: \u201cThere are, no doubt, many cases in which courts recognize an equitable right to an easement without a deed; but there will be found in them either an express agreement for an easement, or an acquiescence or consent by conduct which has led to the erecting of permanent works, or valuable and lasting improvements, or some other fact which would make the assertion of a legal title operate as a fraud upon the persons setting up the equitable right. \u201d The doctrine of this case was reaffirmed in <em>Cronkhite </em>v. <em>Cronkhite, </em>94 N. Y. 323. Miller, J., repeated the language of Danforth, J., which I have quoted, and he referred to the facts of the former case in these words: \u201cIn the case of <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Lucksinger, </em>the plaintiff had paid a sum of money for permission to drain his lot upon the land of the defendant, and took a receipt for the same, and he used and enjoyed the privilege for twenty-five years, when the defendant revoked the permission. In an action to enforce the right of the plaintiff, it was held that * * * the right to drain was</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">an easement which could not be conferred by paroi license, but could be granted only by deed or conveyance in writing, and that an oral contract, which equity will regard as equivalent to the grant required at common law or by statute, must, as already stated, be a complete and sufficient contract in all its parts.\u201d These cases were referred to with approval, and cited in support of like propositions, in <em>Duryee </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>96 N. Y. 484, and <em>Fargis </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>107 N. Y. 403, 14 N. E. Rep. 303. It is apparent from the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>ment of facts with which I have prefaced these legal considerations that the present case, treated even as a bill for the specific performance of a paroi agreement for the grant of an easement, falls far short of what is required by the principles enunciated in these authorities. In all of the cases there was at least some oral testimony in support of the paroi agreement. It was not left entirely to the implications deducible from a mere receipt for money. Thus, in <em>Wiseman </em>v. Lucksinger, <em>ubi supra, </em>the plaintiff testified to the parol agreement, (page 43,) and the defendant denies the receipt of the alleged consideration. The plaintiff also proved the loss of a receipt, said to have been given to him by the defendant, which one of the witnesses testified was in the following form: \u201cBeeeived of(Joseph Wiseman $7 for the right to drain through my premises,\u201d\u2014a receipt singularly analogous to the present. The plaintiff\u2019s contention there was that a valid contract must be implied from these words; that the defendant thereby agreed, for the expressed consideration, to cede to the plaintiff the right to drain through his lands; and that equity would enforce the agreement. But the court denied the completeness of the contract to be implied from this receipt, even when read in the'light of the oral testimony behind and supporting it, and denied relief because the agreement was not entirely clear in all its parts. The court also denied relief because there had been no part performance within the rules laid down in courts of equity. Beferring to the latter head, Danforth, J., observed that the receipt contains \u201ca mere license or permission to drain, and no agreement to convey an easement; nor is the license coupled with any interest in the land. It was therefore revocable, and its revocation did not operate as a fraud upon the plaintiff. . His expenditures were trifling, and, for aught that appears, have been mor\u00e9 than repaid in the use already had by the plaintiff of the privilege given to him.\u201d The conclusion of the court upon this branch of the case was that \u201cthe agreement, however, to be implied from the receipt was undoubtedly good as a license, giving to the plaintiff immunity while acting under its privilege, but no vested -right entitling him to its use or enjoyment against the will of the grantor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The case of <em>Cronkhite </em>v. <em>Cronkhite </em>is also very much in point. There the paroi agreement was for the laying down of pipes to carry water from a spring on the licensor\u2019s <em>lands\u2014First, </em>to the licensor\u2019s buildings; and, <em>second, </em>to buildings on the licensee\u2019s lands. The referee found as a fact, on the oral testimony, \u201cthat it was agreed that Henry C. Cronkhite [the licensee] should bear one-half the expense, and perform half the labor, of procuring and laying down the logs and pipes, etc.; and that, in consideration of such expenditure and labor, he should have a right to take water from said spring through logs and pipes in perpetuity.\u201d Upon this, Miller, J., observed that \u201cthe testimony upon the trial established a paroi contract between John C. Cronkhite [the licensor] and Henry C. Cronkhite, whereby Henry C. was to take and use the water; and there was proof that both parties acted in accordance with that agreement. Money was expended by Henry C., pipes .were laid down and improvements made in connection with the use of the water, but there was no specific agreement as to the size of the pipes, the-amount of water to be carried through them, how far below the surfaee'they were to be laid,\u201d etc. It was accordingly held that the agreement could not be enforced. \u201cDisagreements,\u201d said Judge Miller, \u201cmight also arise as to how and when and where the pipes should be laid and repaired, and as to the manner in which the spring should be protected; and thus it would be difficult for a court of equity to determine the precise character of the agreement. The evidence given upon the trial was too-vague and uncertain to establish a valid agreement in perpetuity such as the law recognizes. The statute re-' quires an agreement of this character to be in writing, expressing a consideration; and to establish it otherwise, by adverse possession, the proof should be entirely clear as to the nature and specific character of the agreement, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>that it can be eventually carried out and enforced.\u201d In <em>Kincaid\u2019s Appeal, </em>66 Pa. St. 411, an instrument of far greater, weight and importance than the present receipt was spoken of as a \u201cvery loose paper.\u201d The court there refers to the instrument as follows: \u201c The certificate set out in the bill states that the subscriber, in consideration of $10 paid by him, is entitled to * two burying lots in the burying ground of said church,\u2019 * to have and to hold the said lots for the use and purpose, and subject to the conditions and regulations, mentioned in the deed of trust to the trustees of said church.\u2019 * * * We cannot consider this certificate as evidence of a grant to the lot-holders of any interest or title in the soil. * * * Taking it for a grant, it is only for the life of the lot-holder, and at the very time it would be needed for his own interment his title would cease. Without accompanying conditions and regulations, it is a very loose paper.\u201d In <em>Dwenger v. Geary, </em>113 Ind. 106, 14 N. E. Rep. 903, where the <em>Coppers Case </em>is commented upon, quoted from, and approved, the receipt seems to have been in substantially the same form as the present. The court found that John Geary had never received any conveyance. \u201cThe only instrument executed,\u201d said the court, \u201cwas a receipt for money. This, and nothing more, does he [Geary] hold in the form of a written evidence of title. It is clear, therefore, that he is a mere licensee. This license conveys no interest in the land. It does no more than confer a privilege.\u201d In that case the supreme court of Indiana was not considering the possibility of specifically enforcing such a privilege. The question was whether an injunction should be granted to the authorities of the church restraining the receipt-holder from attempting to exercise the privilege implied by its terms; and such injunction was granted. And in Maryland <em>(Partridge </em>v. <em>First Independent Church, </em>39 Md. 631) it was held that a certificate with words of grant to the party, \u201chis heirs and assigns, forever,\u201d conveyed \u201cno estate or title, nor a grant of an easement, because the instrument was not under seal and recorded, so as to be effective to convey such interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">It seems useless to multiply authorities upon this point, for the present case is not as strong in its equity as the weakest of those already cited. In the absence of any paroi testimony, and standing upon the naked possession of the receipt, how is it possible here for a court of equity to decree specific performance of a supposed contract for the grant of an easement? We are asked to imply all the terms of a complete and specific agreement from the words in the receipt, \u201camount of purchase <em>money o\u00ed </em>a grave, two feet by eight, in Calvary cemetery;\u201d the two feet by eight being located beneath the superintendent\u2019s signature as \u201cgrave 9, plot F, section 8, range 56.\u201d The amount of purchase money of a grave. Was the contract completely fulfilled when a \u201cgrav\u00e9\u201d was opened for Mrs. McGuire, and her body permitted to rest there? Can it be said that even that question is entirely free from doubt? Or was the contract personal to McGuire, and did it terminate, as suggested in <em>Kincaid\u2019s Case, ubi supra, </em>upon his death? If the agreement to be implied from the receipt passed to McGuire\u2019s administrator, what actual right thus passed? If this receipt implies a property right to burden the soil with as many bodies as can be decently placed in the located two feet by eight, can this admistrator renew his demand from time to time? If so, can he place there, for a consideration paid to him as the representative of McGuire\u2019s estate, the bodies of strangers in blood to the family, provided they are Catholics ? Could McGuire himself have done that under this receipt? And in this process of burdening the soil with numerous bodies, in or out of the family, how deep might McGuire have dug, and how deep may this administrator now dig? The mere outlining of these questions clearly indicates that the receipt, to again quote the language used in <em>Kincaid\u2019s Appeal, </em>\u201c without accompanying conditions and regulations, is a very loose paper.\u201d We look in vain throughout this case for any such accompanying conditions or regulations. Even tlie cemetery rules, so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>as they were read in evidence and appear in the printed case, shed no light upon the obscurity involved in the language used in this receipt; nor do they indicate, directly or indirectly, the precise terms or the specific conditions of the agreement. Nor does the undertaker\u2019s testimony, as to the usage of the cem.etery, establish any definite rule, either as to the allowable depth of the grave, or as to the number of bodies which the receipt-holder is permitted to place there, or as to the character or personality of the occupants. The entire testimony on that head was as follows: \u201cI have been in the undertaking business about fourteen years, and during that time have made a great many interments in Calvary Cemetery, and am familiar with its regulations. In the old ground graves are usually dug eight feet deep, and in the new ground now they are dug nine feet deep. The grave described in plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit A is in the old cemetery. It is usual to bury more than one body in a grave. <em>Question. </em>How many bodies can be safely and properly buried in this grave? <em>Answer. </em>Four bodies, and sometimes more. I have got three in mine, and there is room for two more. I have known numerous cases in which two or three bodies have been buried in one grave in Calvary Cemetery. I can name my own case,\u2014my sister and father and mother, and room for two more. \u201d The case on this head is thus clearly within the principles laid down in <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Lucksinger </em>and <em>Cronkhite </em>v. <em>Cronkhite, </em>above cited. It is also within the rule as to part performance. The act of permitting Mrs. McGuire\u2019s body to burden the soil was in no proper sense an act of part performance. It was simply a partial enjoyment of the privilege. It was an act of burden on the part of the licensor; of enjoyment on the part of the licensee. McGuire never expended a penny upon the grave. The trustees were guilty of no such conduct as to lead McGuire\u2014to quote again Judge Danforth\u2019s words in <em>Wiseman </em>v. Lucksinger\u2014\u201cto erect permanent works, or valuable and lasting im pro vein ents. \u201d Nor was there any other fact which would make the revocation of the license, or the refusal to fulfill the implied obligation,\u2014whatever it may have been,-\u2014a fraud upon McGuire or his legal representatives. It does not appear that McGuire ever placed even a headstone upon his wife\u2019s grave. The part performance, therefore, (or the complete performance, as the receipt may be viewed,) was wholly on the side of the licensor; and, as we pointed out in the <em>Coppers Case, </em>the payment of the consideration did not operate as such part performance. <em>People </em>v. Trustees, <em>(Coppers Case,) </em>194, citing Story, Eq. Jur. \u00a7 760; <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>3 Sandf. Ch. 284. See, also, on the point under consideration, the cases already cited of <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Lucksinger </em>and <em>Cronkhite </em>v. <em>Cronkhite.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">I have thus considered this case precisely as though the rights of property claimed by the plaintiff had come from a secular cemetery. The weakness of the plaintiff\u2019s equity is still more strikingly apparent. The record contains an express admission by the plaintiff of the allegation in the answer that the cemetery lands in question were set apart and consecrated, with appropriate religious ceremonies, by the ministry of a priest or priests of the Roman Catholic Church, for the exclusive purpose of the burial of the remains of persons who may die in communion with that church. McGuire was a Catholic. As such, he entered the denominational domain; as such, he obtained the receipt in question from the denominational cemetery office. What transpired at the time he so obtained that receipt is, as we have already seen, entirely unknown. What may safely be affirmed, however, is that he sought burial privilege in a denominational cemetery thus consecrated to the exclusive purpose of the burial of those dying in communion' with the church. That denominational rule must certainly be implied (as part of the agreement) from the receipt, and the surroundings under which it was sought and obtained. It is as though the receipt had read: Received from John McGuire $10, being amount of purchase money of a grave, two feet by eight, in the ground of Calvary Cemetery, which has been consecrated for the exclusive purpose of the burial of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u2022mains of persons who may die in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. That is the paroi agreement,\u2014the only one which can possibly be implied. The plaintiff, too, recognized this, for he averred in his complaint that McGuire died in the Catholic faith and in communion with the church. And it was only when, upon the trial, the difficulty of proving affirmatively the latter assertion weighed upon him, that he struck it from his complaint, and claimed that it was superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Now, who is to determine whether McGuire died in that communion? Mr. Justice Daniels admits that it is the hierarchy, but he thinks that the chosen judges of the church must proceed according to the principles of the common law; that they can only act upon evidence, (as applicable to church law;) that the accused is entitled to a hearing; and that if those \u201cfirst principles\u201d which govern in the ordinary administration of justice are ignored, the authorities of the church exceed-their jurisdiction when they decree that the holder of the receipt died out of communion with the church. With great respect and diffidence, I venture to differ with the conclusion. In my judgment, McGuire contracted for the exclusive jurisdiction of the church with regard to the question of communion. Spiritual questions are solely for the determination of the church authorities. Over their action in the domain of church \u2022discipline or excision the civil courts exercise no revisory power. <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>3 B. Mon. 253. There the court said: \u201cWe cannot decide who ought to be members of the church, nor whether the excommunicated have been ,justly or unjustly, regularly or irregularly, cut off from the body of the church. We must take the fact of expulsion as conclusive proof that the persons expelled are not now members of the repudiating church; for, whether right or wrong, the act of excommunication must, as to the fact of membership, be law to this court.\u201d The same doctrine was maintained by the supreme court of Pennsylvania in <em>German Reformed Church </em>v. <em>Seibert, </em>3 Pa. St. 291; and the additional suggestion was there made that under no circumstances would the civil courts interfere until the wronged party had exhausted his remedy within the church by appeal to its highest tribunal. This doctrine is peculiarly applicable to the present case, where it is conceded that an appeal to Rome lay from the decision of the ordinary of this diocese forbidding the burial of McGuire, and that no such appeal has been taken. The language of the Pennsylvania court is exceedingly apt, and I quote the most material part of it: \u201cIf, therefore, the relator is injured by the decree of the consistory, his remedy is by appeal to a higher ecclesiastical court, which no doubt (and it is indecorous to suppose otherwise) will afford him redress by reversing whatever may have been done by the inferior court inconsistent with the canons of the church. That the power of the classis and synod is advisory only matters not, as we cannot suppose their decision will be disregarded; and, if it should be, it will then be time enough to seek redress from the civil authorities. The decisions of ecclesiastical courts, like every other judicial tribunal, are final; as they are the best judges of what constitutes an offense against the word of God and the discipline of the church. Any other than those courts must be incompetent judges of matters of faith, discipline, and doctrine.\u201d To the same effect, in substance, are the decisions in <em>Dieffendorf v. Reformed Calvinist Church, </em>20 Johns. 12; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Bullions, </em>9 Barb. 64, affirmed, 11 N. Y. 243; <em>People </em>v. <em>German, etc.. Church, </em>53 N. Y. 103; and <em>Dwenger </em>v. <em>Geary, supra. </em>In the latter case the court said that \u201cno power \u2022save that of the church can rightfully declare who is a Catholic. The question is purely one of church government and discipline, and must be determined by the proper ecclesiastical authorities. \u201d And again: \u201c Under the discipline and doctrines of the church, as enforced by the functionaries invested with the power and duty of deciding questions of doctrine and discipline, \u25a0James Geary was not a Catholic, and this decision is final and conclusive.\u201d &gt;On the same principle, the decision that McGuire, although a Catholic, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>not die in communion with the church, was final and conclusive until reversed,\u2014reversed not by the civil courts, for they have no jurisdiction under a constitutional system which, happily, separates church and state, but by the highest authorities of the church itself. To attempt to exercise jurisdiction to such matters upon the plea of want of jurisdiction in the church authorities of first instance would be the entering wedge whereby the symmetry of our governmental system with regard to church and state might readily be destroyed. And, after all, what do we question, when lookihg into the ordinary\u2019s jurisdiction, but his procedure? Shall we go further, and decide that he has no jurisdiction, within his sphere, to decree that a Roman Catholic died out of communion with the church, because the testimony upon which he acted was unsupported by an oath? Must he also notify the next of kin, or the executor or administrator, of a proposed hearing, produce his witnesses in their presence, permit them to cross-examine, and then to produce their own witnesses? Is he without jurisdiction if he deny them counsel? And all this while the dead body is waiting his decision. Where does the right to question the jurisdiction begin, and where does it end?</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">It seems to me that the ordinary\u2019s jurisdiction in spiritual matters cannot be questioned by the civil courts at all. He may act upon the best light he can obtain, however informal the source; and we cannot review his judgment, however out of touch with common-law principles may have been his means of ascertainment. If the ordinary acts capriciously or arbitrarily, there is an appeal to Rome. If the appellant is there again defeated, it will be time enough to inquire whether he has or has not contracted for the possibility of such injustice; and whether, even then, the facts, and the laws applicable thereto, would warrant a court of equity in entering the spiritual domain to redress a mixed temporal and spiritual wrong. For we cannot overlook the fact which pervades this entire controversy that it is not the mere right to be buried in two feet by eight of ordinary earth which the plaintiff seeks to enforce, but plainly the right to be so buried in consecrated earth. It is thus the spiritual right which, in substance, he asks us to enforce; that is the agreement, so to speak, for consecration predicated upon communion. The rest is but a temporal incident. The world is all before this plaintiff to secure for his testator mere burial. The secular cemeteries, with their regular and binding deeds, were open to McGuire, and are yet open to his representative. But that is not what is required or desired. What the plaintiff insists upon is the burial of McGuire in the same consecrated earth where the body of his wife now rests. That, however, is something which the civil courts are powerless to compel, under such a contract or understanding as that which here forms the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s rights and of this action. The <em>Guibord Case, (Brown </em>v. <em>Cure of Montreal, </em>L. R. 6 P. C. 157,) from which the learned counsel for the appellant quotes so fully, has no conceivable applicability here. That case proceeded upon rules referable to a system in which church and state are blended. Under that system a British subject is entitled to burial in his parish church-yard without regard to contractual locality, and the question of his right to such burial is essentially for the civil courts, in the exercise of their <em>quasi </em>ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The privy council, in opening the discussion, declared that the question to be decided was \u201cthe right of Guibord to interment in the ordinary way in the cemetery of his parish. * * * It may be observed that the cure and marguilliers are only proprietors of the parochial cemetery in the sense in which a parson in England is the owner of the freehold of the church-yard; that is to say, subject to the right of the parishioner to be buried therein.\u201d In that case the church authorities offered to permit Guibord\u2019s burial in that part of the cemetery which was unconsecrated. But the court determined that he was entitled to be buried in the consecrated part, and even queried whether they might not command the church to so bury him with its ordinary and appropriate re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ligious rites and service. \u201c The payment of dimes to the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church,\u201d said the court, \u201cby its lay members, and the ratability of the latter to the maintenance of parochial cemeteries, are secured by law and statutes. These rights of the church must beget corresponding obligations, and it is obvious that this state of things may give rise to questions between the laity and clergy which can only be determined by the municipal courts.\u201d Even the observation made by Lord Piiillimore, that \u201cif this church were to be regarded merely as a private and voluntary religious society, resting only upon a consensual basis, courts of justice are still bound, when due complaint is made that a member of the society has been injured as to his rights in any matter of a mixed spiritual and temporal character, to inquire into the laws or rules of the tribunal or authority which has inflicted the alleged injury,\u201d must be taken as applicable to the parish church-yard system; that is, to the parish church-yard or cemetery of any private and voluntary religious society in the kingdom, resting only on a consensual basis. The general right of a British subject, a member of such society, to burial in its parish churchyard or cemetery, is thus held to be a matter for consideration and adjudication by the courts construing the laws or rules of such consensual society. Throughout the ease there is not a suggestion of contractual relation, nor of a right to burial in any particular plot. It was simply a judicial review, authorized by the law of England, of the action of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada; and thereupon the privy council examined the laws of the church, and held that its authorities had erred. We have no such system of jurisprudence here. In this, I must be permitted to say, we are fortunate, for, while human nature is what it is, there must always be more or less of religious faction, with its intensity of bitterness, in every theological establishment, however well disciplined and authoritative. And I can conceive of nothing more surely tending to weaken respect for judicial authority than the bringing of such factional controversies before the ordinary tribunals of our country, and making the people\u2019s judges final arbiters thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">In conclusion, I must say a word with regard to the present record. I have been somewhat embarrassed by the peculiar character of the findings made by the learned judge at special term. They seem to me to be inconsistent and contradictory in some important particulars, and they can only be reconciled by treating the eleventh, thirteenth, and fourteenth findings of fact as really conclusions of law erroneously deduced from the accurate findings of fact numbered second, third, and fourth. These latter findings are supported by the uncontradicted testimony, while the subsequent findings to which I have referred, as well as the first and second conclusions of law, are implications not borne out by such testimony. But as, upon the pleadings and proofs,\u2014 the latter undisputed,\u2014and the findings of fact really applicable to such proofs, the third legal conclusion (namely, that the complaint be dismissed) was fully justified, the judgment appealed should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b377-4\">Van Brunt, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdV\">I concur in the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Justice Barrett. I think that he has conclusively shown that whatever contract the facts proven establish, if any, is of so vague and indefinite a character that it cannot be specifically enforced by any court. I think that he has further shown that all that the deceased received was a license which was revocable. So grant or irrevocable right or easement was ever given him, and could not be, by the paper he received, without in effect repealing the provisions of the statute in respect to conveyances of interest in land. If it were possible to hold that there was a valid contract for burial only, and not for any interest in land, there seems to be another ground which is fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. There is no evidence but that, if the deceased\u2019s rights of property have been invaded, his estate can be entirely indemnified through an action at law for damages. If it is urged that damages cannot indemnify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>for the deprivation of burial in this consecrated ground, then the court is called upon to decree that a church shall administer to. one who claims to be of its communion its religious offices, and the court is called upon to determine whether the person is or is not in full communion with the church. I think that it will hardly be claimed that a court could rightfully direct a church to administer a sacrament to a person who claimed to be entitled thereto, but whom the church authorities had declared not so to be; and yet, in the case at bar, this is substantially what the court is called upon to do. It is asked to compel the burial of this man in a particular location, apparently because it is consecrated ground, because, if it is not burial in consecrated ground which is asked for, but simply burial, then sepulture in a non-denominational cemetery would attain the object, and damages would compensate for all invasion to property rights. Under our form of government, we do not think that courts can be called upon to compel churches to administer religious rights to persons claiming to be its members, or perform an act in any way impressed with that character. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b378-5\">Daniels, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AY8\"><em>(dissenting.) </em>The action has been brought to secure the interment of the remains of John McGuire, deceased, in Calvary Cemetery, Queens county, in the state of Hew York. The cemetery was acquired and controlled by the defendants under an act of the legislature conferring that power upon the trustees of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. The intestate died on the 19th of February, 1888, and an application was made for his interment in the cemetery, which was refused by the trustees, under the direction of the clerical authorities of the Catholic Church. In his life-time, the intestate, for the sum of money mentioned in it, received the following receipt and agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cNo. 726. Calvary Cemetery, Hew York, November 22, 1870.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201c266 Mulberry street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201cReceived from John McGuire ten dollars, being the amount of purchase money of a grave, two feet by eight, in Calvary Cemetery, with privilege to erect a head-stone thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\u201cD. Brennan, Supt. of Office of Calvary Cemetery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">\u201cGrave 9, plot F, section 8, range 56.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">And prior to his own decease the grave mentioned in the instrument was actually located, and the remains of his wife were interred therein. The grave, as it was located, was sufficient in capacity for the interment of more than two dead bodies; and the object of the action, as well as of the application to the authorities controlling the cemetery, was to secure the interment of the remains of the intestate in the same grave; and by the language of the instrument, and the location of the grave, his representative was entitled to insist upon that right, if the intestate had observed the laws and discipline of the church under whose authority the property was acquired and controlled. The instrument as it was issued, and under which the grave was located, created a privilege or license to this effect, without conveying a title to the land. <em>Kincaid\u2019s Appeal, </em>66 Pa. St. 411; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Symonds, </em>63 N. H. 17; <em>People </em>v. <em>Trustees, </em>21 Hun, 184. And the administrator was empowered to secure this interment if the intestate had complied with the laws of the church controlling the cemetery up to the time of his decease. 2 Bl. Comm. 508; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>L. R. 20 Ch. Div. 659. And that was the view which was adopted and followed in the decision made at the special term; for it was there held by the court that the plaintiff, as the personal representative of the deceased, was vested with whatever right existed to enforce the contract to be implied from or contained in this instrument. The action, accordingly,\" did not fail because of any infirmity in the right of the plaintiff, as the personal representative, to maintain it, if that could be done legally upon the facts made to appear by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Upon the trial of the action, accepted compilations of the laws of the church were proved and read\" in evidence, and these laws or regulations defined and declared the causes for which the interment of a deceased person might be forbidden in the consecrated cemetery and grounds of the church; and so far as they existed, and were applicable to this subject, they are required to be observed in the determination of the controversy which has arisen concerning the right of the deceased to burial in this cemetery. By these laws or regulations it was necessary that the deceased should have been during his life a member of the Catholic Church. If he were not such a member, then his personal representative could claim no right to the interment of his remains in these grounds. <em>Dwenger </em>v. Geary, 113 Ind. 106, 14 N. E. Rep. 903. But the right to the interment of these remains was not denied for want of any compliance on the part of the deceased with this regulation or requirement. Neither could it have been; for it was stated positively by the daughter of the deceased, who was sworn as a witness upon the trial of the action, that her father was a member of the Catholic Church in his life-time, and she was no further interrogated as to the correctness of this statement made by her. It appears tohave been accepted as truthful, and it was assumed during the progress of the trial that he was a member of this church. And the complaint, as it is contained in the case, asserts that to have been the fact; for no more was stricken out on the application of the plaintiff than the statement that he died in full communion with the church, leaving the complaint, as it now forms a part of the case, with the allegation that he did die in the faith of the Roman Catholic Church. And it was not for want of any additional evidence as to this fact that the interment of the remains in the cemetery was denied by the authorities of the church or by the trial court. But that denial appears to have proceeded upon the conclusion adopted by the court that it properly belonged, under the usages and discipline of the church, to the decision of the ordinary of the bishop of New York to determine whether .the deceased was entitled to be buried in this cemetery; and the ordinary having made a decision adversely to this right, upon evidence sufficient to give him jurisdiction to act, the remains were not entitled to burial in the consecrated ground of the cemetery.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">It is undoubtedly the law that the courts will not review conclusions or decisions of the ecclesiastical authorities of the church relating to mere matters of faith, practice, or discipline. <em>Dutch Church </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>8 Cow. 457; <em>People </em>v. <em>German, etc, Church, </em>53 N. Y. 103; <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>3 B. Mon. 253; and <em>German, etc.. Church </em>v. <em>Com., </em>3 Pa. St. 282, 291. But this exclusive authority vested in the church is not applicable to the disposition or determination of rights or interests in property, or those derived from contracts lawfully entered into. As much as that was stated in <em>Bouldin </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>15 Wall. 131. And it necessarily follows from the nature of the transactions through which rights or interests in property, by, virtue of contracts, may be created, that they are to be governed by the secular law, as they are distinguishable from ecclesiastical subjects, and may only be divested, impaired, or forfeited by reason of some act or circumstance upon which the right or contract has been made dependent, or for the violation of rules or regulations which by the sanction and intention of the parties have been made applicable thereto. Rights of this description are recognized and protected by the general law of the state, and that has carefully defined the manner in and the causes for which they may be lost or forfeited; and under that law, if the deceased, as a matter of fact, had violated or failed to observe any of the laws or regulations of the church applicable to and controlling this contract, then the plaintiff could not claim or insist upon his interment in this cemetery. But neither one of these rules or regulations vested the clerical authorities of the church with jurisdiction to determine this right of interment in such a manner as to conclude the party entitled to insist upon the observance of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>agreement. No hearing whatever has been provided for or took place before the vicar general, by whose order the interment of the remains in these grounds was forbidden; but he acted solely upon information which he had received from no directly responsible source, in reaching the conclusion that the deceased had forfeited his right to this burial. This was done, according to his own testimony, upon mere information,\u2014not a safe subject to be relied upon in any case for the determination of rights of property or contract,\u2014 and the determination was made without any notice to, consultation with, or hearing of any person entitled to represent the deceased, or to controvert the correctness of the information received by this clerical official; and under these circumstances the law will not permit a determination arrived at in this manner to forfeit the right which the deceased may have secured through this instrument to burial in the consecrated cemetery of the church. The legal principle, on the contrary, has been declared to be that \u201cthere is nothing which our law denounces more explicitly than an adjudication of the rights of a party without offering him an opportunity of being heard in his defense.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Soper, </em>7. N. Y. 428, 431, and <em>Loubat </em>v. <em>Le Roy, </em>40 Hun, 546, follows and enforces this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The determination which in fact was made in this manner proceeded upon information that the deceased had died at the Academy of Music at a meeting addressed by Dr. McGlynn, who had been excommunicated from membership in the Catholic Church, and that he was in reality a confederate and abettor of this deposed priest. The vicar general had been informed that McGlynn had abused and denounced the pope, and it was considered a scandal for any good Catholic to be present at his meetings. His own testimony is that he did not know the deceased, but that he had \u201cheard that he had been applauding Dr. McGlynn in abusing the pope a few minutes before his death.\u201d Upon his cross-examination he testified that it was a public fact that the deceased had died there. Thereupon the following questions were put to and answered by the witness: \u201c Answer. I was not there. I did not see him die. <em>Question. </em>You say it came up from the trustees. By what means? <em>A. </em>The undertaker called upon them. <em>Q. </em>How do you know? <em>A. </em>The clerk told me. <em>Q. </em>His name? <em>A. </em>Mr. Brennan. <em>Q. </em>Where did he tell you so? <em>A. </em>Oh, I can\u2019t remember the exact spot. <em>Q. </em>When did he tell you so? <em>A. </em>Either the day after his death or the following day. <em>Q. </em>What was said? <em>A. </em>Simply the fact that he died at the Academy of Music. <em>Q. </em>And on that you issued the order forbidding the burial? <em>A. </em>I did, sir.\u201d These reports, with the exception of that as to the fact of the deceased dying at the Academy of Music, were of a loose and unreliable character, and could not legally have been the subject of binding action by the vicar general. They were in no sense so authentic as to warrant or justify the conclusion that the deceased approved of the actions or expressions of McGlynn, or applauded any remarks or imputation made by him at the meeting, in this manner referred to, or at any other, and afforded no grounds of jurisdiction upon which he could legally or properly act in declaring the right of the deceased, under this contract, to have been forfeited by any misconduct on his part. The evidence was not of such a nature as to be acted upon, and therefore afforded no jurisdiction over the subject-matter; and the want of jurisdiction, or the power to act, may be questioned in the courts by legal proceedings whenever the legality of the action taken shall be brought in controversy. <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>70 N. Y. 253, 257; <em>Cagwin </em>v. <em>Town of Hancock, </em>84 N. Y. 532, 541; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Town of Andes, </em>93 N. Y. 405. And to afford jurisdiction by way of support for a <em>quasi </em>judicial determination, it must proceed upon at least colorable evidence of the fact. But here no such, or indeed any, evidence was supplied; and this, as well as the circumstances that the consideration given to the subject was wholly without notice or an opportunity to be heard by any person interested in protecting the right of the deceased against these aspersions, ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>dered the determination which was made inoperative for the want of authority over it. But beyond tin's, according to the laws and regulations of the church, which have been made a part of the evidence in the case, the deceased could not be deprived of the right to burial in this cemetery by a simple determination that it had been forfeited or lost by him; for the laws of the church have made this disability to depend entirely, where the deceased shall have been a member of the Catholic Church, upon some act, misconduct, or omission of the deceased. These laws and regulations have in no manner provided that the right to burial in the cemetery, -under an instrument of this description, can be taken away merely by the <em>dictum </em>or decision of a member of the church hierarchy; but the right to such burial by these laws has been declared to be lost or forfeited only by reason of actual misconduct on the part of the person in whose behalf it may in this manner be claimed. It is a penalty imposed for misconduct, either by means of affirmative acts, or delinquent omissions to act, on the part of the deceased. Among the causes for which burial in consecrated ground may be refused are the fact that the deceased died a public sinner, or that he failed to perform some affirmative duty forming a part of his obligations as a member of the church, or had committed some act of scandalous misconduct. The law of the church in these and other matters attaches the loss or forfeiture to the act itself, or to the delinquency of the party, and not to a mere <em>dictum </em>or determination of any member of the clerical authority of the church. And to bring this case within these laws it was necessary, therefore, that the deceased should be shown, as a matter of fact, by way of defense to the action, to have violated or become chargeable with some act of misconduct prohibited by them; thereby forfeiting, under their authority, his right to burial in the consecrated ground of the church. But no such proof in any form has been included in or made a part of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The evidence concerning the conduct of the deceased was obtained from witnesses either related to or knowing him well, and seeing him at meetings of the Anti-Poverty Society, and of the parishioners of the church of which McGlynn had previously been the pastor; but no witness testifies to the fact that he was present on any occasion when McGlynn addressed the people who. were assembled, or that he in any manner had applauded or approved of his conduct, or sentiments, or the principles which he endeavored to maintain; and upon the occasion when he was at the Academy of Music, the proof is positive, from at least two witnesses, whose evidence is not contradicted, that he died half an hour before the proceedings of the meeting had commenced, and before Dr. McGlynn made his appearance. All that was shown against him was that he was present at the meetings already referred to, but not when Dr. McGlynn was either officiating, or making any remarks or allusions whatsoever. There was no evidence that upon any occasion he had either misconducted himself, or neglected any of his duties or obligations as a member of the Boman Catholic Church. And that was the view which was adopted by the judge presiding at the trial; for by his fifteenth finding he found the facts to be \u201cthat the said John McGuire did not at any time after the said 22d day of November, 1870, violate any of the rules or regulations for the management of the said cemetery, and interments therein, theretofore made by the defendants, nor any laws of the Boman Catholic Church theretofore made respecting the burial of the bodies of its deceased members.\u201d And in this state of the evidence, as it cannot be affirmed that he had violated any rule or regulation of the Catholic faith, it follows that he did not forfeit his right to burial in this cemetery.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">If, upon a mere mistaken view of the facts produced by unfounded reports, which was all that was before the vicar general, this right of burial may be forfeited, then no security can certainly exist for the protection of any person acquiring and paying for this privilege of burial; for even the most correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>religious deportment may be sacrificed by the malignant and untruthful reports of persons misrepresenting the acts, conduct, or sentiments of deceased persons. Instead of the right being maintained, as the law requires it to be, as one of a proprietary character, it may then be overthrown or forfeited, after the decease of the party securing it, without any available means of avoiding the result. No Catholic, whatever his standing may be, will be entirely removed from this danger, if upon mere reports, turning out, as they have in this instance, to be untruthful and unfounded, he can be deprived of burial in the consecrated ground of his church by the action of one of its offir cials, induced by reliance upon these reports. The' only safety which exists is that already indicated in reliance upon and mairitaining the laws of the church itself, which require, not rumors or information, but that actual misconduct, or the omission to observe specific obligations, shall be proven to have taken place before a contract or instrument of the description of that, for a good consideration, delivered to the deceased, shall be forfeited or avoided. That proof is wholly wanting in this case, and the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the plaintiff to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
