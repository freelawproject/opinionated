It is here to be taken that the jury credited the testimony of the plaintiff in describing the effect upon her of the hurts she received, and of her friend, who was a witness, and of her physician. On considering this testimony, it cannot be held that the jury abused its power to assess the damages. The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
