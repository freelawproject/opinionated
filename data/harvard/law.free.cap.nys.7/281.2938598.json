That judgment-was entered upon his consent. His daughter, Mrs. Watson, had brought ejectment against the plaintiff\u2019s grantees, alleging that the will under which the plaintiff claimed title was void. She succeeded in that action at circuit,- and an appeal was taken to the general term. Pending that appeal this action was instituted to establish the will. Negotiations were had for the settlement of the daughter\u2019s claim. When the time for the settlement of the-daughter\u2019s claim arrived, the plaintiff refused to consummate the settlement unless the defendant Carr would consent to the entry of judgment against him in this action. Accordingly the daughter\u2019s husband obtained from defendant such consent, stating that the counsel were of opinion that he had no-interest in the property. He now seeks to avoid that consent on the ground that such advice was wrong. Assuming that the defendant had a right of curtesy in the property in case the will of the grandfather was void, the-opinion given by the counsel, though erroneous, was not necessarily dishonest or fraudulent. The daughter\u2019s ease had been once at the general term, on appeal from an adverse judgment, and she had finally recovered at the circuit-without the point that the father had his curtesy being raised,\u2014a point which, if well founded, would have been fatal to her action. That there was a possibility of such claim was apparent, for Carr was made a party to this action-to bar any such claim. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel made it a condition of the settlement that the defendant\u2019s claim, if any, should be barred by his consent to-the judgment. The nature and effect of the consent was understood by the defendant, and, though he was told he had no valid claim, he must have been aware that the only object of the consent was to cut off the possibility of a-claim. On this consent the plaintiff paid for the daughter\u2019s interest.\u00bb The-plaintiff and defendant dealt at arms-Iength. While there are intimations of collusion between the defendants\u2019 attorney and the plaintiff, there are no-facts shown to prove such averments, and they are explicitly denied by the parties charged. If such, however, be the fact, the defendant can avoid the judgment for fraud in a direct action brought for that purpose; but, in the absence of proof of fraud on the plaintiff\u2019s part, he should not be deprived of the benefits of his settlement; certainly not without an offer to restore to-him what he has paid on account of that settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">It is objected that, as the court of appeals has held that this' action will not lie,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the judgment was entered without jurisdiction, and is void. Such result-does not follow. But, if the judgment be void, defendants can assail it collaterally whenever it may be set up as a bar to his rights. It has been repeatedly held that a party is entitled to have a void judgment or order vacated, and not be remitted to his collateral attachment. This is true where the order or judgment complained of was made against his opposition, or without his authority; but that principle cannot apply where the party has consented to the entry of the judgment or order. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
