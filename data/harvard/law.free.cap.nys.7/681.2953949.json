Pr. 290. The foundation of the practice in the courts rests upon acts, and not upon mere intentions. The case, as it appeared upon the moving papers, was clearly referable, and consequently no error was committed in granting the order of reference. The amended answer, which was subsequently served, in no way lessened the necessity of a reference. The incorporation of a counter-claim rather increased the necessity. On the motion to vacate the order of reference, on the ground that the issues had been changed by an amendment to the answer, the burden of proof was on the defendants to establish that the answer, as amended, rendered a reference unnecessary. This they wholly failed to establish. The case presents only questions of practice, and not of jurisdiction, and upon all the facts we cannot say that the several judges who made the orders appealed from abused the discretion vested in them. The orders appealed from should be severally affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
