The sale of the various lots of ground in a \u201clump,\u201d instead of by parcels, the lack of notice to the creditors, and an apparent inadequacy of consideration, we think, were such grounds of suspicion that the plaintiff was justified in bringing his action; and we think he ought to be relieved from costs. Judgment appealed from modified by striking out the costs and allowances granted, and, as thus, modified, affirmed, without costs of appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
