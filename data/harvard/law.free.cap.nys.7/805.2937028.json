Wyckoff Van Siclen. While visiting a tenant of defendant, as plaintiff was descending a stairway, one of the stairs broke through under her feet, and she sustained serious injuries. It appeared that a month before the accident occurred the defendant remitted a portion of the rent as payment to the tenant for repairing the defect in the stairway which caused the injury. At the close of the evidence the court ordered plaintiff\u2019s complaint dismissed, and from a judgment entered in accordance therewith she appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b830-6\">Argued before Barnard, P.

The defect was a trifling one, and the two dollars would seem to be ample. It seems clear that, as between the tenant and those claiming under him, no action would thereafter lie against the landlord for injuries occasioned by that defect. The duty to repair seems to have been assumed by the tenant. The plaintiff was a visitor to the family of the tenant, and was injured while upon such visit. Upon this state of facts we are of opinion that the authorities in this state do not sustain the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages. It follows that the complaint was properly dismissed, and the judgment must be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
