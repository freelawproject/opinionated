Neither the order to show cause upon which the said motion for a new trial was made, nor any of the papers used on such motion, are presented to the court on this appeal; nor does it appear upon what ground the motion for a new trial was made, except by the recitals of the order, or upon what ground it was disposed of by the court. It is clear, therefore, that there is nothing before this court to show that the or- ' der appealed from was erroneous. By section 3251 of the Code it is provided '.that the costs awarded to a party to an action must be at the following rates: i To either party, upon a motion for a new trial upon a case, or an application for judgment upon a special verdict, the same sum as upon an appeal. The ' criterion to determine whether a partyis entitled to costs under this subdivision is whether the motion for a new trial is made upon a case, and the order of the court in this action recites that the motion made, and which was decided, was for a new trial upon a case. The respondent was therefore entitled to the costs allowed by the chief judge upon the record as it appears before us. The affidavit used on behalf of the defendant says that the motion for a new trial was not made at the term at which the case was tried, or before the time in which the defendant could take an appeal from the judgment had expired, and therefore, under section 1002 of the Code, could not be made upon a case. But' the motion was made by the defendant upon a case, and was decided by the court, and it is upon the motion as made that the costs are allowed. The case of <em>Forstman </em>v. <em>ScJiulting, </em>38 Hun, 485, does not apply, as it does not. appear that the motion discussed in that case was made upon a case, but it appears from the opinion of the presiding justice to have been made upon the ground of what the court there calls \u201cnewly-discovered law.\u201d On the record before us the respondent was entitled to the costs allowed by the resettlement of the order, and the order appealed from should be affirmed,-with costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
