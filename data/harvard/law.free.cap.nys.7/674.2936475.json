The appellant concedes that he has paid the costs and served his answer in compliance with the order. That ends this appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>By submitting to the terms of the order, the appellant waived his appeal. See <em>Grunberg </em>v. <em>Blumenlahl, </em>66 How. Pr. 62. The case of <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Nourse, </em>107 N. Y. 577, 14 N. E. Rep. 508, has no application. A judgment recovered must be paid, either voluntarily or by execution. In such a case a voluntary payment does not affect the appeal from the judgment. But here there was no compulsion upon the part of the appellant to pay. It was a favor granted him, with which he could comply, or decline to do so. Having availed himself of the favor extended, he cannot be heard upon appeal in opposition thereto. Besides, the discretion exercised was not abused. It is an elementary rule that an agreement of accord executory, to be performed at a future day, with a complete tender of performance, is no bar to an action, unless performance is accepted. 3 Bl. Comm. 15. In this case the notes given upon the supposed accord were never accepted, inasmuch as the former notes were not surrendered, nor any other act done showing an acceptance, and plaintiff was at no time deprived of his right to continue his actions. The appeal will therefore be dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
