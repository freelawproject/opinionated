Guyon and Walter S. Guyon for the recovery of a horse, and damages for detention, commenced before a justice of the peace. The return shows no requisition in the justice\u2019s court, or return thereof. The summons was personally served. On the return of the summons the plaintiffs made a formal written complaint by their attorney, setting forth, their ownership of the horse, the wrongful taking and detention thereof, its value, and .$100 damages, and asked for judgment for the delivery of the property, and for the recovery of the damages, with costs. Defendant appeared, and interposed an answer to the merits, and pleaded the want of a return to tile requisition by the constable, predicating thereon an objection tattle jurisdiction of the justice. Thereupon the justice tried the case on the merits, and entered a judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor for the delivery of the horse, and for $50 damages, with $3.15 costs. Defendant appealed to the-county court, and demanded a new trial. On the new trial before the county court, defendant moved to dismiss the action for the alleged want of jurisdiction, and the court granted his motion, and, without further proceedings, entered judgment reversing the justice\u2019s judgment, and dismissed the action* with $74.14 costs. From this judgment plaintiffs appeal. For former report, see 6 H. Y. Supp. 99.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b835-10\">Argued before Barnard, P.

We, however, expressed our views upon the merits of certain questions, vyhich must, if adhered to, determine this appeal. We see no reason to change the views expressed at that general term, which lead to a reversal, of the judgment, and sending the case back for trial in the county court upon the merits, under section 3068, Code Civil Proc., as stated in the opinion referred to. Judgment reversed, on opinion written at May term. All concur..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
