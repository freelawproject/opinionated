Y. 78. The plaintiff herein obtained leave to withdraw the cause of action on what is-called the \u201cfirst\u201d undertaking on appeal, and to continue it on what is denominated the \u201csecond.\u201d undertaking on appeal. Both causes of action were on contract; were given to secure the same judgment; and the parties thereto-were the same on each obligation. The court had power to grant the amendment; and, as the discretion was not abused, the order appealed from must be affirmed. As the terms imposed as a condition, $15, were light, the affirmance will be without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
