In 1885 the defendant, as an insolvent debtor, received from the county court of Westchester county an order discharging him from his debts, Subsequently executions issued to satisfy the judgments, and on motion of defendant\u2019s attorney an order was made and entered at the special term, June 8, 1889, canceling the judgments; whereupon plaintiff moved to vacate and set aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>\u2022order. July 20, 1889, an order was made denying the motion, from which \u2022order plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b832-3\">Argued before Barnard, P.

So far as appears, precisely such an order would have to be again entered in case it was set aside for the irregularity complained of. The plaintiff should have shown upon his motion to vacate the order that he had been prejudiced by the entry of the order without notice. Under all the circumstances, we think the order should stand. Order affirmed, but without costs. All concur</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
