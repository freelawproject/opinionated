Or the whole allegation respecting the bills of the <em>Boston </em>Bank might be rejected as surplusage ; and then the charge will stand sufficient as to the bills of the <em>Albany </em>Bank.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b93-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Au1\">We cannot reject as surplusage what may have been the ground of the conviction. A substantive charge, not sufficiently alleged in an indictment, can never be rejected as surplusage. Neither can we apply the allegation of falsity, &amp;c., concerning the <em>Albany </em>bills, to the bills of the <em>Boston </em>Bank. It is not easy to fix any meaning to the word <em>others; </em>but it would be going too great a length to say that it included the words <em>false, </em>forged, and <em>counterfeit. </em>If the allegation, that the defendant well knew the bills to be false, &amp;c., applies to the <em>Boston </em>bills, then no <em>scienter </em>is laid as to the <em>Albany </em>bills. It may be that the whole evidence at the trial applied exclusively to the <em>Boston </em>bills; and then we are called upon to reject as surplusage the only allegations upon which the conviction was had. The indictment is too loose and untechnical to be supported, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">\n<em>Judgment arrested.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b93-10\"><em> </em>1 Chitty, <em>Crim.
