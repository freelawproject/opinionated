Received of <em>William Jackson </em>the sum of twenty-one hundred and ninety-five dollars, which I promise to account with his daughter, <em>Margaret Jackson, </em>now in <em>Portland, </em>for. <em>James Weeks.\u201d </em>This paper was objected to by the defendants, on the ground that it did not support the promise set forth in the declaration; but the objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">The defendants then showed that the estate of their testator was insolvent, and that, at the date of the above promise, <em>viz., </em>March 15, 1808, he was a minor, not having arrived at full age until the middle of July, 1809.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\">The plaintiff read in evidence the last will and testament of the said <em>J.

This evidence was objected to by the defendants, but admitted by the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-10\">The testimony of <em>Harper </em>was, in substance, as follows: About the 4th of August, 1809, he informed <em>J. Weeks </em>that he had understood that he had received of <em>William Jackson </em>[ * 149 ] * about 2200 dollars, which he had agreed to deliver to his daughter <em>Margaret, </em>then the witness\u2019s wife; ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ing him if it was then convenient to him to pay it <em>Weeks </em>replied <em>that it was not convenient for him to pay it at that time, hut that he was then hading a vessel for </em>Jamaica, <em>where he intended to sell his cargo for cash, and proceed to the Bay of </em>Honduras, <em>and that, on his arrival there, he should, pay Mr. </em>Jackson <em>the money due him on account of the said sum so received as aforesaid. </em>The witness then requested him to pay to a Mr. <em>Martin </em>a bill, which was due him for the schooling of <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>children, out of the money of <em>Jackson </em>in his hands ; and he engaged to pay a part, if not the whole, of that Dill. Some time afterwards, and after <em>Weeks\u2019s </em>death, the defendant <em>Mayo </em>handed the witness the testator\u2019s account against <em>Jackson, </em>and desired him to allow it out of the money which the testator had received of <em>Jackson, </em>and for which a claim had been filed before the commissioners on the said <em>Weeks\u2019s </em>estate. In the account was a charge of 100 dollars, as having been paid by <em>Weeks </em>to <em>Martin; </em>but the witness had been afterwards informed that that sum was in fact paid by the testator\u2019s father, and by him charged in the testa tor\u2019s books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the foregoing facts, as reported by the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">The cause was argued, at the last May term in this county, by <em>Todd </em>for the plaintiff, and <em>Hopkins </em>for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-7\">\n<em>Hopkins.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4S\">To bind an infant to the payment of a debt contracted during his infancy, and for which he would not be liable without a new promise, there must be an express promise to pay.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWi\">The defendants are charged, as the executors of the last will of <em>James Weeks, </em>deceased, upon a promise by him in his lifetime, by his note in writing, March 15, 1808. The promise alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and proved by the note, is to this effect: that, in consideration of 2195 dollars paid by the plain tiff to <em>James Weeks, </em>he undertook .and promised to account with, and pay over to, <em>Margaret Jackson, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, said sum of money on his arrival at <em>Portland. </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The [ * 151 ] plaintiff * avers that <em>James W., </em>after the receipt of the money, did arrive at <em>Portland: </em>but that he never, in his lifetime, paid over the sum so intrusted to him to the said <em>Margaret, </em>the daughter, or accounted for it to the plaintiff; and that the executors had also neglected to pay over or account for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">At the trial of this action upon the general issue, the defendants proved that their testator, at the date of the promise, alleged an.d proved, although master of a vessel in the <em>West India </em>trade, was in his age somewhat short of twenty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">To this defence the plaintiff replies, first, a clause in the will of <em>James W., </em>expressing a bequest of his estate to his sisters and brothel s, after <em>his just debts </em>shall be paid therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">The Court has determined heretofore, <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> in a case arising under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>this same will, that this clause or bequest, if it may have that name, as it respects the debts, is no answer to a defence of infancy ; and that the disability of an infant to contract, unless in certain cases specially provided for with a view to his preservation and benefit, is such as renders his promise not only voidable, but void.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The plaintiff in this case insists, secondly, upon certain testimony adduced at the trial, the amount of which is, that <em>James W., </em>after he became of full age, having been called upon by the witness, then the husband of the plaintiff\u2019s daughter <em>Margaret, </em>and questioned of the money received of her father, and whether it was convenient to pay it over, <em>J. W. </em>answered that it was not convenient to pay it at that time, but that he was then preparing for a voyage to <em>Jamaica, </em>with a cargo which he should there sell for cash ; and expressed his intention to proceed from thence to <em>Honduras, </em>and, on his arrival there, to pay the plaintiff the money due him on account of the sum received for his daughter. Other circumstances are proved by this testimony, which establish very satis factorily, if the witness is credible, an acknowledgment, on the part of <em>J. W., </em>after he came of age, that *he [ * 152 ] had received of the plaintiff the sum of money expressed in the note to him, and in trust for his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">But there is no evidence of any express promise to the plaintiff himself, or of the renewal to him of the promise expressed in the note, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The most that can be made of the testimony is evidence of money in the hands of the deceased, intrusted with him, which he had not in his lifetime paid over or accounted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We have been, when this cause was argued, very explicit in expressing our sentiments of the defence resorted to in this case. The insolvency of <em>James W.\u2019s </em>estate is no apology; and, however inexorable his other creditors may be, we cannot conceive that the executors are under any necessity of continuing the embezzlement of this money, or defending this breach of trust, so reproachful to the memory of their testator, for the benefit of his other creditors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The defence being insisted on, however, we must decide according to the strict principles which apply in the case; and these are, we reluctantly say, against the plaintiff\u2019s action, in the particular form in which it is conceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">A general <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for money received for the use of the plaintiff might be maintained by the evidence adduced at the trial; but not this action on the original promise. There is no evidence of an express promise to the plaintiff, made by <em>J. W. </em>after he came of age; but there is enough proved to revive the debt, to establish the consideration upon which the law will imply a promise to the party injured. <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>, <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The defendants refuse to consent to any amendment of the declaration ; and this being a trial on a review, it is out of the power of the Court to afford any aid by ordering an amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">If the plaintiff has any redress against this scandalous fraud, it must be by another action commenced in a better form ; and which it is possible (though on this point we give no opinion) may be maintained, notwithstanding any restrictions on his legal remedy, either by the statute of limitations or the statutes' respecting insolvent estates, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">[ <em>* </em>153 ] * The witness relied oh for the plaintiff is, we think, competent; the objections suggested going only to his credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Upon the whole, the evidence reported in the case will not support the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. The verdict for him is therefore to be set aside, and a</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\n<em>New trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b144-14\"><em> </em>The promise alleged in the declaration was to account <em>on his arrival at Portland ; </em>but the promise m the note in writing was to <em>account </em>generally, without fixing any time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(5)\">\n<p id=\"b144-15\"> 9 <em>Mass.
