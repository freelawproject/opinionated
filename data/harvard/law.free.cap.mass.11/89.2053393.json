It appeared that the deputy took one <em>M. R. Bartlet </em>only as bail, and that he had avoided on the <em>scire facias, </em>as had <em>Kitteridge, </em>the prin cipal debtor, on the original suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-14\">After a verdict for the plaintiff, taken November term, 1812, before <em>Parker, </em>J., for the original debt, costs, &amp;e., the defendant moved for a new trial on the following grounds: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-15\">1. That the plaintiff gave in evidence an original writ, and a judgment thereon, in favor of <em>Dan Young </em>against <em>Thomas Kitteridge; </em>but the execution against <em>Kitteridge, </em>as well as the <em>scire facias </em>and judgment against the bail, were in favor of <em>Daniel Young.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-16\">2. That the plaintiff gave no evidence of the debt due to him from <em>Kitteridge, </em>other than the original writ and judgment against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-17\">3. That it did not appear that <em>Kitteridge </em>had any property or friends, who were able or willing to assist Jiim; but it appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>that he was a transient person, found for a short time in <em>Cambridge, </em>and none of the witnesses knew whence he came or whither he was gone. Wherefore the defendant said that the jury should have been instructed to allow the plaintiff nominal damages only, if any; whereas the judge directed the jury to allow the plaintiff the whole amount of his said supposed debt and interest, unless the defendant should prove, beyond all doubt, that <em>Kitteridge </em>was a vagabond, and worthless.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-5\"><em>Bigeloxo, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atv\">supported the objections made at the trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-6\"><em>Davis (Solicitor-General) </em>and <em>Heard </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b89-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ac1\">The first objection is, that the original writ and judgment are in favor of <em>Dan </em>Young, and that, in the * execution and in the proceedings against the bail, he is [ * 90 ] called <em>Daniel. </em>This was clearly a misprision of the clerk in issuing a judicial writ, and, being so, might be amended. Besides, it was not necessary for the plaintiff to show the proceedings against the bail, particularly where no evidence was offered on the part' of the defendant tending to show his sufficiency, and where especially, as in this case, one surety only had been accepted. His insufficiency might have been proved in any other way by competent evidence, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The second objection is, that the plaintiff should have been held to prove his original debt against <em>Kitteridge. </em>But we consider the writ and judgment sufficient <em>prima, facie </em>evidence of the debt,\u25a0 although the sheriff might have impeached it upon the ground of collusion and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">More doubt has been raised in our minds by the last objection. But here, again, the benefit of the judgment, to the whole amount of it, is to be presumed lost by the negligence of the officer. The defendant might have repelled this presumption, and reduced the damages. But the evidence for this purpose must be suggested and produced on his part. It is not sufficient for him to say, negatively, that it did not appear that the principal had property; more than this was necessary to raise a presumption for him that the judgment was of no value. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b89-11\"><em>\u0430) Campbell </em>vs. Styles, 9 <em>Mass.
