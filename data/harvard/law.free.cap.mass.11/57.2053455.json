In a second count a similar injury is charged, except only that the plaintiff alleges that the defendant\u2019s horse and chaise were under the care, government, and direction, of a certain servant of the defendant, and that the defend ant, by his said servant, so carelessly, negligently, and improperly, drove his said horse, that, by and through the mere carelessness, negligence, and improper conduct, of the defendant, by his said servant in that behalf, his chaise struck with great force the plaintiff\u2019s chaise, &amp;c., as in the first count, <em>et alla enormia, </em>&amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\">After a general verdict for the plaintiff upon both counts in the declaration, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment, on the ground that the action should have been trespass, and not case; and that causes of action are joined, which in their nature cannot be joined.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-8\">\n<em>Rockwood,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahi\">in support of the motion, said he should principally insist on the first point, which resting in authorities only, he cited the case of <em>Reynolds </em>vs. <em>Clarke; </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> where the distinction is said to be, when the immediate act itself occasions a prejudice, or is an injury to the plaintiff\u2019s person, house, land, &amp;c. The action should-; be trespass <em>vi et armis; </em>and where the act itself is not an injury, but a consequence from that act is prejudicial to the plaintiff\u2019s person, house, land, &amp;c., * the proper remedy is by [ * 58 ] an action on the case. The case of <em>Day </em>vs. <em>Edwards </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> was like the first count of the declaration in the case at bar, and judgment was arrested for that cause. In <em>Savignac </em>vs. <em>Roome, </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>which was case, stating that the defendant\u2019s servant drove his coach and horses against the plaintiff\u2019s chaise, as in the second count of the declaration in the present case, the judgment was arrested, because the action should have been trespass; and there is no difference whether the act be wilful or merely negligent; <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> or whether it be done by the defendant or his servant. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pA2O\"><em>Sullivan, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aok\">The distinctions in the books on this point are very nice, but it is not necessary to discuss them. In <em>M\u2019Manus </em>vs. <em>Crickett, </em><footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> which was a case much discussed, and deliberately considered by the court, it was decided that a master was not answerable in trespass for an injury done by a servant, whether done wilfully or negligently. In <em>Morley </em>vs. <em>Gailsford, </em><footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> it was ruled that case, and not trespass, was the proper remedy for an injury done to the plaintiff\u2019s carriage, by the defendant\u2019s servant negligently driving his carriage against it. And in <em>Rogers </em>vs. Im<em>bleton, </em><footnotemark>(8)</footnotemark> it was holden, upon demurrer to the declaration, that case was the proper action where the defendant, with force and violence, through negligence, inattention, and want of proper care, drove his cart against the plaintiff\u2019s horse. The same point, in effect, was decided in <em>Huggett </em>vs. <em>Montgomery. </em><footnotemark>(9)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">These authorities prove both the counts in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration good. But if the Court should incline against us on the firsl count, we move for leave to amend the verdict, so as to apply it to the second count only, as the evidence was wholly to that count. <footnotemark>(10)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-7\">This last fact appearing from the notes of <em>Parker, </em>J., before whom the cause was tried, the verdict was amended accordingly.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ADG\">\n<em>Rockwood</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AECf\">still insisted that both the counts were bad, and that neither would support a judgment. In <em>M\u2019Manus </em>vs. [ *59 ] * <em>Crickett, </em>the only point decided was, that no action lay against a master for a wilful injury done by 'his servant without the master\u2019s order. In <em>Rogers </em>vs. <em>Imbleton, </em>nothing was decided, but the demurrer was voluntarily withdrawn. In <em>Huggett </em>vs. <em>Montgomery, </em>the decision was only that, where a pilot of a ship, the owner being on board, negligently runs against another ship, the remedy against the owner is by action of the case; and the court expressly save the case of <em>Leame </em>vs. <em>Bray.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\"> 2 Lord <em>Raym. </em>1402.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"AGb\"> 5 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>648.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"AFo\"> 6 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>125</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(4)\">\n<p id=\"b60-9\"> 3 <em>East, </em>593, <em>Leame </em>vs. <em>Bray.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(5)\">\n<p id=\"b60-10\"> 1 <em>Mass.

The second count, being for an injury done by the defendant\u2019s servant, stands on different ground. The injury here arose, so far as the defendant was concerned, from his employing a careless or a mischievous servant; and it was in its nature merely consequential.
