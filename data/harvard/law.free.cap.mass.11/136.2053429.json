Smith </em>passed the note as true to the said <em>Bradbury, </em>in the purchase of a waistcoat pattern, for which he allowed three dollars, and received\" of <em>Bradbury </em>three dollars in change, which he returned to <em>Hill. </em>It appeared that the boy was innocent, and ignorant that the note was counterfeit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-15\">A verdict was taken that the said <em>Hill </em>was guilty, subject, to tliu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>opinion of the Court on the question whether the foregoing evidence proved a passing of the bill to <em>Bradbury, </em>as charged in the indictment, no- question being made by the defendant\u2019s counsel as to the <em>scienter.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">The indictment was continued to the last May term for argument upon the judges\u2019 report, when it was argued by <em>Morton (Attorney-General) </em>for the commonwealth, and <em>Holmes </em>for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>Holmes.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3rH\">There is no evidence that <em>Hill </em>ever passed the note at all. The delivery of a note to be passed is not passing it, more than delivering money to be paid to a creditor is payment. The fact charged in the indictment is made a misdemeanor by statute. But the evidence does not bring the case within the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-7\">Nor did the defendant deliver the note to <em>Smith </em>as true. The whole transaction negatives such a supposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-8\">But, at any rate, he did not pass the note, nor direct it to be passed, to <em>Bradbury, </em>as charged in the indictment. If he were to be indicted for passing it to <em>Smith, </em>neither an ac- [ * 137 ] qui.ttal * nor a conviction on this indictment would be a bar to such prosecution. An averment that the of-fences were the same would be directly against the record.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b130-9\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ARb\">took time in the vacation to consider the question, and being agreed that the evidence was sufficient, the defendant was sentenced by <em>Thatcher, </em>J., at the last term at <em>Alfred, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\"> <em>Com Dig., </em>Abatement, E, 4. \u2014 1 Lord <em>Raym. </em>282. \u2014 <em>Foster's Crown </em>Law, disc. 3, c. 1. \u2014 1 <em>Hale's Hist.
