The plaintiff in an action may be sufficient to answer for the costs at the commencement of his action, but by misfortunes or other causes may become poor It is unreasonable that an endorser should be held beyond a certain period, in which he may have a chance for his remedy over.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-8\">In the case of <em>Ruggles &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Ives, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> the defendant pleaded two pleas to a <em>scire facias </em>like this, one of which was precisely the plea now before the Court; and there the chief justice, after de livering the opinion of the Court, directs judgment to be entered that both the pleas in bar were good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-9\">But if the plea is insufficient, so is the declaration, in that it does not allege the commitment of <em>Alden </em>to be by an officer .of the county; and this is a substantial defect, and good on general de murrer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-10\"><em>Miller </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b373-14\"> 6 <em>Mass.

The defect suggested is in form only, not in substance. Let judgment be enterei. that the plea in bar is bad and insufficient. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"Acq\"> <em>Stat. </em>1784, c. 10, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"ABl\"> <em>Stat. </em>1784, c. 28, \u00a7 10</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b373-15\"><em> Ruggles </em>vs. <em>Ives, </em>6 <em>Mass.
