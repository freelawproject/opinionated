The writ was, however, well served by leaving a copy with the clerk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>corporation, so that r\u00edo inconvenience could follow from the amendment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-5\">\n<em>Bliss, e contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFk\">contended that there was nothing in the case by which to amend the writ. The amendment made * an entirely new action. Here was nothing to show [ * 339 ] even an intention, on the part of the plaintiff, to sue the corporation, whom he wishes, in this late stage of the action, to make defendants. Much greater strictness is requisite, in this view, respecting corporations than individual persons, since they can be described or known only by their corporate names.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b308-12\"> <em>Stat. </em>1791, c. 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b308-14\"> <em>Stat. </em>1796, c. 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AJj\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aus\">The first corporation was dead, and the new one was created for the same purpose and object. The writ was served on the clerk of the existing corporation, by which regular notice was given the real proprietors of the bridge. This is, then, the common case of a <em>misnomer. </em>The amendment may be made, on the common rule of an election by the defendants of the costs of the action to this time, or a continuance, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\"><em> Burnham </em>vs. <em>Savings Bank, </em>5 N. <em>H.
