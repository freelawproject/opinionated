That the action was not rightly brought in the county of <em>Somerset, </em>upon which they moved that the action should be dismissed; 2. That the orders declared on were drawn by a committee appointed by the Court of Common Pleas, in June, 1811, and the powers of that court, [ * 222 ] touching the subject of * roads having been transferred to the Court of Sessions, before the said orders were drawn, the said committee had no authority to draw the same.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-9\"><em>Bond, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHR\">insisted that it was against the common principles of equity that a party should be a judge in his own cause; and to this he cited the express decision of this Court in the similar case of <em>Hawkes </em>vs. <em>The Inhabitants of the County of Kennebeck. </em><footnotemark><em>(1)</em></footnotemark>, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-13\"><em>Boutell </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-10\">He also argued that the Court, which authorized the committee to draw the orders on which the action was brought, having ceased to exist, the powers of the committee had ceased also ; as, upon the death of an individual, the authority of his agent ceases.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b206-14\"> 7 <em>Mass.

One court succeeds another, and takes, by statute, all the powers and authorities of its predecessor. The decision in <em>Hawkes\u2019s </em>case was grounded upon the test of the writ; although the <em>reasoning </em>of the chief justice, in delivering the opinion of the Court, supports the objection made by the defendants\u2019 counsel, grounded upon that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict. </em>\n<footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"AIT\"> Vide <em>Stat. </em>1809, c. 127.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
