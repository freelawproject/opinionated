J. Court, May term, 1808, at <em>Portland, </em>one <em>Richard Manning </em>recovered judgment against the goods and effects of the said deceased in the hands of the said <em>Mary, </em>for the sum of 107 dollars 93 cents debt or damage, and 20 dol\u00edais 81 cents costs; and sued out his execution thereon, and delivered the same to <em>Stephen Swett, </em>then a deputy sheriff for said county, on the 1st of October, 1809, to be duly executed; and the said <em>Swett, </em>on the 16th of the same October, made his return on the said execution, that, pursuant thereto, he had made diligent search for the goods and chattels of the said <em>Edward Anderson, </em>deceased, in the hands of the said <em>Mary Anderson, </em>[*191 ] * administratrix as aforesaid, and elsewhere, and that he had not been able to find any of the said goods and chattels, the said <em>Mary </em>having wasted the same ; and the plaintiff on the same day demanded of the said <em>Mary </em>the sums aforesaid, and she refused and neglected to pay the same, and to show goods or estate of said deceased, for the purpose of paying and satisfying the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-10\">The defendants (protesting that the said\" <em>Manning </em>did not recover judgment, &amp;c., nor sue out his execution, &amp;c. ; that <em>Swett </em>was not a deputy sheriff, and did not make return, &amp;c., and that the plaintiff did not demand, &amp;c.) rejoin that the said <em>Mary </em>has, in the due course of administration, fully administered and accounted for all the goods and chattels, rights and credits, which were of the said <em>Edward </em>at the time of his death, which have ever come to the hands of the said <em>Mary </em>to be administered; and that she has not, n &gt;r had on the day of the purchase of the plaintiff\u2019s writ, nor at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>any time since, any goods, &amp;c., which were of the said <em>Edward </em>at the time of his decease, in her hands to be administered. A nd they further aver that the real estate, of which the said <em>Edward </em>died seised, is sufficient to pay all the debts which the said <em>Edward </em>owed at the time of his decease, which real estate remains for the purpose of paying said debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">To this rejoinder the plaintiff demurs generally, and the defendants join in demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-6\">The cause was argued, at the last May term in this county, by <em>Whitman </em>for the plaintiff, and by <em>Mellen </em>and <em>Longfellow </em>for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-7\">\n<em>Whitman</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aav\">relied on the statute of 1783, c. 32, \u00a7 8, providing that if any administrator shall neglect or unreasonably delay to raise money out of the intestate\u2019s estate, by selling the real estate, (if need be, and he can obtain license to sell the same,) and by such delay shall subject the intestate\u2019s estate to be taken in execution, the same shall be deemed waste and unfaithful administration in such administrator; also the statute of 1786, c. 55, \u00a7 2, providing for *an action upon the administration bond, [ * 192 ] for the benefit of a creditor, who has had his debt or damages ascertained by judgment of court, and has made a fruitless demand on the administrator; all which prerequisites are alleged in the replication in this case. The administratrix has then been guilty of waste, and the case is clearly within the condition of the bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-8\"><em>Mellen </em>and <em>Longfellow, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqy\">insisted that the administration bond had no relation to the real estate of the intestate When she obtains a license to sell the real estate, the Court requires a new bond, with sureties for her fidelity in the sale, and for her accounting for the proceeds. It has been decided by this Court that an administrator is not bound by his bond to inventory real estate. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> In the case cited, the <em>Chief Justice, </em>said, \u201cThe administrator, as such, has nothing to do with the real estate; he cannot even enter upon it, or in any manner intermeddle with it, except where there is an insufficiency of the personal estate to pay the debts of the deceased: when that happens, he has a right, upon being duly licensed, to sell and convey real estate by deed.\u201d If the sureties on the administration bond are not liable for the pro ceeds of land, when sold by license, it would be strange, indeed, if they were liable to the same amount, because the administrator neglects to obtain a license to sell it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-9\">The action having been continued for advisement to this term,</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b179-10\"> 1 <em>Mass, Rep. </em>48, <em>Henshaw </em>vs. <em>Blood &amp; Al.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AZb\">now observed that, the plaintiff having admitted, by his demurrer, that the personal, effects of the intestate have been fully administered, the only question remaining in the action is, whether the defendants have subjected themselves to a forfeiture of their bond, by the neglect of the administratrix to make application for a license to sell the real estate of her intestate for the payment of his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We should have preferred to have met this question on a hearing in equity. We recollect a case that was before us [*193] * on such a hearing, after the forfeiture of the penalty had been adjudged. The estate in that case was insolvent ; and the administrators had paid more money than the whole personal property left by the deceased amounted to ; and it was determined that the sureties were not liable, upon the administration bond, for the proceeds of the real property, which had been sold by the administrators, under a license obtained for that purpose, and without giving a new bond to account for the proceeds of such sale. In the case at bar, we think the bond cannot be extended to cover the neglect of the administratrix to procure a license for the sale of the real estate; and we shall give judgment for the defendants upon the demurrer, unless the plaintiff, believing that he has merits, and that, on a trial, he can show an improper use or waste, by the administratrix, of assets that have come to her hands, should move to withdraw his demurrer, and go to the jury with the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The plaintiff thereupon moved for leave to withdraw his demurrer, and plead to issue; which the Court, after consideration, refused. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\n<em>Rejoinder adjudged good.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b180-10\"><em> </em>Vide <em>Newcomb, Judge, </em>&amp;c., vs. <em>Wing, </em>3 <em>Pick. </em>168.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
