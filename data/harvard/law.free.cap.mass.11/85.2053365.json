This notice must be on the day of the <em>maturity </em>of the note. In the case of <em>Henry </em>vs. <em>Jones, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> the Court say that no action lies against the endorser, until after a demand made <em>on the day of the maturity </em>of the note; and the plaintiff there was nonsuit, because the demand was made on the day preceding the day fixed by the parties for the payment. The same doctrine is distinctly recognized in the case of <em>Jones </em>vs. <em>Fales, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> and in other cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-10\">The note in the case at bar fell due on the 12th of May. Parol testimony is not admissible to vary the effect of a written contract from what is to be collected from the writing itself. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> To admit paroi evidence to prove that a written instrument does not contain the real agreement, would be the same as receiving it for every pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>pose. It was to shut out this inquiry that the rule was adopted. The notice given on the 11th of May was, then, equivalent to no notice at all; and the defendant was entitled to notice on the 12th, as a condition precedent, on which alone his liability in law could arise.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-5\">Did the defendant agree to dispense with this condition, which, being for his benefit, he might waive ? he agreed to <em>receive </em>notice at a certain <em>place; </em>which utterly excludes the supposition of a waiver of notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-6\">To remedy the defect of notice in this case, evidence was admitted of a practice of the <em>Union Bank, </em>of so computing a sixty day note as to demand payment on the fifty-ninth day, and to give notice accordingly; and the notice in this case being pursuant to that usage, and the practice being brought home to the knowledge of the defendant, the jury were directed to find for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-7\">The cases of <em>Jones </em>vs. <em>Fales, </em>and <em>Lincoln, </em>&amp;c., <em>Bank vs. Page, </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> were relied on to support the direction. But those cases go no further than to decide that a party may, by his own agreement, waive or modify his right to notice, and what is proper evidence of such agreement. The construction of the contract was not in question ; nor was paroi evidence admitted to contradict that [ * 87 ] which was written. * In the former case, the <em>Chief Justice </em>says evidence of this kind is not to establish new law, but to prove that the defendant has waived a condition implied by law for his benefit. In the case at. bar, it is not pretended that the defendant waived his right to notice, or agreed to receive it before the note was due, <em>which is the same thing.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-8\">The bank do not pretend a practice of notifying an endorser before a note is due. They notified on the fifty-ninth day because the note was considered then due. Here, then, is a simple question of construction. Did this note fall due in fifty-nine or in sixty days ? The evidence of usage was, in fact, admitted in support of the former construction, in contradiction to the plain letter of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-9\">The case of <em>Wentworth </em>vs. <em>Clap </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> is </em>precisely in point. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>was one of the last <em>nisi prius </em>decisions of the late Chief Justice <em>Parsons, </em>whose opinions will always be heard w'th respect in this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-5\"><em>G. Sullivan, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahg\">The evidence admitted in this case was not to control or vary the written contract. It related merely to the time when a demand should be made and notice given, not to the time when the note should fall * due. [ * 88 ] It is not contended that this note became payable on the 11th of May; but that notice given to the endorser on that day was sufficient to hold him; because the endorser had agreed, at the time of the contract, that it should then be given. Had this agreement been in writing, it could not be pretended that it was repugnant to the contract, or in any degree affected its tenor, or altered the time of payment. If, being in writing, such an agreement might be received in evidence, its being merely paroi would not exclude it. Such an agreement was understood between the parties ; and the evidence was therefore rightly admitted. How far it was sufficient to prove such understanding was a matter of fact for the jury, and their verdict is conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-6\">It does not appear that the question was at all agitated in the <em>nisi prius </em>case cited for the defendant; nor that the distinction which has been now suggested was taken.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b85-11\"> 8 <em>Mass.

J., at the sittings in <em>Boston, </em>after March term, 1813.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">The note declared on was as follows: \u201c26th June, 1810.\u2014For value received, I promise <em>Wm. Clap </em>to pay him, or his order, at the <em>Union Bank, </em>two thousand seven hundred dollars <em>in </em>fifty-seven days, and grace. <em>Alex. Wentworth.\u201d </em>\u2014 Endorsed <em>W. Clap </em>and <em>Joseph Clap.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">The plaintiff produced the note, and the notifying officer of the <em>Union Bank, </em>where the note was discounted, to prove a demand on the maker, and notice to the endorsers. It turned out in evidence that the officer made the usual demand on the make! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>on the 21st, and left the usual notices with the endorsers on the 24th of August; the notice for the defendant, who lived in <em>Dorchester, </em>being left at a place .pointed out by his direction in writing at the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Upon this evidence, the chief justice would not permit the .note to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The plaintiff then offered evidence to prove that the notices in this case were according to the established usage of that and the other banks in <em>Boston </em>at that time ; that the defendant had endorsed many notes at that bank, and was well acquainted with this usage before the making of the note in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">This evidence was also rejected by the chief justice, who ordered a nonsuit upon the authority of <em>Henry </em>vs. <em>Jones, </em>saying that no usage could be given in evidence to control the construction of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\"><em>Selfridge </em>for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\"><em>Rockwood </em>for the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b87-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AVD\">Heretofore it was the usage of the banks to include the day of the date of a promissory note in their computation. Since the decision of the Court, in the case of <em>Henry </em>vs. <em>Jones, </em>they have excluded it. The transactions in the case at bar were before that decision. The direction of the judge at the trial is objected to. There can be no doubt that it was competent for the endorser to waive his right to due notice, and to consent to receive notice at an earlier day. We have in several instances recognized the usages of banks, at which the parties haVe been accustomed to transact business, not as forming rules for our decision, but as evidence of the assent of the parties to such usages, and of their waiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ing their legal claims. On this ground the direction of the judge was given, and we have no doubt of its correctness. The defendant is chargeable, demand having been made and notice given, on the day which, by the assent and agreement of the parties to the note, is to be considered the proper one. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\"><em> Smith </em>vs. <em>Whiting, </em>12 <em>Mass.
