The defendant also admitted that his name had been signed in blank upon the back of said note.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-8\"><em>William Bird, </em>sworn for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avs\">testified that, after a bar gain between the plaintiff and <em>Benjamin Bird </em>for the sale and pur chase of an estate, which the plaintiff had conveyed to <em>Benjamin-Bird, </em>the witness and the defendant were applied to by the plain tiff, who said he had a note, which he wanted one of them to en darse. The witness refused, and the defendant observed that it was not a negotiable note, and said that he would not endorse it \u2022 but finally said he would write his name, to make the plaintiff easy, but would not be accountable for a farthing upon the note; and that this application was after the estate had been sold, and the business settled.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-9\"><em>John Eaton, </em>sworn for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD9\">testified that the note in question, and another note, originated in the sale and purchase of an estate which the plaintiff conveyed to <em>B. Bird, </em>the witness having negotiated the bargain between them; that in the bargain <em>B. Bird </em>agreed to pay a part of the purchase money in cash, and to secure the residue by notes, with a sufficient en-[*437] dorser, or by a mortgage upon the estate; *and proposed to give one of his brothers, <em>Alraham </em>or <em>William, </em>as an endorser or security on the notes; that the part payable in money being received, and notes made for the balance, signed by <em>B. Bird, </em>a deed was given to him by the plaintiff; and one or two days afterwards the endorsement of the defendant was produced, or came to the knowledge of the witness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-10\">The judge directed the jury that, if they believed that the plaintiff conveyed his land to <em>B. Bird, </em>upon the expectation of security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>by the name or endorsement of <em>Abraham </em>or <em>William Bird, </em>as guarantor of <em>B. Bird\u2019s </em>notes, and had obtained the defendant\u2019s endorsement upon the note in question in consequence of that agreement, they might find for the plaintiff; and that the endorsement in blank by the defendant was of the same effect as a signature upon the face of the note under the name of <em>B. Bird </em>would be; in which case the defendant would be considered as a surety for <em>B. Bird </em>in the same promise; unless the endorsement had been explained by the evidence, and proved to have been made with some different intent and purpose; and it was incumbent on the defendant to prove some different meaning or intent of his signature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-5\">The counsel for the defendant objecting to this direction, the jury having returned a verdict for the plaintiff, the judge reserved the case for the consideration of the whole Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-6\">The cause was argued, at the last October term, by <em>Harrington </em>for the plaintiff, and by <em>Hastings </em>and <em>Worthington </em>for the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-7\">\n<em>Worthington</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABS\">contended that this was a collateral undertaking for the debt of another. The transaction between the plaintiff and <em>B. Bird </em>was completed several days before the defendant put his name upon the note ; and at the time of doing it he declared that he meant not to be answerable in any event, which is wholly incompatible with a promise to pay the money. This being a promise to pay the debt of another, if it was any promise at all, and not being in * writing, was void by the statute of [ * 438 ] frauds. Nor was there any evidence of a consideration, without which a collateral promise is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-8\">The case of <em>Ulen </em>vs. <em>Kittredge </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> was different from this. There the endorser gave special authority and directions as to filling up the blank endorsement. Here the defendant may well be understood as forbidding any thing to be written which should make him liable.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUU\">[After reciting the facts from the report.] A verdict having been returned for the plaintiff, a motion is made for a new trial, upon the ground that the direction given at the trial was not right in point of law; and this motion has been urged upon the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">It is insisted, by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that, as the bargain for the land had been completed, and the deed delivered, before the note was presented to the defendant for his signature, his undertaking was merely collateral, and not binding, for want of a consideration, and for want of a memorandum in writing, according to the provisions of the statute of frauds and perjuries; or that, if the defendant be liable at all, it must be only as guarantor of the payment by the promisor; in which case evidence of such being the intent of his signature ought to have been given by the plaintiff, to maintain his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">[ * 439 ] * But we are of opinion that the direction given by the judge, upon the facts proved in the case, was right, and that the verdict is fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">It was in evidence that the endorsement or security of the defendant, or that of his brother <em>William,, </em>was one of the grounds of the bargain between the plaintiff and <em>Benjamin Bird. </em>The plaintiff parted with his land without taking a mortgage, upon the faith of receiving a note so secured. Although no evidence exists of an agreement, on the part of the defendant, to endorse, before the bargain was made, yet the plaintiff had a right to presume, when the names of the purchaser\u2019s brothers were mentioned to him, that there had been an arrangement between the brothers for that purpose. The signature by the defendant, a day or two after the note was made, of itself furnishes evidence that there had been a previous agreement or encouragement on his part to aid his brother in the purchase by lending his name; and his declaration, at the time of his signature, that he gave his name to make the plaintiff easy, but that he would not be accountable, carries with it a strong implication that he was under a moral obligation to comply with some stipulation previously made, and which probably formed an inducement to the plaintiff to transfer his land. If it was a fact that his signature was in consequence of the purchase made by his brother, upon representations made that he would sign the note, although his signing was not until after the delivery of the deed, his act ought to be referred to the date of the transactions; and he must be presumed, when he signed in blank, to have assented to such a reference; so that he would be considered, in law as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>justice,, as having placed his name on the note at the time it bears date, if that be necessary to give effect to his engagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The jury having, by their verdict, established the fact that the defendant\u2019s signature was in consequence of the bargain for the land, and of the expectation that his name would be placed upon the note, it becomes merely a question, as to the form of the action, whether the plaintiff has * brought his action [ * 440 j right, in charging the defendant with having made and signed this promissory note, or whether he should have declared against him as guarantor, after having written over his name words tending to charge him in that particular form.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">It is manifest that the defendant intended to make himself liable in some form; at least such is the intent legally to be presumed, even against his declaration at the time of signing. Had the note been made payable to him, and negotiable in its form, the plaintiff would have been restricted to such an engagement written over the signature as would conform to the nature of the instrument. In such case, the defendant would have been held as endorser, and in no other form ; for such must be presumed to have been the intent of the parties to the instrument. But this note was not made payable to the defendant, and therefore was not negotiable by his endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">What, then, was the effect of his signature ? It was to make him absolutely liable to pay the contents of the note. If he had been asked, <em>after the note became due, </em>to guaranty its payment, and such had been the understanding when he gave his name, it might have been necessary to declare against him as guarantor, instead of charging, him as original promisor; but no such agreement is proved He puts his name upon a note, payable to another in consequence of a purchase made by his brother, in a day or two after the bargain was made, knowing that he could not be considered in the light of a common endorser, and that he was entitled to none of the privileges of that character. He leaves it to the holder of the note to write any thing over his name which might be considered not to be inconsistent with the nature of the transaction. The holder chooses to consider him as a surety, binding himself originally with the principal; and we think he has a right so to do. If he was a surety, then he may be sued as original promisor. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">We are satisfied that the verdict is right, and judgment must be rendered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict, </em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>(a)</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\"> 5 <em>Mass.
