The demanded premises had been attached on the original writ in the same action, before the conveyance by <em>Storer </em>to the plaintiffs. The Court at which the said judgment was recovered adjourned without day on the 30th of May, 1812, being the fifth day of its session at that term; and the judgment was entered in said action on the said 30th of May.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-9\">The parties agree that the Court shall enter such judgment as shall be conformable to law upon the foregoing statement, upon nonsuit or default.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-10\"><em>Whitman, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agz\">The question in this case is, whether the day on which the judgment was rendered is to be taken as part of the thirty days during which an attachment binds the estate attached. The general rule of law is, that, when computation is to be made <em>from </em>an act done, the day in which the act is done must be included, with the exception of bills of exchange. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> This is the rule of law in computing a widow\u2019s quarantine. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-11\"><em>Longfellow, </em>for the demandants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al8\">All the <em>English </em>authorities will be found to apply to criminal cases only, and to actions of trespass; the calculation being so made to excuse from a penalty.

By our practice, the last day of a term is considered the day on which all judgments are rendered, unless it appears otherwise from the record. Executions are not by law to issue until twenty-four hours after judgment is entered up. The whole of the last day of a term is therefore necessarily excluded, in computing the thirty days during which property <em>* </em>attached on the original [ * 206 ] writ is holden to respond the judgment. The day after the adjournment is the first of the thirty days, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\n<em>Plaintiffs nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><em> Alderman </em>vs. <em>Phelps, </em>15 <em>Mass.
