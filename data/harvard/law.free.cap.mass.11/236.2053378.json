that <em>Nathaniel Perley, </em>Esq., commenced and prosecuted said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>suit, as attorney to the plaintiff; that, on the 16th of January, 1811, an execution was issued on said judgment, which <em>Perley </em>retained in his hands at <em>Jewell\u2019s </em>request, and, on the 21st of March, 1811, <em>Jewell </em>paid to Perley, as the creditor\u2019s attorney, 100 dollars, for which <em>Perley </em>gave his receipt; that, on the 9th of July, 1811, the said execution was returned in no part satisfied, the said receipt still remaining in <em>Jewell\u2019s </em>possession; and on the 17th of the same July an <em>alias </em>execution was issued, and on the 1st of October following was also returned unsatisfied ; that, on the 29th of April, 1811, [ * 237 ] the plaintiff * drew an order upon said <em>Perley </em>for the sum recovered by the plaintiff in damages against <em>Jewell, </em>which order was paid on the 2d of May following; that <em>Perley, </em>as the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, paid and engaged to pay the witnesses used in said suit against <em>Jewell; </em>that, on the 21st of October, 1811, <em>Perley </em>sued out a <em>pluries </em>execution on said judgment, which he delivered to <em>Henry Snow, </em>a deputy of the present defendant, with direction to levy and pay over the amount due thereon to him, the said <em>Perley, </em>after allowing and deducting the said sum of 100 dollars; that, upon <em>Snow\u2019s </em>applying to <em>Jewell </em>with the execution, <em>Jewell </em>produced <em>Perley\u2019s </em>receipt, and also an execution in favor of himself against the. plaintiff, <em>Baker, </em>on .which was due the sum of 66 dollars 49 cents; which receipt and execution <em>Snow </em>carried to <em>Perley, </em>by whom he was informed that he had long before paid <em>Baker the sum </em>recovered by him in damages, and that the balance due on his execution was due to him, <em>Perley, </em>as the attorney in the suit; and he was directed by <em>Perley </em>not to set off the executions against each other, and was promised an indemnity if he collected the balance due on the execution against <em>Jewell; </em>that <em>Perley </em>then endorsed the said 100 dollars on the said execution, and delivered the same to <em>Snow, </em>with directions to collect and pay over to him the balance due thereon ; that <em>Snow </em>afterwards delivered over both the executions to one <em>John Smith, </em>another deputy of the defendant, who discharged the plaintiff\u2019s execution by endorsing the amount remaining due thereon upon <em>Jewell\u2019s </em>execution against the plaintiff; and that no evidence exists that <em>Snow </em>communicated to <em>Smith </em>the said directions of <em>Perley.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">If the Court, upon these facts, should be of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, the defendant agreed that judgment should be rendered against him on his default; otherwise the plaintiff agreed to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-6\"><em>Wilde, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF_\">relied on the proviso in the \u201c act to direct officers in the levy of executions,\u201d <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> which recognizes and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tects the lien which an attorney has upon judgments and executions for his fees and disbursements, *and in effect [ * 238 ] prohibits the officer from setting off one execution against another, where such lien exists.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-5\">Warren, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhS\">The money paid by Mr. <em>Perley </em>to the witnesses lyas paid after judgment was recovered; and he had in that case no more lien upon the execution than a stranger would have had who had paid it for the client, nor than if <em>Perley </em>had paid the same money for <em>Baker </em>on any other account. But <em>Perley </em>had received of <em>Jewell </em>100 dollars, and it was his own folly to pay over the damages, without retaining enough to indemnify himself.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-6\"><em>Wilde, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atm\">Whether the witnesses were paid before or after judgment, can make no difference. If <em>Perley </em>caused them to be summoned, he was liable to them for their legal allowance. A1 though he had satisfied the creditor the damages, there was still sufficient due on the execution to reimburse him his fees and disbursements, if the officer had obeyed his directions as he was by law bound to do; for his misconduct in this respect, the defendant is answerable in this action.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b219-16\"><em> Harrington </em>vs. <em>Ward, </em>9 <em>Mass.

Mr. <em>Perley </em>then had a lien on the plaintiff\u2019s judgment- against <em>Jewell, </em>for his fees and the necessary disbursements made by him in the course of the suit. Did his receiving money of the judgment debtor, and paying the same over to the creditor, take the case out of the statute, and discharge his lien ? I think not. If he had any lien upon the judgment, it was upon the whole sum recovered. His directions to <em>Snow, </em>the defendant\u2019s deputy, were binding upon him. In setting off the executions against each other, it appears that <em>Smith, </em>the other deputy, acted ignorantly. But it was <em>Snow\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>duty to inform him of the directions he had received; and for his negligence in this respect I think he is chargeable, and that judgment ought to be rendered for the plaintiff in this action, [ * 239 ] upon that count in his declaration * which charges the defendant for this misconduct of his deputy, <em>Snow.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b222-5\">Parker, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACL\">of the same opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b222-6\">Thatcher, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A82\">agreed that the statute had given to an attorney a lien, on the judgment and execution recovered by him, for his fees and\" disbursements in the suit. But this lien, being against common right, ought to receive a strict construction, and not to be extended beyond the necessity of the case. When Mr. <em>Perley </em>had received of the judgment debtor a sum equal to the lien, the remainder due on the execution was discharged therefrom. He could not say he did not receive that sum on account of his fees, &amp;c. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b222-7\">Sewall, C.
