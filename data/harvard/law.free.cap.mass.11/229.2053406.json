The said deposition was taken, <em>in perpetuara rel memoriam, </em>on the 15th of June, 1811, before two justices of the peace for the county of <em>Suffolk, quorum unus, </em>and recorded in the registry of deeds for the county of <em>Kennebeck </em>on the 18th of October, 1811, at the taking of * which, the said <em>Baldwin </em>was present, [ * 230 ] and objected to the taking thereof, because he had only three hours\u2019 notice of such taking.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-8\">In the said deposition, the said <em>Backus </em>testified that he sailed from <em>Tobago </em>in said brig on the 10th of March, 1811, and arrived at <em>Boston </em>on the 7th of April following, being Sunday morning, and came to anchor near the <em>Long </em>Wharf about 7 o\u2019clock, A. M. After-wards the boarding officer of the government took the manifest, carried it to the custom-house, and made a regular report, as usual. During the forenoon of the same Sunday, the defendant came to the witness\u2019s house, in <em>Boston, </em>when the witness asked him where he should haul the vessel; he said, to the south side of <em>India </em>Wharf, near his counting-room; and the witness thought he said that the vessel would probably be seized by the government, and, whether that was so or not, it would be a convenient place to unload the vessel. The next morning the vessel was accordingly hauled thither, and the same morning the witness and the defendant went to the custom-house, and offered to enter the vessel in the customary form; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>but the deputy collector said the vessel must be seized, and the sur veyor inquired of the witness where the vessel lay, and was informed. The witness then went away, and, returning in half an hour, was told by the officers of government that the vessel was seized, and he was then permitted to enter the vessel. On Wednesday, the vessel was begun to be unloaded at the same place, a custom-house officer having been on board from the time of the seizure. The witness could not tell to whom the cargo was delivered, whether to the defendant, or to the officers of government. No one ever receipted his bills of lading. During the landing of the cargo, there was an officer on the wharf by the goods landed, and another on board the vessel. In answer to a question put to him by the defendant, the witness said that, at the first conversation at the house of the witness, the defendant told him that, whoever had the cargo, it must be discharged; and, if it was to be given up to him, he should prefer to have it landed opposite his store, [ * 281 ] at <em>India </em>Wharf; * and that he supposed that would be as convenient a place, if the government retained it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-5\">On the part of the defendant, it was proved that <em>Samuel Dowe </em>was supercargo of the vessel, employed by the defendant; that he had no knowledge of the non-intercourse law until his arrival in <em>Boston; </em>that he contracted for the return cargo, to be delivered on or before the 20th of January, 1811; but, owing to the lateness of the crop, it could not be obtained until March, when it was put on board; and, being seized on the 9th of April, was on the same day libelled as forfeited in virtue of an act of Congress, entitled \u201c An Act to interdict all commercial intercourse between the <em>United States </em>and <em>Great Britain </em>and <em>France, </em>and their dependencies, and for other purposes; \u201d whereupon a warrant was issued, and the cargo was taken possession of by the marshal, who continued to hold the same until the 13th of April, when it was delivered to the defendant, by order of the district judge, the defendant having given bond for the appraised value of the same; that the libel was still pending, at the time of the trial, in the Court of the <em>United States; </em>and the defendant\u2019s said bond remained in full force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">The defendant, besides objecting to the admission of <em>Backus\u2019s </em>deposition, contended that the cargo had never been delivered according to the covenant and agreement in the charter-party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-7\">The judge, besides admitting the said deposition, instructed the jury that, upon the whole evidence, the plaintiffs had maintained their action, and the jury returned a verdict accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-8\">To this admission and opinion of the judge, the defendant filed exceptions, and the cause was argued upon the exceptions at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>last June term in this county, by <em>Wilde </em>for the plaintiffs, and by <em>Mellen </em>and <em>Williams </em>for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-5\">\n<em>For the defendant,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJq\">it was insisted that the deposition, not having been recorded within ninety days, as required by the statute, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> was not to be received in evidence. As the *use [ * 238 ] of depositions in our Courts of law is wholly by virtue of a statute provision, they must be brought within that provision, or they cannot be used. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> Putting <em>Backus\u2019s </em>deposition out of the case, the plaintiffs have wholly failed of proving a delivery; and having averred a delivery to the defendant, they must be holden to prove it as alleged. The defendant was entitled by his contract to a delivery, without any condition or restriction. A delivery obtained by giving his own bond to the value of the cargo was, as to the rights of the plaintiffs in this action, as no delivery at all. And such as it was, it was made by the <em>United States, </em>and not by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-6\"><em>Wilde, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0L\">The statute is merely directory, in requiring depositions <em>in perpet\u00faan </em>to be recorded within a certain time. Its whole object is, that parties concerned in interest should have notice. This purpose, and more, was fully answered in the case at bar, as the defendant was notified and present at the caption. The same liberality is to be applied in this case as in the registry of deeds, and extents of executions on real estate. But if the deposition is put out of the case, there is other sufficient evidence, from the defendant\u2019s own witness, that the cargo was delivered to him, as soon as he relieved it from a detention wholly induced by his own breach of the laws of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-7\">The cause stood over to this term for advisement, and now</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\"> <em>Stat. </em>1797, o. 35, \u00a7 8</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b215-11\"> 5 <em>Mass. </em>Rep. 219, <em>Amory </em>vs. <em>Fellowes.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b215-8\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ap8\">observed that, if the defence was to avail the defendant, it must be on the ground that the covenant, as it is expressed in the charter-party, was to pay 2100 dollars in full for the freight in thirty days after the return cargo should be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">If there was evidence of a readiness, on the part of the plaintiffs, to deliver the cargo to the defendant, and the actual delivery and discharge of it had been prevented by the neglect of the defendant to receive it, or if the delivery was intercepted by an attachment or seizure for a default of the defendant, the plaintiffs would be as well entitled * upon this evidence, as they [ * 233 ] would be upon proving an actual discharge and delivery of the cargo. Whether this was proved, or not, by the testimony of <em>Tfowe, </em>the supercargo, is a question which we cannot decide; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>and it was not left to the jury upon that evidence. Perhaps other evidence may be adduced of the fact, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The objection insisted on against the testimony of <em>Backus,t </em>although hardly consistent with any pretensions of mercantile honor, we think must be yielded to. The statute provisions respecting depositions taken <em>in perpetuara </em>were not punctually observed ; and the deposition admitted at the trial, not having been recorded within the term prescribed, was not in that authentic form which the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The exceptions therefore prevail; the verdict is to be set aside, and a new trial is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\"><em> </em>A covenantor will be discharged from the obligation of his covenants, if the party for whose benefit they are made performs an act whereby the covenantor is incapacitated to observe his contract. \u2014 <em>Co.
