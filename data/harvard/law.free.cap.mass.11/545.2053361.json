On the 16th of April, her outward cargo was unladen and completely discharged, on which day the master commenced loading with brandy for a return cargo, and on the 18th of May had laden on board 400 pipes of brandy. The ship was detained from this time to'the middle of September, waiting for a license from the emperor to depart with her cargo. The license being then obtained, and the lading completed, the ship was ready to sail on the last [ * 546 ] day of * September; but was detained by adverse winds and tides until the 5th of November, when she sailed from <em>Bayonne, </em>bound to <em>Boston. </em>In attempting to go to sea, she struck the bar, which obliged the master to take out part of her cargo, and to return to <em>Bayonne </em>to repair, where she was detained, partly by unfavorable winds and tides, and partly in making repairs, until the 12th of February, 1813, when she sailed for <em>Boston, </em>and on the 26th of March following was captured by a <em>British </em>vessel of war, and sent to <em>Halifax, </em>where she was afterwards condemned, with her whole cargo, as lawful prize, and thereby the ship, freight, and cargo, were wholly lost to the owners thereof. One month\u2019s advance wages were paid to the plaintiff before the ship sailed from <em>Boston, </em>and sixty-five dollars more were paid him in <em>France </em>on-account of the wages due on the said voyage. The plaintiff\u2019s said apprentice continued on board, and performed his duty as a seaman during the voyage, and until the ship was captured as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">If, in the opinion of the Court, the plaintiff was entitled to recover upon these facts, it was agreed that judgment should be rendered in his favor for such sum as should appear to the Court to be due to him; otherwise, that the defendant should have judgment for his costs.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">The cause was argued at the last March term in <em>Suffolk, </em>by <em>French </em>for the plaintiff and <em>Prescott </em>for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-7\">\n<em>French</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Als\">contended that the plaintiff was entitled to recover wages to the time of the capture; or, if not, to the time of the ship\u2019s leaving <em>Bayonne; </em>or, at the least, to the time that the outward cargo was discharged, and also for one half the time between that period and the time of the ship\u2019s sailing from <em>Boston. </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-8\">\n<em>Prescott</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGj3\">insisted that wages were commensurate with freight; and in this case, the outward freight only being earned, the plaintiff\u2019s claim legally extended only to the time of the discharge of the</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AES\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>outward cargo in <em>France. </em>For so much and no more, the case acknowledges satisfaction. All * the time and [ * 547 ] labor, after the outward cargo was delivered, form a charge on the homeward voyage. The rule which has been sometimes assumed, of allowing half the time spent in the foreign port, when the homeward voyage has been lost, has been adopted for convenience, upon the supposition that half the time is probably spent in discharging the outward cargo, and half in lading the return cargo on board. But in this case, all the time, except the few days employed in unlading the cargo, was consumed in procuring the homeward cargo, or lost by contrary winds or other accidents, from neither of which does a claim for wages arise. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\"> 1 <em>Peters\u2019s Adm.

The ship-owner contends that, as the outward voyage only was performed, he ought to be holden to pay only the wages for navigating the ship outwards, and for unlading her outward cargo. On the other hand, the seaman may, perhaps * with equal justice, allege [ * 548 ] that, as the homeward voyage only was lost, he ought to lose only the wages for the time employed in lading the homeward cargo, and for navigating the ship so far as she proceeded on her homeward voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">If a ship, on her outward voyage, is seized and carried into any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>port out of the course of her voyage, and is afterwards restored to the master, and arrives safely at her port of delivery, the seaman receives his wages for the whole time of such detention, although the ship be lost on the return voyage. On the other hand, if a ship is detained in like manner on her homeward voyage, and is after-wards lost, the seaman loses his wages for the time of such detention, as well as for all the other time consumed on the homeward voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">But in a case like the present, it is difficult to say whether the detention lengthened the outward or the homeward voyage. It would introduce endless perplexity and litigation, if we were in every case to inquire into the causes or motives which influenced the foreign government in ordering the detention, to enable us to decide whether it is attributable most to one or to the other part of the voyage. Suppose a vessel detained in a foreign port by an embargo imposed from political motives, without any reference to the particular ship, or the commerce in which she is engaged. There would be nothing in the nature or cause of the detention, to show to which part of the voyage it should be attributed. In truth, it would apply as well to one part as to the other; and it does not seem to affect materially the merits of the question, whether the embargo were imposed before the ship had discharged her outward cargo, or after she had begun to receive on board her return cargo. It is a detention at the port of delivery, between the outward and homeward voyage, and not constituting exclusively a part of either. If, therefore, we were at liberty, without reference to authority, to decide according to equity and good conscience, or to adopt a [ * 549 ] rule that would be most convenient * in practice, we could not, perhaps, devise one better than that heretofore established.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">It appears, from the facts agreed in this case, that the ship arrived at her port of delivery on the 28th of March, 1812, and proceeded on the homeward voyage, with her return cargo, on the 12th of February, 1813. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to the wages of his apprentice to the 4th of September, 1812, which will include half the time of the ship\u2019s stay at the port of delivery, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\"><em> Locke </em>vs. Swan, 13 <em>Mass.
