Those issues arose out of the following pleas: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\"><em>First, </em>plea to the first count. <em>\u201c </em>And now the said <em>Lyman </em>comes and defends, &amp;c., when, &amp;c., and as to the first count in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, prays oyer of the agreement in writing declared on, and it is read to him in these words, <em>viz.: </em>\u2018 Memorandum of an agreement made and concluded on the 8th day of June, one thousand eight hundred * and seven, by and between [ * <em>77 </em>] Messrs. <em>James 8f Thomas H. Perkins </em>on one part, and <em>Theodore Lyman, </em>of <em>Boston </em>aforesaid, merchant, on the other, <em>viz.: </em>The said <em>James 8f Thomas H. Perkins </em>agree to buy of said <em>Theodore Lyman </em>a certain ship now lying in the harbor of <em>Boston, </em>called the <em>Vancouver, </em>and to pay therefor, at the end of one year from the date, eight thousand dollars; and whereas the said <em>James &amp;f Thomas H. Perkins </em>have this day executed a promissory note of hand, payable to said <em>Lyman </em>in one year, for the sum of eight thousand dollars ; now, in consideration of receiving said note, the aforesaid <em>Theodore Lyman </em>covenants and agrees with the said <em>James 8f Thomas H. Perkins, </em>that, provided they well and truly pay, or cause to be paid, the aforesaid sum of eight thousand dollars at the period it may fall due, that he will not, in his own name or iii the name of any other person for him, directly or indirectly, be interested in any voyage to the north-west coast of <em>America, </em>or in any adventure to that coast, or any species of traffic with the natives of that country, for the term of seven years, to be reckoned from this day ; and he, the said <em>Theodore Lyman, </em>doth bind himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, in the penal sum of eight thousand dollars, for his faithfully adhering to this contract. <em>Provided, </em>and it is fully understood by the parties, that it is not in any way to affect the trade of. any vessels the said <em>Lyman </em>may now have on that coast, or on their way there.\u2019 Which being read and heard, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>said <em>Lyman </em>saith that the said <em>James fy Thomas H. Perkins </em>their action aforesaid ought not to have and maintain against him, the said <em>Lyman; </em>because, by protesting that he did not load or fit out the said ship called the <em>Hamilton </em>in the said count mentioned for a voyage to the north-west coast of <em>America, </em>and that he was not directly or ind rectly concerned in the loading or fitting out of the same; he for plea saith that, at the time of the departure of the said vessel and cargo for the said north-west coast of <em>America, </em>or at any time after, during the said voyage in the [ * 78 ] * plaintiff\u2019s said first count of their declaration described, he was not the owner, in whole or in part, of the said ship called the <em>Hamilton, </em>and the cargo on board the same; and therefore he puts himself on the country.\u201d \u201c And the plaintiffs likewise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8G\"><em>Second </em>plea to the first count. \u201c And for a further plea in this behalf, as to the said supposed breach of covenant above in the said first count in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration assigned, the said <em>Lyman, </em>by leave of the Court here for this purpose had and obtained, saith that the said <em>James fy Thomas H. Perkins </em>their action aforesaid thereof against him ought not to have or maintain, because he saith that the said ship called the <em>Hamilton, </em>in the plaintiff\u2019s said first count of their declaration mentioned, and the cargo on board the same, or either of them, were not at any time after the making and executing of the agreement in the plaintiff\u2019s said first count of their declaration mentioned, and before the bringing of the said action, engaged or employed by him, or by any other person in his, the said <em>Lyman\u2019s, </em>behalf, or for his account or profit, in trade or traffic with the natives of the north-west coast of <em>America; </em>and thereof he puts himself on the country.\u201d \u201c And the plaintiffs likewise.\u201d The jury returned verdicts upon each of the issues thus joined in favor of the plaintiffs, and also upon similar issues joined on like pleas to the second count, which charged the defendant with owning and fitting the brig <em>Lydia. \u25a0</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\">At this term the plaintiffs moved the Court for judgment on the verdicts, for the sum of 8000 dollars, the sum demanded in their writ, together with the further sum of 2360 dollars, being the amount of interest for additional damages, the interest being computed from the day of the last breach of covenant alleged in the declaration to this time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">The defendant prayed a hearing in chancery, pursuant to the statute of 1785, c. 22, \u00a7 1, for giving remedies in equity. [ * 79 ] * <em>Otis </em>and <em>Bigelow, </em>for the defendant, contended that</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\">the sum of 8000 dollars, mentioned as the penal sum in the agreement, was a penalty or forfeiture, and not to be taken as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>liquidated damages, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and therefore came expressly within the provision of the statute referred to, which makes it expressly the duty of the Court to make up judgment for the plaintiff, to recover so much as is due in equity and good conscience. And if the Court should be of opinion that this sum, instead of being a penalty or forfeiture, was in nature of liquidated damages, still it is believed the Court has an equitable jurisdiction to reduce them. It was on this ground that the late chief justice, at the trial of the issues, refused to permit evidence to be given to the jury as to the quantum of damages, his opinion being that the consideration thereof belonged exclusively to the Court. What goes strongly to support the motion is, that the penal sum was to protect the plaintiffs for seven years from the date of the agreement; and as the term has not yet expired, the judgment is to stand as security for further breaches, pursuant to statute of 1798, c. 76, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 6.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">In the opinion of the Court, given upon the demurrers joined in this action, it is said, \u201c The fact of the plaintiffs afterwards purchasing a part of the vessel fitted by the defendant, may properly be considered by the jury, when estimating the plaintiffs\u2019 damages.\u201d It is very plain that the Court considered that the damages were yet to be ascertained; and as this was not permitted to be done by the jury, it must remain for the Court upon a hearing in equity. If the defendant has the opportunity, it is in his power to satisfy the Court, or any other forum, that the plaintiffs are entitled to no more than .nominal damages.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-6\"><em>The Solicitor-General (Davis) </em>and Sullivan, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap\">insisted that they were entitled to the sum agreed by the parties as liquidated damages. The action was <em>debt </em>for this sum, and the plaintiffs have shown their action well founded. This is a stronger case than that of <em>Lowe </em>vs. <em>Peers, </em><footnotemark><em>(2)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which was covenant not to do a certain act, and * if he did do it, to pay \u00a3 1000. [ * 80 ] In such an action the plaintiff may recover more or less, but in debt for the penalty he is entitled to that or nothing. In <em>Orr </em>vs. <em>Churchill, </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> which was an action of debt for a penalty, Lord <em>Loughborough </em>says, \u201c In such cases the parties may foresee the consequences of a breach of the engagement, and stipulate accordingly.\u201d So the parties to this action have stipulated, foreseeing that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, either for the court, or a jury, to ascertain the actual damages in a case of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>sort. It would not have entered their minds that such could ever be the result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-5\">In the case of <em>Fletcher </em>vs. <em>Dyche, </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> where the agreement was to perform certain work in a limited time, or to pay a stipulated weekly sum for such time afterwards as it should remain unfinished, <em>Ashurst, </em>J., says, \u201c These sums are in the nature of liquidated damages, and are such a kind of penalty, if they may be called by that name, as a court of equity would not relieve against.\u201d \u201cThe object of the parties, in naming the weekly sum, was to prevent any altercation with respect to the quantum of damages, &amp;c. It would have been difficult for the jury to have ascertained them, and therefore it was proper for the contracting parties to ascertain them by their agreement; so that this is a case of stipulated damages, and is not to be considered as a penalty.\u201d <em>Buller, </em>J., (quoting Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in the case of <em>Lowe </em>vs. <em>Peers,) </em>says, \u201c Where the precise sum is fixed and agreed upon between the parties, that very sum is the ascertained damage, and the jury are confined to it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\">In <em>Astley </em>vs. <em>Weldon, </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> Lord <em>Eldon </em>says that what is matter of contract bottomed on good consideration, should not be looked upon as a penalty, but should be considered as liquidated damages. <em>Heath, </em>J., after observing that it is very difficult to lay down any general principle on the subject, states this is a safe one: \u201c Where articles contain covenants for the performance of several things, and then one large sum is stated at the end to be paid upon breach of performance, that must be considered as a penalty.. [ * 81 ] *But where it is agreed that, if a party do such a particular thing, such a sum shall be paid by him, there the sum stated may be treated as liquidated damages.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-7\">The case of <em>Peirce </em>vs. <em>Fuller </em><footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> is extremely similar to the case at bar, and there the penalty was considered as the damages liquidated by the parties. \u201cThe parties,\u201d say the court, \u201cwere competent in law to make a contract, imposing a limited restraint on the defendant\u2019s trade for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit, and without injury to the public. They were competent to determine on what consideration it should be made, and to liquidate the damages if it should be broken.\u201d \u201c The defendant, by honestly fulfilling his agreement, might have protected himself from the forfeiture.\u201d \u201cAnd when the plaintiff has suffered by the breach of it, he shall not be relieved from the terms, to which he had voluntarily submitted.\u201d</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> 3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>630, <em>Smith vs. Dickenson. </em>\u2014 1 <em>Br.

But one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>point seems to be settled. The question whether a sum of money mentioned in an agreement shall be considered as a penalty, and so subject to the chancery powers of this Court, or as damages liquidated by the parties, is always a question of construction, on which, as in other cases where a question of the meaning of the parties in a contract provable by a written instrument arises, the Court may take some aid to themselves from circumstances extraneous to the writing. In order to determine upon the words used, there may be an inquiry into the subject matter of the contract, the situation of the parties, the usages to which they may be understood to refer, as well as other facts and circumstances of their conduct; although their words are to be taken as proved by the writing exclusively.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Perhaps there is nothing extraneous to the contract brought under our consideration in this suit, which can have much bearing or influence upon the inquiry into its meaning as to the particular question now in controversy. The occasion *of [ * 82 ] it is recited in the instrument; the purpose of it is very explicitly stated. But these would be consistently answered and secured, as well by an agreement of liquidated damages, as by a penalty, to be used as one remedy for the recovery of the actual damages sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">If the sum of 8000 dollars, mentioned in the agreement, is to be treated as liquidated damages, then for one instance in which the contract should be broken, and for a thousand in which the defendant should interfere in the trade contemplated by the parties to be secured to the plaintiffs for seven years, exclusively of him and of all acting under him, the same damages, the same amount of demand, would be recovered; and having been once paid, if demanded as a penalty, there would be an end of the contract; but if demanded as damages, then, it seems, the demand might be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Examined in this view, we see nothing which gives this contract any other determinate meaning than that of a penalty. If there is nothing to prevent the plaintiffs, in case the defendant should have injured\" them, in breach of his contract, to a greater amount than 8000 dollars, from recovering upon his covenant, and in that form of action, the extent of the damage actually sustained, although greatly exceeding the sum mentioned, it would be a severe construction indeed, which should consider him liable to that amount upon one breach, however slight the injury and loss may have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">If we look to the words themselves, there is a covenant, on the part of the defendant, that he will not, in his own name, &amp;c., directly or indirectly, be interested in any voyage to the north-west <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>coast of <em>America, </em>&amp;c., for the term of seven years. Then he binds himself in the penal sum of 8000 dollars for his faithfully and strictly adhering to. this contract. It is not said, if he docs so, contrary to his agreement, then he will pay that sum as a satisfaction. Nor is there any thing expressed, which would conclude the plaintiffs, unless it be their form of action, when the amount of damages should exceed 8000 dollars, from demanding to the extent of their loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">[ * 83 ] * Lord <em>Mansfield </em>expresses the distinction of liquidated damages, and a penalty to secure the performance of a contract, very closely and accurately, in the case of <em>Lowe </em>vs. <em>Peers, </em>referred to in the argument of the case at bar. <em>There is a difference, </em>says his lordship, <em>between covenants in general and covenants secured by a penalty or forfeiture. In the latter case, the obligee has his election to bring an action for the penalty, after which he cannot resort to the </em>covenant; <em>or- to proceed upon the covenant, and recover more or less than the penalty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Upon the whole, we are of opinion that the demand, in this case, is not for damages ascertained or liquidated by the parties to the contract, but for a penalty or forfeiture annexed to articles of agreement, a breach of which has been found; and therefore, <em>by </em>the statute, the defendant is entitled to a hearing in chancery before judgment shall be rendered, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b82-8\"><em> </em>Where the word <em>penalty </em>is used, the damages can never be considered as liquidated. \u2014 <em>Smith </em>vs. Dickenson, 3 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>630. \u2014 <em>Davis </em>vs. Penton, <em>6 B. &amp; C. </em>216. \u2014- <em>Orr vs. </em>Churchill, 1 <em>H.
