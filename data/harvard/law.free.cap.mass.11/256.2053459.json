This is a court of general jurisdiction ; and, to avoid its jurisdiction, it behaves the defendant to show matter which ousts it of its cognizance of this action, and gives exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of <em>Connecticut. </em>Respecting the disposition of personal property belonging to a deceased person, whether * chattels in possession or [ * 259 ] choses in action, the laws of the country where the deceased had his home at the time of his death are to govern. Debts have no <em>situs, </em>but follow the person of the creditor. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>follows, then, that the distribution of the personal effects of the deceased intestate are to be distributed by the laws of this commonwealth. As kindred of the half-blood are, by the laws of <em>Connect</em>icut, excluded from any share of the property, but are by our laws admitted equally with those of the whole-blood, the Court will see that the citizens here have the benefit of their own laws and institutions. And if the money in question in this action has been accounted for by the defendant in <em>Connecticut, </em>yet, since his administration in that state was but ancillary to the principal administration here, the money ought to be remitted hither, to be administered according to our laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-5\">The defendant was a volunteer in taking the administration upon himself in <em>Connecticut, </em>and if be suffers, it will be owing to his own indiscretion. But he is not obliged to account there for these notes. Had another been there appointed administrator, and the defendant had voluntarily paid these demands to such administrator, such payment would have been no bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action; although perhaps a judgment against him, and a satisfaction of it, might have been a sufficient bar. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">It will not escape the recollection of the Court that the plaintiff is bound, by his administration bond, to account for the money due from the defendant to the judge of probate here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-7\">Suppose the defendant\u2019s only property .consisted of' land in this state, the plaintiff must have his remedy here or not at all; yet that circumstance alone could not of itself give jurisdiction to this Court. Nor can a debtor\u2019s taking letters of administration in another state protect him against the demands of the rightful administrator here.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-8\">\n<em>Dewey.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkF\">The question in this case is of a new impression, and authorities in point are not to be found in the [*260] * books. But, by reasoning from analogy, and from principles well settled, it will be easy to come to a correct conclusion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-9\">Before the decision in the case of <em>Goodwin </em>vs. <em>Jones, </em>administrators appointed in the other states were admitted to sue and collect debts in this commonwealth. Since that time administrations nave been granted here for that purpose, upon the estates of persons who were never resident within this jurisdiction. But such administrators have never been understood to have any authority or control over the effects of the deceased in another state. He can only administer the estate found and being here! Much les* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>can he maintain actions against the administrator appointed originally in the state where the deceased belonged and had his domicile.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-4\">In the case at bar, although the writ names the intestate as late of Norfolk, yet the plea leaves it uncertain whether his domicile, at the time of his decease, was in <em>Connecticut </em>or in this state. It is alleged in the plea that administration was first granted to the defendant in <em>Connecticut, </em>that he lived there at the decease of the intestate, and that he has given bonds and become accountable to the judge of probate there for the money for which this suit is brought. And we contend that, as it respects this case, which has nothing to do with the distribution of the estate, the intestate\u2019s domicile is wholly immaterial. The administrator is to collect the debts; and the estate is to be distributed according to the law of the place where the intestate had his domicile. This is the law of this state, <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> which agrees, in this particular, with the law of <em>England, </em>and with the law of nations. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">In <em>England, </em>there can seldom be two distinct administrations-upon the same estate. If an intestate leave <em>bona notabilia </em>in two dioceses, administration is granted by the <em>archbishop. </em>But in this commonwealth, and in the other <em>United, States, </em>there may be as many administrations as states in which an intestate had debts due to him. To prevent a * conflict of the rights [ * 261 ] of the several administrators, some rule is necessary with regard to the extent of their powers and duties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">In this state, no provision is made by statute for the appointment of an administrator, where the intestate was not an inhabitant of the commonwealth. But when such deceased person had estate here, the propriety of granting administration results from prin ciples of the common law; <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> and the sole object of it is to admin ister the estate of the deceased actually found within the common wealth. And the same rule will apply where a previous adminis tration has been granted in another state.. For it can never be supposed that the administrator appointed here has any control over estate of the deceased situate in another state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">The question, then, is, whether the promissory notes described in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration were the estate of the deceased in this commonwealth. If they were not, the plaintiff has no right to recover their contents in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">Upon this point, the authorities are uniform. Simple contract debts follow the person of the debtor, and, in <em>England, </em>are cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>sidered as <em>bona notabilia </em>of the deceased in the place where the debtor resides at the decease of the creditor. <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">From the authorities cited, it is very clear that the plaintiff, as administrator, has nothing to do with the debts due the intestate in <em>Connecticut. </em>If there were a doubt on the subject, when taken as a general rule, there can be none in this particular case, where the defendant is himself administrator. The money due is in the hands of the defendant, as administrator; it is collected by him ; and he is obliged to account for it to the court from whom he received his appointment. It does not appear to the Court, in the case at bar, where the promissory notes, which were the evidence of the debt, were at the time of the intestate\u2019s decease. But if it had been shown that they were in this state, it could make no difference, as to the legal consequences of the fact; for the [ * 262 ] * debt was estate of the deceased at the place where the debtor resided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\">In England, the archbishops of <em>York </em>and of <em>Canterbury </em>may ap\u2022point several administrators, when an intestate leaves <em>bona notabilia </em>in each province. <footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> But no one will believe that one administrator can collect simple contract debts due in the province in which the other was appointed. The cases above referred to, and the principles settled by them, are clearly against it. The same principles apply with equal force against the present action. As well might the plaintiff collect a debt of an inhabitant of <em>Connecticut, </em>who has paid what he was indebted to the administrator there, and taken his discharge; this money, being in the hands of the defendant, as administrator, who cannot sue himself, is, in a legal sense, by him collected, and he is accountable for it, but not in this action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-7\">\n<em>Hulbert,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtTU\">in reply. The cases cited for the defendant do not apply to the case before the Court. In <em>England, </em>there are no conflicting jurisdictions upon the subject; and the law of distributions is the same through the kingdom. But here, if the plaintiff, who, as being of the half-blood to the intestate, is entitled to a distributive share of his estate, cannot maintain this action, he is by the law of <em>Connecticut </em>debarred from any share.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-8\">Although the defendant may be holden to account for these notes in <em>Connecticut, </em>yet it will be a sufficient accounting, if he shows that he has been compelled to pay them here; and he will be thereupon discharged.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> 2 <em>Vattel </em>c. 7, \u00a7 66, 68, 109, 110. \u2014 2 <em>Ves. </em>35, <em>Thorne </em>vs. Watkins. \u2014 Ambler, 25, <em>Pipon </em>vs. Pipon.\u20142 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>225, <em>Bruce </em>vs. Bruce.\u20143 <em>Mass.

In that plea, he admits, in effect, that he was indebted to the intestate, as alleged in the declaration, and that the plaintiff is administrator, duly appointed in this state, of the effects of the deceased; but he alleges, in his defence, that, before the plaintiff\" was so appointed administrator, he, the defendant, and one <em>Philemon Gaylord, </em>who were both inhabitants and * residents in <em>Connecti- </em>[ * 263 ] <em>:ut, </em>were duly, and according to the laws of <em>Connecticut, </em>appointed administrators of the effects of the said deceased, by a certain judge of probate there, who had the power of granting such administrations; that they gave bond to the said judge, with condition to exhibit an inventory, and to render their account to him; that they did accordingly exhibit an inventory of all the effects oi the deceased, which had come to their knowledge, including therein all the moneys due from the defendant to the deceased on the notes and demands specified in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration; by means of all which the defendant is holden and obliged to account to the said judge of probate in <em>Connecticut </em>for all the said moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The plaintiff assigns, as a special cause of his demurrer to this plea, that it is not alleged therein that the said <em>Tibbals, </em>at the time of his decease, or at any time before, resided or had his home in <em>Connecticut; </em>and, on examining the other parts of this record, it appears that such an averment was made in another plea; and being traversed, the issue was found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We are well satisfied that this point is wholly immaterial in the decision of this cause. The right of granting administration is not confined to the.state or country in which the deceased last dwelt. It is very common, and often necessary, that administration be taken out elsewhere. If a foreigner, or a citizen of any other of the <em>United States, </em>dies, leaving debts and effects in this state, these can never be collected by an administrator appointed in the place of his domicile ; and we uniformly grant administration to some person here for that purpose. This is the rule of the common law; and it is adopted, as we understand, in most of the <em>United States, </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In such case, however, the administration granted here is considered as merely ancillary to the principal administration, granted in the jurisdiction where the deceased dwelt. It is true that such ancillary administration is not usually granted until an administrator is appointed in the place of * the de- [ * 264 ] ceased\u2019s domicile. But this cannot be a necessary pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>requisite; for if so, and it should happen that administration is never granted in the foreign state, the debts due here, under such circumstances, to a deceased person could never be collected ; and the debts due from him to citizens of this state might remain unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The time of granting the respective letters of administration is also immaterial in this case. The administrators in <em>Connecticut, </em>if duly appointed, must collect all the effects of the deceased in that state, whilst the plaintiff will do the like here; and the residue, after paying the debts of the deceased, wherever collected or remaining, must be distributed according to the laws of the state in which the deceased dwelt. If it should appear, upon due exami nation in our Probate Court, that <em>Tibbals </em>had his home in <em>Connecticut, </em>we should cause the balance remaining in the hands of the administrator here, to be distributed according to the laws of <em>Connecticut, </em>or transmitted for distribution by the administrator in <em>Connecticut, </em>under the decree of the Probate Court there. And we cannot doubt that the Courts in <em>Connecticut </em>would, under like circumstances, adopt the same principles of comity and justice. <footnotemark>(8)</footnotemark>, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Having disposed of these two subordinate points, the great question in the cause still remains, \u2014 whether, if the debtor of an intestate be duly appointed administrator in another state, that circumstance, together with the others stated in this plea, furnishes\" a sufficient defence. I say duly appointed in another state, because no objection is suggested to the jurisdiction of the court in <em>Connecticut, </em>unless it arise from the domicile of the deceased, which has been already considered ; and no fact is alleged, tending to impeach that grant of administration, or in any manner impair its legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">If some other person had been appointed sole administrator in <em>Connecticut, </em>and had there received this debt of the defendant, it would undoubtedly have been a good bar to this action. [ * 265 ] Suppose, then, that such administrator, instead * of receiving the debt, had commenced an action for it there, and had recovered judgment before the commencement of this suit, the defendant being a citizen of that state, and subject to its laws; that would also be a bar to this action. Otherwise we must admit that one of our citizens, after a regular judgment against him for a debt in our courts, is justly liable to pay the sam\u00e9 debt again in any other state, where he may have property to be attached, or where his body may happen to be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Still, in the cases supposed, the defendant could not allege in his defence a payment of the debt demanded. A legal obligation to pay to such judgment creditor exclusively seems equivalent to actual payment. It resembles, in this respect, a judgment on a process of foreign attachment against the debtor, as granishee or trustee of iiis creditor. It has been decided in this Court that such a judgment rendered in this state, and remaining unsatisfied, is a good bar to an action brought by the creditor; <footnotemark>(9)</footnotemark> and it is equally clear that a like judgment, rendered in any other state, having jurisdiction of the cause, would protect the debtor, if afterwards sued here. <footnotemark>(10)</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The ground of the debtor\u2019s defence in such a case has no resemblance to a discharge procured under the bankrupt or insolvent laws of another state. In the cases supposed, the foreign state, instead of releasing and discharging the debtor without payment, and depriving the creditor of all remedy for his debt, requires and compels the debtor to pay the debt, but in a different manner, or to a different person, than such as our laws would prescribe, if the debt had been originally sued here. If the foreign state have jurisdiction of the person of the debtor, and of course the right to enforce the payment of the debt, it cannot be important by what form of process, or in what manner, they exercise that right.. Any adjudication, or other proceeding whatever, pursuant to their laws, which is obligatory on the debtor there, must protect him against a suit for the same thing in another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">* It is hardly necessary to remark that, in allowing [ * 266 ] this effect to such proceedings in a foreign state, we suppose them to have been conducted with good faith, and without any fraud or collusion on the part of the debtor, to the prejudice of third persons. Such fraud in the parties concerned will avoid the effect of a judicial proceeding, as well as of any act <em>in </em>pais. ' But it must be pleaded, if relied on by the adverse party, and can never be presumed by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">That brings us to consider whether the defendant, upon the facts stated in his plea, was, at the commencement of this action, legally bound to pay and account for this debt in <em>Connecticut, </em>in such a manner that, if compelled to pay it on this suit, he may be twice charged for the same debt. It is material here to recollect that the debt now demanded is included and specified in the inventory exhibited by the administrators in <em>Connecticut, </em>as part of the goods and estate of the intestate, for which those administrators were accountable to the judge of probate there. The case might hats <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>been very different, if the defendant had denied that he owed this debt, and had refused to insert it in tile inventory, and to account for it as the property of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">It is well settled that, when the creditor makes his debtor exec utor, it is a discharge of the action for the debt. The reason sometimes given for this is, that the making of him executor operates by way of legacy or gift of the debt. Lord <em>Holt, </em>in the case of <em>Wankford </em>vs. <em>Wankford, </em><footnotemark>(11)</footnotemark> says that it operates as a payment and release; as the same hand is to pay and receive the debt which is therefore considered as actually paid and extinguished But. in truth, it is not always a legacy, nor a release or extinguish ment of the debt. It -is not a legacy, if it appear from the will that the testator did*not intend to give the amount of the debt to the executor ; as if he give him a distinct legacy in the same will It is not always a release or extinguishment of the debt: for it is assets to pay creditors, if wanted for that purpose. <footnotemark>(12)</footnotemark> It is also assets to pay legacies, or distributable among the next [ * 267 ] of kin, when the debt is not itself given as a * legacy to the executor. <footnotemark>(13)</footnotemark> It seems more correct to say that, although the duty remains in some cases, and for some purposes, yet the right of action is always discharged, because the executor cannot sue himself, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">This reason, it is obvious, applies with equal force to an administrator ; and, indeed, in all those cases where the debt is not in effect given to the executor as a legacy, it is difficult to imagine any substantial reason for the discharge or extinguishment of the action, which does not apply to the case of an administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In 1 <em>Rol. Abr. </em>920, pi. 11, it is said that, if the creditor dies intestate, and the ordinary commits administration to the debtor, <em>by which the debt is extinct, </em>yet it shall be assets in his hands; for the ordinary has no power to discharge the debt. This short note would not be considered of much authority, against the opinion of Lord <em>Holt, </em>in the case cited from <em>Salkeld, </em>and against the cases in 8 <em>Co. </em>268, and 1 <em>Sid. </em>79; but it is believed that they may all be reconciled by distinguishing between a discharge or suspension of the remedy by action and an extinguishment of the debt. In this view, the expression iri <em>Rolle </em>is incorrect; it should have been, that the <em>action </em>is discharged or suspended ; for the <em>debt </em>clearly is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>not extinguished or released without payment, the amount of it being assets payable to the creditors of the intestate, or distributable among his next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">On the other hand, those who hold that it is no extinguishment cannot mean to say that any action can be maintained for the debt, so long as the debtor remains administrator. In the case cited from 8 <em>Coke, </em>268, the administration granted to the debtor had been repealed, and was considered as void <em>ab initia; </em>after which he was held liable in an action by an administrator rightfully appointed. In the case from 1 <em>Siderjxn, </em>79, which is more fully reported in 1 <em>Keb. </em>313, it appears that the obligor, who was appointed administrator, had died, and his executor was sued for the debt by an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of the first intestate. <footnotemark>(14)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">* I have not been able to find any case where an ad- [ * 268 ] ministrator, while 'his letters of administration remained in force, has been sued for a debt due from him to the intestate. The case cited in the argument, from <em>Dyer, </em>305, seems to be somewhat analogous. There an administrator appointed in <em>Ireland </em>released a bond debt due to the intestate from a person in <em>Ireland; </em>but the bond being in <em>England </em>at the death of the intestate, an administrator appointed in <em>England </em>maintained an action there on the same bond against the obligor, because the administrator appointed in <em>Ireland </em>had no control of this debt, and no authority to release it. And there can be no doubt that, if the <em>Irish </em>administrator had been himself the obligor, and had undertaken to appropriate the amount of this debt as assets there, he would still have been liable to the action of the <em>English </em>administrator. But this seems to prove, <em>e conversa, </em>that, if the <em>Irish </em>administrator could have lawfully released the debt when due from another, he might have discharged it, and accounted for it in <em>Ireland, </em>if due from himself. In the case at bar, there can be no doubt that the administrators in <em>Connecticut </em>might have received and released this debt, if due from any other person in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">It was suggested, in the argument, that the notes on which this action is brought were in this state at the death of the intestate. This fact does not appear on the record; and, if material, it should have been pleaded. But if the notes were here, the debtor, being a citizen of <em>Connecticut, </em>might be effectually discharged by a release from any administrator in <em>Connecticut, </em>having lawful authority to receive the debt. And, further, the notes, under such circumstances, could never be recovered, in the ordinary course of things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>without being sent to <em>Connecticut, </em>and demanded by an administrator duly appointed there.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The circumstance of the defendant\u2019s having come into this state, so as to expose himself to this action, cannot affect the general principle. The law would be the same if that contingency had not happened; in which case the debtor [ * 269 ] * could never be compelled to pay but to an administrator duly authorized in <em>Connecticut; </em>and, of course, a release given to him by such an administrator would bar any subsequent action for the same debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Another reason why this money should be accounted for in <em>Connecticut </em>is, that all the effects of the deceased are liable, in the first instance, to his creditors there. No principle of comity requires of that government to lend their aid in collecting the effects of the deceased, and to send those effects out of their country, whilst any of their citizens have just and legal claims upon the fund. This debt, then, was assets, liable to the claims of all creditors, citizens of <em>Connecticut; </em>and they ought not to be deprived of this advantage merely because the debtor is himself appointed administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">If the opinions now expressed tended in any degree to impair the security of the creditors or next of kin of the intestate, it would afford a strong argument against their correctness. But no such effect is to be apprehended. As soon as the debtor is appointed administrator, if he acknowledges the debt, he has actually received so much money, and is answerable for it. This is the result with respect to an executor; <footnotemark>(15)</footnotemark> and the same reason applies to an administrator ; as the same hand is to receive and pay, and there is no ceremony to be performed in paying the debt, and no mode of doing it, but by considering the money to be now in the hands of the party, in his character of administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Lord <em>Holt, </em>in the case so often cited from <em>Salkeld, </em>gives it as his opinion that, if the administrator in such case, having no assets, pays a debt of the intestate,'to the amount of what he himself owed, this would be a release. And why is it not as effectual a release, if he brings the money into his account to the credit of the intestate\u2019s estate, to' be paid to creditors, if required, or to be distributed among the next of kin upon a decree of the Probate Court? It is said, in <em>Shelley\u2019s </em>case, <footnotemark>(16)</footnotemark> that all the debts mentioned [ * 270 ] in the * inventory shall be assets in the executor\u2019s hands, unless he prove a demand and refusal. In the case of his own debt, which he admits to be due, it is obvious that he can never prove a demand and refusal. The consequence is, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>and his sureties in the administration bond are liable for the amount of such a debt, in like manner as if he had received it from any other debtor of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">It may be thought injurious to the sureties of the debtor that they should thus be made liable for a debt due from the administrator. To this it may be answered, that, if such be the legal effect of the bond, it is presumed to have been contemplated by the parties at the time of executing it; and they cannot afterwards complain of the natural and legal consequence of their own voluntary act But how is the condition of the sureties worse than if any other person had owed the same debt, and the administrator had released the debtor without receiving payment, or upon taking a note payable to himself for the amount ?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">To examine this point a little further, let us suppose that an administrator, being a debtor to the intestate, after inserting his debt in the inventory, and bringing it into his account to the credit of the intestate\u2019s estate, should settle his account in the Probate Court, and that a decree should there be made for distributing the residue remaining in his hands on such account; if the administrator should become insolvent, or refuse to pay the balance, pursuant to the decree, and an action should be instituted on the part of the next of kin on the administration bond, would the sureties be exonerated, because a part or the whole of that balance arose from a debt originally due from the administrator himself? They are obviously in no worse condition than if the administrator had received the like amount from any other debtor, and, after crediting it in his account, had become unable to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">If it should be said that the representatives of a deceased administrator, under such circumstances, would be liable for the amount of his original debt, if not actually paid by him * in a course of administration, as in the case cited from [ * 271 ] 1 <em>Keb. </em>313, still there seems to be no inconsistency in holding that the sureties are also liable on their bond for the same amount. The chance of such a future remedy ought not to deprive the creditors or next of kin of their resort to the sureties, while the administrator is living, during all which time they have no other remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">We are therefore satisfied that, by the principles of the common law, the defendant was, at the time when this action was commenced, bound to account, as administrator, for the debt now demanded ; and that the fact set forth in his plea, if not amounting to an actual payment of this specific debt, are equivalent to a payment, so that, if held liable in this suit, he might, without any default on his part, be twice charged for the same debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>It has not been suggested that the laws of <em>Connecticut </em>vary, in this respect, from the common law. The plea might perhaps have contained a more distinct reference to the laws of <em>Connecticut, </em>or a more direct averment of the effect of those laws upon the facts disclosed. But as no objection has been made to the plea on this ground, and the cause has been argued on both sides with reference to the common law, as recognized among us, we have not thought it necessary to examine very critically the form of the plea, being satisfied that the defendant has shown substantially a just defence to this action, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\n<em>Defendant's plea good.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\"><em> Goodwin </em>vs. <em>Jones, </em>3 <em>Mass.
