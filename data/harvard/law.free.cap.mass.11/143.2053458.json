The sum of 189 dollars 50 cents, the amount for which the order was drawn, was all the demand the plaintiff had against the defendant, and the several counts in the declaration had respect to that sum. [ * 144 ] * The brig <em>Cataract, </em>soon after the date of the order,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-9\">sailed on the contemplated voyage, and touched at one of the <em>West India </em>Islands, since leaving which she had not been heard of. The usual time for the performance of such a voyage had elapsed long before the commencement of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-10\">The judge who sat in the trial was of opinion, upon this evi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>dence, that the first contract for the boards was discharged by the acceptance of the order; that it was not the intention of the parties that the plaintiff should take the risk of the return of the vessel; but that, after a reasonable time for the performance of the voyage mentioned, the plaintiff was entitled to receive the amount o\u00ed the order; and he instructed the jury to return their verdict for the said amount, with interest after such reasonable time had expired. The jury returned their verdict in conformity to the said directions; and the defendant, having filed his exceptions to the said directions, as against law and the evidence in the case, the action stood continued to this term for the consideration of the said exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-5\"><em>King, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah_\">This was an entire and special contract, and it is to be enforced only according to the terms of it. The condition, on which alone the bill was to be paid, has not happened. It was for this reason that the acceptor has not been called upon ; and the drawer cannot be holden, unless the acceptor is liable. Here is no room for construction ; nor for equitable considerations, since it is to be presumed that the price of the article was proportioned to the risk of a final loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-6\">As the plaintiff has no cause of action on the bill, so neither can he recover on his original account.

Although it is not to be inferred, from the writing, that the plaintiff was to assume the risk of the voyage, yet the money was not to be paid upon this ordei until the return of the vessel. It was a mere authority to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>drawee to pay the money upon the happening of that event. It is not drawn for value received. But when we look further into the case, we find the order was given in part payment for a quantity of boards sold by the plaintiff to the defendant, the remainder of the bill having been satisfied in money. This is sufficient evidence of value received; but still we think this not such a bill of exchange as gave a recurrence to the drawer, but on the terms of the draft itself, that is, on the return of the vessel from the voyage then in contemplation, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We do not think, as the evidence is, that there is sufficient proof that the plaintiff was to depend in all events for the payment of this sum on the vessel\u2019s return. It was probably to fix the length of the credit he was to give, that the money was make payable at that time. Then the plaintiff must have his remedy against <em>Maxwell </em>on his original demand, notwithstanding his receipt on the bill. That receipt is not a release, nor conclusive upon the plaintiff. Unless, then, the defendant can show that it is agreeable to a general course of trade in <em>Saco </em>for the party selling lumber or other cargo for a voyage, and giving a credit for the voyage, to run the [ * 146 ] risk, and that in the present case such * was the probable understanding of the parties, to be evidenced by the price of the articles sold, we are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict on the other counts. Such evidence might have been introduced at the trial if in the defendant\u2019s power. We shall not therefore set aside the verdict, but enter judgment upon it, leaving the defendant to his review, if he shall be advised to pursue it. He has accordingly leave to retract his waiver of a right to ^review, stipulated when the cause was saved for out consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> A bill or note must purport that the money mentioned in it shall be payable absolutely, and at all events; if it purport to make the payment depend upon any uncertainty or contingency, the instrument is not a bill or note; and if it be not a bill or note <em>ao initia, </em>no subsequent event can make it so. \u2014 <em>Bayley on Bills, </em>5th ed, c. 1, \u00a7 6, p. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
