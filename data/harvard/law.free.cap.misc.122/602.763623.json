His will was admitted to probate on June 13, 1874. One-of these grandchildren, Mary P. Murdock, died May 22, 1923, leaving issue as follows: Marion P. Murdock, an unmarried daughter; Eleanor B. Beach, who has three infant children, Beta, Eleanor and Natalie; and two infant children of James P. Murdock, a deceased son, to wit, Rebecca Murdock and Mary P. Murdock.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The definite question here presented is how and to what extent these great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren share under the terms of paragraph 6 of the will, above quoted. It is a well-settled principle of law that the word <em>\u201c </em>issue \u201d includes all descendants and its use contemplates a <em>per capita </em>distribution unless this construction frustrates the obvious intention of the testator, as manifest in the testament, and results in an inequality of distribution where an even division was clearly contemplated. In the latter instances an exception is made to the rule and distribution must be <em>per stirpes. Matter of Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Co., </em>213 N. Y. 168; <em>Matter of Durant, </em>231 id. 41; <em>Matter of Lawrence, </em>111 Misc. Rep. 524; <em>Estate of Cotheal, </em>121 id. 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In the will before us the intention of the testator to distribute the remainder equally and <em>per stirpes </em>is clear and certain. In the clauses creating the trust the principal is divided into as many shares <em>\u201c </em>as there shall be grandchildren of mine living at the time of my death, or who shall have died leaving issue me surviving and to set apart and designate one of such shares for each of my said grandchildren.\u201d This language discloses fully the intention to create as many shares as there were grandchildren living or dead; in other words, to provide for a stirpital distribution. This intention is again indicated in the clause near the end of the paragraph, viz., \u201c and upon the death of each such grandchild, I give and devise the <em>said share so set apart and designated for him or her to his or her issue in fee simple.\u201d </em>A <em>per capita </em>distribution of this remainder would result in a division of seven parts as against the three parts or shares undoubtedly intended by the testator and would permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>great-great-grandchildren to share equally with living great-grandchildren, their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">I hold, therefore, that the word <em>\u201c </em>issue <em>\u201d </em>as used in this will must be interpreted to mean a division <em>per stirpes. </em>A decree may be submitted on notice construing the will accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
