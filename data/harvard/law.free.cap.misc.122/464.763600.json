Prac. Act, \u00a7 1410, subd. 1-a), the stay authorized by chapter 137 of the Laws of 1920 was expressly limited to cities of the first class having a population of 1,000,000 or <em>less </em>(Laws of 1920, chap. 948); so that in the city of New York a justice of the Municipal Court had no power thereafter to grant a stay in a summary proceeding for longer than thirty days upon the conditions prescribed in subdivision 3 of section 6 of the Municipal Court Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">It follows that the final order must be modified by striking therefrom the stay in so far as it exceeded the statutory thirty days, and as so modified affirmed, with five dollars costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">All concur; present, Bijur, Mullan and Lydon, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
