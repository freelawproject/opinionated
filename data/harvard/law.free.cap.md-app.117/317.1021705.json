The major challenge presented in this case is to interpret correctly the meaning of the term \u201cclaim\u201d as used in a \u201cclaims made\u201d directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The dispute that gives rise to this issue had its origin in the 1985 Savings and Loan debacle, which ultimately cost Maryland taxpayers over $125,000,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One of the largest Maryland savings and loan associations that suffered severe financial difficulties in 1985 was the Merritt Commercial Savings &amp; Loan Association (\u201cMerritt\u201d), formerly known as Merritt Savings and Loan, Inc. At all times here relevant, Merritt was a wholly owned subsidiary of Middle States Financial Corporation (\u201cMiddle States\u201d). Gerald S. Klein (\u201cKlein\u201d) held all outstanding shares of stock in the holding company that owned Middle States. Klein, in turn, controlled numerous other corporations and partnerships in Maryland, many of which were subsidiaries of Merritt.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In 1983, Fidelity Deposit Company of Maryland (\u201cFidelity\u201d) issued a $3,000,000 \u201cDirectors and Officers Liability Insurance Policy\u201d (\u201cD &amp; O policy\u201d) to Merritt. The D &amp; O policy covered two of Merritt\u2019s subsidiaries, Institutional Service Corp. and Merritt Capital Corp., along with some twenty-two subsidiaries of either Institutional Services Corporation or Merritt Capital Corporation. The policy was for \u201cclaims made\u201d during the period between August 12, 1983, and October 14, 1986.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under Paragraph 6 of the D <em>&amp; O </em>policy, if the insured received a notice of contemplated claim within the policy period and gave notice of the potential claim to the insurer, that potential claim was to be treated as covered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the event that a claim was later made against directors or officers of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Klein, one of the appellants, was the President of Merritt and the Chairman of Merritt\u2019s Board of Directors at the time Fidelity\u2019s D &amp; 0 policy was issued. He continued as an officer and director until November 26, 1984. Thereafter, he asserted personal control over most of the important aspects of Merritt\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Due to \u201cextreme liquidity pressures\u201d and because depositors had lost confidence in privately insured savings and loans associations in Maryland, Merritt entered into a voluntary conservatorship effective May 13,1985. The Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund Corporation (\u201cMDIF\u201d) was appointed by the court to be Merritt\u2019s conservator. The conservator immediately limited withdrawals to $1,000 per account per month. On June 20, 1985, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City eliminated all withdrawals from Merritt to continue until September 20,1985, or until changed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">A. THE FOUR NOTICE LETTERS</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In regard to the crisis at Merritt, Fidelity received four letters that are important to our narrative. Of the four letters, only the first, the Trice letter, was sent to any of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">1. The Trice Letter</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">In 1985, Paul Trice was a Senior Vice President of Maryland Savings Share Insurance Corporation (\u201cMSSIC\u201d), the predecessor of MDIF. He wrote a letter to Klein on May 2, 1985, and complained about a number of serious problems his office had found with scores of loans made by Merritt. Mr. Trice complained, for example, that Merritt had lent Delmarva Venture Corporation (\u201cDelmarva\u201d) a total of $9,240,710, even though Klein indirectly owned Delmarva through a holding company and was a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d within the meaning of Maryland Code Annotated, Financial Operations section 9-323(e)(3). That section, in 1985, required that loans to a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d must be approved by the Division Di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>rector of the Division of Savings and Loan Associations. No such approval was in Mr. Trice\u2019s files, and he demanded a complete explanation for the \u201cviolation of section 9-323(e)(3) ... along with a plan for the immediate removal of these loans from Merritt with no loss thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">After listing many other violations, or purported violations, of banking laws or regulations by Merritt, Mr. Trice concluded his fifteen-page letter by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">In summary, the nature and volume of the items noted above is of paramount concern to this Corporation. Underlying these comments, obviously, are numerous major issues such as the question of independence of Merritt Commercial\u2019s board of directors from influence by its stockholder; the apparent lack of adequate internal controls and adequate underwriting in major investments; the concentration of large dollar investments \u2014 direct or by loans \u2014 in three (3) geographic locations and the timely recovery of these funds without loss to Merritt in the current economy; the ability of Merritt Commercial to complete funding and effect recovery of its major loans and investments in the current environment and marketplace (vis-a-vis Merritt\u2019s current and near term liquidity and borrowing posture, savings flows, etc.); the apparent disregard for various statutes and regulations designed to maintain safety and soundness, thereby affording a degree of protection of the saving public\u2019s monies and enabling maintenance of integrity and viability in the MSSIC insured industry; etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">In view of the magnitude of all the above, we are compelled to require that you, the board of directors of Merritt and its senior management officers such as Dennis Finnegan present yourselves in the offices of the Corporation on May 13, 1985 at 10:00 A.M. for the purpose of presenting for our preliminary review, your written responses to each of the matters noted herein. There can not and will not be any further extensions for this meeting or written response to these issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>2. The Robinson Letter</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Zelig Robinson, Esquire, wrote to Fidelity on July 9, 1985, on behalf of the current and former directors and officers of Merritt, including Klein. His letter concerned \u201cpotential claims, which may arise under\u201d Merritt\u2019s D &amp; 0 policy. Mr. Robinson said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">This notice, including the Exhibits, describes certain events and transactions in which Merritt and/or its direct and indirect wholly or partially owned subsidiaries (\u201csubsidiaries\u201d) engaged, and in which some or all of the insureds were involved, which could possibly result in claims against the insureds on the basis that such events and transactions gave rise to .the occurrences referred to above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">... it is conceivable that, with the benefit of hindsight, claims may be made by frustrated depositors, creditors, or others against the insureds based upon the following as well as other transactions, events and circumstances, most of which are set forth in the following Exhibits, for the reasons specified, among others. Accordingly, we believe that under the terms of the above-referenced policy we are obligated to call your attention to any such potential claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\"><em>In view of the occurrences beginning in May 1985, we hereby notify you pursuant to Section 6 of the policy that claims, including those referred to above, may be made against the insureds in respect of one or more of the transactions set forth in the following Exhibits. </em>This submission, however, is not and shall not be construed as an admission of any wrongdoing or irregularity; this submission is made solely for the purpose of notifying you, in accordance with the terms of the policy, of the possibility that claims may be made against the insureds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">(Emphasis added.) Mr. Robinson\u2019s letter goes on to summarize, in broad outline form, numerous claims that the writer believed might be brought by others against his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>3. The Thieblot Letter</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Robert J. Thieblot, Esquire, special counsel for the conservator for Merritt, wrote a letter that was addressed to Melvin Brown, Director of the MDIF. It was dated September 18, 1985, and a copy was sent to Fidelity on September 20, 1985, by a partner of Mr. Thieblot. The copy was sent pursuant to Paragraph 6 of Fidelity\u2019s policy dealing with notice of potential claims. Mr. Thieblot\u2019s letter was blunt. He wrote the letter</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">to call [Mr. Brown\u2019s] attention to various matters which, in our opinion, could give rise to a civil law suit against Gerald S. Klein, and possibly others, relating to gross mismanagement of Merritt and other wrongful conduct. We do not intend at this point to attempt to provide a complete catalogue of transactions, acts, and circumstances which we believe may give rise to liability. Rather, we will provide a broad outline of what we believe to have been Mr. Klein\u2019s wrongful conduct, with some specific examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Mr. Thieblot continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">We believe he may have practiced extensive self-dealing, taken unreasonable fees and dividends, diverted corporate opportunities, exerted undue and in fact total control over the officers and directors of Merritt, forced Merritt to enter highly speculative transactions without Merritt having sufficient (and in some cases any) basis for believing they were sound, and procured unsound appraisals for the purpose of inducing Merritt to enter transactions it should have avoided, and to lend sums in excess of regulatory limits. We also believe that Klein may have committed legal malpractice in connection with his representation of Merritt. We believe that the net effect of Klein\u2019s activities was to transform Merritt into an aggressive vehicle which he used to finance his speculative investments, to the detriment of Merritt. We believe Klein\u2019s wrongful activities will cost Merritt, and ultimately its depositors or those who have or may undertake to make the depositors whole, millions of dollars. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Mr. Thieblot next proceeded to list numerous: 1) \u201cstatutory and regulatory violations\u201d by Klein; 2) examples of \u201cundue influence by Klein\u201d; 3) examples of \u201cself dealing by Klein,\u201d including examples of loans by Merritt to entities, which were already on shaky ground, that Klein controlled; and 4) numerous examples of business practices that Mr. Thieblot thought \u201cmay be improper.\u201d He concluded his letter by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_9\">The Maryland statutory and regulatory provisions that may govern cases of this kind are not free from confusion. There are gaps in the law and some inconsistencies. Operative provisions are capable of varying interpretations. Documents and facts have been under the control of Klein and those he directs. Yet I think we now are on notice of facts and circumstances sufficient to permit an informed judgment, and that is that Klein at least, and very possibly others, are liable for Merritt\u2019s very substantial losses. If part of the Chase Agreement with Klein (if there is such an agreement) is to be to release him of past liabilities, then that is of course part of the business deal and general settlement with him. If[,] however, that for any reason does not go through, then I advise that suit papers be prepared and filed promptly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The \u201cChase agreement with Klein\u201d referred to in the September 18, 1985, letter concerned the purchase of all shares of stock in Merritt by the Chase Bank of Maryland (hereinafter \u201cChase\u201d) and will be discussed in detail <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">4. The Frierson Letter</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">By letter dated October 3, 1985, Robert deV. Frierson, on behalf of the MDIF, gave notice to Fidelity of a potential claim MDIF had against Merritt and its officers and directors. Mr. Frierson said, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">\n<em>Pursuant to paragraph 6 of the policy, you are hereby given notice of events, transactions, and circumstances that may give rise to a claim against Merritt that have not already been given to you.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">During the period of your policy\u2019s coverage, Merritt may have or may be alleged to have acted or failed to have acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>with respect to various transactions and matters in a manner that may give rise to a claim that Merritt engaged in deceit, fraud, misrepresentation, neglect, self-dealing, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, violation of the Maryland and United States securities acts, violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, violation of Merritt\u2019s rules, regulations and bylaws, violation of the Maryland Financial Institutions Article, violation of the former MSSIC\u2019s rules and regulations, and other violations of state and federal law, the common law, and various rules and regulations. The claims may be asserted against Merritt by depositors and creditors of Merritt, by members of the public (either directly or indirectly through a State agency), by others who have had business dealings with Merritt, by or on behalf of Merritt and its conservator, officers, directors and agents, and by MDIF as successor corporation to MSSIC. The factual basis of potential claims is set forth in greater detail in letters dated September 18, 1985 from Robert J. Thieblot, Esquire to Melville S. Brown and May 2, 1985 from Paul V. Trice, Jr. to Gerald S. Klein, attached hereto and incorporated by reference. Further notification has been previously given by letter and appendix dated July 8, 1985 from Robert J. Thieblot on behalf of MDIF as conservator of Merritt and this notification is incorporated by reference in letter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">B. THE CHASE AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Fearing suits for civil liability due to matters mentioned in the aforementioned letters, Klein, on behalf of Merritt, undertook negotiations with Chase and MDIF for Chase to purchase all Merritt stock. The negotiations were fruitful, and Chase bought Merritt\u2019s stock in an agreement that was concluded on October 14, 1985. Chase was paid $25 million by the MDIF for its assumption of control over Merritt, and as part of the bargain, the MDIF agreed to forebear from suing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Klein until Klein paid Chase for various divestments of Merritt property made pursuant to the Chase sale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Klein, by use of various corporations he controlled, incurred approximately $500,000 in expenses in order to complete the sale of Merritt\u2019s stock to Chase. These expenses included fees paid to lawyers, accountants and other professionals for tax returns, tax advice, liquidation of subsidiaries, lobbying, and preparation of financial statements, and tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The Policy Exclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Fidelity\u2019s policy contained the following exclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">(a) Except insofar as the [insured] may be required or permitted by law to indemnify the Directors and Officers, the Company [Fidelity] shall not be liable to make payment for Loss in connection with any claim made against the Directors and Officers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">(2) based upon or attributable to their gaining in fact any personal profit, remuneration or advantage to which they were not legally entitled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">(4) brought about or contributed to by the dishonesty of the Directors and Officers. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Directors and Officers shall be protected under the terms of this policy as to any claims upon which suit may be brought against them by reason of any alleged dishonesty on the part of the Directors and Officers unless a judgment or other final adjudication thereof adverse to the Directors and Officers shall establish that acts of active and deliberate dishonesty committed by any of the Directors and Officers with actual dishonest purpose and intent were material to the cause of action so adjudicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Appellants\u2019 Claim Against Fidelity</p>\n<p id=\"ARc\">In February 1987, Klein, through counsel, presented a claim to Fidelity under its D <em>&amp; </em>0 policy for reimbursement of the monies spent in the negotiations of the sale of Merritt\u2019s stock to Chase. Klein\u2019s counsel wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">[Y]ou will recall that you have had conversations with Mr. Klein and myself relative to the expenditure by Mr. Klein of substantial sums related to the acquisition of Merritt Commercial Savings <em>&amp; </em>Loan Association by Chase Bank of Maryland. A very substantial part of those negotiations involved and culminated in the agreement by the Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund to forebear any civil action against Merritt\u2019s Officers and Directors at least until all debts to Chase are paid. In addition to providing potential limitations problems, the structure of that transaction provided very substantial defenses to any claims against Officers and Directors of Merritt which are probably dispositive and would at least facilitate a very favorable settlement. Needless to say, this undertaking by Mr. Klein has resulted in substantial savings to your company far in excess of the amounts expended by Mr. Klein in obtaining these agreements from which you directly benefit[ed].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">On March 24,1987, Fidelity advised Klein\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">Any legal or other professional expenses which may have been incurred by or on behalf of Mr. Klein in connection with the acquisition of Merritt by Chase Bank of Maryland would not have been amounts which Mr. Klein was legally obligated to pay for a claim or claims made against him for a Wrongful Act. Accordingly, these expenses would not constitute Loss under the Policy, and there would be no coverage under the Policy for such expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Approximately six years later, on January 4, 1993, Fidelity again denied Klein\u2019s request for coverage for the Chase transactional expenses, stating, \u201cIt is the position of Fidelity ... that the Policy does not in any way cover other legal fees and expenses notwithstanding the fact that the expenses incurred may have avoided certain claims.\u201d Klein, on January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>14, 1993, acknowledged in writing that his claim had been denied, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">It is not my purpose to perpetuate this discourse, although I admit it has been stimulating over the years. I was distracted by more pressing matters and had hoped that there would be some kind of reconciliation of our opposing views. That, now, appears to be impossible, and, therefore, I take your letter as a declination of the claim. It is my expectation that I will authorize counsel to enter suit shortly to enforce the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Klein wrote to Fidelity\u2019s representative on February 9, 1993, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">To be frank, I was disappointed that my last letter did not generate an invitation from you to meet in order to air, once and for all, our disagreements on this subject. Such a meeting would, at a minimum, afford you the opportunity to get specific about what the problem is here, insure that both sides have exhausted the negotiations before suit is filed. In any event, I want you to know that in the absence of communications, I have instructed Jim Ulwick, Esquire of Kramon &amp; Graham to begin drafting our action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The coverage issue was not resolved, yet appellants never filed the \u201caction\u201d mentioned in the February 9, 1993, letter. On February 22, 1996, more than three years after Klein acknowledged Fidelity\u2019s \u201cdeclination of the claim,\u201d Fidelity brought a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, seeking a declaration that it was under no duty to indemnify either Klein or Middle State\u2019s Holding Company, Inc. for \u201cany sums which [they] may have incurred and paid as a result of incurring fees, costs and expenses associated with the sale of Merritt\u2019s stock\u201d to Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">A bench trial was held on the matter on August 12, 1996, Judge Joseph Kaplan presiding. In a written opinion dated August 15,1996, Judge Kaplan ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">1) No \u201cclaim\u201d was made against Klein, as that term is used in the policy, and thus Fidelity had no duty to indemni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>fy either Klein or Middle States for monies expended in the sale of Merritt to Chase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">2) The insured suffered no \u201closs\u201d as that term is defined under the policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">3) That even if the insureds had both a \u201cclaim\u201d and a \u201closs\u201d under the D &amp; 0 policy, any cause of action Klein or Middle States had was barred by the statute of limitations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">4) The defendants were not entitled to recover against Fidelity under the theory of unjust enrichment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">ISSUES PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Appellants raise four issues in this appeal, but we need to address only two, which we have rephrased:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">1. Did the letters, received by Fidelity in 1985, threatening possible litigation against Klein and others, constitute a \u201cclaim\u201d under Fidelity\u2019s Policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">2. Are the appellants entitled to recovery against Fidelity under an \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d theory?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">We answer both these questions in the negative and affirm the judgment entered in favor of Fidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ISSUE I</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Fidelity\u2019s policy says, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">If during the policy period, any claim or claims are made against the Directors and Officers, individually or collectively, for a Wrongful Act, the company will pay, in accordance with the terms of the policy, on behalf of the Directors and Officers or any of them, their heirs, legal representatives or assigns all Loss which the Directors and Officers or any of them shall become legally obligated to pay or as to which the Association shall be required or permitted by law to indemnify the Directors and Officers <em>for a claim or claims made against the Directors and Officers for Wrongful Act(s) </em>and shall include damages, judgments, settlements and costs, charges and expenses ... incurred in defense of legal actions, suits, or proceedings and appeals therefrom____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In Paragraph 6(a), under the heading \u201cNotice of Claim,\u201d the policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">If during the policy period ..., the Association or the Directors and Officers shall: (1) receive written or oral notice from any party that is the intention of such party to hold the Directors and Officers, or any of them, responsible for a specified Wrongful Act ..., the insured shall during such period give written notice thereof to the Company as soon as practicable and prior to the date of termination of the policy, then <em>any claim which may subsequently be made </em>against the Directors and Officers arising out of such Wrongful Act shall, for purposes of this policy, be treated as a claim made during the Policy Year in which such notice was given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The word \u201cclaim\u201d is not defined in Fidelity\u2019s policy. This fact does not, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">lead to the conclusion that the term is ambiguous. <em>See Hoyt v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>607 F.2d 864 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Bensalem Tp. v. Western World Ins. Co., </em>609 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>F.Supp. 1343, 1348 (E.D.Pa.1985). Ambiguities only exist where reasonably minded people have honest differences. <em>Eli Lilly [v. Home Insurance Co.], </em>482 N.E.2d [467,] 470 [ (Ind.1985) ]. The term claim is one of the commonest terms in the law. <em>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Hawaiian Ins. &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>2 Haw.App. 595, 637 P.2d 1146 (1981), <em>quoting </em>8 Bac. Abr., where Lord Coke said, \u201cthe word demand is the largest word in the law, except claim.\u201d The word claim is derived from the Latin word clarmor, \u201cmeaning a call or demand. In its ordinary sense the term imports the assertion, demand or challenge of something as of a right____\u201d <em>San Pedro Properties, Inc. v. Sayre &amp; Toso, Inc., </em>203 Cal.App.2d 750, 21 Cal.Rptr. 844 (1962), <em>quoting Supera v.

Dillon, Hardamon &amp; Cohen, </em>725 F.Supp. 1461, 1468 (N.D.Ind.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">All parties agree that the letters from Messrs. Trice, Robinson, Thieblot, and Frierson constituted, at least, notice of a claim within the meaning of Paragraph 6(a). Appellants go a step further, however, and contend that these letters constitute \u201cclaims\u201d in and of themselves. According to appellants, because \u201cclaims\u201d mentioned in the letters were averted or at least postponed due to expenditures by appellants of more than $500,000, Fidelity was obligated under its policy to reimburse them. Fidelity denied appellants coverage, because according to Fidelity, no \u201cclaim\u201d has been made as of the date of trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">The \u201cfirst principle of construction of insurance policies in Maryland is to apply the terms of the contract,\u201d <em>Mutual Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Ins. v.

The letter did not, however, demand money from appellants nor demand that appellants do anything except, in the case of certain officers, appear at a meeting to be held on May 13, 1985, and present \u201cwritten responses\u201d to the allegations set forth in the letter. Significantly, the appellants do not contend in their brief that the Trice letter constituted a \u201cclaim\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Appellants do contend, however, that the Robinson, Thieblot, and Fierson letters constituted \u201cactual claims.\u201d They argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">In the context of insurance, Webster\u2019s defines a \u201cclaim\u201d as \u201ca demand for something due or believed to be due ...\u201d Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 203 (G. &amp; C. Merriam Co.1981). Black\u2019s supplies a more technical legal definition of \u201cclaim\u201d: \u201c[t]o demand as one\u2019s own or as one\u2019s right; to assert; to urge; to insist. <em>Cause of action.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>224 (5th ed.1979) (emphasis sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>plied). \u201cCause of action\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he fact or facts which give a person a right to judicial relief ... [a] situation or state of facts which would entitle party to sustain action and give him right to seek a judicial remedy in his behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. <em>See also, Polychron v. Crum &amp; Forster Insurance Companies, </em>916 F.2d 461, 463 (8th Cir.1990). A lawsuit, as opposed to a claim, is a \u201csuit, action or <em>cause instituted or [pending] </em>... <em>in a court of law.\u201d </em>Black\u2019s at 799 (emphasis supplied). Therefore, according to the definitions of the relevant terms contained in Black\u2019s, it is clear that \u201cclaim\u201d includes the assertion of the relevant facts and legal theories that give rise to potential liability, whether or not the claim is formally filed in court. As the <em>Polychron </em>court noted, Black\u2019s does not normally supply the ordinary and accepted meaning of words. 916 F.2d at 463. However, in light of the definition in Webster\u2019s and the definitions in Black\u2019s, the Robinson, Thieblot and Frierson letters are clearly claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Using the <em>Webster\u2019s </em>definition, which is quite similar to the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d set forth by the Court of Appeals in <em>House, supra, </em>the three letters here at issue do not make \u201cclaims\u201d because the letter writers fail to make \u201ca demand for something due or believed to be due.\u201d Moreover, using the <em>Black\u2019s </em>definition of a claim, the three letter writers did not \u201cdemand [anything] as one\u2019s own or as one\u2019s right.\u201d Taken as a whole, the letters, at most, simply warn that claims were likely to be filed against Klein and other officers and directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Appellants\u2019 argument that letters warning of an intent to take legal action constituted a \u201cclaim\u201d against Klein (and others) is refuted by reading the policy as a whole. Paragraph 6(a) is a \u201cclaims after termination clause.\u201d Typically, such a clause</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">provides that if an insured becomes aware and gives notice to an insurer during the policy period of the occurrence of a specific wrongful act or if circumstances that could give rise to a claim, a claim subsequently made arising out of such wrongful act or circumstances will be deemed made \u201cduring the [p]olicy period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>In re Ambassador Group, Inc.

Paragraph 6(a) in Fidelity\u2019s policy plainly distinguishes between notice to the insurer that it is the intention of a party to hold an officer or director responsible for wrongful acts and \u201cclaims which may subsequently be made against the Directors and Officers\u201d for wrongful acts. Under Paragraph 6(a), <em>if </em>there is a notice of a potential claim given to the insurer within the policy period and <em>if </em>there later is a claim filed, the notice of potential claim shall be treated as a \u201cclaim made\u201d during the policy. If a \u201cclaim\u201d and a notice of the intention to make a claim were the same, then the claims after termination provision (Paragraph 6(a)) would be superfluous. As Judge Kaplan pointed out in his -written opinion, under Fidelity\u2019s D &amp; 0 policy, a \u201cclaim\u201d is not made merely by the insurer\u2019s receipt of notice that a party intends to hold a director or officer liable for a wrongful act. Several cases from other jurisdictions have reached a conclusion similar to that reached by Judge Kaplan.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In <em>MGIC Indem. Corp., supra, </em>a D &amp; O policy was issued. As in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the insurer agreed that, \u201cif during the policy period, any claim or claims are made against the Directors and Officers, individually or collectively, for Wrongful Acts, the Insurer -will pay in accordance with the terms of the policy, on behalf of the [Home State Savings] Association, all loss for which the Association is required to indemnify or for which the Association has, to the extent permitted by law, indemnified the Directors and Officers.\u201d 797 F.2d at 286. The definition of \u201closs\u201d set forth in the MGIC Indemnity Corporation policy was virtually identical to the definition set forth in the policy issued by Fidelity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>During the policy period, the Home State Savings Association (\u201cHome State\u201d) received loan commitment fees of more than $795,000. Some of the commercial customers who paid these fees, as well as a federal prosecutor, subsequently contended that the loan commitments received by the customers were illusory. <em>Id. </em>at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">An Assistant U.S. Attorney advised Home State that five of its officers were considered to be targets of a grand jury investigation then being conducted of Home State\u2019s activities. <em>Id. </em>Later a two-count information was filed against Home State charging it with having obtained loan commitments through fraudulent representations. <em>Id. A </em>plea bargain was proposed to Home State whereby it would repay $795,000 to its customers and plead <em>nolle contendr\u00e9 </em>to the charges. In exchange, the prosecutor agreed to forego seeking or pursuing criminal charges against any of Home State\u2019s individual officers. One of the main considerations that led Home State to accept the plea agreement was the agreement not to prosecute the officers individually. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">When Home State sued its insurer to recover $795,500 under its D <em>&amp; </em>O \u201cclaims made\u201d policy, the trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer. On appeal, one of the principal issues was whether Home State paid the $795,-000 for \u201cclaims made against the Officers and Directors for Wrongful Acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287. The <em>MGIC </em>Court noted that of critical importance was the fact that the insurer agreed to indemnify Home State only \u201cif, during the policy period, any claim or claims are made against the Directors and Officers for a Wrongful Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288. This exact provision is contained in the policy issued by Fidelity, and as aptly pointed out in <em>MGIC:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>The existence of claims \u201cof\u2019 wrongful acts does not of itself mean that claims were made against the officials \u201cfor\u201d the wrongful acts. </em>Home State failed to show that any such claim was made against any director or officer during the policy period, and we think it was incumbent on Home State to make such a showing, or to show a bona fide dispute as to whether such a claim had been made, if MGIC\u2019s summary judgment motion were to be defeated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">... Although \u201cclaim\u201d often means \u201ccontention,\u201d that is not the use to which it has been put in the insuring agreement. If claims were made in the newspapers that directors and officers of Home State engaged in wrongful acts, those would obviously not be the kind of \u201cclaims\u201d that could make MGIC liable under the insuring agreement. The agreement, as we read it, is speaking <em>not of a claim that wrongdoing occurred, but a claim for some discrete amount of money owed to the claimant on account of the alleged wrongdoing. </em>In context, it seems to us, the only kind of \u201cclaim or claims\u201d that could trigger the insurer\u2019s obligation to pay would be a demand for payment of some amount of money. Thus it is that the policy defines \u201closs\u201d in terms of an \u201camount\u201d \u2014 i.e., an amount of money \u2014 which amount the officials are legally obligated to pay or for which amount they have been indemnified or are required to be indemnified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">Home State suggests that there was a <em>potential </em>for demands against the officials for the payment of money, but a mere potential for such claims is not enough to meet the condition imposed by the policy. The agreement was that MGIC would pay if, during the policy period, \u201cclaims <em>are </em>made against the Directors and Officers.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) That condition is not satisfied, in our view, where claims might have been made during the policy period, but were not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 288 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The case of <em>In re Ambassador Group, Inc. Litigation, supra, </em>was one of the cases relied upon by Judge Kaplan when he concluded that no claim had been made against appellants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The case involved a D &amp; 0 policy issued by the National Union Fire Insurance Company (\u201cNational Union\u201d) to the Ambassador Group. The insuring clause in National Union\u2019s policy is identical (in all material respects) to that set forth in the policy issued by Fidelity. It provided that the insurer would pay \u201con behalf of\u2019 the directors and officers of the insured and its subsidiaries \u201closs ... arising from any claim or claims which are first made against the [directors or officers] dining the policy period by any Wrongful Act.\u201d The National Union policy had a Paragraph 7(c), which was a \u201cclaims after terminations\u201d clause similar to Paragraph 6(a) in Fidelity\u2019s policy. National Union\u2019s policy did not define the term \u201cclaim.\u201d At issue was whether letters to National Union from the Vermont Commission of Banking and Insurance, as receiver for the Ambassador Group, constituted a \u201cclaim\u201d under the policy. One letter advised the insurer that the \u201cCommissioner [h]ad uncovered facts which [led] him to conclude that certain former directors and officers were guilty of acts falling within the scope of coverage afforded by the ... policy, resulting in losses to the estate of the Ambassador [Group].\u201d <em>In re Ambassador Group, </em>830 F.Supp. at 151. What the Court said in the <em>Ambassador Group </em>opinion is here apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">The specific language of the notice provisions of the policy support this distinction between the making of a claim and the reporting of a claim made or a potential or inchoate claim. Section 7(b) provides that either the company or its directors and officers must, as a condition precedent to the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 right to be indemnified, give notice as soon as practicable of any claims made upon the directors and officers. Section 7(c) provides that if National Union is given written notice of an inchoate claim, the claim subsequently made will be deemed a claim made during the policy period. <em>Thus, the reporting of a claim or an inchoate claim by the company or the directors and officers must necessarily be something other than the making of the claim.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 154 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Later the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The policy distinguishes between claims made upon the Directors and Officers, notice to the Directors and Officers of the third party\u2019s intention to hold them responsible for the results of a specific Wrongful Act and the Directors and Officers\u2019 awareness of an occurrence which may subsequently give rise to a claim against them. Thus, the policy itself (referring to the Notice of Claim provision) confirms that neither notice to the Directors and Officers of \u00e1 third party\u2019s intention to make a claim nor awareness on the part of the Directors and Officers of an occurrence that may subsequently give rise to a claim is the equivalent of a claim having been made. There is something different from and antecedent to a claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\"><em>Evanston Insurance Co. v. Security Assurance Co., </em>715 F.Supp. 1405 (N.D.Ill.1989) is another case involving a D &amp; O policy with terms similar to those in the policy issued by Fidelity. The Court in <em>Evanston Insurance Co. </em>pointed out that, although the policy did not define \u201cclaim,\u201d the term \u201cheld no mystery.\u201d The Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">Clearly the Policy uses the term \u201cin its common (and common sense) usage: <em>an effort by a third party to recover money from the insured </em>\u201d <em>(id. [National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Continental Ill. Corp., </em>673 F.Supp. 300] at 307 n. 17 [(N.D.Ill.1987]).

What Security [the insured] was being told, in no uncertain terms, was that it would be held liable for any possible <em>future </em>damages flowing from its refusal to honor its commitment. But such a warning (or even threat) of a possible future suit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>at least framed in the way the communications went to Security, does not qualify as a present \u201cclaim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">715 F.Supp. at 1412-13 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In <em>Hill v.

Following the surgery, Hill was unable to move her right wrist and was without sensation in her right arm. <em>Id. </em>When Hill asked Dr. Steinway, immediately after the operation, \u201cif this was supposed to happen,\u201d Dr. Steinway said, \u201cNo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hill immediately told Dr. Steinway that she was dissatisfied with his work and, one month after the operation, discontinued her use of his services. <em>Id. </em>At issue in the <em>Hill </em>case was whether, Ms. Hill had made a \u201cclaim\u201d against Dr. Steinway within the policy period of Steinway\u2019s \u201cclaims made\u201d policy. The <em>Hill </em>Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">\u201cA claim, both in its ordinary meaning, and in the interpretation given to it by other courts in similar circumstances [citation], is a demand for something as a right, or as due.\u201d <em>(Phoenix Ins.

At no time during the policy period <em>did Hill demand Steinway perform a service owed her or compensate her in any way. </em>Although Hill asserts she was worried, frightened and terribly upset with the results of the surgery, she remained Steinway\u2019s patient for one month following surgery. During this time, Hill did not demand money or any specific remedy. <em>At most, she requested an explanation and expressed her disappointment. </em>Contrary to Hill\u2019s position, a <em>complaint is not an assertion of a right. </em>Moreover, the fact [that] Steinway may have been aware of Hill\u2019s injury is not sufficient to constitute a claim because <em>\u201c[a] claim connotes an assertion of a legal right, as distinguished from a recognition of that right.\u201d (Williamson &amp; Vollmer Engineering, Inc. v.

Thus, no claim was made against Steinway during the applicable policy period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 704-05 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In support of its contention that a threat to file suit of the type set forth in the Thieblot letter constitutes \u201cclaims\u201d within the meaning of the policy, appellant cites <em>Berry v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>70 F.3d 981 (8th Cir.1995) and <em>Polychron v. Crum &amp; Forster Ins. Cos., </em>916 F.2d 461 (8th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In <em>Berry, </em>unlike the present case, the insurance policy defined the word \u201cclaim.\u201d It was defined as meaning a \u201cdemand in which damages are alleged.\u201d As issue was whether a letter from an insured party\u2019s lawyer, dated July 1, 1988, constituted a \u201cclaim\u201d within the meaning of the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 982. The <em>Berry </em>Court discussed the attorney\u2019s letter by observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">We think this letter, fairly read, clearly qualified as a \u201cclaim.\u201d In the first place, the letter itself refers to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u201cProducts Liability Claim of Ronald D. Berry.\u201d It states that Berry\u2019s sustained personal injuries and disability are the result of the use of an Empire product, and that the letter should be forwarded to Empire\u2019s insurance company so that \u201cthe situation\u201d can be discussed before suit is filed. The letter does not state damages of a particular amount, but it does say that \u201cMr. Berry has sustained severe and permanent disability,\u201d and the inference that Mr. Berry\u2019s injuries and disability should be compensated in money is unmistakable. The letter is telling Empire that Mr. Berry has a claim, that the claim is Empire\u2019s responsibility, and that the claim should be referred to Empire\u2019s insurance company. Further, the reference to an attorney\u2019s lien presupposes the existence of a claim, because it is a claim to which the lien attached under state law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">It is argued, in opposition to this conclusion, that the letter was not a claim or demand, but merely a communication of a present legal right. <em>On this view, no claim would occur until Mr. Berry affirmatively brought suit or made a specific demand for payment. </em>We think the argument is strained. True, the letter does not request payment of a specific dollar amount, but sometimes complaints in actions actually filed in Court don\u2019t either, so this omission does not seem inconsistent with the letter\u2019s being treated as a \u201cclaim.\u201d Treating the letter as other than a claim, it seems to us, requires a tortured construction of its text. In our view, anyone receiving this letter would know that Mr. Berry was claiming that he was owed money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\"><em>Berry </em>is distinguishable from the case at hand in three ways. The Fidelity policy does not contain the definition set forth in the policy issued by the insurer in <em>Berry; </em>as far as is shown by the opinion, the <em>Berry </em>policy had no language similar to that set forth in Paragraph 6(a) of the Fidelity policy; and the letters here at issue do not, either explicitly or implicitly, demand money of appellants. To reiterate, both the Robinson and Fierson letters, by their terms, are letters sent pursuant to Paragraph 6(a) alerting the insurer of poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>tial claims. The Thieblot letter is in no way similar to the letter sent in <em>Berry. </em>The Thiebolt letter was neither addressed to the insured <em>nor does </em>it make any demand whatsoever. Although the Thieblot letter was forwarded to the insurer, it was sent by Thieblot\u2019s partner, not as a claim but to notify Fidelity of a potential claim, pursuant to Paragraph 6(a) of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">At issue in <em>Polychron, supra, </em>was whether a \u201cclaim\u201d was made against a bank president within the meaning of a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy. 916 F.2d at 463. The language in the bank\u2019s D &amp; 0 policy appears to be basically similar to that in Fidelity\u2019s policy. Mr. Polychron, as bank president, was the \u201ctarget\u201d of a grand jury investigation. <em>Id. </em>The grand jury, prior to the indictment of Mr. Polychron, subpoenaed bank records concerning the president\u2019s actions. Immediately after the bank\u2019s records were subpoenaed, Mr. Polychron hired an attorney who performed services for Mr. Polychron prior to the latter\u2019s indictment. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Polychron sought reimbursement from the insurer for fees paid to the attorney under the policy. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Polychron </em>Court interpreted the term \u201cclaim\u201d using a portion of the definition set forth in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, i.e., </em>\u201cto demand as one\u2019s own or as one\u2019s right, to assert; to urge; to insist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held that the term \u201cclaim\u201d was broad enough to encompass \u201cthe first grand jury investigation of Mr. Polychron\u201d and therefore the bank was entitled to recoup his attorney\u2019s fees. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">The function of a subpoena is to command a party to produce certain documents and therefore constitutes a \u201cclaim\u201d against a party. The subpoena, it is true, was directed to the bank, but the documents demanded (not merely requested, as defendants would have it) related to the plaintiffs conduct as a bank official. Further, the grand jury\u2019s investigation and the questioning by the Assistant United States Attorney amounted, as a practical matter, to an allegation of wrongdoing against Mr. Polychron, for which he prudently hired an attorney. The defendants\u2019 characterization of the grand-jury investigation as mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>requests for information and an explanation underestimates the seriousness of such a probe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">We have no quarrel with the result reached in <em>Polychron, </em>because using the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the term \u201cclaim\u201d that was set forth by the Maryland Court of Appeals in <em>House, supra, </em>the same result as in <em>Polychron </em>might well have been appropriately reached by a Maryland court. But unlike the grand jury subpoenas issued in <em>Polychron, </em>the three letters here at issue did not demand something of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In their reply brief, appellants say:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">At trial, [Fidelity\u2019s] corporate designee testified that \u201cclaims\u201d means \u201cLegal action, suits or proceedings.\u201d Similarly, the policy defines \u201cLoss\u201d to include amounts incurred in the defense of \u201clegal actions, suits or proceedings____\u201d Accordingly, F &amp; D admits that \u201cproceedings\u201d are claims, and that expenses incurred in defense of proceedings constitute Loss under the Policy. As [Fidelity\u2019s] corporate designee testified at trial, \u201cproceedings\u201d is not defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Klein and Middle States have previously noted that a Maryland statute supplied a definition for \u201cproceedings\u201d in the context of officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 liability for alleged wrongful acts or omissions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\">\u201cProceeding\u201d means any <em>threatened, </em>pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether <em>civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">Md.Code Ann., Corps. <em>&amp; </em>Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 2 \u2014 418(a)(6) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">The Robinson, Frierson and Thieblot correspondence, at a minimum, \u201cthreatened\u201d civil litigation against Klein and the other directors of Merritt.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">The record also shows that the Attorney General, Merritt\u2019s conservator, and the MSSIC all conducted detailed investigations into the activities of Merritt\u2019s directors. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>therefore dear that the State instituted proceedings, as defined by the statute, against Klein through its investigation and through all-but-certain litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">(Reference to record extract omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Later in the reply brief, appellants argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">Under this definition [of the word \u201cproceeding\u201d as defined in the Md.Code Ann., Corps. <em>&amp; </em>Ass\u2019ns], it is clear that the State instituted proceedings against the directors and officers of Merritt. Because [Fidelity] admits that \u201cproceedings\u201d are \u201cclaims,\u201d and that costs incurred in defense of such claims constitute \u201closs\u201d under the policy, [Fidelity] owes an indemnity obligation to Klein and to Middle States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">If we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the investigations by the Attorney General, Merritt\u2019s conservator, and the MSSIC were all \u201cproceedings\u201d within the meaning of the policy, appellants would still not prevail. Under the policy\u2019s definition of \u201closs,\u201d an insured may recover only expenses \u201cincurred in the defense of proceedings.\u201d Appellants did not prove that they expended one penny in defense of any of the investigations mentioned in the reply brief. They proved, instead, that they spent money in selling stock to Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">We conclude for the above reasons that Judge Kaplan correctly ruled that no \u201cclaim\u201d was made against appellants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">ISSUE II</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">UNJUST ENRICHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">Testimony showed that Fidelity\u2019s policy limits were three million dollars but approximately one-half of that amount had already been paid out prior to suit. Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Chase agreement, MDIF, a state agency, can still sue appellants, and such a claim would not be barred by limitations. Fidelity admitted at trial that, if covered claims were made against appellants by MDIF, defense costs would exceed the remaining policy limits. Thus, one of the benefits Fidelity obtained as a result of the Chase agreement was that it has had the use of one and one-half million dollars for over ten years, which it would not have had if MDIF had brought a claim covered by the D &amp; 0 policy. Moreover, due to the age of the potential claim, there is a possibility that MDIF will never bring suit against Fidelity\u2019s insured, which is another indirect benefit that Fidelity may have received as a result of the Chase Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">While it is clear that Fidelity probably did benefit from the Chase agreement, it is just as clear that appellants were not motivated to enter into the Chase agreement to benefit Fidelity. Rather, the prime motivation was that of self-interest, <em>i.e., </em>to prevent both criminal and civil actions against Klein and other officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The elements of a claim of unjust enrichment are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">1. a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">2. an appreciation or knowledge by the defendant of the benefit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">3. the acceptance or retention by the defendant of the benefit under such circumstances as to make it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without payment of it value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-10\"><em>Yost v. Early, </em>87 Md.App. 364, 386-87, 589 A.2d 1291, <em>cert. denied, </em>324 Md. 123, 596 A.2d 628 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Appellants argue that Fidelity is liable to them for the monies expended in regard to the Chase transaction as a \u201cquasi-contractual remedy\u201d under an unjust enrichment theory. As admitted by appellants, no Maryland appellate court has thus far decided whether an insured is entitled to restitution for preventive measures taken that benefit the insurer. In <em>W.M. Schlosser Co. v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>325 Md. 301, 310, 600 A.2d 836 (1992), the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The question is interesting, and determination of whether to grant restitution for preventative measures requires careful consideration of a number of factors. See the comprehensive discussion of a number of relevant factors by Judge Barry in <em>McNeilab, Inc. v. North River Ins. Co., </em>645 F.Supp. 525 (D.N.J.1986), <em>aff'd </em>831 F.2d 287 (3d Cir.1987), involving an unsuccessful attempt by the manufacturer of \u201cTylenol\u201d to recover from its liability insurance carrier $100,000,000 expended for the recall of the product following the death of seven persons who had ingested Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Language used by Judge Barry in the <em>McNeilab </em>case is instructive here. As he pointed out, \u201c[c]ertain commentators have suggested ... that based on a theory akin to unjust enrichment, recovery for [monies expended to prevent damages] ... might be had outside the explicit provisions of the policy, assuming, of course, that there be coverage for the potential damages averted.\u201d 645 F.Supp. at 547. When a plaintiff attempts to recover against an insurer under an unjust enrichment theory, then principles of restitution apply. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The <em>McNeilab </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">It is, indeed, a narrow line that must be walked in order to recover under a restitutionary theory. <em>The actor must be motivated in part by an interest in reward, or his actions will be altruistic, gratuitous, and uncompensible. </em>Plaintiffs recall was not at all motivated by <em>an interest in a reward from its insurers. </em>On the other hand, in most cases there can be no recovery if the actor\u2019s deeds are undertaken in self-interest (as opposed to interest in a reward recovery) for the actor has suffered no loss, i.e., he would have done the same thing even had the beneficiary possessed no interest in the object of the actor\u2019s efforts. This self-interest is evident here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\"><em>[The] Allocation of Costs [Theory] argues that an insured cannot be an officious intermeddler in the business of the insurer when he acts to mitigate damages to himself </em>This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>contention, too, can be disputed on two grounds. First, according to a noted expert in the field of restitution, courts have consistently denied attempts of all persons but lawyers who, simultaneously serving their own interests, seek to recover on a restitutionary theory from another whose interest was also served by their endeavors. Dawson, The Self-Serving Intermeddler, 87 Har.L.Rev. 1409, 144-50, 1457-58 (1974). See Restatement of Restitution 2d, Tentative Draft No. 1, \u00a7 21 Comment c (April 5, 1988). This conclusion is in line with the civil law precept denying recovery on negotiorum gestio when the benefactor\u2019s acts also benefit himself. Second, at least one recent case has held that an insured was an intermeddler vis-a-vis the insurer when he acted to mitigate damages for which the insurer might ultimately have been liable. See <em>J.L. Simmons Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co., </em>[84 Ill.App.2d 98], 228 N.E.2d 227.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 549 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">We agree with the <em>McNeilab </em>analysis. The sale of stock to Chase greatly benefitted appellants, as did the recall measures undertaken by the manufacturers of \u201cTylenol,\u201d which were discussed in <em>McNeilab. </em>Appellants negotiated the sale of the stock to Chase without ever telling Fidelity beforehand that they intended to seek reimbursement under the policy for sale expenses. Appellants\u2019 deeds and actions, like those of the plaintiff in <em>McNeilab, </em>were unquestionably motivated by self-interest as opposed to an interest in obtaining a reward from the insurer. Appellants are not entitled to restitution of the monies expended under an unjust enrichment theory because the \u201ccircumstances are not such as to make it inequitable for [the insurer] to retain the benefit without payment of the value.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>For all the above reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-13\">.

Do letters from third parties stating causes of action and threatening litigation that would have consumed a \u201cclaims-made\u201d Directors and Officers Liability Policy constitute a claim under the policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">II. In light of this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Luppino v. Vigilante Insurance Co., </em>holding that limitations does not begin to run until after an insured\u2019s obligation to pay becomes fixed upon the entry of a final judgment on the underlying claim, are the claims of the insured under a Directors and Officers Liability Policy barred by the Statute of Limitations where the underlying claims have never been litigated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-16\">III. Where insureds under a Directors and Officers Liability Policy have expended in excess of $500,000.00 to avoid cause of action that were within the coverage afforded by a Directors and Officers Liability Policy, do such expenditures constitute a \"loss\u201d requiring reimbursement under the policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-17\">IV. Is an insurer unjustly enriched where the timely actions of its insureds avoid defense costs and potential liability far in excess of policy limits?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\"><em>. </em>The issue presented in <em>House </em>was different from the issue in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>House, </em>the opinion provides little guidance in this case because in <em>House, </em>using the \"ordinary meaning\" of the term \"claims made,\u201d a claim was unquestionably made against the insured physician within the policy period. In <em>House, </em>a former patient of the insured had filed a claim against the insured with the Health Claims Arbitration Office during the policy period. What made the policy ambiguous in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>House </em>is that it had two conflicting provisions as to when a claim was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\">. The Fidelity's D &amp; O policy defined \"Loss\u201d as meaning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">(d) ... any amount which the Directors and Officers are legally obligated to pay or as to which the Association shall be required or permitted by law to indemnify the Directors and Officers for a claim or claims made against the Directors and Officers for Wrongful Act(s) and shall include damages, judgments, settlements and costs, charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>and expenses (excluding salaries of Officers or Employees of the Association) incurred in the defense of legal actions, suits or proceedings and appeals therefrom, and cost of attachment or similar bonds; provided, however, such Loss shall not include fines or penalties imposed by law, or matters which may be deemed uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this policy shall be construed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">. In ruling that \u201cno claim\u201d has thus far been made against appellants, Judge Kaplan gave one additional reason, with which we also agree. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-14\">Furthermore, because the mere threat of an action gives F &amp; D no way of determining if it is based upon acts which were excluded from coverage under the policy, it would be unreasonable to find that its obligation to indemnify became operative solely upon receipt of a letter threatening suit....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">. Additionally, appellants failed to prove that the monies were paid or expenses undertaken \"in an emergency situation\u201d a <em>sine qua non </em>for the application of restitution doctrine in cases such as this. If they had wished to do so, there was plenty of time, prior to the Chase Agreement, to tell Fidelity what monies they were spending and why. Appellants waited for more than one year after the agreement had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>signed to tell Fidelity what they had spent and that they claimed Fidelity had an (alleged) duty to reimburse those monies. <em>See McNeilab, supra, </em>645 F.Supp. at 548.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
