The trial court later struck the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on the Assault with Intent to Murder charge because the jury had entered a not guilty verdict on the underlying count of Attempted Murder. The court also struck two of the three counts relating to Use of a Handgun in the Commission of a Crime of Violence. Appellant was sentenced to a total of 50 years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">On appeal, appellant presents two issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">I. Whether the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to allow defense counsel to cross-examine two critical State witnesses with their prior written statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">II. Whether the trial court committed reversible error when it instructed the jury on two ultimate issues in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">The first issue presented requires us to decide whether a defendant is entitled to production of confidential statements made by police officers, which are not, and never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>were, in the possession of the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney. This is an issue of first impression in this State. Under the principles adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. 455, 397 A.2d 606 (1979), as well as <em>Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957), and the \u201cJencks Act,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1994), a defendant is entitled to production of a witness\u2019s prior statement if, <em>inter alia, </em>the prosecution or the prosecutorial arm of the government is in \u201cpossession\u201d of the statement. We hold that, when a statement is confidential under State law, developed for a non-prosecutorial purpose, and held by a division of a law enforcement agency that is not working in conjunction with the prosecutor, the State cannot be deemed to have access to, or constructive possession of, the statement. Hence, a defendant is not entitled to production of such statements under the Jencks-Curr<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">A. State\u2019s Version of Events</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">On January 18, 1996, two men in ski masks robbed a 7-11 store located on Walters Lane in Forestville, Maryland. The store closed at midnight. The robbery commenced at approximately 1:00 a.m. and concluded after 2:00 a.m. On duty that night were three female employees: Lang Tuy Luc, Anissa Abdurahim, and Lucinda Washington. Luc was emptying the trash when a man with a ski mask aimed a gun at her head, told her to \u201clay down or I kill you,\u201d and took money from her purse. The man who robbed Ms. Luc wore blue jeans, black sneakers, and a \u201cplaid\u201d shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Inside the store, another masked man forced the two other employees to lie on the floor. The men asked Washington and Abdurahim for the store\u2019s money. Washington told them it was in the safe, but they did not have a key. At this point, a gunman brought Luc into the store, tied her up, and left her in the store\u2019s office. Ultimately, the store\u2019s safe, which weighed about 250 pounds, was taken out of the store by the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Prince George\u2019s County Police received a 911 call alerting them that a robbery was in progress at the 7-11. Officers Christopher Smith and Samuel Hooper responded to the call in a marked police cruiser. After Officer Smith exited the police car, he saw two men in ski masks come out of the store and enter a Nissan Pathfinder, which spun its wheels and accelerated straight toward him. The police officers fired at the vehicle, and it skidded to a stop in a snowbank. Officer Hooper yelled at the occupants to place their hands out of the vehicle. One of the gunmen fired at Officer Smith. Officer Hooper, who was standing behind a telephone pole, slipped on the ice and slid parallel to the passenger side of the vehicle. Shots were fired at Officer Hooper from the Pathfinder\u2019s passenger window. Both officers returned fire. The passenger, Tyrone Glover, then surrendered without incident. Appellant Robinson exited the vehicle holding a gun in his hand. Officer Hooper commanded him to drop the gun, at which point Robinson \u201cbegan incoherently screaming and started pulling the trigger\u201d of his gun. The officers fired at Robinson, striking him four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">When the policemen approached Robinson, he was laying face down on the pavement. The gun was located near his right hand. Robinson\u2019s clothes were cut off in order to administer emergency assistance at the scene. A gun holster was found in his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">During a post-arrest search of the scene, the store\u2019s safe was found in the parking lot, as were some U.S. currency and some coins in wrapping tubes. From the front seat of the Pathfinder the police recovered $139.00 contained in coin tubes, which, according to Ms. Luc, were exactly \u201cthe same kind of tube\u201d used by 7-11. Also found on the front seat of appellant\u2019s truck were ninety-six Maryland lottery tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">B. Defendant\u2019s Version of Events</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Robinson was the lone defense witness. He adamantly denied that he knowingly played any role in the 7-11 robbery. Robinson testified that he was driving Tyrone Glover home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>when Glover asked him to stop at the 7-11. He waited in his Pathfinder while Glover went inside to get a soda and cigarettes. Appellant, while waiting, received a page and used the pay phone outside the store to respond to it. Glover then came out of the store and fumbled around in the Pathfinder, possibly looking for change. Glover went back inside the store, and Robinson got behind the steering wheel and waited. Glover then got back in the vehicle and said he was \u201cready.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">According to Robinson, as he drove from the parking lot several shots were fired at his truck from behind a snowbank. He did not know who was shooting at him, and he did not see the police officers or their car. One of the bullets hit the left front tire, he lost control of the vehicle on the ice and hit a snowbank. Robinson heard \u201csome guys\u201d telling him to get out of the truck. He and Glover attempted to get out, but the doors were stuck due to the snow. Before he could get his door open, several more shots were fired. When he managed to open the door, he exited the Pathfinder with his hands raised. He was told not to move. Robinson heard several additional shots, one of which hit him in the leg. He began to hop on one foot and saw Glover exit the truck. The \u201cguys\u201d again ordered him not to move. Appellant kept his hands up, but he heard more shots and was hit three more times. Appellant testified that \u201che had no idea\u201d where the police found the holster and denied that he had been armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Appellant testified that on the night of the robbery he wore blue jeans, black boots, and a multi-colored red flannel shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">C. Evidentiary Issues and Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Officer Smith, Smith testified that he had given a statement to the Internal Affairs Division of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department concerning the arrest of Robinson and Glover. Defense counsel did not, however, request a copy of the statement at any time during Officer Smith\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Later, when cross-examining Officer Hooper, defense counsel discovered that Officer Hooper had also provided a state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ment to the Internal Affairs Division. Defense counsel requested a bench conference. At the bench conference he contended that the defense was entitled to the internal affairs statements made by Officers Smith and Hooper. Defense counsel added that it was his understanding that witness statements were \u201cdiscoverable, but they [the prosecution] didn\u2019t have to hand them over until the witness ... had finished direct examination.\u201d Judge Spellbring responded that he did not think that such a rule applied to statements given to Internal Affairs. He asked defense counsel if he had any legal authority supporting the defendant\u2019s position. Defense counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> could not cite any authority but held his ground by, among other things, saying: \u201cI know it\u2019s the State\u2019s responsibility to give us exculpatory statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Judge Spellbring asked the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney whether she had attempted to get the internal affairs statements, and she responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">No, your Honor. I didn\u2019t even know that they made statements____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">It\u2019s my understanding that statements to the Internal Affairs Division are not the privy of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office either. That\u2019s an underlying policy____ They have to keep that investigation somewhat separate and apart from the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. Therefore, it\u2019s been my understanding that we don\u2019t receive those types of statements, and I have not received any in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Judge Spellbring instructed the prosecutor \u201cto inquire\u201d as to the availability of the statements \u201conly to determine whether there is anything exculpatory within them and for no other purpose at this point.\u201d He requested that counsel appear in chambers the next morning and that the officers\u2019 statements be made available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Present in chambers the next day were the prosecutor, defense counsel, and an Assistant County Attorney. The record does not indicate that the internal affairs statements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Officers Hooper and Smith were ever turned over to the prosecutor. Judge Spellbring placed the following on the record regarding the meeting in chambers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">[Defense Counsel\u2019s] position was that he was entitled to both the statements of Officer Smith and Officer Hooper to the Internal Affairs department. [The Assistant County Attorney\u2019s] position on behalf of the Police Department was that these matters were a part of the officers\u2019 personnel files and were not subject to production in this matter or any other matter. I made the decision that 1 would view the documents <em>in camera </em>to determine whether there was any exculpatory information in either of the statements. I have conducted that <em>in camera </em>review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">I have determined that there is no exculpatory information in either of those two statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The statements were not turned over to counsel, but the originals were filed, under seal, as exhibits for appeal purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">During the cross-examination of Officer Hooper, defense counsel began to inquire about details of the internal affairs investigation. After an objection by the State, a bench conference was convened at which the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">I\u2019m going to sustain the objection. But more than that, if this area is gone into by further interrogation or in final argument, I intend on my own to instruct this jury that I have viewed the statements, that these police officers were exonerated and that I have found the statements to be totally consistent with their testimony here today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Later, during the cross-examination of another witness, the defense attempted to inquire about the witness\u2019s trajectory analysis of the bullets that had left holes in the Pathfinder. This analysis apparently had been performed in relation to the internal affairs investigation. After an objection by the State, the court ruled that defense counsel could pursue this line of questioning but that it was going to instruct the jury in regard to the internal affairs investigation. Defense counsel responded that \u201cif that\u2019s what you think you have to do that\u2019s fine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>But I think that [it\u2019s] important that this gets examined.\u201d Thereafter, the court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">[L]adies and gentlemen of the jury, it\u2019s come out in this case that two matters are going on here. First, there is this case that is for you to consider; and secondly, there\u2019s the internal investigation by the police department which takes place every time a police officer fires his weapon. Just so there\u2019s no issue in this case, I have precluded evidence of the Internal Affairs investigation thus far. We\u2019re now into it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">I will tell you the Internal Affairs investigation cleared the two police officers. I will tell you that I have examined the two statements that were made by the two police officers to the Internal Affairs people and have found nothing in there that is exculpatory in this case. And for that reason neither the investigation nor those statements will be coming into this case. But now that the issue has been opened; .1 want the issue to be fully presented to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8R\">Defense counsel did not lodge an objection to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">After the State rested its case, but before the defense put forth its evidence, the jury sent the trial court a note asking it to \u201cPlease Define Exculp[a]tory.\u201d The court informed counsel that it intended to tell the jury \u201cit means free from guilt.\u201d Defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>court then instructed the jury that exculpatory means, \u201cin the legal sense ... free from guilt. It\u2019s the opposite of guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">At the outset, it is important to note what is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the United States Supreme Court held that the government must turn over evidence to the accused, if the evidence is both favorable to the accused and material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Appellant does not contend that the government failed to provide him with exculpatory Brady-type material. Instead, appellant\u2019s brief focuses exclusively on the issue of whether Judge Spellbring\u2019s failure to turn over the officer\u2019s statements violated the Jencks-Carr rule. In this regard, the failure to rely on <em>Brady </em>and its progeny is understandable in light of the Supreme Court decision in <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987), which, in at least some respects, is markedly similar to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Ritchie was accused of various sexual offenses against his thirteen-year-old daughter. Prior to trial, Ritchie subpoenaed the file of a child protective agency (\u201cthe agency\u201d) that had investigated the child abuse charges. 480 U.S. at 43, 107 S.Ct. at 994. The agency resisted the subpoena based on a Pennsylvania statute that, with eleven exceptions, mandated that reports and other information obtained by the agency in the course of their investigation be kept confidential. <em>Id. </em>One of the exceptions was that the agency could disclose information in their files to courts of competent jurisdiction \u201cpursuant to a court order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43-44, 107 S.Ct. at 994. The trial judge refused to release the records to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 44, 107 S.Ct. at 994. The main witness against Ritchie at trial was his daughter. <em>Id. </em>Ritchie was convicted, but, on appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Pennsylvania Supreme Court vacated the conviction and remanded the case to determine if a new trial was necessary. 509 Pa. 357, 502 A.2d 148 (1985). It concluded that the trial court had violated the Confrontation Clause and the Compulsory Process Clause of the United States Constitution and that Ritchie\u2019s lawyer was entitled to review the agency\u2019s entire file to search for any useful evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 46, 107 S.Ct. at 995. The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>and observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arv\">Although we recognize that the public interest in protecting this type of sensitive information is strong, we do not agree that this interest necessarily prevents disclosure in all circumstances. This is not a case where a state statute grants CYS the absolute authority to shield its files from all eyes. Cf. 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 5945.1(b) (1982) (unqualified statutory privilege for communications between sexual assault counselors and victims). Rather, the Pennsylvania law provides that the information shall be disclosed in certain circumstances, including <em>when CYS is directed to do so by court order. </em>Pa. Stat. Ann., Title 11, \u00a7 2215(a)(5) (Purdon Supp.1986). Given that the Pennsylvania Legislature contemplated some use of CYS records in judicial proceedings, we cannot conclude that the statute <em>prevents all disclosure in criminal prosecutions. </em>In the absence of any apparent state policy to the contrary, we therefore have no reason to believe that relevant information would not be disclosed when a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the information is \u201cmaterial\u201d to the defense of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT_\"><em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 107 S.Ct. at 1001-02 (emphasis added)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">A plurality of the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to remand the case; however, it ruled that Ritchie\u2019s lawyer was not entitled to review the agency\u2019s file. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Ritchie </em>Court held that the trial judge should review the file \u201cto determine whether it contained information that probably would have changed the outcome of ... [Ritchie\u2019s] trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">A defendant\u2019s right to discover exculpatory evidence does not include the unsupervised authority to search through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the Commonwealth\u2019s files. See <em>United States v. Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. [667], at 675, 105 S.Ct. [3375], at 3380 [87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985)]; <em>United States v. Agurs, supra, </em>427 U.S. [97], at 111, 96 S.Ct. [2392], at 2401 [49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976)]. Although the eye of an advocate may be helpful to a defendant in ferreting out information, <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 855, 875, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 1851, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966), this Court has never <em>held </em>\u2014 even <em>in the absence of a statute restricting disclosure </em>\u2014 that <em>a defendant alone may make the determination as to the materiality of the information. Settled practice is to the contrary. In the typical case where a defendant makes only a general request for exculpatory material under Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), it is the State that decides which information must be disclosed. Unless defense counsel becomes aware that other exculpatory evidence was withheld and brings it to the court\u2019s attention, the prosecutor\u2019s decision on disclosure is final. Defense counsel has no constitutional right to conduct his own search of the State\u2019s files to argue relevance. See <em>Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 559, 97 S.Ct. 837, 846, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977) (\u201cThere is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady did not create one\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 59-60, 107 S.Ct. at 1002 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">At bottom, in regard to the discovery issue, Judge Spell-bring followed the procedure recommended in <em>Ritchie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Appellant asserts that the trial judge erred by refusing to grant appellant\u2019s request for production of the officers\u2019 statements to the Internal Affairs Division following the State\u2019s direct examination of Officer Hooper. According to appellant, under <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. 455, 397 A.2d 606 (1979), and <em>Leonard v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 631, 421 A.2d 85 (1980), <em>aff'd, </em>290 Md. 295, 429 A.2d 538 (1981), a defendant is entitled, for cross-examination purposes, to inspect prior statements made by the State\u2019s witnesses. Appellant contends that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>judge erred by concluding that the statements were producible only if they contained exculpatory material.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The State counters that appellant failed to preserve this issue as to Officer Smith\u2019s statement. In regard to Officer Hooper\u2019s statement, the State argues that the records of the internal affairs investigation were confidential and only subject to disclosure, if at all, pursuant to the Maryland Public Information Act. Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7\u00a7 10-611 to 10-628 (1995 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In <em>Carr v. State, </em>the Court of Appeals held that, for cross-examination purposes, defense counsel is, under certain circumstances, entitled to inspect prior statements of the State\u2019s witnesses. <em>Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 582-83, 530 A.2d 743 (1987), <em>vacated, </em>486 U.S. 1050, 108 S.Ct. 2815, 100 L.Ed.2d 916, <em>aff'd in part and vacated on other grounds, </em>314 Md. 111, 549 A.2d 17 (1988). By so holding, the Court adopted the underlying principles set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957). <em>See Chief, Montgomery County Dep\u2019t of Police v. Jacocks, </em>50 Md.App. 132, 139, 436 A.2d 930 (1981) (by judicial decision, Maryland courts have adopted the underlying principles in <em>Jencks v. United </em>States). In <em>Jencks, </em>353 U.S. at 668, 77 S.Ct. at 1013, the Supreme Court held that, in criminal cases, after a witness has testified on direct examination for the prosecution and upon motion by the defense, the prosecution must produce for inspection all written reports or statements made by the witness concerning the subject matter of the testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Three months after the <em>Jencks </em>decision was filed Congress enacted the \u201cJencks Act,\u201d codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1994), which clarified and limited the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jencks. See Jones, </em>310 Md. at 584, 530 A.2d 743; <em>Jacocks, </em>50 Md.App. at 139, 436 A.2d 930; James C. Cissell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>Federal Criminal Trials </em>\u00a7 8-1 (4th ed. 1996). Although the Maryland Legislature has not enacted a counterpart to the \u201cJencks Act,\u201d Maryland courts have looked to the Act, as well as subsequent analysis and interpretation of the statute, for guidance in interpreting the proper parameters of the <em>Carr </em>decision. <em>See Jones, </em>310 Md. at 569, 530 A.2d 743; <em>Kanaras v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 568, 577, 460 A.2d 61 (1983) (Maryland courts have \u201cimplicitly accepted the underlying foundations\u201d of the Jencks Act \u201cwithout adopting wholesale the rules contained therein\u201d); <em>see, e.g., Bruce v.

Thus, in order for a defendant to receive a witness\u2019s prior statement under the Jencks Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">1) the witness must testify on direct examination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">2) defense counsel must request the statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>3) the statement must qualify as a discoverable statement under the Jencks Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">4) the statement must relate to the subject matter of the witness\u2019s testimony; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">5) the statement must be in the possession of the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Regarding Officer Smith\u2019s prior statement, appellant has failed to preserve the <em>Jencks-Carr </em>issue for our review because appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not make a timely request for the statement. Although appellant\u2019s trial counsel knew of the statement\u2019s existence, he did not seek its production at any time during the cross-examination of Officer Smith. It was not until the cross-examination of Officer Hooper that appellant actually requested the Smith statement. Therefore, contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the trial court never prevented the defense from using the statement to cross-examine Officer Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel did, however, make a timely request for Officer Hooper\u2019s statement during his cross-examination. Moreover, neither party disputes that Officer Hooper\u2019s statement qualifies as a discoverable \u201cstatement\u201d under <em>Jencks </em>or that it relates to the subject matter of Officer Hooper\u2019s testimony on direct. Thus, the only issue before us is whether appellant met the fifth requirement of the Jencks-Carr rule, i.e., that the statement was in the possession of the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney. Material to the possession issue is a determination as to whether Officer Hooper\u2019s statement to the Internal Affairs Division is confidential under State law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Section 728(b) of the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (LEOBR), codified at Maryland Annotated Code, article 27, sections 727 to 734B (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), mandates that whenever \u201ca law-enforcement officer is under investigation or subject to interrogation by a law-enforcement agency, for any reason which could lead to disciplinary action, demotion or dismissal, the investigation or interrogation shall be conducted\u201d in accordance with the LEOBR. Officer Hooper\u2019s statement to the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department Internal Affairs Division, given as a result of a direct order to answer questions about the performance of his duties, is, therefore, covered under the LEOBR.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Under LEOBR sections 728(b)(5)(iii) and (iv), the only person outside the Internal Affairs Division entitled to see the contents of an investigatory file is the law enforcement officer under investigation. <em>See Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Maryland Comm. Against the Gun Ban, </em>329 Md. 78, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>90, 617 A.2d 1040 (1993) (subject of an internal affairs investigation is the officer on whom the investigation is focused). The LEOBR does not make any provision for any additional persons to obtain access to such files. Moreover, even the officer cannot obtain any part of the file unless he or she executes a confidentiality agreement with the law enforcement agency conducting the investigation, promising not to disclose any of the material contained in the record \u201cfor any purpose other than to defend the officer.\u201d Md. Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 728(b)(5)(iv)l. Once the confidentiality agreement is signed, the officer is entitled to receive only exculpatory information in the investigatory file. As a general rule, officers are precluded from obtaining non-exculpatory information or the identity of confidential sources. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 728(b)(5)(iii). <em>But see </em>note 7, <em>infra, </em>and <em>Jacocks, </em>50 Md.App. 132, 436 A.2d 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In <em>Maryland Committee, </em>329 Md. at 84, 617 A.2d 1040, the Court stated that LEOBR sections 728(b)(5)(iii) and (iv) demonstrate that there \u201cis a public interest in the confidentiality of investigations of police officers.\u201d The strict disclosure requirements in the aforementioned sections also demonstrate that, by enacting these provisions, the Legislature intended to maintain the confidentiality of these investigatory records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We, therefore, hold that a statement made to the Internal Affairs Division by a police officer under investigation is confidential under the LEOBR.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Federal courts have construed the Jencks Act requirement that the prosecution produce \u201cany statement ... of the witness in the possession of the United States\u201d to mean that the statement must be in the possession of the <em>prosecutorial arm </em>of the government. <em>See United States v. Trevino, </em>556 F.2d 1265, 1271 (5th Cir.1977); <em>United States v.

Some courts have further interpreted the \u201cin the possession\u201d language to mean that a prosecutor must disclose statements to which the prosecutor has \u201caccess\u201d but does not have actual physical possession. <em>Trevino, </em>556 F.2d at 1272; <em>Dansker, </em>537 F.2d at 61; <em>see also United States v.

Watson, </em>173 W.Va. 553, 318 S.E.2d 603, 609 (1984) (citing <em>Trevino </em>with approval and holding that a prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>cuting attorney \u201chas possession of grand jury transcripts by virtue of his access to them\u201d under the West Virginia Rules of Criminal Procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In <em>Dansker, </em>537 F.2d at 60, the defendant had requested production of a pre-sentence report containing statements made to the probation department by a witness. The Third Circuit held that the lower court did not err by refusing to turn over the statements to the defendant. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">In speaking of statements \u201cin the possession of the United States,\u201d we understand the statute to require production only of statements possessed by the prosecutorial arm of the federal government. Hence, such statements possessed by, for example, the F.B.I. or a United States Attorney must be turned over to the defense on proper motion. A pre-sentence report and statements contained therein, however, are not within the possession of the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfZV\"><em>Id. </em>at 61. The court pointed out that a pre-sentence report is a confidential document, to which the prosecution has only limited access under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c); the report is prepared at the direction of the court by the probation department, which acts \u201cas an arm of the court in such preparation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">In <em>United States v. Trevino, </em>556 F.2d at 1271, the Fifth Circuit held that a statement is only in \u201cthe possession of the United States\u201d if it is in the hands of the \u201cprosecutorial division\u201d of the government. Thus, a pre-sentence report in the control of a probation officer was not in the hands of the federal prosecutor. The court stressed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUG\">that <em>neither the prosecutor nor any governmental unit aligned with him in the prosecution can have possession of or access to </em>a presentence report [held by the probation officer].... Were we considering some type of report held by an arm of the government other than the probation officer \u2014 an investigative agency for example \u2014 different questions would be presented, those concerning the prosecutor\u2019s duty to disclose material not technically within his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>possession but to which he has ready access.... Certainly the prosecutor would not be allowed to avoid disclosure of evidence by the simple expedient of leaving relevant evidence to repose in the hands of another agency while utilizing his access to it in preparing his case for trial____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1272 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Assistant County Attorney represented to the trial judge that the statements of Officers Hooper and Smith were in the possession of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department Internal Affairs Division. He took the position that the statements were not \u201csubject to production in this matter or any other matter.\u201d The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney represented that she did not know of the statements prior to trial, nor did she have physical possession of the officers\u2019 statements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s representation was not rebutted by appellant. Thus, even if the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney wanted to obtain copies of the statements, she apparently could not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Appellant argues that the county police are part of the investigatory arm of the State of Maryland. This is not true as to all parts of the police department. The Prince George\u2019s County Police Department cannot be viewed as a monolith \u2014 it has divisions that, at least for some purposes, are separate and distinct. Under such circumstances, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office does not constructively possess all statements held by all divisions of the police department. To know if the State constructively possesses a document, it must be determined whether the division of the police department that holds the document is working in concert with the prosecutor. If so, the State can be deemed to have access to, or constructive possession of, the document. <em>Butler v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 345, 359-60, 667 A.2d 999 (1995); <em>see Trevino, </em>556 F.2d at 1272; <em>Dansker, </em>537 F.2d at 61 (statements possessed by the F.B.I. are considered to be in the possession of the prosecutorial arm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>of the federal government). In contrast, if there is no evidence that the two entities are working in tandem, the State cannot be deemed to have constructive possession of any documents in the other entity\u2019s control. <em>See Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. at 726, 569 A.2d 1254; <em>see also United States v. Moeckly, </em>769 F.2d 453, 463 (8th Cir.1985)(Jencks Act does not apply to statements made to state officials when there is \u201cno joint investigation or cooperation with federal authorities\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>476 U.S. 1104, 106 S.Ct. 1947, 90 L.Ed.2d 357 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Bruce, </em>318 Md. at 726, 569 A.2d 1254, ruled, in a case examining the Jencks-C'owr rule, that statements made by a witness to police officers in New York did not have to be turned over to defense counsel by the Maryland prosecutor. The Court pointed out that several federal decisions have held that \u201c \u2018statements\u2019 in possession of state authorities are not \u2018in possession of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725-26, 569 A.2d 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We acknowledge that frequently two completely separate entities, such as a police department and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, work in tandem to prosecute a defendant. <em>See Butler, </em>107 Md.App. at 360, 667 A.2d 999. For example, in <em>Butler, </em>107 Md.App. at 359-60, 667 A.2d 999, we held that because the local police department had worked in close coordination with the F.B.I., the report of the F.B.I. agent should have been turned over to the defense. Similarly, when the crime fighting arm of the local police department works with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to prosecute a crime, police reports developed by the police for prosecutorial purposes must be turned over to the defendant under Jencks-Carr. <em>See id. </em>at 360, 667 A.2d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The document sought by appellant was not prepared for prosecutorial purposes. When the Internal Affairs Division of the police department conducts an investigation into a shooting by one of its officers, it is not acting in conjunction with the prosecutorial arm of the government. The aim of the investigation is not to bring criminal charges against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>officer(s) or anyone else. Rather, the Internal Affairs Division\u2019s goal is to ensure that the county police department\u2019s procedures regarding use of firearms are being followed to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In the instant case, there is no evidence in the record of cooperation or interface between the Internal Affairs Division of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department and the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney. There was no proof that the prosecutor could get the document from the police department upon request. It was only after the trial judge demanded that the statement be made available to him in chambers that the Assistant County Attorney turned the statement over to the court for its <em>in camera </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Because Officer Hooper\u2019s statement was confidential under State law, prepared for non-prosecutorial purposes, and held by a division of the police department that was not working in conjunction with the prosecutor, the State did not have possession of the document under the Jencks-Ccwr rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Appellant argues that the trial judge erred when he, <em>sua </em>sponte, told the jury that 1) the Internal Affairs Division of the police department had cleared the two officers and 2) there was nothing in the statements of Officers Hooper or Smith that was \u201cexculpatory in this case.\u201d Appellant contends that the trial judge\u2019s instructions were \u201ctantamount to instructing the jury on the ultimate issue of Mr. Robinson\u2019s guilt or innocence,\u201d and that the instruction usurped the jury\u2019s role of deciding defendant\u2019s fate.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Maryland Rule 4-325(e) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">It is a fundamental proposition, \u201cthat appellate review of a jury instruction will not [ordinarily] be permitted unless the appellant has objected seasonably so as to allow the trial judge an opportunity to correct the deficiency before the jury retires to deliberate.\u201d <em>Bowman v. State, </em>837 Md. 65, 67, 650 A.2d 954 (1994). Before the court gave the instruction about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>which appellant now complains, appellant\u2019s counsel commented that it was \u201cf\u00edne\u201d with him. Consistently, appellant\u2019s counsel did not thereafter object to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Appellant did, however, make a timely objection to the court\u2019s later instruction regarding the definition of \u201cexculpatory.\u201d Appellant asserts that his objection to the definition of exculpatory was broad enough to preserve for our review the issue of the earlier instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Appellant\u2019s objection that he did not \u201cthink the [cjourt should give the type of instruction as to exculpatory\u201d is clearly not an objection to the original instruction concerning the results of the internal affairs investigation. Rule 4-325(e) requires that a party object \u201cpromptly\u201d and state distinctly the \u201cmatter to which the party objects and the grounds for the objection.\u201d Appellant failed to do either.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Appellant further argues that, under <em>Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 209, 522 A.2d 1338 (1987), he substantially complied with Rule 4-325(e). In <em>Gore, </em>the Court of Appeals explained that, to comply substantially with Rule 4-325(e),</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">there must be an objection to the instruction; the objection must appear on the record; the objection must be accompanied by a definite statement of the ground for objection unless the ground for objection is apparent from the record and the circumstances must be such that a renewal of the objection after the court instructs the jury would be futile or useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\"><em>Id. </em>As previously indicated, appellant never made any objection relating to the initial instruction dealing with the internal affairs investigation. Therefore, he did not substantially comply with Rule 4-325(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Appellant also argues that, even if his trial counsel did not properly object to the instruction concerning the internal affairs investigation, the trial court\u2019s instruction constitutes \u201cplain error\u201d meriting our discretionary review under Rule 4-325(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The plain error doctrine will only be recognized if the court\u2019s error deprived appellant of his right to a fair trial. <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 588, 602 A.2d 677 (1992). Under Rule 4-325(e), the decision to review and correct plain error lies purely within the discretion of the appellate court. Our discretion is to be exercised only when the error complained of was \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional, or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035 (1980). In our previous cases, we have emphasized that the plain error exception is \u201cvery limited\u201d and that appellate discretion to decline to recognize such error is plenary. <em>Austin v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 254, 257, 600 A.2d 1142 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, what the trial judge told the jury was not \u201ctantamount to instructing the jury on the ultimate issue of [appellant\u2019s] guilt____\u201d The trial judge did not tell the jury that they should believe the officers. He told them that nothing that the officers told internal affairs was exculpatory \u2014 from appellant\u2019s viewpoint.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is hardly surprising inasmuch as nothing the officers said at trial was helpful to appellant either. In any event, in his instructions at the conclusion of the case, the trial judge told the jury that they were the sole judge of whether any witness should be believed or disbelieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Admittedly, the statement that the police department\u2019s Internal Affairs Division had \u201ccleared the two officers\u201d was potentially prejudicial to appellant because the jury could have inferred from this statement that the police department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>investigators believed the officers when they said they fired at appellant only in self-defense. The ultimate outcome of this case, however, proves that there was no possibility of actual prejudice to appellant even if such an inference was drawn by the jury. Appellant was not convicted of any crime concerning the police officers\u2019 testimony that they shot at appellant because he aimed a gun at them or tried to kill them by attempting to run them down with his Pathfinder. All of his convictions related to crimes committed inside the 7-11 or in the back of the store where store clerk Lang Tuy Luc was robbed. Proof of appellant\u2019s guilt of those earlier crimes was overwhelming. He, therefore, was not denied a fair trial. Under these circumstances, we decline to exercise our plenary discretion to entertain the merits of appellant\u2019s complaints regarding the portion of the court\u2019s instructions to which no objection was made. <em>Stockton v. </em>State, 107 Md.App. 395, 398, 668 A.2d 936 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 116, 673 A.2d 707 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The appellant also objects to the court\u2019s instruction in which it defined \u201cexculpatory.\u201d We find no error in the trial court\u2019s statement that exculpatory means \u201cin the legal sense ... free from guilt.

The mere fact that a document is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>privileged does not mean that a defendant is automatically entitled to it under the <em>Jencks-Carr </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"A2q\">At least one court has determined that a confidential document, even if it is in the prosecutor's possession, does not necessarily have to be turned over to the defense for impeachment purposes. <em>See United States v. Figurski, </em>545 F.2d 389 (4th Cir.1976). In <em>Figurski, </em>the Fourth Circuit set forth a test for determining whether a confidential presentence report should be disclosed. The court stated that the \"basic issue is one of materiality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYn\">If the report contains exculpatoty material, that part of the report must be disclosed. If the report contains only material impeaching the witness, disclosure is required only when there is a reasonable likelihood of affecting the trier of fact. Whether there is such a likelihood depends upon a number of factors such as the importance of the witness to the government's case, the extent to which the witness has already been impeached, and the significance of the new impeaching material on the witness' credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"AapY\"><em>Id. </em>at 391-92. According to the court, if defense counsel requests disclosure of a confidential report, the district court should examine the report <em>\u201cin camera </em>and disclose only those portions\u201d that meet the aforementioned test. <em>Id. </em>at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"AJO\">In the case at hand, we carefully reviewed Officer Hooper\u2019s statement to internal affairs, and we agree with the trial court's finding that it contains no exculpatory information. Moreover, we compared the statement with Officer Hooper\u2019s trial testimony, and the statement does not conflict with his testimony at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b294-5\">. In <em>Maryland Committee, </em>329 Md. at 83 n. 2, 617 A.2d 1040, the Court of Appeals, while discussing the requirements of the Maryland Public Information Act, stated that \"if the Act does not require inspection [of police records], then the common law rule applies under which it is generally held that police records are confidential. <em>Whittle v. Munshower, </em>221 Md. 258, 261 [155 A.2d 670] (1959)[, <em>cert. denied, </em>362 U.S. 981, 80 S.Ct. 1069, 4 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1960) ].\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">. Our holding in <em>Jacocks, </em>50 Md.App. 132, 436 A.2d 930, does not contradict our determination that, under the LEOBR, a statement to internal affairs by an officer under investigation is confidential. In <em>Jacocks, </em>we held that statements given to internal affairs by persons who ultimately testify against the officer, at the administrative hearing, must be produced under Jencks principles. <em>Id. </em>at 143-44, 436 A.2d 930. We determined that those portions of a witness's statement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>inlernal affairs \u201cpertaining to matters about which he testified\u201d must be disclosed to the officer who is the subject of the investigation and administrative hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 436 A.2d 930. Thus, these statements were only disclosed to the party in interest, i.e., the law enforcement officer under investigation, in the context of an administrative hearing against him. No statement made by the officer, under the LEOBR, was ordered disclosed to any other party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\">. Appellant did not suggest in either the trial court or on appeal that the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney ever had physical possession of the statements of Officers Hooper and Smith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">. When dealing with the government\u2019s failure to turn over exculpatory <em>Brady </em>type evidence, it would not matter that the prosecutor did not know that other governmental agents possessed such evidence. <em>Barbee </em>v. <em>Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, </em>331 F.2d 842 (4th Cir., 1964). Barbee was charged with the shooting of Donald Fisher, a Baltimore police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 843. At his trial, three witnesses were shown a 32 caliber revolver, which Barbee admitted he owned. <em>Id. </em>at 843-44. These witnesses were unable to identify the revolver positively, but all said it was \"similar\u201d to the one used by the gunman who shot the officer. <em>Id. </em>Unbeknownst to the prosecutor, or Barbee's trial attorney, the police had performed ballistic tests on Barbee\u2019s gun that proved it was not the weapon used in the shooting of Officer Fisher. Barbee was convicted, but in post-conviction proceedings the ballistic reports came to light and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Barbee was entitled to a new trial. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">Nor is the effect of the nondisclosure neutralized because the prosecuting attorney was not shown to have had knowledge of the exculpatory evidence. Failure of the police to reveal such material evidence in their possession is equally harmful <em>to </em>a defendant whether the information is purposely, or negligently, withheld. And it makes no difference if the withholding is by officials other than the prosecutor. The police are also part of the prosecution, and the taint on the trial is no less if they, rather than the State\u2019s Attorney, were guilty of the nondisclosure. If the police allow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>State's Attorney to produce evidence pointing to guilt without informing him of other evidence in their possession which contradicts this inference, state officers are practicing deception not only on the State's Attorney but on the court and the defendant. <em>'The cmelest lies are often told in silence.' If the police silence as to the existence of the reports resulted from negligence rather than guile, the deception is no less damaging.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A95\">The duty to disclose is that of the state, which ordinarily acts through the prosecuting attorney; but if he too is the victim of police suppression of the material information, the state\u2019s failure is not on that account excused. We cannot condone the attempt to connect the defendant with the crime by questionable inferences which might be refuted by undisclosed and unproduced documents then in the hands of the police. To borrow a phrase from Chief Judge Biggs, this procedure passes 'beyond the line of tolerable imperfection and falls into the field of fundamental unfairness.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Av6I\"><em>Id. </em>at 846 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\">. Appellant\u2019s trial counsel apparently did not believe that what internal affairs found was of any great importance. At one point in his closing argument he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">[T]here was one statement about the police that was made and they were exonerated. I don\u2019t give a rip what the police did in their Internal Affairs\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">You are the people who are meant to judge this case, not anybody else---- You were picked from the community, twelve people at random and not somebody on the police force or anything like that.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
