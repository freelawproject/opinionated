The indictment is clearly insufficient. The pawn-ticket-set forth contains no words of contract. Nothing is predicated of any person or any thing. It does not purport to be the act of any person. Nor does it purport to create, increase, discharge, diminish or affect any pecuniary demand or obligation or any rights or property. It is a mere memorandum,\u2014 an incomplete instrument. And there are no averments in the indictment to make it good. <em>Cunningham </em>v. People, 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Hun, 455 ; <em>People </em>v. Harrison, 8 Barb. 560 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shall, </em>9 Cow., 778 ; <em>People </em>v. Fadner, 2 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 558.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-4\">II. No averment in the indictment, of extrinsic matters, would cure the defect. (a.) The definition of forgery by our statute (Pen. Code, \u00a7 511) is much narrower than the common law definition. At common law, a forgery may be of any writing. But by our statute, the writing must be or purport to be \u201c the act of another,\u201d and it seems by \u00a7 513 that it must have a signature. (5.) The instrument in question belongs to a class of instruments in very general use, and known to the law as \u201c tokens.\u201d Of this kind are bread tickets,, milk tickets, tickets of admission to theatres and other places of public amusement, Such tokens are not complete legal instruments. Their purpose is to identify, by their possession the person who is entitled, by virtue of such possession, to certain rights, or property. A pawn ticket thus serves to identify the pledgor and the article pledged, when application is made for its redemption. To obtain property by a false token is defined and punished as larceny by \u00a7 528 of the Penal Code, (c.) A railway ticket of the character commonly used, is a token of this kind. Such tickets ordinarily contain certain words and figures expressing in brief that the holder is entitled to a passage between certain points, but do not generally contain a complete contract. Such a ticket certainly is an instrument of as high character in law as a pawn-ticket. Postage and revenue stamps furnish another illustration of papers which, by law and usage, serve as evidence of contract, but are not complete contracts upon their face. But by \u00a7\u00a7 516 and 517 of the Penal Code, the forgery of railway tickets and postage and revenue stamps is made forgery in the <em>third </em>degree. Any train of reasoning by which the general definition of \u00a7 511 can be made to include a pawn-ticket, would also make the same definition include a railway ticket and a postage stamp. But since the Legislature has seen fit specially to provide for the case of railway tickets and postage stamps, and has defined the false making of them to be forgery in the <em>third </em>degree, it seems to follow that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u25a0did not intend the general clause in \u00a7 511 to cover the case of railway tickets and stamps. And by parity of reasoning, it follows that they did not intend that general clause to include the numerous other tokens which are in common use, which are not complete instruments and which derive all their validity from custom and usage. The use of false tokens of this character for the purpose of fraud is otherwise punished. (cZ.) By our statute of frauds \u201c every agreement that by its terms is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof shall be void, unless such agreement, or some memorandum thereof be in writing, and <em>subscribed by the party to be charged </em>therewith.\u201d This pawn-ticket seems to come within the statute. Upon its face it is \u201c good for one year,\u201d that is, the contract of which it is a memorandum, is not to be performed <em>within </em>one year. It therefore requires a signature, and there is nothing upon it which purports to be a signature. It is therefore void by statute.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b566-4\"><em>Randolph B. </em>Martine, district attorney, and <em>McKenzie .Semple </em>(assistant), for the people, respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b566-5\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"AVK\">It is conceded upon the argument of this appeal by the learned district attorney, that the motion in arrest of judgment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We have no reason to differ from that view upon an examination of the case, and the judgment should therefore be reversed and the prisoner be discharged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Van Brunt, P.
