Dig. 424, opinion by Haight, Judge, January term, 1885, the general term of the supreme court held that the true reason and basis for allowing conversation between the third party and the witness, in the presence of the defendant, to be given in evidence, was that hearing the conversation and <em>not denying </em>the statement made was some evidence to go to the jury as to the truth of the statement made.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-6\"><em>Hdward W. Hatch, </em>district attorney, for the people, respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-7\">No error was committed in allowing the witness Nicken to testify to the conversation had with the mother of the defendant as to the time when the defendant reached home. This evidence was admitted upon the theory that it was an admission upon the part of defendant as to the time when he arrived home. His mother was asked what time he came in, and stated this conversation was had in a loud tone. The defendant was within ten feet of the parties, and the officer stated that he must have heard it. There is no pretense but that at the time he was in full possession of all his faculties. Under such circumstances it is clear that the evidence was properly received. <em>Lanergan </em>v. <em>People, </em>39 N.

An examination of this case shows that the rule there laid down was complied with. <em>People </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>2 N. Y. Crim.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOu\">Testimony was given on the part of the prosecution tending to show that the offense alleged in the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>dictment was committed in the city of Buffalo, between the hours of half past one o\u2019clock and three o\u2019clock in the morning of December 18th, 1884, on Broadway near the corner of Madison street. The complainant, Fleisner, had visited a saloon kept by one Kick, a little after midnight, remaining there till about half past one, and the defendant was shown to have been in the saloon, and to have left it shortly after Fleisner entered it. Evidence having been given on the part of the prosecution tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense, the defendant attempted to rebut it by testimony tending to show that he reached his residence on Adams street and went to bed shortly before one o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Katie Ushold, a witness called by him, testified that she lived eight doors from Holfelder\u2019s house, and that on the night in question a friend named Shuler had been out with her and left her at her gate at half past twelve A. M., and went towards Holfelder\u2019s house. Tins testimony was important only as it corroborated Shuler the next witness who testified that he parted with Katie Ushold at her house between half past twelve and one o\u2019clock, as -he judged; passed Holfelder\u2019s house, saw Holfelder going into his gate, and spoke to him. Katie Ushold on her cross-examination stated that she had talked with officers Nicken and Fernlacker and did not tell them or either of them that she saw Holfelder going to his house, go into the yard, go out of the yard, go down Beckwith street about one o\u2019clock and return in about half an hour and run into the alley, and that she got into her own house at two o\u2019clock and looked at the clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">After the defendant rested the prosecution called upon officer Fernlacker and put to him the following question: \u201c Did she,\u201d Katie Ushold, \u201c tell you she saw Holfelder run into his yard about half past twelve, or one o\u2019clock, that she saw him go out and go down Beckwith street, and in about three quarters of an hour she saw him run back into the alley ? \u201d The question was objected to on the ground, among others that in respect to the matter to which it related the prosecution made Katie Ushold their own witness and they could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>contradict her. The objection was overruled and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. The witness answered, \u201c she did not say that time, she said near one o\u2019clock.\u201d We understand this to be an affirmative answer to the question, substituting \u201cnear one o\u2019clock \u201d for \u201c about half past twelve or one o\u2019clock,\u201d and the reception of it we think was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The only material part which the defense proved or sought to prove by the witness Katie Ushold, was the hour at which Shuler left her and its only materiality consisted in the circumstance that it tended, in connection with the testimony of Shuler, to fix the time when the latter saw the defendant going into his gate. Her cross-examination as to what she had stated in regard to Holf elder\u2019s subsequent movements was new matter, in regard to which the prosecution made her their own witness, and it was not competent for them to contradict her. It was undoubtedly competent for them to give evidence tending to show as they did by the witness Nicken that she made a contradictory statement as to the hour when Shuler left her at her house, but beyond that the proof of her statements was improperly received. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>21 Hun, 47; affirmed, 83 N. Y., 610.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The prosecuting attorney was permitted to prove against the objection and exception of the defendant a conversation had by officer Nicken with the defendant\u2019s mother at the house of the latter about three o\u2019clock on the morning in question. The witness testified in substance that the mother said her son got home at two o\u2019clock; that she knew that was the hour because she got out of bed and looked; that her son had promised her that he would be at home at twelve o\u2019clock and go to church in the morning, and that she had given him a talking to for coming home so late. The testimony was received upon the theory, doubtless, that the son heard what his mother said, and by his silence impliedly admitted it to be true. It is questionable,, in view of the testimony, whether the defendant heard what his mother said to the officer. Nicken testified that the defendant was in a room adjoining that in which the conversation was heard, eight or ten feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>away as the witness judged, engaged in dressing himself. The door was open; the witness testified that he spoke in a pretty loud tone, but it did not appear in what tone the mother spoke. The witness in a reply to a question put by the court as to whether he thought the defendant heard the talk, replied that he thought he did; but in reply to a question put by the defendant\u2019s counsel said he would not swear that the defendant heard it. The testimony respecting the conversation with the mother seems to have had decided weight with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">After they had deliberated several hours they sent a written communication to the judge requiring what bearing the testimony of Nicken should have in regard to what Mrs. Holfelder said to him about the time when her son came home. In reply, the court instructed the jury that if the defendant did not hear what was said the testimony was unimportant; but if he did hear it, it would bear upon the question of his guilt or innocence, \u201c because,\u201d said the court, \u201cif he heard his mother state to the officer that it was two o\u2019clock when he got in, and he made no denial of it, it might be taken as an admission on his part that what his mother said was true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The correctness of that instruction in the abstract is not questioned. But two comments are to be made upon it, in view of the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In the first place there is no evidence whatever, that if the defendant heard the statement, he made no denial of it or was silent. It does not appear how he received it. In the next place the case shows that after the instruction above stated, was given the counsel differed in open court as to the testimony of Nicken, and the court then told the jury that they must determine the evidence for themselves and he made the following remark: \u201c The evidence of the other officer who swore upon that was\u2014my recollection is that he was very positive that the defendant heard these declarations ; but this is a question for you whether he did or not.\u201d So far as the case shows (and it purports to contain all the evidence) the remark respecting the testimony of any officer other than Nicken was inadvertently made. The only officers who were at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>house with Nieken were .Hammersmith and Christbaum. Christbaum testified that he did not go inside of the house and did not know what happened there. In regard to Hammer-smith, the case does not give his testimony in detail and states nothing more on this subject than that he gave further testimony tending to corroborate Nieken as to what occurred at the defendant\u2019s house. It does not appear that Ms testimony was any more positive than that of Nieken who said that he thought the defendant heard what was said, or that he testified to any fact on which such opinion could be based, in addition to the facts stated by Nieken. The remark in question was therefore unwarranted by the testimony and it probably had weight with the jury upon what they seem to have regarded as the turning point m the case;. Indeed, it is not too much to say in view of what occurred after the jury first retired, that the verdict was produced by the remark of the judge above referred to, and the opinion expressed by the witness Nieken that the defendant heard the conversation with his mother. The opinion, we think, was not proper evidence. The question whether the defendant heard was not one to be determined by the testimony of experts, <em>(Manke </em>v. <em>People, </em>17 Hun, 410; S. C., affirmed, 78 N. Y. 611). Although no exception was taken to this item of testimony or to the remark of the court above referred to, yet as it is impossible to say that they did not produce the verdict, we think it a case where justice requires a new trial. (Code of Civ. Pro., \u00a7 527, as amended by Ch. 360, L. 1882.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The conviction should be reversed- and a new trial ordered in the Court of Sessions of Erie County, to which court the proceedings should be remitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Barker, Haight and Bradley, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Note.\u2014Defendant\u2019s silence can be used against him if it was his duty to speak. <em>People </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>5 N.
