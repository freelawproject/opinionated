Jurisdiction exists under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (6). We affirm, although on somewhat different grounds than those relied upon by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-23\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint against F.B.I. and Department of Justice employees for abuse of process, false arrest and false imprisonment are barred by the Federal Tort Claims Act. As originally enacted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Act excepted any claim against the United States for, <em>inter alia, </em>false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution and abuse of process. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) (amended 1974). Effective March 16, 1974, the Act was amended to allow recovery for such actions committed by investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h), <em>as amended by </em>Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub.L.No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the only acts and omissions alleged in plaintiff\u2019s complaint upon which liability of F.B.I. and Department of Justice employees conceivably could be based \u2014 plaintiff\u2019s arrest, confinement and indictment \u2014 occurred prior to March 16, 1974, plaintiff\u2019s complaint against those employees is barred. <em>Gaudet v. United States, </em>517 F.2d 1034, 1035 (5th Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim for malicious prosecution also fails to state a cause of action against employees of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The tort of malicious prosecution is triggered by institution of criminal proceedings, in this case the return of a grand jury indictment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 653(a), 654(2)(b), Comment (c) (1977). The actions alleged to have been done with malice and without probable cause in the malicious prosecution count are Ames\u2019 arrest, confinement, and prosecution, and the placing of a lien against his property. The complaint does not allege specific activity by F.B.I. or Justice Department employees preceding the grand jury indictment and subsequent arrest that could be construed as an allegation that those employees initiated or procured the institution of the grand jury indictment. Furthermore, absent any specific allegation, such as the presentation of false evidence or the withholding of evidence, the grand jury indictment breaks any chain of causation linking the employees\u2019 activities to the institution of criminal proceedings, thus insulating the F.B.I. and Justice Department employees from tort liability. <em>See Rodriguez </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>v. Ritchey, </em>556 F.2d 1185, 1193 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1047, 98 S.Ct. 894, 54 L.Ed.2d 799 (1978); <em>cf. Dellums v. Powell, </em>566 F.2d 167, 192-93 (D.C. Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>438 U.S. 916, 98 S.Ct. 3146, 57 L.Ed.2d 1161 (1978). <em>See also </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 653, Comment (d) (1977); W. Prosser, The Law of Torts \u00a7 119 (4th ed. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The final count alleges in conclusory fashion that the acts complained of violated Ames\u2019 constitutional rights. No allegations of additional activities which would constitute a violation of Ames\u2019 constitutional rights are pleaded. Since the actions complained of cannot be the basis for holding the United States liable for common law torts, it follows that they cannot be the basis for its liability under a constitutional or \u201cBivens\u201d tort theory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-15\">. Jurisdiction is also asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, the jurisdictional counterpart of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. By its very terms, however, section 1983 applies only to actions taken under \u201ccolor of state law.\u201d Since the only defendant here is the United States, the lower court\u2019s holding that the action was time barred under rules applicable to section 1983 claims was erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">. Section 2680(h) currently reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">The provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">Any claim arising out of-assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights: <em>Provided, </em>That, with regard to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government, the provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim arising, on or after the date of the enactment of this proviso, out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For the purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\">. The amendment further limited the liability of the United States to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers, which the amendment defined as \u201cany officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). Since United States Attorneys are not so empowered, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 547, sovereign immunity still bars suit against the United States. <em>See Solomon v. United States, </em>559 F.2d 309 (5th Cir. 1977). Furthermore, suit against the United States Attorney and his assistant is barred by the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity, <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976), at least to the extent the United States may adopt as a defense the personal immunities of its agents. <em>Cf. Norton v. United States, </em>581 F.2d 390, 395-96 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1003, 99 S.Ct. 613, 58 L.Ed.2d 678 (1978); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>536 F.2d 269, 271-72 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. <em>denied, </em>429 U.S. 1039, 97 S.Ct. 735, 50 L.Ed.2d 750 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b275-13\">. The complaint against the Internal Revenue Service is barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). Although an administrative complaint was filed with the Department of Justice within the two year period, no claim was filed with the Department of the Treasury, of which the Internal Revenue Service is a part. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7801, 7802. Unless the appropriate agency is given an opportunity to consider and finally deny the claim, suit is barred. <em>Provancial v. United States, </em>454 F.2d 72, 74 (8th Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b275-14\"> Although the grand jury indictment which preceded Ames\u2019 arrest is not mentioned in the complaint, it is a matter of court record in the third division of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, which was the forum for Ames\u2019 gambling prosecution as well as the present civil suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b276-23\">. <em>Bivens v.
