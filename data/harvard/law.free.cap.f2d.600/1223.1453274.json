Appellants, Upjohn Company and its in-house General Counsel, appeal from the District Court\u2019s order enforcing under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7402(b), 7604(a) (1976) an IRS summons for documents. The General Counsel refused to produce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>documents on the grounds that they are protected by company\u2019s attorney-client privilege and by the work-product doctrine. District Judge Fox rejected these arguments and enforced the summons. We adopt the \u201ccontrol group\u201d test, affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">While auditing Upjohn\u2019s 1972-73 consolidated federal income tax returns, the IRS learned that since January 1, 1971, Upjohn and its subsidiaries had made payments of approximately $4,400,000 to officials of many of the 136 foreign countries in which Upjohn does business. The company had directed its in-house counsel, along with outside counsel, to conduct an internal investigation of these payments. At the request of Upjohn\u2019s top management, officers and employees of the company were urged to respond to counsel\u2019s questions candidly and confidentially. The responses were recorded in answers to written questionnaires and in counsel\u2019s notes and memoranda describing oral interviews. These are the documents the IRS seeks to obtain in the instant proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">The internal investigation was prompted, at least in part, by Upjohn\u2019s concern that the payments had not been reported properly to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company filed two reports with the SEC disclosing some, but not all, of the details of the payments. The disclosures were voluntary in the hope of lenient treatment by the SEC. These reports to the SEC were made available to the IRS, which then commenced the instant investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">The company provided the IRS with details of $700,000 worth of the payments which it conceded might affect its federal income tax liability. The company furnished the IRS considerably less detailed information regarding the other $3,700,000 of questionable payments because the company claims that these payments do not affect its tax liability. Although the company made its employees available for questioning by the IRS, the company refused to permit questions about the $3,700,000 of questionable payments. The IRS claims that the company\u2019s limited disclosure has been inadequate to permit an independent evaluation of the possible tax implications of the payments. Accordingly, the IRS summoned from company counsel the documents generated in the course of the internal investigation and now seeks enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-12\">Upjohn claims that the communications to counsel made by all of its employees, including regular and middle management employees as well as top management, are privileged as confidential communications between client and attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the extent that the communications were made by officers and agents not responsible for directing Upjohn\u2019s actions in response to legal advice, we disagree for the simple reason that the communications were not the \u201cclient\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-13\">The attorney-client privilege, as it exists today, is based on two related principles. The first is that it is an intrinsic part and a necessary incident of the attorney-client relationship. The legal profession has an intimate relationship with its clients and an important role in the administration of our system of justice. Privacy is the necessary context of the relationship between the individual and his lawyer. As stated by Dean McCormick:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-14\">Our adversary system of litigation casts the lawyer in the role of fighter for the party whom he represents. A strong sentiment of loyalty attaches to the relationship, and this sentiment would be outraged by an attempt to change our customs so as to make the lawyer amenable to routine examination upon the client\u2019s confidential disclosure regarding professional business. Loyalty and sentiment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>are silken threads, but they are hard to break.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">The second principle is that the privilege \u201cencourage[s] clients to make full disclosure to their attorneys.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This policy of promoting full disclosure to counsel serves to implement the notion inherent in the first principle, that finding the truth and achieving justice in an adversary system are best served by fully-informed advocates loyal to their client\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">The application of the privilege to corporate \u201cclients\u201d poses a somewhat different problem. Since corporations are inanimate, artificial entities, the attorney-client relationship is conceptually more difficult, and its underlying principles are less obvious. As clients, corporations can communicate to attorneys only through agents. Moreover, corporations, unlike individuals, are organized in such a way that responsibilities, and the information needed to fulfill the responsibilities, are delegated and compartmentalized. Thus, marketing officials have knowledge and duties related only to selling, while plant supervisors have knowledge and duties related only to production. It is only the senior management, guiding and integrating the several operations, which can be said to possess an identity analogous to the corporation as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">Courts have generally recognized that the attorney-client privilege applies to corporations so long as the attorney-client relationship was initiated and pursued by the company\u2019s management.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Any communication made by top management to the corporation\u2019s attorney, which otherwise meets the requirements of the attorney-client privilege, is protected from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-15\">The difficulty arises when, after the attorney-client relationship has been established by the top management, communications are made to counsel by subordinate corporate agents and employees. Some courts, notably the Seventh and Eighth Circuits, have adopted the position that such communications are privileged if certain conditions are met. The specification of the conditions varies, but the sum and substance are similar: If the agent is in possession of information acquired in the ordinary course of business relating to the subject matter of his employment, and the information is communicated confidentially to corporate counsel to assist him in giving legal advice to the corporation, then the communication is privileged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under this \u201csubject-matter\u201d approach, the privilege does not cover communication of pre-existing documents prepared for independent business reasons<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or communications unrelated to the subject matter of the agent\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Other courts have adopted a narrower approach which covers only those communications made by the so-called \u201ccontrol group\u201d of the corporation, namely, those officers, usually top management, who play a substantial role in deciding and directing the corporation\u2019s response to the legal advice given.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is our opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>the \u201csubject matter\u201d approach goes too far, and we align ourselves with the courts that have adopted the \u201ccontrol group\u201d analysis. The \u201csubject matter\u201d test encourages senior managers purposely to ignore important information they have good business reasons to know and use. Corporate counsel should not be the exclusive repository of unpleasant facts. The law should not encourage corporate managers to shield themselves from information about possibly illegal transactions. Such purposeful ignorance does not serve the interests of moral corporate conduct or the protection of stockholder equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">In addition, the scope of the attorney-client privilege should be limited to its purpose because the privilege acts as a bar to the discovery of the truth.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The \u201ccontrol group\u201d test recognizes that a corporation\u2019s decision-makers, like individual clients, must communicate freely and confidentially to counsel. By protecting these communications, the \u201ccontrol group\u201d test promotes consultation with counsel and thereby achieves its objective.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the same time, the \u201ccontrol group\u201d test guards against undue limitation of evidence. The \u201csubject matter\u201d approach enables the corporation\u2019s management \u2014 via agents \u2014 to \u201ccommunicate\u201d to counsel the details of transactions about which management is only dimly aware and to have these communications protected by the attorney-client privilege. Thus, once management is informed in a general way of transactions posing legal problems, it can order subordinate agents to communicate the full details directly to counsel. Because the \u201csubject matter\u201d test brings these communications within the attorney-client privilege, it tends to encourage this type of indirect communication to counsel. This, in turn, fosters situations in which the <em>only </em>record of the full details of a particular transaction is in the hands of corporate counsel and, under the \u201csubject matter\u201d test, undiscoverable. Discovery, then, would have to be directed at the corporate agents who know the details of the transaction rather than at the corporation\u2019s management. When the knowledgeable agents are located in several foreign countries, as here, the burden on discovery is severe. We, therefore, decline to accept Upjohn\u2019s argument because of the broad \u201czone of silence\u201d it would tend to create.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-11\">Upjohn argues, however, that some of the communications in this case were made by members of the \u201ccontrol group.\u201d This point is well taken. The record indicates that, in the course of their investigation, Upjohn\u2019s counsel interviewed a number of senior corporate officers, including the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman, and the President. These senior officers, and possibly others, are in all likelihood members of the \u201ccontrol group\u201d and their communications to counsel should be privileged.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>mand the case to the District Court to determine which communications sought by the IRS were made by members of the \u201ccontrol group\u201d and to deny enforcement of the summons with respect to these \u201ccontrol group\u201d communications.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">. <em>See </em>VIII J.

Simon, <em>The Attorney-Client Privilege as Applied to Corporations, </em>65 Yale L.J. 953, 955 (1956). We recognize that, historically, individual clients\u2019 communications with counsel via agents have been deemed privileged. <em>E. g., In re Aspinwall, </em>2 Fed.Cas.No. 591 (S.D.N.Y. 1874). We believe, however, that this principle should be limited to agents who, at the client\u2019s request, communicate <em>facts known to the client. See e. g., Reid v. Langlois, </em>41 Eng.Rep. 1408 (1849); <em>see </em>generally-Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 100-01 (1954); Simon, <em>The Attorney-Client Privilege, supra, </em>at 963-64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1317-13\">. The corporation\u2019s voluntary disclosures to the SEC amount to a waiver of the privilege only with respect to the facts actually disclosed. <em>United States v. Cote, </em>456 F.2d 142 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v.

Upjohn\u2019s other arguments that the work-product doctrine and principles of relevancy shield it from disclosure are not well founded. The work-product doctrine of <em>Hickman v. Taylor, supra </em>note 7, and Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3) is not applicable to administrative summonses issued under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602. The IRS simply must show that the inquiry is relevant to a good faith investigation conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose, that the information sought is not in the IRS\u2019 possession and that proper administrative procedures have been followed. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 57-58, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964). <em>See also United States v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>550 F.2d 615 (10th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Davey, </em>543 F.2d 996 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Matras, </em>487 F.2d 1271 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Theodore, </em>479 F.2d 749 (4th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. McKay, </em>372 F.2d 174 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"A8q\">There is no reason why the IRS should be required to take on faith Upjohn\u2019s assurances that $3,700,000 in questionable payments had no tax consequences, especially in view of the company\u2019s admission that $700,000 in questionable payments did affect its' tax returns. The fact that the IRS investigation is focused on the years 1972-74 does not mean that records after 1974 might not shed light on the earlier years\u2019 returns. Moreover, the IRS is not precluded from expanding its investigation into 1975 and later years should the facts warrant. The inquiry, therefore, is relevant to a legitimate investigation of Upjohn\u2019s tax liability. Upjohn has not argued that the IRS has acted in bad faith, that the proper administrative procedures have not been followed, or that the information sought is already in the hands of the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS is entitled to have its summons enforced as to all non-privileged material.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
