Leval, <em>Judge, </em>after a bench trial, finding certain items seized by the United States Customs Service not legally \u201cobscene\u201d and ordering their release to their respective addressees. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-25\">Between September 15 and September 21, 1978, the United States Customs Service seized 132 lots of allegedly obscene merchandise from the mail arriving in New York from overseas and five different allegedly obscene 8 mm. films from an arriving passenger at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The seized items were destined for the addresses of well over 100 citizens in twenty-five states and Wash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>ington, D. C. The seizure was made pursuant to \u00a7 305(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a). On September 26 a warrant for the arrest of the seized articles was issued by the Clerk of the District Court for the Southern District; the next day the United States Marshal made the arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">On October 5, notice of this action was sent to each addressee. The notice read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASDR\">PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the United States of America has commenced an action for the forfeiture and destruction of the below obscene material seized in New York, New York:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">ADDRESSEE: MERCHANDISE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">[ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">[ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">If you wish to contest the forfeiture and destruction of such merchandise, you have twenty (20) days from the receipt of this notice to file a Claim and Answer with this office.

I demand judgment that the seized merchandise be forwarded to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-19\">Five persons signed and returned these forms; a sixth person claimed not by form but by letter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Either just prior to, or at the same time as, the mailing of these forms, the government apparently also sent to the addressees something it calls an \u201cas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>sent to forfeiture\u201d form.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the trial below, the government attorney described this form as one that provides \u201can opportunity for the addressee to assent to an administrative forfeiture.\u201d The form read in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">Sir: Assent is hereby given to the forfeiture of [the seized articles] now in your custody [and] the subject of your notice dated above. This assent is neither an acknowledgement that the materials being forfeited were solicited nor an admission that it was known that they are obscene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">On November 6 and November 8, notice was sent to the six claimants informing them of the date and time of the proceedings in the district court for the determination of the obscenity of the claimed items.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This notice read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that you may appear at the time and place of trial, in person or by an attorney, and contest on any appropriate grounds the right of the United States to seize and forfeit the materials you have claimed in this action.

The government introduced into evidence all of the seized articles as well as the various items of correspondence sent to or received from the addressees. None of the addressees appeared at trial. During the trial, the government moved for entry of a default judgment against the allegedly obscene articles that were addressed to persons who either had failed to file a Claim and Answer or had filed an \u201cassent to forfeiture.\u201d The district court denied the motion, and determined whether each of the Schedule 1769 articles was or was not \u201cobs'cene.\u201d On November 24 the court ordered destroyed those materials portraying children engaged in sexual activity as well as those materials portraying rape, sexual sadism, or other forms of violence. All other materials were ordered released and forwarded to their addressees. The government appealed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ACai\">(I) <em>Default</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">We consider first the question whether a default judgment may be entered against the materials addressed to persons who either had \u201cassented\u201d to their forfeiture or had chosen not to file a Claim and Answer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court held that such a judgment could not be entered in proceedings of this kind. We agree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the district court in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The government\u2019s argument takes the following course. The procedure for actions commenced under \u00a7 1305(a) is governed by the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims. Rule A of these rule^ provides that the Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts are applicable to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Supplemental Rules. There is nothing in the Supplemental Rules regarding default, so Fed.R.Civ.P. 55 is properly consulted for guidance. Under this rule, the argument goes, the district court had the power to, and should have, entered a default judgment against the unclaimed articles. But this is to miss the forest for the trees. Given the important First Amendment interests at stake, we decline to approve of such a procedure. <em>Compare St. Martin\u2019s Press, Inc. v. Carey, </em>No. 77-7603 (2d Cir. 1979) (Timbers, J., dissenting) (\u201cParticularly where First Amendment rights are involved, courts must be sensitive to the first whisper of a chilling wind \u2014 the whisper picked up first by the beeches before the pines.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The statute provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">All persons are prohibited from importing into the United States from any foreign country . . any obscene book, pamphlet, paper, writing, advertisement, circular, print, picture, drawing, or other representation, figure, or image on or of paper or other material or other article which is obscene or immoral .... No such articles whether imported separately or contained in packages with other goods entitled to entry, shall be admitted to entry; and all such articles and, unless it appears to the satisfaction of the appropriate customs officer that the obscene or other prohibited articles . . were inclosed therein without the knowledge or consent of the importer . . ., the entire contents of the package . . . shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture . . . . [T]he Secretary of the Treasury may, in his discretion, admit the so-called classics or books of recognized and established literary or scientific merit, but may, in his discretion, admit such classics or books only when imported for noncommercial purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-14\">Upon the appearance of any such book or matter at any customs office, the same shall be seized and held by the appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ate customs officer <em>to await the judgment of the district court </em>as hereinafter provided . . . . Upon the seizure of such book or matter such customs officer shall transmit information thereof to the district attorney of the district in which is situated the office at which such seizure has taken place, who shall institute proceedings in the district court for the forfeiture, confiscation, and destruction of the book or matter seized. <em>Upon the adjudication </em>that such book or matter thus seized is of the character the entry of which is by this section prohibited, it shall be ordered destroyed and shall be destroyed. <em>Upon adjudication </em>that such book or matter thus seized is not of the character the entry of which is by this section prohibited, it shall not be excluded from entry under the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a) (emphasis added). As is quite obvious, \u201cforfeiture pursuant to \u00a7 305 would suppress the material entirely and condemn it in all contexts.\u201d <em>United States v. 35 MM. Motion Picture Entitled \u201cLanguage of Love,\u201d </em>432 F.2d 705, 714 (2d Cir. 1970), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>403 U.S. 925, 91 S.Ct. 2241, 29 L.Ed.2d 704 (1971). In our judgment, Congress intended this final restraint to be imposed only upon a judicial determination that seized articles are \u201cobscene,\u201d and not as the result of an unchallenged administrative recommendation for destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">This conclusion is amply supported by the statute\u2019s legislative history. <em>See United States v. 37 Photographs, </em>402 U.S. 363, 368-71, 91 S.Ct. 1400, 28 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971); <em>United States v. One Book Entitled \u201cThe Adventures of Father Silas,\u201d </em>249 F.Supp. 911, 916-19 (S.D.N.Y.1966). We have held as much:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">The Collector of Customs is not authorized under any circumstances finally to determine whether material seized is obscene. His sole function is to select material for judicial review. The power to determine questions of obscenity is vested solely in the courts. In fact, the legislative history of Section 305 indicates great hostility, on the part of the Congressmen who devised the section, to administrative censorship and manifests their desire that the question of obscenity should \u201cbe quickly submitted to the district attorney and to the court for determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\"><em>United States v. One Carton Positive Motion Picture Film Entitled \u201c491,\u201d </em>367 F.2d 889, 899 (2d Cir. 1966). <em>See also United States v. Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise, Schedule 896, </em>363 F.Supp. 165, 166 (S.D.N.Y.1973); <em>United States v.

Obscene Magazines, </em>382 F.Supp. 975 (C.D.Cal. 1974). The effect of the government\u2019s suggested procedure here would be to remove <em>from </em>the judiciary the statutorily imposed obligation to rule on the obscenity of seized items. We cannot, in light of the clear wording of the statute, say that an addressee\u2019s decision to file an \u201cassent to forfeiture\u201d or not to file a \u201cClaim and Answer\u201d serves to lift the burden of making these \u201cadjudications\u201d from the shoulders of the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Even if we found the statute ambiguous, however, we would decline to sanction the default procedure suggested by the government. The practical effect of such a procedure would be to permit the government\u2019s administrative seizure and subsequent destruction of books, magazines and films to become an unreviewed act of cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>sorship.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a result, citizens could be prevented from receiving materials which the courts, given the opportunity, would find not obscene. This we will not allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u201cWe risk erosion of First Amendment liberties unless we train our vigilance upon the methods whereby obscenity is condemned no less than upon the standards whereby it is judged.\u201d <em>Manual Enterprises v. Day, </em>370 U.S. 478, 497, 82 S.Ct. 1432, 1442, 8 L.Ed.2d 639 (1962) (Brennan, J., concurring). This is so because \u201cconstitutionally protected expression ... is often separated from obscenity only by a dim and uncertain line.\u201d <em>Bantam Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. 58, 66, 83 S.Ct. 631, 637, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). Thus, the teaching of the Supreme Court\u2019s cases is that \u201conly a procedure requiring a judicial determination suffices to impose a valid final restraint.\u201d <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 58, 85 S.Ct. 734, 739, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965). As explained further by the Court in <em>Blount v.

Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 525, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). As unedifying as we may find this task in cases involving alleged \u201cobscenity,\u201d it is the judiciary which must wield these implements, not administrators or executive officers, who make only the initial determination that certain materials are of doubtful legality.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">(II) <em>\u201cObscenity\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">We turn now to the central issue before the district court: whether the seized articles were \u201cobscene\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1305(a) and therefore subject to destruction. The court expressly, and correctly, referred to the definition laid out in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), as governing this question. In <em>Miller, </em>the Court defined as obscene those \u201cworks which, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d 413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. It is the district court\u2019s application of this definition to the articles here in question that we examine on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The district court determined that all of the seized articles satisfied the first and third parts of the <em>Miller </em>test. As to the second part of the definition, however, that part having to do with the \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d of the portrayal of sexual conduct, the court \u201cdivided the materials into subject matter groups in accordance with [its] perception of differing community attitudes.\u201d The court found that photographs and films of children engaged in sexual activity \u201chave provoked a very widespread public outrage, based in considerable part on revulsion at the potentially harmful exploitation of children for commercial sex purposes.\u201d The court held such materials \u201coffensive to the community standards\u201d and ordered them destroyed. The court made a similar finding and holding regarding the materials depicting rape, sexual sadism or other forms of violence. Those items were also ordered destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The court made quite a different finding, however, with regard to <em>\u201cadult </em>materials which do not involve violence, rape or sadism.\u201d (emphasis in original). The court characterized these items as portraying \u201ca wide variety of sex activity,\u201d ranging from \u201crelatively conventional sex\u201d to \u201cbizarre sexual practices.\u201d As to determining the community\u2019s attitude toward such materials, the court said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agp-dedup-0\">\u201cThe most apparent factor in seeking to make that determination is that the community does not speak with any consensus. Without question a significant population is outraged and disgusted by such materials. It is equally clear, given the proliferation of such materials, that the approving and consuming public is enormous. In my view, perhaps the largest element of the community and that closest to common ground expresses a view which tolerates the wishes of others to consume such adult materials privately and does not find them patently offensive <em>per se </em>unless publicly displayed \u25a0 in an offensive manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">Except where the corruption and exploitation of children are involved, public outcries against pornography and commercial sex activities in this community more often have to do with resentment of its intrusion into particular neighborhoods or with offensive display rather than with categorical objection to the existence of the materials or the activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\"><em>(quoting United States v. Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise, Schedule 1724, </em>460 F.Supp. 826, 829 (S.D.N.Y.1978) (Leval, J.)). The district court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">In seeking to determine whether the community standards are offended by these materials, I do not see how I can disregard the factor that these materials are being imported discreetly for private voluntary viewing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">I cannot disassociate my findings of community standards from the question whether the materials are to be used in offensive public display or in discreet privacy because I believe that these distinctions are a pertinent part of the community standards. The question of offensiveness is nearly impossible to disassociate from the context in which the material appears.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxaH\">People are not offended in the abstract \u2014 they are offended in meaningful contexts. Consider whether the act of sexual intercourse performed by an adult man and woman is patently offensive to our community\u2019s standards. The question cannot be answered without information as to the circumstances. If the act is performed in the privacy of the bedroom, the answer will be \u201cno\u201d. If performed on a stage erected on a busy and crowded public street at lunch time, the answer will undoubtedly be \u201cyes\u201d. I have no doubt that much of the communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ty would find even tame erotic materials to be offensive if displayed in public areas, on billboards or in any manner that inflicted it on unwilling viewers and children. On the other hand, I find in my attempt to determine the standards of the community that the majority view does not necessarily consider adult non-violent sex material patently offensive when it is discreetly and privately used by those who find it enjoyable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">[CJonsideration of the context of display is [not] forbidden in seeking to determine whether the community standards have been offended where the finder of fact concludes that the context is a significant factor affecting the community\u2019s attitude.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">(footnote omitted). Thus, the court concluded, although some of the articles \u201cmight\u201d be offensive if imported for purposes of commercial sale or public display, they were \u201cnot offensive to the community standards in their present form and under the circumstances of their importation.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Books, magazines and motion pictures<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> are, of course, entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But when they contain material that is \u201cobscene in the constitutional sense,\u201d <em>United States v. Dellapia, </em>433 F.2d 1252, 1254 (2d Cir. 1970), their distribution, or, as here, their very existence, may be regulated by the government without offending constitutional guarantees. \u201c[O]bscenity is not protected by the freedoms of speech and press.\u201d <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 481, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1307, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957). <em>Accord, Miller v. California, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 23, 93 S.Ct. 2607. Thus, the problem presented in cases such as this one is twofold. First, the term \u201cobscene\u201d must be properly defined. As explained by Justice Rehnquist, \u201c[t]he definition of obscenity . is not a question of fact, but one of law; the word \u2018obscene\u2019 ... is not merely a generic or descriptive term, but a legal term of art.\u201d <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 118, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2908, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974). Second, once the definition is arrived at, it must be applied to the facts of the specific case \u2014 a matter of considerable delicacy. \u201c \u2018[T]he line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated ... is finely drawn.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, supra, </em>372 U.S. at 66, 83 S.Ct. at 637, <em>quoting Speiser v. Randall, supra, </em>357 U.S. at 525, 78 S.Ct. 1332. It is our task on this appeal to determine whether the district judge properly discerned this line. It is our judgment that, under the teaching of the Supreme Court cases as they stand today, he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">It is well settled that the \u201cobscenity\u201d of an article seized pursuant to \u00a7 1305(a) is to be determined by reference to the <em>Miller </em>test. <em>See United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, </em>413 U.S. 123, 129-30, 93 S.Ct. 2665, 37 L.Ed.2d 500 (1973); <em>United States v. Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise, Schedule 1303, supra, </em>562 F.2d at 190 &amp; n.8; <em>United States v. One Reel of 35MM. Color Motion Picture Film Entitled \u201cSinderella\u201d, </em>491 F.2d 956, 957 (2d Cir. 1974). We need not consider on this appeal whether the articles in Schedule 1769, \u201ctaken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex.\u201d The district court found that they did. Nor need we consider whether these articles \u201chave serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>court found that they did not. But we are required to consider whether the district court properly applied to the seized articles the \u201cpatently offensive\u201d part of the <em>Miller </em>test. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In <em>Miller </em>the Court held that in order for a trier of fact to classify material as \u201cobscene\u201d it must find that the material \u201cportray[s] sexual conduct in a patently offensive way.\u201d 413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. As a \u201cbasic guideline\u201d for this determination, the trier of fact is to decide \u201cwhether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, [specifically defined] sexual conduct . . <em>Id. </em>The Court gave two \u201cplain examples\u201d of such depictions or descriptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sex acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">(b) Patently offensive representations, or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">413 U.S. at 25, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. Although the examples given by the Court do to some extent help clarify what the Court had in mind as to the types of activity displayed in \u201cpatently offensive\u201d representations or descriptions of sexual conduct, they do not clarify what the Court meant by the term \u201cpatently offensive.\u201d In other words, we are told only that an example of a work which \u201cdepicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, [specifically defined] sexual conduct\u201d is a work which contains \u201c[p]atently offensive representations or descriptions\u201d of certain specified sexual activity. The only other clues offered in <em>Miller </em>are references by the Court to \u201cpornography\u201d or \u201cpornographic material,\u201d 413 U.S. at 18-19 n.2, 93 S.Ct. at 2615, \u201cpatently offensive \u2018hard core\u2019 sexual conduct,\u201d 413 U.S. at 27, 93 S.Ct. at 2616, and \u201c \u2018hard core\u2019 pornography,\u201d 413 U.S. at 28, 93 S.Ct. 2665. It has largely been left to us, then, the inferior federal courts, to infer the meaning of the term \u201cpatent offensiveness.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">There was no mention of the phrase \u201cpatently offensive\u201d in <em>Roth v. United States, supra, </em>354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, the case that provides the starting point for obscenity analysis. In <em>Roth </em>the proper test for obscenity was held to be only \u201cwhether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u201d 354 U.S. at 489, 77 S.Ct. at 1311. Subsequently, however, in <em>Manual Enterprises v. Day, supra, </em>370 U.S. 478, 82 S.Ct. 1432, Justice Harlan, announcing the judgment of the Court, found that the magazines there in question \u201ccannot be deemed so offensive on their face as to affront current community standards of decency \u2014 a quality that we shall hereafter refer to as \u2018patent offensiveness\u2019 or \u2018indecency.\u2019 Lacking that quality, the magazines cannot be deemed legally \u2018obscene . . . 370 U.S. at 482, 82 S.Ct. at 1434. He also referred to sexual conduct \u201cportrayed in a manner so offensive as to make it unacceptable under current community <em>mores,\u201d id., </em>to \u201cobnoxiously debasing portrayals of sex,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 483, 82 S.Ct. at 1434, to \u201cmaterial whose indecency is self-demonstrating,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 487, 82 S.Ct. 1432, to materials \u201coffensive on their face,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 488, 82 S.Ct. 1432, and to materials \u201cdeemed to be beyond the pale of contemporary notions of rudimentary decency,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 489, 82 S.Ct. at 1438. Although Justice Harlan found the magazines there at issue \u201cdismally unpleasant, uncouth, and tawdry,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 490, 82 S.Ct. 1432, they were held not to be obscene. Two years later, in <em>Jacobellis v. Ohio, </em>378 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964), Justice Brennan, announcing the judgment of the Court, held that the film \u201cThe Lovers\u201d was not obscene, at least in part be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>cause it was not \u201c \u2018substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of [sexual] matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 84 S.Ct. at 1680. <em>See Roth v. United States, supra, </em>354 U.S. at 487 n.20, 77 S.Ct. 1304. In <em>Jacobellis, </em>Justice Stewart filed his now famous concurring opinion, which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">[Criminal laws in this area are constitutionally limited to hard-core pornography. I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so.

Massachusetts, </em>383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966), the Court adopted a new test for obscenity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqih\">[I]t must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) <em>the material is patently offensive because it affronts community standards relating to the description and representation of sexual </em>matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">383 U.S. at 418, 86 S.Ct. at 977 (emphasis added). The Court went on to note that, <em>assuming </em>that \u201cprurient appeal\u201d and \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d had been demonstrated, \u201cthe circumstances of production, sale, and publicity\u201d may be used as relevant to the question whether the material is utterly without redeeming social value. 383 U.S. at 420, 86 S.Ct. at 978.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">The Court expanded on the use of context or circumstance as relevant to the determination of \u201cobscenity\u201d in <em>Ginzburg v. United States, </em>383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 942, 16 L.Ed.2d 31 (1966), holding in effect that advertisements which were \u201cnot themselves obscene,\u201d 383 U.S. at 465 n.4, 86 S.Ct. 942, could be deemed so in light of \u201cthe setting in which the publications were presented.\u201d 383 U.S. at 465, 86 S.Ct. at 944-45. The Court, found evidence of \u201cpandering\u201d relevant \u201cin close cases\u201d to the questions of prurient appeal and social value. <em>See also Pinkus </em>v. <em>United States, </em>436 U.S. 293, 303, 98 S.Ct. 1808, 56 L.Ed.2d 293 (1978); <em>Hamling v.

With regard to \u201cpatent offensiveness,\u201d however, the Court made only the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">The deliberate representation of [the] publications as erotically arousing . . . would tend to force public confrontation with the potentially offensive aspects of the work; the brazenness of such an appeal heightens the offensiveness of the publications to those who are offended by such material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">383 U.S. at 470, 86 S.Ct. at 947.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Accord, Splawn v.

For example, in <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U.S. 115, 93 S.Ct. 2680, 37 L.Ed.2d 492 (1973), the Court declared that expression by words alone may be held \u201clegally obscene\u201d if upon reading it the Court can describe it as being \u201cmade up entirely of repetitive descriptions of physical, sexual conduct, \u2018clinically\u2019 explicit and offensive to the point of being nauseous.\u201d 413 U.S. at 116, 93 S.Ct. at 2683. In <em>United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, supra, </em>413 U.S. 123, 93 S.Ct. at 2670, the Court indicated that there was a certain \u201csubstantive\u201d aspect to the <em>Miller </em>examples: \u201cIf and when . . . a \u2018serious doubt\u2019 is raised as to the vagueness of the words \u2018obscene,\u2019 \u2018lewd,\u2019 \u2018lascivious,\u2019 \u2018filthy,\u2019 \u2018indecent\u2019 or \u2018immoral\u2019 as used to describe regulated material in [federal statutes], we are prepared to construe such terms as limiting regulated material to patently offensive representations or descriptions of that specific \u2018hard core\u2019 sexual conduct given as examples in <em>Miller v. California . . </em>. 413 U.S. at 130 n.7, 93 S.Ct. at 2670. And in <em>Hamling </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>418 U.S. 87, 94 S.Ct. 2887, the Court did precisely that, explaining that <em>\u201cMiller </em>undertook to set forth examples of the types of material which a statute might proscribe as portraying sexual conduct in a patently offensive way.\u201d 418 U.S. at US-14, 94 S.Ct. at 2906. The Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\"><em>Miller, </em>in describing the type of material which might be constitutionally pro; scribed . . . was speaking in terms of substantive constitutional law of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. . . . While the particular descriptions there contained were not intended to be exhaustive, they clearly indicate that there is a limit beyond which neither legislative draftsmen nor juries may go in concluding that particular material is \u201cpatently offensive\u201d within the meaning of the obscenity test set forth in the <em>Miller </em>cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5B\">418 U.S. at 114, 94 S.Ct. at 2906.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">In <em>Jenkins v. Georgia, </em>418 U.S. 153, 94 S.Ct. 2750, 41 L.Ed.2d 642 (1974), decided the same day as <em>Hamling, </em>the Court considered the question whether the popular film entitled \u201cCarnal Knowledge\u201d was \u201cpatently offensive.\u201d The Georgia court held that it was; the Supreme Court held that it was not. The Court acknowledged that the question of \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d was \u201cessentially a question of fact,\u201d but went on to hold that the fact finder does not have \u201cunbridled discretion in determining what is \u2018patently offensive.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">While [the <em>Miller </em>list of examples] did not purport to be an exhaustive catalog of what juries might find patently offensive, it was certainly intended to fix substantive constitutional limitations, deriving from the First Amendment, on the type of material subject to such a determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">418 U.S. at 160-61, 94 S.Ct. at 2755. Using this analysis, the Court held that the film was not \u201cpatently offensive\u201d because its scenes were neither \u201cwithin either of the two examples given in <em>Miller\u201d </em>nor \u201csufficiently similar to such material to justify similar treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he film could not, as a matter of constitutional law, be found to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way.\u201d 418 U.S. at 161, 94 S.Ct. at 2755.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">This analysis was again employed in <em>Smith v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 291, 97 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>S.Ct. 1756, 52 L.Ed.2d 3241 (1977), where the Court described the criterion of \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d not only as an \u201cunderlying question of fact[]\u201d to be determined in light of \u201ccontemporary community standards,\u201d but also as a standard containing a \u201csubstantive component.\u201d 431 U.S. at 300-01, 97 S.Ct. 1756. \u201cThe kinds of conduct that a jury would be permitted to label as \u2018patently offensive\u2019 . . are the \u2018hard core\u2019 types of conduct suggested by the examples given in <em>Miller.\u201d </em>431 U.S. at 301, 97 S.Ct. at 1764. The Court referred to these kinds of conduct as \u201csubstantive conduct\u201d the portrayal of which may be held to be \u201cpatently offensive.\u201d 431 U.S. at 303, 97 S.Ct. 1756. Of particular relevance to the appeal now before us is a comment made by Justice Stevens in dissent: \u201cThe standard now applied by the Court focuses its attention on the content of the materials and their impact on the average person in the community.\u201d 431 U.S. at 317, 97 S.Ct. at 1772. And in <em>Ward v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 767, 97 S.Ct. 2085, 52 L.Ed.2d 738 (1977), the Court held that, although the <em>Miller </em>examples did not include depictions of sado-maso-chistic sexual behavior, depictions of such conduct could nevertheless be found \u201cpatently offensive.\u201d The Court reasoned that the <em>Miller </em>examples \u201cgave substantive meaning\u201d to the \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d portion of the <em>Miller </em>test \u201c \u2018by indicating the kinds of materials within its reach,\u2019 \u201d 431 U.S. at 775, 97 S.Ct. at 2089, but that because the examples \u201cwere not intended to be exhaustive,\u201d 431 U.S. at 773, 97 S.Ct. at 2090, <em>quoting Hamling v. United States, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 114, 94 S.Ct. 2887, the real question to be asked is whether the material in question is \u201c.the sort of\u201d material described in <em>Miller, i. e., </em>\u201cspecific hardcore sexual conduct.\u201d The Court characterized this as the <em>Miller </em>\u201cspecificity requirement,\u201d 431 U.S. at 775, 97 S.Ct. 2085, and held the requirement satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">To summarize, in order for a portrayal of sexual conduct to be \u201cpatently offensive,\u201d as that term has been used by the Supreme Court, it must at a minimum be a depiction, description or representation either of the activities listed in the <em>Miller </em>examples or of activities \u201csufficiently similar\u201d to those activities to justify similar treatment. Once this \u201csubstantive component\u201d is satisfied, the question becomes whether, as a matter of fact, the portrayal is \u201cpatently offensive\u201d in light of \u201ccontemporary community standards.\u201d And, as explained by the Court in <em>Smith, </em>\u201ccontemporary community standards must be applied by [the fact finder] in accordance with [its] own understanding of the tolerance of the average person in [its] community.\u201d 431 U.S. at 305, 97 S.Ct. at 1766. It is with this as background that we evaluate the district court\u2019s use of the inferred intention of the addressees to enjoy the seized articles privately as relevant to the question whether those articles are \u201cpatently offensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">It is our judgment that the district court\u2019s method of analysis is not supported by the relevant Supreme Court pronouncements. In reaching its own conclusions as to the \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d of allegedly \u201cobscene\u201d materials, the Supreme Court has referred only to the \u201cworks,\u201d or to the \u201cportrayals\u201d of sexual activity, or to the \u201cdepiction,\u201d \u201crepresentation or description\u201d of that conduct. There has been no mention of the context in which those works were to be viewed by the owner, nor has there been mention of their intended private use. The assumption throughout the development of this area of the law has been that the portrayal of sexual activity either is or is not \u201cpatently offensive.\u201d The question which the Supreme Court is instructing the lower courts to ask in this regard is as follows: Is, as a matter of fact, the depiction, description or representation of sexual conduct contained in the article in question \u201cpatently offensive\u201d under \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d? As explained above, some portrayals of sexual conduct may not, as a matter of substantive constitutional law, be found to be \u201cpatently offensive.\u201d Their content must be either that content mentioned in the <em>Miller </em>examples or \u201csufficiently similar\u201d to that content to justify similar treatment. But, the manner in which sexual conduct is depicted, described or represented in allegedly ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>scene materials is not affected by the man-her or place in which the materials themselves either are, or are intended to be, used tnd enjoyed. Under the Supreme Court cases handed down to date, such informaion is simply not relevant to the determiation of the materials\u2019 \u201cpatent offensiveess.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For this reason, we must vacate le district court\u2019s order that the materials 5 released and remand for further considation of the question of the \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d of these articles in light of ontemporary community standards.\u201d <em>e, e. g., Hamling </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>8 U.S. at 125-26, 94 S.Ct. 2887; <em>United States v.

On December 11, 1978, the district court granted a government motion for a partial stay of the judgment so the government could perfect its appeal to this Court. The stay was for sixty days, beginning November 24, and was conditioned on the government\u2019s filing with the Court of Appeals within one week a brief and record for appeal, an application for review of the stay, and an application for an expedited appeal. The court also ordered the government to send copies of the order granting a partial stay as well as \u201call pertinent papers\u201d to the addressees of the articles ordered released. Subsequently, the government requested the district court to modify the stay so as to require briefing no earlier than February 1, 1979. The court gave the government until January 10, 1979, to file its brief, believing that such a schedule was \u201camply reasonable\u201d given the important interests involved. On January 5, 1979, this Court, per Chief Judge Kaufman and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Judge Smith, granted a government motion for a stay of the district court\u2019s order pending disposition of the government\u2019s appeal and expedited the hearing of oral argument. <em>Compare United States v.

If the material is indeed obscene, statutes of the United States and of most of the states make its importation, transportation or acquisition a criminal offense. . . . The printed claim form which the government sends to addressees upon seizure requires the addressee to \u201cadmit that the seized merchandise was sought to be imported into the United States through the Port of New York\u201d. ... A potential claimant might well believe, and reasonably so, that in signing such a form he was furnishing the government with evidence which could be used against him in a criminal prosecution. In contrast, the printed assent-to-forfeiture form which the Government sends to the addressee offers the comforting exculpatory statement that \u201cthis assent is neither an acknowledgement that the materials being forfeited were solicited nor an admission that it was known that they are obscene.\u201d . The filing of an assent form in the circumstances is no more consistent with the interpretation advocated by the government that the addressee didn\u2019t send for and doesn\u2019t want the material than that the addressee wants to stay out of trouble,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"adl-dedup-0\">(citations and footnote omitted). <em>See also United States v.
