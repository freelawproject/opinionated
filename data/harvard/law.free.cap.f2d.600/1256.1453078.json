We reverse and remand the district court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-13\">I. <em>Statement of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-14\">On February 14, 1979, the district court issued five search warrants authorizing the Government to search parts of the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas, the offices of appellee Productions and Leasing, Inc., and the person of appellee Agosto, in connection with alleged violations of federal law in the management and control of the Tropicana Hotel. The Government\u2019s search warrant application was supported by the contents of wiretaps authorized by the district court and a \u201cmaster affidavit\u201d of 131 pages describing an on-going federal investigation. On February 15, 1979, the district court sealed the master affidavit at the request of the Government, purportedly to protect the on-going investigation described in the master affidavit. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-18\">Two days later appellees moved that the affidavit be unsealed. A number of papers and hearings ensued. The Government informed the district court (for the District of Nevada) that the district court for the Western District of Missouri had sealed a similar master affidavit until June 28, 1979, in order to avoid disrupting the nationwide investigation of which the Las Vegas investigation was a part. On May 21, 1979, the district court for Nevada ordered that the affidavit be unsealed because \u201cfederal courts have no power to seal affidavits upon which search warrants are based.\u201d The district court granted a 24-hour stay so the Government could pursue an appeal to this court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We continued the stay pending the disposition of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-19\">II. <em>Authority to Seal Affidavits</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWX2\">In finding that the federal courts do not have the authority to seal affidavits, the district court concentrated on Rule 41(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, concluding that \u201cnowhere in Rule 41(c) is the power of a judge or magistrate to seal such an affidavit even suggested.\u201d We believe that the district court erred in narrowly focusing on Rule 41(c) for the courts have inherent power, as an incident of their constitutional function, to control papers filed with the courts within certain constitutional and other limitations. <em>See Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 589, 598, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978); <em>Shea v. Gabriel, </em>520 F.2d 879 (1st Cir. 1975); Note, Protective Orders Against the Press and the Inherent Powers of the Courts, 87 Yale L.J. 342, 350 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>Because the district court improperly concluded that the federal courts <em>per se </em>lack the authority to seal affidavits, it did not consider whether the sealing of the affidavit in this case would be consistent with the limits on the court\u2019s power. Since such a determination will involve factual matters not yet considered by the district court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we remand to the district court. To protect the jurisdiction of the district court and the Court of Appeals, the affidavit shall remain sealed at least until the district court has completed its proceedings on remand and for seven days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">It is noted that on remand, if the district court should conclude that the sealed matter should be opened, then there is a question as to whether all or part of the sealed matter should be unsealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">There are questions as to mootness in the record, most of which have arisen since the district court acted in the case. The district court is authorized to consider the mootness issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">Remanded for proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1347-15\">. Because the Government\u2019s prayers were in the alternative, and given our resolution of the appeal <em>infra, </em>we do not address the Government\u2019s prayer for mandamus relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1347-20\">. Because the district court\u2019s order finally adjudicated the matter presented to the district court and was not a mere component of a different proceeding, the order is a final judgment appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1348-16\">. For example, the district court postulated that the Fourth Amendment might prevent sealing of an affidavit depending on the circumstances of the given case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
