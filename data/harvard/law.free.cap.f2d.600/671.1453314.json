We dismiss that appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In appeal No. 78-2232, Claude Carpenter and James Adcock (Beneficiaries), individually and on behalf of all Fund members and beneficiaries, appeal the denial of their motion to intervene. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">\n<em>General Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">On August 4, 1976, the Fund, through its former trustees, brought suit in the district court against Old Security and sixty other defendants, including appellee Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago (Continental), to recover $7 million in Fund assets, allegedly diverted and misappropriated by defendants\u2019 insurance fraud conspiracy. Prior to the filing of a second amended complaint, the former trustees were required to resign. New trustees filled the vacancies and were substituted as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">The Fund\u2019s second amended complaint charged the sixty-one defendants with breach of contract, fraud, conspiracy, and breach of fiduciary duty under state law, and with breach of statutory duties as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(1976) (ERISA). It alleged that the Fund contracted with Old Security for insurance benefits to Fund members; that at that time Old Security failed to inform the Fund of Old Security\u2019s feeble financial condition; that the Fund transferred $7 million in premiums to Old Security; that Old Security defaulted on the contract because of its financial condition; that the failure to inform and default were part of a complex scheme in which defendants conspired to defraud the Fund of $7 million, all of which was misappropriated, diverted, and wasted by defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Old Security and various other defendants filed counterclaims and third-party claims charging trustees, officers, and agents of the Fund with complicity or actual participation in the scheme to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">Because the issues are unrelated, the appeals must be separately treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">\n<em>Appeal No. 78-2287\u2014 The Motion to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-18\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-19\">In October, 1977, the Missouri Director of Insurance, Jerry B. Buxton (Buxton), petitioned the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri (Missouri court), for an order placing Old Security in receivership. <em>Buxton v. Old Security Life Insurance Co., </em>No. 29686 (Cir.Ct., Cole Cty., Mo., filed Oct. 1977) (Missouri insolvency proceeding). Buxton proceeded under Section 375.560 of the Missouri Insurance Act, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 375.560, authorizing receivership of domiciliary insurance companies for rehabilitation or liquidation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-20\">By order of October 20,1977, the Missouri court adjudged Old Security insolvent, appointed Buxton receiver, and authorized him to rehabilitate Old Security and to otherwise act in protection of Old Security\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>remaining assets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The order included this (Missouri injunction):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\">11. All persons are enjoined and restrained from prosecuting or bringing any action, issuing any process or obtaining any judgment against the defendant, Old Security Life Insurance Company, or its properties or assets, except pursuant to the order of this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">It was after issuance of the Missouri injunction that the Fund filed its second amended complaint and moved for preliminary injunctions in the district court against Old Security. The Fund did not seek permission of the Missouri court and made no attempt to obtain modification of the Missouri injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">On December 27, 1977, Old Security moved to dismiss, arguing that further proceedings in the federal action were barred by the Missouri injunction. On September 1, 1978, the district court denied the motion,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">Old Security also urges this court to abstain from taking jurisdiction over this controversy because it is now under liquidation or rehabilitation by defendant Jerry Buxton, the court-appointed receiver in Missouri. That court has enjoined any suits against Old Security by its order entered October 20, 1977. However, E.R. I.S.A. confers upon Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over employee health and welfare funds, except that a beneficiary is given the right to file a civil action in a State court to enforce his claims and for similar purposes. We therefore have a \u201cvirtually unflagging obligation\u201d to retain and exercise jurisdiction over Old Security. See <em>Will v. Calvert, </em>[437 U.S. 655, 98 S.Ct. 2552, 57 L.Ed.2d 504] 46 U.S.L.W. 4811, 4813 (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-10\"><em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800 [96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483] (1976) does not support defendant\u2019s argument for abstention. No difficult or unusual question of state law has been raised. To the contrary, all three counts involve questions of Federal law which, as we have held, are exclusively under our jurisdiction in this particular instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">We do not overlook the holding in <em>Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co., Inc. v. Geeslin, </em>530 F.2d 154 (7th Cir. 1976), a diversity case where the State court had obtained jurisdiction over the <em>res. </em>In that situation, it was held that the Federal court should not simultaneously proceed with liquidation of the <em>res, </em>particularly when a domestic insurance company is involved. However, when the Federal suit is proceeding <em>in personam, </em>we see no reason why we should not proceed simultaneously with the State court liquidation proceedings. <em>Roller v. Richmond Industrial Loan and Thrift, </em>407 F.Supp. 1211 (E.D.Va.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">The other arguments raised by Old Security for dismissal have been considered and found wanting. We will merely refer specifically only to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A) which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-13\">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7A\">To what extent plaintiffs may be bound by Missouri law we are not called upon to decide. They are entitled to bring an action to enforce alleged obligations under E.R.I.S.A., while at the same time Old Security is bound by the laws of the State of Missouri under the foregoing statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>As the basis for jurisdiction in this appeal, Old Security relies on the collateral order doctrine of <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The dispositive issue is whether the district court\u2019s order denying the motion to dismiss is an appealable collateral order under <em>Cohen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Jurisdiction of Appeals from \u201cfinal decisions,\u201d .28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1976), includes jurisdiction of final \u201ccollateral orders,\u201d described in <em>Cohen </em>as \u201cthat small class which finally determines claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225. <em>Cohen </em>was a stockholders\u2019 derivative suit, with jurisdiction based solely on diversity. Defendant corporation, entitled to do so under the law of the forum state, moved to require plaintiff to post security for defendant\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees, and appealed the denial of that motion. The court saw \u201ca serious and unsettled question,\u201d 337 U.S. at 547, 69 S.Ct. 1221, in whether federal courts in diversity cases must apply the state statute on posting security.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">To be final and appqalable, therefore, a collateral order must raise an important and unsettled question of law, the question must be separable from the merits, and delay in its resolution must result in an irretrievable loss of rights. We conclude that the denial of Old Security\u2019s motion to dismiss is not a final and appealable collateral order and that this court is, therefore, without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-16\">Though Old Security variously described an alleged important and unsettled question of law in the briefs<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it became clear at oral argument that the only question relied on by Old Security is whether it is an abuse of discretion not to abstain in this in person-am <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> action alleging violation of a federal statute. Abstention, says Old Security, is required in view of the Missouri injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>against prosecution of claims outside the insolvency proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The issue presents neither a legal question of first impression nor one unsettled. In <em>McGough v. First Arlington National Bank, </em>519 F.2d 552 (7th Cir. 1975), the district court had stayed a federal securities claim pending resolution of related state court proceedings. This court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">[I]t is manifest to us that the exclusive remedy sought under the complaint in the District court is not available to McGough in the state action. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s stay order was an abuse of judicial discretion and reversible error, since it relegated McGough to a sterile state court for vindication of its federal remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">That the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over ERISA claims for breach of fiduciary duty is settled. <em>Morrissey v. Curran, </em>567 F.2d 546, 549 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>Marshall v. Chase Manhattan Bank National Association, </em>558 F.2d 680, 682 (2d Cir. 1977). Section 502(e)(1) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides that the federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions brought by a participant or beneficiary, and section 514(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> preempts all state laws relating to employee benefit plans covered by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">Though a state court may decide federal questions, e. <em>g., </em>an affirmative defense based on federal statute, the concern here is with affirmative relief. Exclusive federal jurisdiction being present, only the federal courts have power to provide that affirmative relief. <em>McGough v. First Arlington National Bank, supra </em>at 555; <em>Movielab, Inc. v. Berkey Photo, Inc., </em>321 F.Supp. 806 (S.D.N.Y.1970), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>452 F.2d 662 (2d Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">With no prejudgment on the merits of the case, we conclude that the question of law relied on by Old Security is not so unsettled as to justify appeal at this time under <em>Cohen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">If there were doubt of the absence of an important and unsettled question, that doubt would not aid Old Security in view of its failure to establish a <em>Cohen </em>-type irretrievable loss of rights. The right otherwise irretrievably lost in <em>Cohen </em>was specific. There the state statute provided for security for defendant\u2019s costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, and the question was whether a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction was to apply that statute. The \u201cright\u201d here asserted by Old Security is not the sort present in <em>Cohen,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nor would its loss be the sort there viewed as incapable of vindication on appeal from final judgment. Dismissal of its appeal means that Old Security will \u201csuffer\u201d only in undertaking the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>pense of defending itself in this action. Enforcement of a state statute for a bond, covering potential reimbursement of the cost of a lawsuit, is not equatable with a holding that incurrence of litigation costs constitutes irreparable harm. That view would render appealable every denial of a motion to dismiss. One may not invoke <em>Cohen </em>on the basis of a \u201cright\u201d not to have to litigate at all. <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>American Express Co., </em>558 F.2d 102, 104 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>United States Tour Operators Association v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>556 F.2d 126, 129 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Non-existent rights cannot be \u201clost,\u201d and Old Security has no right to enforce the Missouri injunction. Even the state courts have no such right in relation to federal in personam actions. <em>Donovan v. Dallas, supra </em>note 6, 377 U.S. at 413, 84 S.Ct. 1579.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Finally, Old Security relies upon its \u201cright\u201d to a single liquidation forum, analogizing the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et <em>seq. </em>(1976), with the Missouri Insurance Act, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 374 <em>et seq., </em>respecting receivership, rehabilitation, and liquidation of insolvents. Old Security begins by noting that the purpose of the Missouri injunction is to insure efficient, economic settlement of claims by preventing dissipation of assets in multiple, far-flung litigation, and that the same purpose is served for most corporations by the federal Bankruptcy Act provisions enjoining external prosecution of claims against bankrupts. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 29, 516(4), 714. Old Security then says this case is governed by the Missouri insolvency proceeding only because it is an insurance company subject to state regulation under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011 <em>et seq. </em>(1976),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and for whom the Bankruptcy Act is inapplicable, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">Protecting the integrity of state insurance insolvency proceedings, and concern for their freedom from outside interference, are of great importance. <em>Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. v. Geeslin, supra </em>at 159. We conclude, however, that Old Security\u2019s assertion of a single-forum right cannot here prevail. The Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act (Act),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> part of the Missouri Insurance Act, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 375.950.990, does not itself create an exclusive single-state forum. The Act expressly authorizes separate claims proceedings in ancillary states, <em>i. e., </em>in all states adopting the Act. Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 375.958. Moreover, the Act cannot be interpreted as precluding a party from pursuing a congressionally created federal claim in the only courts able to provide affirmative relief on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">We hold that the denial of Old Security\u2019s motion to dismiss is not a final \u201ccollateral order\u201d justifying a deviation from the final judgment rule of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">Old Security\u2019s appeal from the denial of its motion to dismiss, appeal No. 78-2287, is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\"><em>Appeal No. 78-2282 </em>\u2014 The <em>Motion to Intervene</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-17\">On May 1, 1978, the Beneficiaries filed a motion to intervene and an intervention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>complaint, of which counts III and V correspond essentially to counts I and III of the Fund\u2019s second amended complaint, counts I and IV are asserted against the present trustees, former trustees, Old Security, the Fund administrator, and others, and count II is asserted against the present trustees and the administrator. All counts allege violations of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">When the Beneficiaries filed their motion to intervene, they brought a separate action, in the same district court, based on the same allegations as those in their intervention complaint. Carpenter v. <em>Fitzsimmons, </em>No. 78 C 1672 (N.D.Ill., filed May 1, 1978). On April 19, 1979, while this appeal was pending, the district court denied the Beneficiaries\u2019 motion to consolidate the two actions for purposes of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Claiming intervention as a matter of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24, the Beneficiaries alleged that the motion was timely filed; that they have a substantial interest in the subject matter of the litigation; that disposition of the underlying action would impair or impede their ability to protect that interest; and that their interest is not being adequately represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Respecting inadequacy of representation, the Beneficiaries alleged that the present trustees have a community of interest with the former trustees, with Old Security, and with other defendants, rendering the suit collusive in nature. It is asserted that the former trustees\u2019 choice of Old Security, a company financially infirm and inexperienced in the relevant field of insurance, over unquestionably sound insurance companies, furthered a scheme to defraud the Fund; that the former and present trustees are intimately linked because the former controlled their successors\u2019 selection; that, notwithstanding the clear involvement of the former trustees in a conspiracy to defraud the Fund, the present trustees failed to join their predecessors as defendants; and that the present trustees have evinced a pattern of inadequate, less than zealous, representation by failing to assert certain other claims arising from the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">On September 1, 1978, the district court denied the motion to intervene.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As indicated in a memorandum order, the court concluded that the present trustees are acting in the best interests of the Fund, though not taking every step desired by the Beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Respecting failure of the present trustees to intervene in Old Security\u2019s lawsuit against National American Life Insurance Company (NALICO), <em>Old Security Life Insurance Co. v. National American Life Insurance Co., </em>Civ. No. 76-1910 (D.D.C.), the district court noted that the objective of the NALICO litigation was acquisition of assets for Old Security, making it more responsive to relief sought here by the Fund; that intervention of the Beneficiaries here would have no direct effect on the NALICO litigation; and that such effect could be achieved by intervention of the Beneficiaries in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">The court further concluded that the Beneficiaries\u2019 separate class action against the trustees was a means for obtaining relief against the trustees and would be a \u201cwindow\u201d for observing the present litigation, both actions being prosecuted simultaneously before the same judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">The Beneficiaries appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Only the present trustees and defendant Continental have responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The issue is whether the district court erred in denying the motion to intervene.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">To intervene of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2), an applicant must: (1) timely apply, (2) claim \u201can interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action,\u201d (3) be \u201cso situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest . . . ,\u201d and (4) not be \u201cadequately represented by existing parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">On this appeal, the interest of the Beneficiaries is not challenged and appellees\u2019 assertion of untimeliness is without merit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Appellees argue, \u201cthat \u2018inadequate representation\u2019 requires a compelling showing of collusion <em>between the representative and an opposing party in the lawsuit </em>[citing cases],\u201d and assert that the Beneficiaries have alleged no facts indicating collusion between the plaintiffs and any named defendants.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">All nonconclusory allegations supporting a motion to intervene are taken as true, absent sham, frivolity, or other objections. <em>Stadin v. Union Electric Co., </em>309 F.2d 912, 917 (8th Cir. 1962); <em>Clark v. Sandusky, </em>205 F.2d 915, 918 (7th Cir. 1953). The Beneficiaries have pleaded with specificity, in Count I of the intervention complaint, instances of collusion between the former trustees and the defendants, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-19\">1. Though Prudential Life Insurance Company is a nationally known insurer with unquestioned assets, and its bid was objectively superior to that of Old Security, the former trustees selected the relatively small, unknown, inexperienced-in-the-field company for a cost plus fee contract generating $20.4 million in premiums.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-20\">2. The former trustees gave advance confidential information of the solicitation to defendants or coconspirators acting on behalf of Old Security, employed insufficient and inadequate insurance consultants, and used consulting information slanted toward selection of Old Security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-21\">3. Selection of Old Security rested on its willingness to continue using Amalgamated Insurance Agency as exclusive service agent. Amalgamated is controlled by Allan M. Dorfman, convicted of a felony, whose services were sought and continued despite statutory (ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1109 and 1111) and common law prohibitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-22\">4. The former trustees failed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>(a) To determine whether reinsurance was contemplated or necessary and the identity and financial position of proposed reinsurers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\">(b) To retain the right to control designation of a reinsurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">(c) To establish sufficient control over the account into which premiums were paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">(d) To adequately investigate the successful bidder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">5. After problems of Old Security and jeopardy of the insurance program were public knowledge, the former trustees made a July, 1976 payment of $1,776,000 to Old Security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The Beneficiaries have also specifically alleged in count I a relation between the present and the former trustees, asserting that the present trustees \u201cwere appointed under mechanism believed to be such as to permit the Former Trustees to directly or indirectly participate in or control or effect the appointment of the [present] Trustees or their tenure in office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">We find the Beneficiaries\u2019 material allegations to be noneonclusory.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There being no evidence of sham, frivolity, or other defects we must take those allegations as true. We therefore find in the Beneficiaries\u2019 complaint allegations sufficient to establish, prima facie, a case of collusion between the former trustees and the defendants, and a relationship the equal of collusion between the present and former trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">This suit was initiated by the former trustees, for whom the present trustees have been substituted. In considering the representation issue, the present trustees would have us treat their predecessors as strangers to the action, and would have us hold that alleged collusion must be direct collusion between the representative and an opposing party. That narrow view of the adequacy of representation question is required by neither the rule nor prior decisions of this court. Representation is either adequate or inadequate. Its character must be determined therefore on the facts presented. In <em>Clark v. Sandusky, supra </em>at 918, this court found inadequacy in light of a conspiracy between plaintiffs and a third party \u201cwrongfully to appropriate and use [applicant\u2019s] property,\u201d and \u201cinjury to [applicant\u2019s] property by defendants as a consequence of this conspiracy.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">There is, moreover, a basic unattractiveness in the notion that inadequacy of representation cannot be shown when indirect collusion, a kind of \u201ccollusion once removed,\u201d is alleged and established. Factual allegations reflecting collusion between original representatives and a party, and reflecting control over substituted representatives in the hands of those original representatives, are sufficient in this case to indicate an inadequacy of representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">The veil otherwise existing between the former and present representatives having been pierced by the allegation of their relationship, we find sufficient indication of collusion between the present trustees and defendants, through the former trustees, to warrant a grant of intervention as of right.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-16\">The present trustees say the Beneficiaries\u2019 interests will not be impaired because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>their counts III and V duplicate counts I and III of the trustees\u2019 second amended complaint, and the Beneficiaries\u2019 remaining counts duplicate the complaint in their separate action. We disagree. Because the present trustees do not adequately represent the Beneficiaries\u2019 interest, denial of intervention would be certain to \u201cimpair or impede\u201d their ability to protect their interest respecting counts III and V of the intervention complaint. Respecting the other counts in the. intervention complaint, and the Beneficiaries\u2019 separate action, we repeat this court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Clark v. Sandusky, supra </em>at 919: \u201cThe right to intervene is not barred merely by the existence of another remedy. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The Beneficiaries were entitled to intervene of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24.

At the time of oral argument, Old Security was in receivership for rehabilitation. On February 22, 1979, Buxton petitioned the Missouri court for liquidation. The petition was granted May 15, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\">. The September 1, 1978 decision also disposed of motions to dismiss Continental and Buxton. Buxton was dismissed because his being a receiver did not make him a fiduciary under ERI-SA. Continental did not appeal the denial of its motion. In addition to considering the Missouri injunction, the district court also concluded that Old Security was an ERISA fiduciary. Old Security\u2019s appeal being based solely on the Missouri insolvency proceeding and the Missouri injunction, we express no view on whether a life insurance company is generally a fiduciary under ERISA wi(h respect to payments made to it by an employee benefit plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">. Old Security does not now assert that the important question supporting appealability is whether a federal court <em>must </em>dismiss an in personam action when a state court has enjoined all actions against the defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-10\">In <em>Donovan v. Dallas, </em>377 U.S. 408, 84 S.Ct. 1579, 12 L.Ed.2d 409 (1964), the Supreme Court recognized \u201cthe old and well-established judicially declared rule that state courts are completely without power to restrain federal-court proceedings in <em>in personam </em>actions . <em>Id. </em>at 412-13, 84 S.Ct. at 1582 (footnote omitted). And in the more recently decided case of <em>General Atomic Co. v. Feiter, </em>434 U.S. 12, 98 S.Ct. 76, 54 L.Ed.2d 199 (1977), the court said that \u201c[i]t is therefore clear from <em>Donovan </em>that the rights conferred by Congress to bring <em>in personam </em>actions in federal courts are not subject to abridgment by state-court injunctions, regardless of whether the federal litigation is pending or prospective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 98 S.Ct. at 78 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b765-12\">. Old Security contends that, although technically in personam, this federal action has substantial in rem aspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">If this federal action were in rem, it would present a very different situation. <em>Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co., Inc. v. Geeslin, </em>530 F.2d 154 (7th Cir. 1976) involved state and federal proceedings, both in rem. An Illinois court placed a domestic insurance company in liquidation. Blackhawk petitioned the federal court to turn over certain securities. This court held that \u201csince the Illinois court had already acquired control over the securities at the time Blackhawk filed its turnover petition, the federal court lacked power to exercise control over that property. That property had been removed from the <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction of all other courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159. A federal court which first acquires in rem jurisdiction of a suit to liquidate is obliged to relinquish jurisdiction to permit administration of the affairs of the insolvent under the state\u2019s statutory receivership plan. <em>Pennsylvania v. Williams, </em>294 U.S. 176, 185-86, 55 S.Ct. 380, 79 L.Ed. 841 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"AgO\">However, the Fund\u2019s second amended complaint seeks to enforce a personal liability and obtain a money judgment, not to obtain possession of a res. Old Security describes injunction motions by the Fund as demanding in rem relief. Nothing of record indicates that the district court granted those motions or any in rem relief. The district court is fully capable of preventing inappropriate conversion of the suit to a proceeding truly in rem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">(e)(1) Except for actions under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions under this subchapter brought by the Secretary or by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary.

Old Security admits that the district court is not obligated to honor the Missouri injunction, <em>see </em>note 6 <em>supra, </em>but says the court should exercise its discretion to abstain. Under <em>McGough v. First Arlington National Bank, supra, </em>however, abstention would be an abuse of discretion, and the presence of discretion would militate against Old Security\u2019s effort to invoke <em>Cohen. </em>In <em>Cohen </em>the statute, from which the right there involved was derived, was either constitutional and applicable under the <em>Erie </em>doctrine, or it was not. There was no room for discretion. The Court in <em>Cohen </em>noted that \u201c[i]f the right were admitted or clear and the order involved only an exercise of discretion as to the amount of security . . appealability would present a different question.\u201d 337 U.S. at 547, 69 S.Ct. at 1226.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">(a) The business of insurance, and every person engaged therein, shall be subject to the laws of the several States which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">(b) No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b767-20\">.

On July 24, 1978, the Beneficiaries moved to disqualify the attorneys for the present trustees, alleging conflict of interest.

The court held the Beneficiaries without standing to disqualify, the motion to intervene being denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b768-13\">. Unlike the companion appeal No. 78-2287, appealability has not been here questioned. The traditional rule is that an order denying intervention of right is unconditionally appeala-ble. <em>Reedsburg Bank v.

The quoted reference to untimeliness merely cited the opponents\u2019 contentions. The only express findings in the court\u2019s memorandum are directed to adequate representation and necessity. The district court would not have decided on the merits if the motion had been untimely. Further, the court\u2019s statements that \u201cthis opposition is well-founded at the <em>present </em>stage of the proceedings,\" and that the \u201csituation may change in the course of time, but <em>for the present </em>at least, the motion is denied [emphasis added],\u201d imply renewal; hence they represent an implicit finding that the instant motion was timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"AUk\">. Appellees further argue that the present plaintiff-trustees have strong personal motives for succeeding against the present defendants, <em>i. e., </em>avoiding personal liability for breach of fiduciary duty, and evading any need to sue the former trustees. The argument is unpersuasive in the face of the factual allegations of collusion in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b770-11\">. Count I, paragraph 8 of the Beneficiaries\u2019 complaint alleges that the present trustees \u201cformed or participated in or later joined and ratified\u201d a conspiracy to defraud the Fund.

Collusion between a representative and a party evidenced inadequacy in <em>Cuthill v. Ortman-Miller Machine Co., </em>216 F.2d 336 (7th Cir. 1954).
