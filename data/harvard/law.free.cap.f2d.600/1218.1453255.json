Johnson, who died in a fire that destroyed the building where she worked. At the time of her death, the decedent was a part-time civilian dance instructor employed by the Recreation Department of the Naval Air Station Memphis (the Department), located in Millington, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">Appellees brought this wrongful death action against the United States pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a), 2671 <em>et seq. </em>Appellees alleged in their complaint that the decedent had been killed as the result of negligence on the part of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">In response, the Government moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The Government argued that at the time of her death the decedent was an employee of the United States within the meaning of the Nonap-propriated Fund Instrumentalities Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8171 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Government further argued that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8173, appellees\u2019 sole and exclusive remedy for the decedent\u2019s death was to seek compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Longshoremen\u2019s Act), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">Appellees opposed the motion to dismiss on the ground the decedent was not an employee of the United States. Rather, appellees contended the decedent was an independent contractor employed by the Department to provide dance instruction for off duty Navy personnel and, therefore, was not covered by \u00a7 8173.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-13\">The district court conducted an evidentia-ry hearing to determine the employment status of the decedent at the time of her death. The district court found that the decedent was an employee of the United States, but concluded that she was excluded from being considered such by virtue of a contractual provision in the Employment Agreement (Agreement) between the decedent and the Department. Consequently, the district court denied the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-14\">Thereafter, the matter was tried to the court on the issue of liability. On October 22,1975, the district court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abj-dedup-1\">By its failure to have periodic fire drills, its failure to issue instructions about precautions in the event of fire, and its failure under these peculiar circumstances to have installed relatively inexpensive and recognizedly needed heat or fire detection devices, [the United States] was guilty of actionable negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1310-15\">The question of damages was referred to a magistrate for a report and recommendation. Following a hearing, the magistrate recommended that appellees be awarded $66,998.02 for the wrongful death of the decedent. On October 1, 1976, after considering the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations, the district court awarded ap-pellees $41,500 in damages, together with costs. Both sides have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-16\">We conclude that any remedy appellees may have is under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-18\">Ordinarily, an employee of the United States is entitled to compensation for work related death or disability under the Federal Employees Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101 <em>et seq. </em>The Federal Employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>Compensation Act states: \u201cThe United States shall pay compensation for the disability or death\u201d of a covered employee. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8102. This Act further provides specific benefits to be recovered, depending on the type of injury the employee sustained. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8105-14. Coverage is exclusive of all other liability of the United States. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">However, employees of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities of the United States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are excluded from coverage under the Federal Employees Compensation Act as well as from certain laws administered within the Civil Service System. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, employees of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities are entitled, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8171, to compensation for work related death or disability under the terms of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. Section 8171(b) of the Nonappropriated Fund In-strumentalities Act expands the definition of the term \u201cemployer\u201d in \u00a7 902(4) of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act to include nonappro-priated fund instrumentalities described in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-19\">The Longshoremen\u2019s Act, unlike the Federal Employees Compensation Act, provides that the employer, and not the United States, shall be liable for and shall secure payment to his employees for covered disability or death. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 904. The Longshoremen\u2019s Act also specifically provides for benefits that may be recovered, depending on the injury that is sustained. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 908-09. Moreover, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8173 provides that coverage under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is exclusive and in lieu of all other remedies against the United States for covered injuries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Martin v. United States, </em>566 F.2d 895, 897 (4th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Charles, </em>130 U.S.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>App.D.C. 151, 153, 397 F.2d 712, 714, <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 897, 89 S.Ct. 220, 21 L.Ed.2d 178 (1968); <em>Dolin v. United States, </em>371 F.2d 813, 814-15 (6th Cir. 1967); <em>Rizzuto v. United States, </em>298 F.2d 748, 749 (10th Cir. 1961); <em>Aubrey v. United States, </em>103 U.S.App.D.C. 65, 67, 254 F.2d 768, 770 (1958). Accordingly, if at the time of her death, the decedent was (1) an employee of a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States; and (2) her death occurred while she was acting within the scope of her employment; then (3) the decedent\u2019s estate may be entitled to compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act; and (4) compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is exclusive and in lieu of all other liability of the United States. <em>Martin, </em>566 F.2d at 897; <em>Charles, </em>130 U.S.App.D.C. at 130, 397 F.2d at 714; <em>Dolin, </em>371 F.2d at 814-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">Both sides agree the Department is a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States Navy. The district court found that \u201cbut for another provision in the contract to be discussed hereafter, the facts and circumstances would indicate clearly that Mrs. Johnson, the deceased, was in fact, an employee\u201d of the Department. Ap-pellees contend that the district court erred in finding the decedent an employee of the Government. They argue the decedent was an independent contractor. Appellees point out that the decedent was compensated on a commission basis rather than an hourly basis and further note that she was subject only to casual supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">The finding of the district court was based upon a number of factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-7\">Throughout the agreement, Mrs. Johnson is referred to as an employee and in the files maintained by the personnel office, she is throughout referred to as an employee. Her pay was subject to withholding and she was required to submit an employee\u2019s withholding exemption certificate, was to render good and faithful services to the satisfaction of the Director of Recreation, under whose general supervision she worked as a part-time civilian employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-8\">The agreement further provided that \u201cthe employee will be covered by workmen\u2019s compensation insurance\u201d and such insurance carrier made a payment to Mrs. Johnson\u2019s estate, or heirs, for funeral expenses incurred by reason of the death of the employee while in the apparent course of her duties. The agreement further provided, among other things, that the employee could be terminated without notice, for cause, or otherwise on a short basis and further provided that she was not to be considered a civil service employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-9\">Findings of fact will not be set aside on appeal unless clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). <em>J. A. Jones Const. Co. v. Englert Engineering Co., </em>438 F.2d 3, 5 (6th Cir. 1971). A finding of fact will be deemed clearly erroneous only where it is against the clear weight of the evidence or when upon review of the evidence, the appellate court \u201cis left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1958); <em>Jones, </em>438 F.2d at 5. .We conclude that appellees have failed to establish that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding the decedent was an employee of the Department. <em>See also </em>9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2585.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-11\">Although finding the decedent an employee of the Department, the district court nevertheless concluded that \u00a7 8173 of the Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities Act was inapplicable to the present case because of a clause in the Agreement between the decedent and the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-12\">The Agreement provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-13\">The employee shall not be considered an employee of the United States for the purpose of any laws administered by the Civil Service Commission or the provisions of the Federal Employees Compensation Act as amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-14\">The district court interpreted this clause as excluding the decedent from being con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>sidered an employee of the United States, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-5\">Since the contract was presumably drafted by the United States, and any doubt is to be construed against the United States under these circumstances, it seems clear to the Court that the government itself in the contract excluded the deceased from being considered or treated as an employee under the Act in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">We conclude the district court misconstrued this provision of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">The Agreement merely paraphrases what already is provided by statute. All employees of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities, like the decedent, are specifically excluded from coverage under civil service laws and the Federal Employees Compensation Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(c). In <em>United States v. Forfari, </em>268 F.2d 29, 32-33 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 902, 80 S.Ct. 211, 4 L.Ed.2d 157 (1959), the court explained the purpose and relationship between \u00a7 2105(c) and \u00a7\u00a7 8171 <em>et seq. </em>The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-8\">Thus 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 150k [now \u00a7 2105(c)] and 150k \u2014 1 [now \u00a7\u00a7 8171-73] serve these two purposes: (1) to render inapplicable civil service control over such employees (because of the administrative difficulties), and (2) to place the financial burden of compensation insurance for such employees on the non-appropriated fund activities rather than on the federal government. Section 150k, however, expressly provided that the status of these non-appropriated fund activities as federal instrumentalities should not be affected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">That the decedent was excluded under the terms of the Agreement from coverage under the Federal Employees Compensation Act, which is federally funded, in no way supports the conclusion that she was also excluded from coverage under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, which is employer funded. Nothing in the Agreement suggests the decedent was to be treated in a manner inconsistent with the Nonappropri-ated Fund Instrumentalities Act. The contractual provision in question is entirely consistent with the scheme of worker\u2019s compensation embodied in the latter Act and the language of \u00a7 2105(c). The decedent\u2019s entitlement to compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is determined by her status as an employee of the Department, which was not affected by anything in the Agreement between the decedent and the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-13\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-14\">We therefore conclude that, at her death, the decedent was an employee of a nonap-propriated fund instrumentality of the United States within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8171, and that under the terms of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8173 the sole and exclusive remedy of the appellees for the death of their decedent is to seek compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-15\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1310-11\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8171 <em>et seq. </em>and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(c) were originally enacted as a part of the same statute.
