Layton, 3rd, United States District Judge for the District of Delaware, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b96-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b96-6\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">On June 17, 1978, an unclaimed suitcase, one of approximately twenty pieces of unclaimed luggage, arrived at JFK Airport in New York on a flight from Mexico. Following the customary practice in such situations, the United States customs officer on duty at the time inspected the suitcase\u2019s contents in the presence of an airline employee. Upon detecting a smell of glue that was indicative to him of a false bottom, the official weighed the suitcase and determined that it was unusually heavy considering its contents. He then put a small incision in the bottom, and discovered that a total of two kilograms of high quality cocaine were hidden under a false bottom. After Drug Enforcement Administration agents were alerted, the bag was forwarded to its destination in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Appellant, Joseph Scheer, and a code-fendant were arrested when they claimed the bag at the airport. Scheer was indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). When his pretrial motion to suppress the evidence was denied, Scheer pleaded guilty on the condition that appellate review of the suppression motion would still be available. Scheer was sentenced to a term of three and one-half years in prison and three years special parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">The border search conducted in the present case was authorized under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1582 and implementing regulations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In contrast to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 482, which permits customs officials to search persons, vehicles, and packages even at some distance from the border when they have \u201creasonable cause to suspect that there is merchandise which was imported contrary to law,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> these provisions do not on their face require that probable cause or a reasonable suspicion exist before a search may be undertaken at the point of entry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Concerned that without a limiting gloss \u00a7 1582 and its implementing regulations may be inconsistent with the fourth amendment, Scheer urges that the statute must be construed to permit a border search in the absence of a search warrant only when the customs official has \u201csome quantum of individualized suspicion.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Scheer further argues that the customs search in this case lacks this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>modicum of suspicion because, as the customs official testified, his practice was to inspect every unclaimed piece of luggage.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">We appreciate Scheer\u2019s solicitude for preserving the constitutionality of federal statutes, but are satisfied that \u00a7 1582 can withstand constitutional attack even without the proffered gloss. The Supreme Court, in <em>United States v. Ramsey, </em>431 U.S. 606, 97 S.Ct. 1972, 52 L.Ed.2d 617 (1972), reviewed the \u201clongstanding right of the sovereign to protect itself by stopping and examining persons and property crossing into this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, 97 S.Ct. at 1979. Concluding its survey, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">Border searches, then, from before the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, have been considered to be \u201creasonable\u201d by the single fact that the person or item in question had entered into our country from outside. There has never been any additional requirement that the reasonableness of a border search depended on the existence of probable cause. This longstanding recognition that searches at our borders without probable cause and without a warrant are nonetheless \u201creasonable\u201d has a history as old as the Fourth Amendment itself. We reaffirm it now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 619, 97 S.Ct. at 1980 (footnote omitted). <em>See Torres v. Puerto Rico, </em>439 U.S. 815, 99 S.Ct. 74, 58 L.Ed.2d 106 (1979). In view of this authority, we join the Fifth and Seventh Circuits<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in upholding the constitutionality of a search conducted at the border, or equivalent entry point, pursuant to \u00a7 1582, notwithstanding the absence of probable cause or even a quantum of individualized suspicion, but merely because the item was entering the United States from abroad.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\">. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1582 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe regulations for the search of persons and baggage and he is authorized to employ female inspectors for the examination and search of persons of their own sex; and all persons coming into the United States from foreign countries shall be liable for detention and search by authorized officers or agents of the Government under such regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1582, regulations printed in 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 162.6 were promulgated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">All persons, baggage, and merchandise arriving in the customs territory of the United States from places outside thereof are liable to inspection and search by a customs officer. District directors and special agents in charge are authorized to cause inspections, examinations, and search to be made under \u00a7 467, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1467) of persons, baggage, or merchandise, even though such persons, baggage, or merchandise were inspected, examined, searched, or taken on board a vessel at another port or place in the United States or the Virgin Islands, if such action is deemed necessary or appropriate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b96-16\">. The \u201creasonable cause to suspect\u201d standard of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 is discussed in, <em>inter alia, United States </em>v. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606, 611-16, 97 S.Ct. 1972, 52 L.Ed.2d 617 (1977); <em>United States v. King, </em>517 F.2d 350 (5 Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Beck, </em>483 F.2d 203 (3 Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b96-17\">. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Pringle, </em>576 F.2d 1114, 1116-17 (5 Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Odland, </em>502 F.2d 148, 150-51 (7 Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>419 U.S. 1088, 95 S.Ct. 679, 42 L.Ed.2d 680 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b96-18\">. Scheer borrows this standard from <em>United States v. Mirmelli, </em>421 F.Supp. 684 (D.N.J. 1976), <em>aff'd without opinion, </em>556 F.2d 569 (3 Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">. <em>United States v.

Of course, a different question would have been presented had the customs search been conducted somewhere other than at the border itself. In that situation, it would have been necessary to meet the slightly more demanding standard of \u00a7 482. <em>See United States v. Bowman, </em>502 F.2d 1215, 1218-20 (5 Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
