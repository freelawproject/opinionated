Petitioners would have us order the Commission to proceed with such an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Such relief is clearly precluded by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Southern Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Allied Milling Corp., </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 2388, 60 L.Ed.2d 1017 (1979). There the Court held that the decision whether to commence a \u00a7 15(8)(a) investigation is committed to the discretion of the ICC and rejected the Eighth Circuit\u2019s position that the Commission may be ordered to so act when \u201ca substantial issue of patent illegality has been presented.\u201d <em>Seaboard Allied Milling Corp. v. ICC, </em>570 F.2d 1349, 1355 (CA8, 1978). After an extensive review of the structure and history of the Act, the Court concluded that there is \u201c \u2018 \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that Congress meant to prohibit all judicial review\u2019 of the Commission\u2019s limited decision not to initiate an investigation under \u00a7 15(8)(a) . . \u201d - U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. at 2398, <em>citing Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 568, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 1858, 44 L.Ed.2d 377, 386 (1975).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-23\">It could be argued that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Seaboard </em>in that the refusal here was based on the preliminary legal conclusion that the petition was not timely filed rather than discretionary policy grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While this factor was not relied upon by the Supreme Court, it could be used to bring this case within the narrow line of cases holding that even where an action is discretionary the decisionmaker must in fact exercise his discretion and not refuse to even consider discretionary action on the basis of an erroneous legal premise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus if the contention were that the Commission was wrong in holding that a \u00a7 15(8)(a) investigation may not be based on a petition filed after a tariff becomes effective, it might well be proper for us to reach the merits of that contention and (if we agreed with petitioner) remand to the Commission for a reconsideration in its discretion of whether to make such an investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the issue on which petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>seeks review is the complex determination of when tariff changes are effective, and this may turn on such minutiae as the Commission\u2019s typographical rules for tariff schedules. While it may be a threshold issue, it is one well left to the discretion and expertise of the Commission. We therefore see no reason to depart from the general rule that ICC determinations not to commence a \u00a7 15(8)(a) investigation are not reviewable in the Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-11\">. The entire Act has been revised and recodi-fied by P.L. 95-473, 92 Stat. 1337 (1978). The provisions of \u00a7 15(8)(a) are now contained in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10707.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b583-12\">. The reason that decision is \u201climited\u201d is that shippers may insist on review of tariffs in a proceeding under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(1) (1976). ICC review under \u00a7 13(1) is somewhat less advantageous to shippers than review under \u00a7 15(8)(a). The differences involve burden of proof and measure of damages. See - U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. 2388.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b583-15\">. The ICC\u2019s refusal to conduct a \u00a7 15(8)(a) investigation in <em>Seaboard </em>was based on substantive policy grounds regarding allowance of experimental ratemaking. - U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. 2388.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b583-18\">. For example, in <em>Southern California District Council of Laborers, Local 1184 v. Ordman, </em>318 F.Supp. 633 (C.D.Cal.1970), the NLRB General Counsel had refused to issue an unfair labor practice complaint based on a conclusion that charges had not been timely filed. The court held this conclusion erroneous. However, in view of the General Counsel\u2019s broad discretion in this area, the court declined to order issuance of a complaint and instead merely ordered the General Counsel to reconsider the case in his discretion. Analogous cases have involved mandamus, which may lie \u201cto compel a judge or officer to exercise discretion which he has erroneously considered himself to lack.\u201d <em>U. S. v. Nebbia, </em>357 F.2d 303 (CA2, 1966), <em>citing Work v. U. S. ex rel. Rives, </em>267 U.S. 175, 45 S.Ct. 252, 69 L.Ed. 561 (1925); <em>U. S. v. Gonzales, </em>582 F.2d 1162 (CA7, 1978); <em>Nixon v. Secretary of the Navy, </em>422 F.2d 934 (CA2, 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b583-25\">. As the Commission points out, this is not petitioner\u2019s contention and could not be in view of <em>U. S. v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. Co., </em>426 U.S. 500, 513, 96 S.Ct. 2318, 2325, 49 L.Ed.2d 14, 23 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
