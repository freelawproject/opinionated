Prior to that merger Ruegsegger had served Carling under an ICC Certificate for its shipments from its plant in Frankenmuth, Michigan, to points in Ohio and Indiana. During the same period National operated its brewery in Baltimore and McCurdy held a certificate to transport malt beverages from Baltimore to points in Ohio and Indiana. After Car-ling bought National, it decided to serve Ohio and Indiana distributors exclusively from Frankenmuth and projected an increase of that traffic by 30%. Thereupon McCurdy filed a petition with the ICC seeking a certificate to be allowed to follow the transferred traffic by acquiring a certificate to serve the Frankenmuth to Ohio and Indiana runs.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-18\">It is Ruegsegger\u2019s earnest contention that it had the equipment to serve the increased Carling traffic and that there was no need for McCurdy\u2019s services. McCurdy based its argument before the ICC and before us upon the \u201cfollow the traffic\u201d doctrine described in <em>Smith and Solomon Trucking Co., Extension</em>\u2014Camden, <em>N. J., </em>61 M.C.C. 748 (1953). Carling supported McCurdy\u2019s petition, asserting that while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Ruegsegger\u2019s prior services had been entirely satisfactory and it had no intention of diminishing shipments available to Rueg-segger, it did not believe Ruegsegger could handle the peak summer requirements based on the contemplated increase in shipments.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In granting the McCurdy certificate, the Commission balanced Carling\u2019s needs and the needs of the public, plus the fact that McCurdy would otherwise lose all of its previous traffic, against the fact that Rueg-segger would lose the potential expanded service.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Our review of the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2019s order is limited to determining whether or not the order is supported by substantial evidence, and whether or not it can be found on the total facts to be arbitrary and capricious. This record does contain substantial evidence to support the ICC\u2019s issuance of the McCurdy certificate. We cannot find from these facts that its order is arbitrary and capricious. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) and (B) (1976). We therefore order that the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2019s order in <em>McCurdy Trucking Co., Inc., Extension</em>\u2014Ohio <em>and Indiana Beer, </em>No. MC-119118 (Nov. 29, 1976) is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
