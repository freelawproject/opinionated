Appellant Aquarius Releasing, Inc. (\u201cAquarius\u201d), an entertainment corporation of which Levene is sole stockholder and president, acquired and produced the allegedly obscene film involved here entitled \u201cBelinda.\u201d The other corporate appellant, New Buffalo Amusement Corp. (\u201cNew Buffalo\u201d), is a subsidiary of Loew\u2019s Theatres, Inc., and is the operator of the theater in Buffalo, New York, at which the movie in question was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-19\">Under the four-count indictment which initiated this action, filed on May 2, 1973, against appellants Levene, Aquarius, New Buffalo, and various other defendants not involved in this appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Levene and Aquar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ius w\u00e9re convicted of knowingly using a common carrier for carriage in interstate commerce of an obscene film, and New Buffalo was convicted of knowingly taking the same film from the common carrier, both offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1462 and 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judgments of conviction were entered on July 25, 1978 after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, Curtin, <em>J. </em>This is an appeal from those judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Appellants have asserted many grounds for reversal, including the claim that they were denied their rights to a speedy trial under the various speedy trial plans of the Western District of New York<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and under the Sixth Amendment. Since we reverse on the ground of the denial of appellants\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights to a speedy trial, we need limit ourselves only to the speedy trial contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">While we realize that delay alone is insufficient to constitute a Sixth Amendment violation, a chronological history of the delays in the prosecution of this action, for which the appellants must assume some of the responsibility, reflects an official indifference to the necessity of a speedy trial as required by the applicable Western District Plans and by the Constitution. Although the indictment was filed on May 2, 1973 and appellants moved for dismissal on speedy trial grounds on June 1,1976,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it was not until October 12, 1977 that a jury was finally empanelled, and even then the trial was postponed until November 15, 1977, approximately four and one-half years after the date of indictment. Although various contentions have been made by the government in explanation of this extensive delay, we find no dispute as to the actual facts as reflected by the record or the docket sheet. For the sake of clarity a table summarizing the periods of delay is annexed hereto as an appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">Appellants have specified the alleged violations of their speedy trial rights according to the different time periods covered by (1) the applicable Western District Plans Regarding Prompt Disposition of Criminal Cases (April 1, 1973 to July 1, 1976), passed pursuant to Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; (2) the Western District\u2019s New Plan for Prompt Disposition of Criminal Cases, promulgated pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161 et <em>seq. </em>(July 1,1976 to July 1,1979); and (3) the Sixth Amendment speedy trial clause. Accordingly, the extent and effect of the delay involved can best be presented by a discussion of the lapse of time under each Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">I. WESTERN DISTRICT\u2019S RULE 50(b) PLANS</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">Appellants\u2019 first contention is predicated upon a violation of Rule 4 of the Western <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>District\u2019s Rule 50(b) Plan, effective April 1, 1973. While this Plan was superseded on September 29, 1975 by the Western District\u2019s Interim Rule 50(b) Plan, for all purposes relevant here the plans are identical, and the pertinent provision reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">In all cases the government must be ready for trial within six months from the date of arrest, service of summons, detention, or the filing of a complaint or of a formal charge upon which the defendant is to be tried.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The necessary inquiry, therefore, is whether the government was ready for trial within six months after date of indictment, exclusive of any periods of excludable delay. Appellants claim that the government was required to signify its readiness for trial by filing a timely notice of readiness in writing and that it failed to fulfill that obligation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">To determine the effective timetable, we proceed to the excludable periods which extend the six-month deadline beyond the initial expiration date of November 2, 1973 in this case. In his opinion of August 4, 1976 denying appellants\u2019 speedy trial motions, Judge Curtin found \u2014 and the parties concede \u2014 that the initial fourteen and one-half months from May 2, 1973 to July 15, 1974 were consumed by the hearing and consideration of pretrial motions. Under Rule 5(a) of the Plan, this period, during which motions were <em>sub judice, </em>must be excluded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From July 16 to November 1, 1974, the government took no action, and, therefore, it must be charged with this three and one-half month delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">On November 1, 1974, the United States Attorney sent a notice to defense counsel and the court placing the matter on the trial calendar to set a date for trial. If' this motion could properly be treated as a notice of readiness, the government should be given the benefit of the November 1 date. However, this procedure was not in accordance with the accepted Western District practice of filing a written notice of readiness. <em>See United States v. Pierro, </em>478 F.2d 386, 389 n.3 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>cf. United States v. Lane, </em>561 F.2d 1075, 1076, 1077-78 (2d Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In his opinion of June 23, 1976 denying defendants\u2019 motion for dismissal on speedy trial grounds, the trial judge specifically identified August 11, 1975 as the date of the government\u2019s announcement of readiness for trial, and the government\u2019s July 13, 1976 memorandum in opposition to the speedy trial motion makes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>same assumption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The government further claims to have announced in open court on November 11, 1974 its readiness for trial. This claim, however, is unsupported by anything in the record, and Judge Curtin fails to mention it in either his initial consideration or his reconsideration of appellants\u2019 speedy trial motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We find the government chargeable with the period from November 1 through November 20, 1974 when the next excludable period begins, bringing the total non-excludable time from May 2, 1973 to November 20, 1974 to approximately four months and four days.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">On November 20, defendants moved to inspect grand jury minutes and to dismiss the indictment for failure of the government to supply the grand jury with sufficient evidence that the films were transported in interstate commerce. Since the motions were <em>sub judice </em>until June 10, 1975 when the trial court issued a brief decision and order denying both motions, this entire period of over seven months must be excluded under Rule 5(a) of the Plan, although such extended consideration of the motions seems inordinately lengthy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">From June 11 to July 7, 1975, so far as is discernible from the record, no action was taken by the government which would toll the readiness period. The delay from July 7 to July 21; 1975, however, must be attributed to defendants since they specifically requested an adjournment to file additional motions. Again, the record indicates no basis for exclusion of the period from July 22 to August 10, 1975, thus bringing to five months and twenty days the total non-ex-cludable time from date of indictment and extending the expiration date of the six-month readiness period to August 20, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">Consistent with the June 23, 1976 opinion of the trial court, we have accepted August 11, 1975 as the date \u201c[t]he Government announced that it was ready for trial,\u201d although no written notice was filed. This announcement, made within the six-month notice period, may be deemed an adequate compliance by the government-with its obligation under the Western District\u2019s Rule 50(b) Plans.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">II. WESTERN DISTRICT\u2019S NEW PLAN (SPEEDY TRIAL ACT OF 1974)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">On January 3, 1975, the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161 <em>et seq., </em>became effective. This Act set forth certain mandatory timetables and required the various district courts to adopt after study a plan formulated in accord with the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3165-66, pursuant to which the Western District adopted an interim plan (\u201cNew Plan\u201d) effective from July 1, 1976 to July 1, 1979. Unlike the predecessor Rule 50(b) Plans, this New Plan, as required by the Speedy Trial Act, focuses not on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>obligation of the government to file a notice of readiness, but upon the obligation of the court to bring the case to trial within 180 days of the effective date of the Plan, subject to any periods of exclusion set forth in \u00a7 3161(h) of the Act. Specifically, Rule 7(a)(1) and Rule 5(a)(1) of the Western District\u2019s New Plan require that the government be ready for trial and that the trial commence within 180 days of July 1, 1976. In this case, the jury was not selected until October 12, 1977, 468 days after July 1, 1976, and trial did not actually commence until November 15, 1977, 502 days after July 1, 1976. Of this latter period, approximately 226 days were properly excludable.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"> On July 1,1976, appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial was pending and was not finally decided by the court until August 4, 1976. Delay occasioned by pendency <em>subjudice </em>of appellants\u2019 speedy trial motion is not chargeable against appellants because, as observed, in <em>United States v. Didier, </em>542 F.2d 1182, 1188 (2d Cir. 1977), to do so would \u201cimproperly penalize defendants for their invocation of speedy trial rules and run counter to the purposes of those rules.\u201d However, on August 10, appellants appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of their speedy trial motion, which appeal, according to the docket entry on September 24, 1976, was dismissed upon the government\u2019s motion for lack of finality. It would seem t\u00f3 us that this period must be excluded because it would otherwise \u201cimproperly penalize\u201d the government for the ill-advised action of appellants. On December 3, appellants requested an adjournment beginning on December 6 and continuing through January 18, 1977, and, therefore, that 44-day period is also excludable. Thus, of the 202 days from July 1, 1976 through January 18, 1977, 112 days are not excludable.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">From January 19 to April 4, 1977, according to the docket sheet, no action was taken by the court or either party justifying exclusion of the period from the mandatory timetable. However, the government asserts in its brief that after December 6, 1976 there was \u201ca whole series of adjournments at the request of the defendants.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This conclusory statement is not supported by any indication in the record as to what, if any, periods are properly excludable. Although a docket entry on January 13, 1977 indicates that a meeting was held and that the trial was then adjourned from January 25 to February 15, 1977, no reasons are stated for the postponement and the record does not reflect that appellants agreed to any waiver of their rights. Nor, in the absence of findings by the court, can the exception of \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A) be invoked to serve the \u201cends of justice.\u201d Judge Mansfield charges appellants\u2019 trial counsel with obvious efforts to postpone an imminent trial by resorting to plea negotiations from January through July 1977 and asserts that the trial court \u201cpermitted itself to be lulled by the defendants\u2019 extraordinarily successful delaying tactics.\u201d We have difficulty in believing that the able and experienced trial judge would permit himself to be lulled or that the defense counsel\u2019s conduct can fairly bear the weight of this charge. While it could be argued that time consumed in plea negotiations should be ex-cludable since initiated by defendants, an equally appealing argument can be made that such negotiations are potentially as beneficial to the government as to the defendants. In all events, both the government and the court have an obligation to insure that such negotiations do not interfere with speedy trial requirements of the Western District\u2019s New Plan. In fact, under Rule 5(f)(1) of the New Plan the court has \u201cthe sole responsibility for setting cases for trial . .\u201d At minimum, if such periods are to be excluded, it seems to us that the burden is on the government or the court to set forth in the record what are excludable periods or at least what are the operable facts leading to the exclusion. To hold otherwise, as the dissent suggests, by inferring intentional delay by appellants wherever the reason for a delay is unrecorded, would effectively emasculate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Speedy Trial Act and would transfer to a defendant responsibility which has properly been assigned to the court and the government. Recording is essential to effective implementation of the Act and, indeed, is mandated by Rule 10(b) of the New Plan, requiring the docketing of all \u201cinformation with respect to excludable periods of time . .\u201d In the context of this background, we believe that the 76 days from January 18 to April 4, 1977 are not excluda-ble, although, as appears <em>infra, </em>the exclusion of this period would not preclude a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The period from April 5 to April 12, 1977 is excludable due to defense counsel\u2019s request for an adjournment necessitated by his schedule. In an order dated April 12, Judge Curtin sought to exclude also the period from April 13 to June 27, 1977 as \u201cin the public interest\u201d because of his commitment to the trial of other cases in April, May and early June. Under \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(C), however, the court\u2019s discretion to grant continuances upon a finding that \u201cthe ends of justice\u201d are served thereby is explicitly qualified by the limitation that \u201c[n]o continuance . . . shall be granted because of general congestion of the court\u2019s calendar . . . .\u201d <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Didier, </em>542 F.2d at 1188; <em>United States v. Carini, </em>562 F.2d 144, 149 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>515 F.2d 642, 644 (2d Cir. 1975). Therefore, this 75-day period cannot be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The jury was finally empanelled on October 12, 1977. The following periods immediately preceding that date are ex-cludable because of (i) an adjournment from June 27 to July 13, due to illness of defense counsel\u2019s wife; (ii) the finding of the court that the delay from July 13 to September 1 is \u201cin the interest of the defendant and the public\u201d;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (iii) an adjournment from September 15 to October 12, due again to illness of defense counsel\u2019s wife. The period from September 2 through September 14 is not excludable, however, because the delay was purely for the convenience of the court. Although appellants contend that the 33 days from October 13 to November 15, 1977, when the actual trial commenced, are not excludable, Rule 5(e)(2) of the Western District\u2019s New Plan specifically provides that \u201c[a] trial in a jury case shall be deemed to commence at the beginning of voir dire.\u201d Because voir dire occurred on October 12, we conclude that the period thereafter until November 15 is excludable. Thus, the non-excludable delay between July 1, 1976 and the date of trial totals 276 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">After subtracting the periods of ex-cludable delay in accordance with the above computation, the 180-day limit imposed by the Speedy Trial Act was exceeded in this case by approximately 96 days. Even excluding the additional period of 77 days from January 19 to April 4, 1977 during which appellants\u2019 trial counsel sought to negotiate a plea agreement, the 180-day limit was exceeded by 19 days. As the government suggests in its brief, however, dismissal of the indictment as a sanction for violation of the timetable effective until July 1, 1979 is not mandated under the Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3162, 3163(c).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, this court has previously held that until that date \u201cthe violation of the Speedy Trial Act is not, in and of itself, a sufficient reason for dismissing the [indictment] here.\u201d <em>United States v. Carini, </em>562 F.2d at 148. Such a violation may, however, be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>sidered as a factor to be weighed together with other circumstances in a court\u2019s analysis of a claimed violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial, and, in fact, such a finding may \u201ctip the scales\u201d in defendant\u2019s favor where the balance is close. <em>Id. </em>at 151-52. We proceed, accordingly, to the issues raised by appellants\u2019 constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">III. SIXTH AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Appellants contend finally that the 54-month delay between indictment and date of trial violated their rights under the Sixth Amendment to a speedy trial. The Sixth Amendment guarantees that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\u201d Both the court and the government in this case had an affirmative obligation to appellants and to the public generally to bring this matter on for trial promptly, rather than permitting delay \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 to drag on for over four and one-half years. <em>United States v. Vispi, </em>545 F.2d 328, 334 (2d Cir. 1976). Further, where the delay is as substantial as it was in this case, the burden is upon the government to prove that the delay was justified and that appellants\u2019 speedy trial rights were not violated. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>173 U.S.App.D.C. 280, 524 F.2d 834, 849 (1975); <em>United States v. West, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 184, 187-88, 504 F.2d 253, 256-57 (1974); <em>United States v. Salzman, </em>417 F.Supp. 1139, 1165 (E.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>548 F.2d 395 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2). Although this is a close case due to some delay occasioned by the conduct of appellants\u2019 trial counsel, we conclude upon the totality of the circumstances that the government has failed to satisfy its obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\"><em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), is of course the controlling authority. There, the Supreme Court clearly enunciated the essential factors to be considered in determining a denial of the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial as follows: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right; and (4) the prejudice to defendant resulting from the delay. <em>Id. </em>at 531-33, 92 S.Ct. at 2192-93; <em>see also United States v. Vispi, </em>545 F.2d at 333; <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>515 F.2d at 645. Though each of these factors is important, other circumstances may be relevant as well. <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. at 533, 92 S.Ct. at 2193. At the same time, the Court made it clear that the constitutional right to a speedy trial cannot \u201cbe quantified into a specified number of days or months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522, 92 S.Ct. at 2188. Instead, the approach should be \u201ca balancing test, in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The length of the delay in this case \u2014 four and one-half years \u2014 is unquestionably substantial, and while it may not be conclusive of the constitutional issue, it must weigh heavily in support of appellants\u2019 claim that their rights have been violated. Such delay here is clearly enough to \u201ctrigger\u201d the constitutional analysis with respect to the other elements of the <em>Barker </em>test. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The reasons for the delay were varied, as the foregoing analysis indicates, but we believe that the bulk of the delay\u2014 approximately 31 months \u2014 was chargeable to the government\u2019s inaction, the overcrowded dockets of the Western District of New York, and the trial court\u2019s failure to rule expeditiously on appellants\u2019 motions. While the government may have had little control over the \u201cinstitutional delays\u201d more appropriately attributable to the court, \u201cthe ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2193. This court has previously held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">[rjegardless of the judge\u2019s inaction or the fact that the delay may have been in part attributable to institutional factors, the government was not entitled to sit back and rely upon its pro forma notice of readiness; it owed the additional duty of monitoring the case and pressing the court for a reasonably prompt trial. We have repeatedly emphasized that affirmative action by the government in bringing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>cases to trial is mandated and that it cannot escape this duty on the ground that the delay is for institutional reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"afi-dedup-0\"><em>United States v. Vispi, </em>545 F.2d at 334. Though a number of adjournments were attributable to requests by appellants, their duration was minimal in comparison to the lengthy and repeated periods of court and government inaction. Moreover, unlike a complex antitrust or fraud action, the nature of this case is not such as would necessitate the 54 months of delay in preparation for trial, and it is notable that the actual trial, once begun, was completed in no more than four days. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. at 531-32, 92 S.Ct. at 2192. Finally, appellants assert \u2014 and the record indicates \u2014 that plea negotiations were ongoing for at least a year prior to the date of their speedy trial motion. Good faith plea negotiations by a defendant should not be equated to a waiver of speedy trial rights, and, under the circumstances, the government must assume responsibility for the risk of institutional delays where the bargain ultimately is unsuccessful. <em>Compare United States v. Roberts, </em>515 F.2d at 647; <em>United States v. Carini, </em>562 F.2d at 149. We find no basis in the record to support Judge Mansfield\u2019s statement that the inference is \u201cinescapable\u201d that appellants engaged in plea negotiations merely as \u201ca delaying maneuver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACv\">It is true that the appellants did not move for dismissal, based upon speedy trial grounds, until June 1, 1976 \u2014 approximately 40 months after the date of indictment \u2014 and that this is a consideration which must be weighed in determining a violation of their Sixth Amendment rights. Prior to that time they had been engaged in plea negotiations with the government to avoid the necessity of trial, and it is not unreasonable to assume that they were \u201clulled into not pressing for trial\u201d during that period. <em>United States v. Carini, </em>562 F.2d at 149. More important, however, is the fact that after the June 1, 1976 speedy trial motion was made, there was a 16-month delay prior to the commencement of the trial. In <em>Carini </em>this court held that such post-assertion delay was of \u201cespecial importance\u201d in that the government and court were then put on notice that they \u201cwould be held strictly accountable for the passage of time <em>after </em>the motion to dismiss for want of a speedy trial had been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150. Though defendants requested several adjournments due to illness of defense counsel\u2019s wife and in order to permit defense counsel in early April 1977 to try another case, such continuances would not have been necessary had the government fulfilled its obligation to press for trial before that time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A rigid application of the demand-waiver rule was rejected in <em>Barker. </em>There, the Supreme Court reiterated the rule that there is no duty upon a defendant to bring himself to trial, but that the duty is upon the state, in the interest of the public, to bring prosecutions to a swift conclusion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We do not read <em>Barker </em>as indicating that the duty of the state to bring a defendant to trial is postponed or minimized by a defendant\u2019s continuing, although unsuccessful, efforts to obtain a favorable plea. We conclude that under such circumstances appellants\u2019 delay in making a prior demand for a speedy trial is not sufficient to vitiate a violation of their Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The fourth factor under the <em>Barker </em>test \u2014 prejudice to appellants \u2014 is evident in this case in two respects. First, the extended delay would unavoidably increase the \u201canxiety and concern\u201d suffered by appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>lant Levene as a result of the pending criminal indictment. <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. at 533, 92 S.Ct. at 2193. While not unique to appellant Levene, this kind of prejudice becomes especially significant where prolonged for a period of four and one-half years after date of indictment. Second, and more important, is the possible impairment of appellants\u2019 ability to present a defense which may have been caused by the delay. As stated in <em>Barker, id:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">Of these [interests], the most serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews to fairness of the entire system. There is also prejudice if defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately events of the distant past. Loss of memory, however, is not always reflected in the record because what has been forgotten can rarely be shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Appellant Levene\u2019s uncontradicted affidavit, sworn to in June 1976, describes the difficulties caused by the delay in preparing for trial. The art director and the story editor of \u201cBelinda\u201d could no longer be located, and certain actors and actresses, who previously had agreed to testify, refused to attend trial for fear that they might also be subject to criminal prosecution if a verdict unfavorable to defendants was returned by the jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Also submitted at that time was a letter written by Charles Winick, Professor of Sociology at the City College of New York, in which he evaluates changes between 1972 and 1976 in public attitudes toward sexually explicit films and concludes that those attitudes had changed in a way detrimental to appellants \u2014 specifically, that \u201cattitudes in 1972-73 were far more accepting and liberal than they have been during the last year [1975-76].\u201d The government offered no other experts in this field to dispute his opinion, and in view of his experience and qualifications his opinion can hardly be dismissed as frivolous.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Where, as here, a case turns on a morals point of view, it is important that the trial be framed in terms of the community standards existing at the time of the alleged offense, which in this case was 1973. Consequently, it is impossible to say that the moral standards prevailing at the time of the trial over four years later were the same as those existing on the date of indictment. Hence, there was all the more reason for a speedy trial. The government relies on the fact that appellant Levene has been free on bail since 1973 and has failed to demonstrate any adverse effect on his income or reputation as a result of this protracted prosecution. As <em>Barker </em>indicates, however, prejudice takes various forms, and based upon the above analysis, we find that the fourth factor of the <em>Barker </em>test is appropriately weighed in appellants\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Finally, the violation of appellants\u2019 rights under the Western District\u2019s New Plan \u2014 occurring in its entirety after appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>speedy trial motion \u2014 is a factor which supports our conclusion that appellants\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights have been violated. We cannot subscribe to Judge Mansfield\u2019s statement that a Speedy Trial violation is \u201clargely irrelevant\u201d since it has been established in this Circuit that a \u201cviolation of the Speedy Trial Act is a proper factor to be weighed in our analysis of whether [a defendant] was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Carini, </em>562 F.2d at 148. The government cites <em>United States v. Lane, supra, </em>as authority in support of its contention that appellants\u2019 speedy trial claims should be denied. As stated in <em>Barker, </em>every case must be approached on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis. 407 U.S. at 503, 92 S.Ct. at 2192. We believe that the facts in <em>Lane </em>differ significantly from the facts in the present case. Notable among other circumstances are the absence in <em>Lane </em>of a violation of the District Court Speedy Trial Act Plan, the failure of defendant to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the delay, and the absence of continuing plea negotiations which mitigate the importance of the defendant\u2019s delay in asserting his speedy trial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">After considering all the facts in this case, we believe that, on balance, appellants\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights to a speedy trial have been violated.

The third count charged a conspiracy to commit the substantive crimes charged in counts one and two, and the fourth count charged a conspiracy to commit the substantive crime of using the mails for mailing an obscene trailer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-6\">.

The Western District\u2019s Plan Regarding Prompt Disposition of Criminal Cases, adopted pursuant to Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, became effective on April 1, 1973. That Plan remained in effect until September 29, 1975, when it was superseded by the Western District\u2019s Interim Plan, adopted pursuant to Rule 50(b) and \u201cin conformity with the provisions of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974.\u201d Interim Plan, p. 1. This Interim Plan was superseded on July 1, 1976 by the Western District\u2019s New Plan, promulgated pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161 <em>et seq., </em>and this New Plan will remain in effect until July 1, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b462-18\">. The trial judge denied appellants\u2019 motion on June 23, 1976 and again, after reconsideration, on August 4, 1976. The latter denial was immediately appealed, but on September 14, 1976 \u2014before any briefs on the merits were filed\u2014 this court dismissed the appeal on the ground that the trial court\u2019s order was not final and, therefore, was non-appealable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\">. Appellants argue that only part of this fourteen and one-half month period should be ex-cludable, on the grounds (1) that the analogous provision of the Speedy Trial Act \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(G) \u2014 was intended to permit exclusion only of time periods actually consumed by pretrial hearings, and (2) that such provision limits the permissible period of advisement to 30 days. Whether or not the drafters of the Act had such a narrow intention regarding the meaning of the term \u201cproceeding,\u201d the language of Rule 5(a) of the Western District\u2019s Rule 50(b) Plan is clear that all periods during which motions are <em>sub judice </em>are excludable. Similarly, Rule 5(a) does not limit the period of time during which motions may be held under advisement. Moreover, appellants fail to indicate specifically what, if any, portions of this initial period from May 2, 1973 to July 15, 1974 were consumed by neither pending motions nor other pretrial proceedings. We, therefore, consider the entire period excludable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\">.

In his August 4, 1976 opinion again denying appellants\u2019 speedy trial motion, Judge Curtin did not treat the government\u2019s motion to set a trial date as equivalent to a notice of readiness, stating that from date of indictment to June 1, 1976, \u201cthere was only about four and a half months of delay which could be arguably charged to the Government.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">. The government also claims to have satisfied the notice of readiness requirement by reporting this case to the trial court on a monthly basis beginning in November 1974 as awaiting a trial date. Aside from the government\u2019s own reference to such a practice in its Response to the Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, there is no support in the record suggesting that the government actually did report monthly or, if it did, that anyone received the reports. The trial judge makes no reference to such practice in either of his speedy trial opinions, and the docket sheet does not reflect that any monthly reports were made. Thus, we conclude that the record is insufficient to support the government\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b464-15\">. <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b464-16\">.

This court noted in <em>United States v.

In appellant Levene\u2019s affidavit, it appears that during the pendency of this action an actor was convicted of conspiracy by a federal court in Memphis, Tennessee based on his participation in an allegedly obscene motion picture.

If it is annexed to show that there could have been no prejudice from delay because a jury using 1973 standards would have to hold exactly the same way as the jury did hold sitting in 1977, we think that this presupposes too much; juries\u2019 verdicts simply cannot be guessed, especially in criminal cases involving the presumption of innocence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>OAKES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Abn\">(concurring specially):</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">I join in Judge Bartels\u2019 opinion in respect to the deprivation of a speedy trial.

The indictment charged transportation of an obscene film \u201cin interstate commerce, by means of common carriers . . from the State of New Jersey to the City of Buffalo . . .\u201d But the Government proved only a shipment from <em>New York, New York, </em>to Buffalo and sought to prove its interstate character by virtue of a Greyhound Lines, Inc., terminal manager\u2019s testimony, made in reliance on Greyhound\u2019s Timetable No. 70 (GX 10), that at the time in question \u201cour service between New York, New York, and Buffalo, New York, operated through the State of New Jersey .

A material variance may in and of itself be grounds for reversal, at least if it so modifies the elements of the crime that it creates a <em>different </em>crime, <em>see Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960); <em>Ex parte Bain, </em>121 U.S. 1, 8, 7 S.Ct. 781, 30 L.Ed. 849 (1887). True, we have said that a material variance occurs only if it \u201cprejudiced the ability of the defendants to make their defense to the charge . . . .\u201d <em>United States v. Knuckles, </em>581 F.2d 305, 311-12 (2d Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Somers, </em>496 F.2d 723, 744 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 832, 95 S.Ct. 56, 42 L.Ed.2d 58 (1974). But what is involved, of course, is the right to be informed of the charges against one. <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 82, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). Here the charge was that the film was shipped from the state of New Jersey to the city of Buffalo. Appellants were prejudiced by the variance in proof because they might well have disputed more vigorously than they were able, note 1 <em>supra, </em>that they transported the film through Paramus, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">True, the Government argues that there could have been no surprise because (a) appellants were aware that \u201cas far as [appellant Levene] knew all of his films since the inception of Aquarius Releasing, Inc. were stored in the New York City Warehouse\u201d (Gov\u2019t Br. 13) and (b) through pretrial discovery appellants learned of Gov\u2019t Ex. 9, the Greyhound Lines bus bill showing that the film went from the New York City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>terminal to the Buffalo, New York, terminal. But armed with this information, appellants were fully prepared to meet the charge of the indictment, that the film had been transported \u201cfrom the State of New Jersey to the City of Buffalo.\u201d This preparation, however, could hardly have enabled them to meet an amended charge that the film was transported from New York, New York, to the city of Buffalo by way of Paramus, New Jersey. By hindsight one can think of several courses, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>counsel might have pursued to meet such an amended charge; that he did not do so when first confronted by the Greyhound witness\u2019s testimony is to my mind indicative of surprise and prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">I note that we have previously distinguished <em>Stirone </em>on the basis that the indictment in that case alleged \u201cinterference by extortion with the <em>importation </em>into Pennsylvania of sand to be used in building a new plant\u201d while the proof showed \u201cinterference with the <em>exportation </em>from Pennsylvania of steel to be manufactured in the new plant.\u201d <em>United States v. Colasurdo, </em>453 F.2d 585, 591 (2d Cir. 1971) (emphasis in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 917, 92 S.Ct. 1766, 32 L.Ed.2d 116 (1972); see <em>also United States v. Knuckles, supra, </em>581 F.2d at 312. But such a distinction cannot be made here, where the charge was shipment <em>from </em>New Jersey and the proof was (somewhat thinly at best) shipment <em>through </em>New Jersey.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus I think <em>Stirone </em>controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Even if I am wrong about the variance issue, however, there was no proof that appellants Levene and Aquarius Releasing, Inc.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> knowingly<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> used interstate commerce for the shipment from New York to Buffalo. The Government contends that the interstate commerce requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462 is jurisdictional, citing <em>United States v. Feola, </em>420 U.S. 671, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>L.Ed.2d 541 (1975), where the court noted that \u201cthe existence of the fact that confers federal jurisdiction need not be one in the mind of the actor at the time he perpetrates the act made criminal by the federal statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 676 n.9, 95 S.Ct. at 1260, and thus upheld a conviction for assault even though the defendant did not know that his victim was a federal officer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But in <em>Feola </em>the statutory language did not require such knowledge; indeed the defendant conceded that scienter was not a necessary element of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 677, 95 S.Ct. 1255. And the Court was very careful to hold only that the statute in issue (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111) did not embody \u201can <em>unexpressed </em>requirement that an assailant be aware that his victim is a federal officer\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 684, 95 S.Ct. at 1264.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although to some it might appear overly technical to construe a statute to require proof of knowing carriage in interstate commerce, when, as the Government argues, \u201cfederal [criminal] jurisdiction has broadened in areas requiring a nexus to interstate commerce,\u201d we must remember that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462 is a criminal prohibition against conduct that has potential First Amendment protection. Congress has specifically imposed a requirement of \u201cknowingly,\u201d note 4 <em>supra. </em>Con-cededly there was no proof that Aquarius or Levene kpew that the shipment from New York City to Buffalo traveled in interstate commerce. Although it may be argued that appellants were aware of certain contracts with Bonded Film Distributors under which various films <em>would </em>be distributed across the country and even to other countries, I do not see how a jury could infer from this, or from any supposed knowledge of use of a common carrier, that a shipment between two points in one state would pass <em>through </em>another state, especially when it is not at all obvious from a road map that there is any more direct route from New York City to Buffalo than the New York State Throughway (U.S. Interstate Highway 87), which does not cross any state line.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Thus I would reverse the judgment on these two grounds as well, although they are unnecessary to reach if Judge Bartels and I are correct on the speedy trial issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\">. On cross-examination counsel for appellants did elicit that the witness could not tell what bus carried the film or whether it was detoured on that day, and the witness conceded that \u201cwe will alter our routes because of traffic conditions. . . . \u201d Counsel did not inquire, however, as to Bus No. 3300, the 9:45 westbound, which appears to be express to Rochester, then to Buffalo. Greyhound Timetable No. 70, Table 255, effective Jan. 3, 1973. Nor did he explore the use of the January, 1973, edition of Russell\u2019s Official National Motor Coach Guide which, appellants advise us, indicates several other Greyhound schedules (Nos. 16, 390, 720, 255, 260) showing routes that do <em>not </em>run through Paramus, New Jersey. 1 note these omissions only as they may bear on prejudice to appellant from the variance between the charge in the indictment and the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"Am9\">The Government suggests that the issue of variance was not timely raised. But at the close of the Government\u2019s case and of the defense case and upon the return of verdict appellants moved for dismissal on grounds of insufficiency of the evidence, and in particular failure to prove that the shipment was made in interstate commerce. It appears that the defendant in <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 214, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960), did not raise the variance issue any more directly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-5\">. Judge Leventhal has distinguished <em>Stirone </em>by saying that \u201c[i]n <em>Stirone </em>the prosecution was relying at trial on a complex of facts distinctly different from that which the grand jury set forth in the indictment ...

The record indicates that the delay in bringing the defendants to trial was attributable largely to the dilatory tactics of their attorney in postponing trial, despite the Government\u2019s readiness and the trial judge\u2019s repeated efforts to get the case to trial. There was no timely assertion by defendants of their right to a speedy trial. No legally cognizable prejudice to the defendants has been shown. Thus the standards of <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), have clearly not been met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">The court\u2019s decision works a serious injustice, rewarding the defendants for their attorney\u2019s successful stalling maneuvers. Moreover, the majority has engaged in unjustifiable appellate fact-finding, based largely on assumptions rather than on evidence. In my view, at the very least the majority, before reversing on the basis of disputed facts and an incomplete record, should remand the case to the district court for findings regarding the reasons for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>delay and the resulting prejudice, if any, to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The majority lists at considerable length its concept of how many days during the long period from the filing of the indictment until trial should be labeled as \u201cex-cludable\u201d and \u201cnon-excludable\u201d under the Western District\u2019s Rule 50(b) Plan and its Speedy Trial Act Plan which went into effect July 1, 1976. In my view this procedure serves no useful purpose and is misleading, since as the majority concedes there was no violation of the former Plan and the Speedy Trial Act prohibits dismissal for any pre-July 1, 1979, violation of the latter Plan. See <em>United States v. Carini, </em>562 F.2d 144, 148 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In enacting the Speedy Trial Act Congress recognized that a four-year phase-in period would be required before the sanction of dismissal for non-compliance might be imposed, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3163(c), since it would take many district courts that much time to eliminate their criminal case backlogs and to obtain the additional personnel, facilities, and new systems needed to meet the permanent time limits which would go into effect July 1, 1979. Viewed realistically, the interim time limits have represented hopes rather than firm mandates. Cf. <em>United States v. Amendola, </em>558 F.2d 1043, 1045 (2d Cir. 1977) (\u201cminimal\u201d violation of Connecticut Speedy Trial Plan does not warrant dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In my view, the excludability or non-ex-cludability of time under the terms of these prior Plans is largely irrelevant since their standards differ substantially from the four-factor test established by <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), for determining whether a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, as distinguished from statutory rights, has been violated. When the <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>standards are applied, it is clear beyond peradventure that the defendants\u2019 constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated. Although the time from indictment to trial was long, the record repeatedly demonstrates that if the defendants had really wanted an earlier trial they could have had one at least as early as June 1, 1976, when Chief Judge Curtin (to whom the case was assigned for all purposes) ordered that a jury be drawn, and probably earlier. The Government was ready for trial at least as early as August 11, 1975. Indeed, by written notice dated November 1, 1974 (App. 36) the Government advised defense counsel that the case would be called on November 11,1974 in Part I of the U.S. Courthouse in Buffalo for the purpose of \u201cSETTING TRIAL DATE.\u201d The docket shows that this hearing was adjourned to November 20, 1974, for a meeting with Judge Curtin but there is no record of what transpired at that meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">What were the reasons for the repeated adjournment of the trial date? The Appendix and docketed record, while obviously quite incomplete, furnish sufficient information to support a strong inference that defense counsel, rather than the Government or the court, 'was mainly responsible for the delay. Defendants never sought a trial; on the contrary, they repeatedly sought to avoid trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">Following the filing of the indictment on May 2, 1973, Judge Curtin granted the <em>defendants\u2019 </em>motion to defer all proceedings until the end of June, 1973, when certain cases pending before the United States Supreme Court, which could have affected the prosecution of the present case, would have been decided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the latter part of 1973 the defendants then filed numerous pretrial motions, including motions to dismiss the indictment in a related case (Cr. 1973-118), supported by affidavits and briefs necessitating answering affidavits and briefs from the Government and oral argument on February 14, 1974, which culminated in the court\u2019s denial of the motions on July 15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>1974. There followed the Government\u2019s effort in November, 1974, to get a trial date fixed. Additional motions apparently were filed in related cases, including motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court on June 10, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Immediately upon denial of the latter motions defense counsel Seymour S. Det-sky, whose offices were in New York City, by letter dated June 20, 1975 (App. 34) to Assistant U.S. Attorney Williams in Buffalo, initiated plea bargaining negotiations. However, when the U.S. Attorney by letter dated July 2, 1975 (App. 33) advised Detsky he was willing to discuss the matter, Detsky by letter dated July 15, 1975 (App. 32) sought delay because of his own engagement in a trial. The U.S. Attorney by letter dated July 28, 1975 (App. 35) offered to accept a guilty plea from defendants Loew\u2019s Theatres, Inc., Arena and Levene to any one count of the indictment, adding \u201cIf I do not hear from you by August 11, 1975, I will move this matter for immediate trial.\u201d As a result, on August 11, 1975, according to the docket sheet, Judge Curtin directed \u201cthat [the] case be placed on the trial calendar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Faced with trial, Detsky, according to his letters dated September 9, 1975 (App. 31) and September 26, 1975 (App. 30), reopened plea negotiations by having his client write a letter to Assistant U.S. Attorney Williams (App. 57), and by making an appointment to go to Buffalo to see Williams -about the matter. However, Detsky\u2019s September 9th letter concedes that he then \u201ctelephoned [Williams\u2019] office to cancel that appointment because I was then engaged in a continued trial which extended beyond the dates I had speculated.\u201d In a letter dated September 30,1975, Williams replied he was willing to meet on October 2, October 10, or any time the following week (except October 13) but that \u201cas previously indicated\u201d he was \u201cnot of a mind to accept a corporate plea.\u201d (App. 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The record does not reveal what happened as a result of the foregoing correspondence except that almost five months later Detsky, by letter of February 10, 1976 (App. 28), again sought an opportunity to discuss a plea that would dispose of the case. Once again, this time on February 24, 1976 (App. 26, 27), Williams replied that his position had not changed, that he was \u201cnot of a mind to accept a corporate plea from Aquarius Releasing, Inc.,\u201d but that he would be happy to meet with Detsky.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Thus the picture during the period prior to June, 1976, is one of defendants who were not seeking or asking for a trial but, on the contrary, were trying to induce the Government to accept a plea only by the corporate defendants and, when the Government twice refused any such bargain, were asking to reopen plea negotiations, thus implying that some other disposition might be negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">In short, the defendants\u2019 objective was to avoid or delay trial by negotiating a corporate guilty plea. This was confirmed when, after defendants\u2019 stalling tactics failed, Judge Curtin met with counsel on June 1, 1976, to begin selection of the jury in the case (App. 38). Thereupon</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201cMr. Detsky moved for dismissal on the ground that the Government had not afforded his clients a speedy trial. Furthermore, he contended that he did not represent defendant Benjamin Abrams although the court records indicated the contrary. Later he reported to the court that he did represent Abrams but Abrams had left the country. The Government\u2019s affidavit represents that the FBI investigation reveals that Mr. Abrams still lives in the Buffalo, New York area. It appears that the Government has been ready at all times necessary in this case . . Putting aside the fact that the court since the summer of 1975 has been trying criminal cases, <em>at no time during that period did defense urge a motion similar to the present one. That motion was not filed until the date set for jury selection.\u201d </em>(App. 38-39, Mem. Opin. of Judge Curtin, 6/23/76) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Judge Curtin, in his decision dated June 23, 1976, promptly denied the motion to dismiss, directing that if defendant Abrams <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>was not represented by Detsky he should retain counsel and be ready for trial on July 20, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Instead of availing himself of the opportunity to have the defendants go to trial immediately, Mr. Detsky moved the court to reconsider its decision, contending in a June 28 letter to Judge Curtin that defendants had not moved to dismiss earlier on speedy trial grounds because they had been trying \u201cto work out a plea for the corporations and dismissing as to the individuals\u201d and adding \u201cI assumed that I would receive word on the aforesaid proposals. Instead I received a statement indicating readiness for trial. I state this so that the Court would not believe that we sat idly by abiding our time hoping that the United States would forget we existed.\u201d (App. 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The truth, of course, was that the U.S. Attorney had long since repeatedly stated in writing to Detsky that he would not agree to any such proposals, despite which Detsky had thereafter reopened negotiations. Not surprisingly, the court on August 4, 1976, denied defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration and set jury selection for August 10, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">If there were any doubt about the defendants\u2019 consistent purpose from the inception of the case of delaying trial, it was removed by their next move. On August 10, 1976, <em>the day set for selection of the jury, </em>defendants filed a notice of appeal from Judge Curtin\u2019s interlocutory, nonap-pealable order denying their motion to dismiss the case for lack of a speedy trial. This patently frivolous move served the purpose of preventing the case from going to trial that day as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">As anyone with even the slightest knowledge of federal practice could have predicted, the appeal was dismissed by us on September 14, 1976, for lack of jurisdiction. It may reasonably be inferred from this record that the appeal was taken in bad faith as a maneuver designed to block a prompt trial, which it succeeded in doing. The docket shows that the pertinent papers were not returned by our court to the Western District of New York until September 29, 1976. Thereupon, it became necessary to appoint counsel for defendant Abrams, whom Det-sky again disclaimed as his client after having claimed Abrams as his client on other occasions and having appeared as his counsel of record. This \u201con-again, off-again\u201d representation of Abrams afforded another defense mechanism for delay of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Of course, a busy district court such as the Western District with only three judges can hardly be expected to drop everything upon remand of a criminal case by the Court of Appeals and bring that case immediately to trial. However, Judge Curtin acted promptly, scheduling the case for trial on December 6, 1976. Thereupon Mr. Det-sky, just as he had effectively done in June and August on the eve of trial, moved <em>three days before trial </em>for a postponement, this time because of the death in Ireland of the mother of one of the defendants. Trial was adjourned until January 18, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Faced with trial on January 18, Detsky by letter dated January 12, 1977, to Judge Curtin offered to have defendant Aquarius Releasing, Inc., and perhaps Loew\u2019s Theatres, Inc., plead guilty if the case were dismissed as to the individual defendants and this time advised the court (as had been the case for almost 1/2 years, see U.S. Attorney\u2019s letter of 7/28/75, App. 35) that the U.S. Attorney had refused to entertain the offer. Thereupon the court held a meeting on January 13, 1977, at which trial was adjourned to February 15, 1977, for reasons not appearing in the record. Thereafter the record proceeds in the same vein, with defense counsel, whenever the court was ready to try the case, successfully obtaining adjournments, either because Mr. Detsky was actively pursuing plea negotiations or was actively engaged in trial elsewhere (see, e. g., App. 77), or because he had filed new motions, such as a motion for change of venue, or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">With the aid of hindsight it is apparent that the trial court was altogether too liberal in permitting itself to be lulled by the defendants\u2019 extraordinarily successful delaying tactics into believing that postponements were reasonable and might lead to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>disposition of the case without trial. Part of their success was undoubtedly attributable to the court\u2019s lack of sufficient judicial personnel and its Herculean efforts to dispose of a huge backlog before July 1, 1979, the date when sanctions under the Speedy Trial Act go into effect. For present purposes, however, the important thing is that the defendants should not be rewarded for their own manipulation. To do so permits distortion, debasement and abuse of the right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment, which was never intended to protect those who do everything within their power to delay or defeat the holding of a trial as long as possible. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>\u201cbarring extraordinary circumstances, we would be reluctant indeed to rule that a defendant was denied this constitutional right on a record that strongly indicates, as does this one, that the defendant did not want a speedy trial.\u201d 407 U.S. at 536, 92 S.Ct. at 2195. There are no such \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Both the reasons for the delay between indictment and trial and the lack of a timely assertion of speedy trial rights should weigh heavily against the defendants here. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that in determining whether a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial has been violated, time expended by the parties in plea negotiations should be weighed against the Government. Such negotiations are not a one-way street but a bilateral affair in which the defendant, not just the Government or the public, stands to benefit from any resulting compromise that is accepted by the court. A defendant\u2019s counsel is not obligated to engage in plea bargaining. When he does so, it is because he believes that the process is in his client\u2019s interest and that the prospect of benefit warrants the delay occasioned by the bargaining. Absent a showing of bad faith or an unjustified change of position on the Government\u2019s part (as was the case in <em>United States v. Carini, </em>562 F.2d 144, 149 (2d Cir. 1977)), there is no reason to charge time devoted to plea bargaining against the Government rather than the defendant. The defendant is not entitled to have it both ways \u2014 to negotiate what may turn out to be an advantageous disposition for him and, if no such disposition is reached, to claim a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\"><em>United States v. Carini, supra, </em>relied on by the majority, is wholly inapposite. There the Government was directly responsible for the delay. In satisfaction of charges against Carini, the president of Carini Construction Co., the Government offered to accept a corporate guilty plea to a misdemeanor charging violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512(b) by failing to deposit withholding taxes, provided he would demonstrate over a period of time his good faith by scrupulous compliance with the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s withholding requirement. More than a year was then allowed to pass without any plea being entered. Then the offer was withdrawn by the Government for policy reasons. The delay was properly assessed against the Government because the offer, due to its condition precedent, proposed an automatic delay which the defendant could not avoid if he wished to participate. See also <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>515 F.2d 642, 647 (2d Cir. 1975). No such postponement or delay was proposed by any of the offers to plead in the present case. Moreover, except for one flat Government offer involving no delay and having no conditions precedent, the offers here all appear to have been proposals by the defendants, not the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Nor can I agree with the majority\u2019s statement (p. 378 <em>supra) </em>that when the defendants \u201cengaged in plea negotiations with the government to avoid the necessity of trial, . . it is not unreasonable to assume that they were \u2018lulled into not pressing for trial\u2019 during that period,\u201d citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carini, </em>thus excusing defendants\u2019 long delay in asserting their right to a speedy trial. The record here is exactly to the contrary. The plea negotiations here were initiated and reinstituted by the defendants, notwithstanding the Government\u2019s flat refusal as early as September 30, 1975, to accept the proffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>corporate pleas in satisfaction of the charges against the individuals. The inference is inescapable that the defendants were using this tactic as a delaying maneuver. If anyone was \u201clulled\u201d it was the Government, not the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Similarly, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Didier, </em>542 F.2d 1182 (2d Cir. 1976), relied on by the majority for the proposition that the period during which a speedy trial motion was <em>sub judice </em>should not be charged against the defendant, is clearly distinguishable. There the motions to dismiss on speedy trial grounds were not filed on the eve of trial for the obvious purpose of seeking delay, as was the case here, but months before the first retrial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendants have made any showing of prejudice as a result of the delay. Appellant Levene can hardly complain of \u201canxiety and concern\u201d attributable to the long pendency of trial when the delay was largely of his own making and when he deliberately sought and obtained postponement of much earlier trial dates. More important the suggestion that the ability to present a defense may have been impaired by the delay strikes me as frivolous. If what appears in public media is any criterion, community attitudes toward explicit sex, assuming they have changed at all since 1973, have become more liberal and tolerant. In any event, it is unlikely that the view on that subject of actors and actresses who played parts in \u201cBelinda\u201d would carry any weight at all. The acid test would be the impressions created by a viewing of the film \u201cBelinda\u201d itself, summarized in Appendix A hereto, the notes of two FBI agents which were made as they viewed the film on January 31, 1973. Well aware that the film could be viewed by the court and jury, the two agents would have no motive other than to make an accurate record of what they saw. Appendix A demonstrates \u2014 as the jury\u2019s verdict confirms\u2014 that the chances of such hard, explicit pornography being saved by testimony of an art director or story editor were nil. Finding substitute witnesses for the art director and story editor should not pose a serious problem. Moreover, as far as.the record is concerned they may have disappeared long before 1975, when the case could first have been brought to trial but for the defendants\u2019 own delaying tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">For these reasons I believe the majority makes a grave mistake in reversing the convictions and dismissing the indictments on the ground that the defendants\u2019 Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Nor can I agree that either of the two grounds advanced by Judge Oakes warrants reversal. The slight variance between the indictment and the proof at trial was clearly immaterial. \u201c[Cjonvictions are not now set aside except for variance resulting in substantial prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Knuckles, </em>581 F.2d 305, 312 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 986, 99 S.Ct. 581, 58 L.Ed.2d 659 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Defendants Levene and Aquarius Releasing, Inc. were charged with knowingly transporting on or about January 26, 1973, an obscene film entitled \u201cBelinda\u201d in \u201cinterstate commerce, by means of common carriers, to wit, State Film Delivery, Inc., and Greyhound Lines-East, Inc., from the State of New Jersey to the City of Buffalo, in the State and Western District of New York\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1462 &amp; 2. The evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, as it must be, established that those two defendants knowingly transported the film \u201cBelinda\u201d on or about January 26, 1973, using the common carriers State Film Delivery, Inc. and Greyhound Lines-East, Inc., from New York City through the State of New Jersey to Buffalo, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1462 &amp; 2. New Buffalo Amusement Corp. was charged with knowingly causing to be taken from Greyhound Lines-East, Inc. in Buffalo the film \u201cBelinda\u201d on January 26, 1973, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1462 &amp; 2. The evidence, again viewed most favorably to the Government, established those allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">In short, out of the many details contained in the two relevant counts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>indictment, the only alleged variance is that the indictment read <em>\u201cfrom </em>the State of New Jersey to the City of Buffalo\u201d rather than <em>\u201cthrough </em>the State of New Jersey to the City of Buffalo.\u201d The date, the film, the two carriers, the destination, the names of the defendants and the sections of Title 18 were all completely accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">For a variance to be material, it is necessary that the prosecution rely at trial upon evidence and legal theories not \u201cfairly embraced in the charges made in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Garguilo, </em>554 F.2d 59, 63 (2d Cir. 1977), quoting <em>United States v. Silverman, </em>430 F.2d 106, 110 (2d Cir.), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>439 F.2d 1198 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 953, 91 S.Ct. 1619, 29 L.Ed.2d 123 (1971), and <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 793, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962) (Harlan, J., dissenting). The evidence and theory at trial here were \u201cfairly embraced in the charges\u201d because the essence of the interstate aspect of the indictment was that a particular obscene film had moved on a particular day on a particular common carrier between New Jersey and Buffalo. The jury found, under proper instructions, that the film actually moved \u201cfrom the State of New Jersey to the City of Buffalo.\u201d Whether the film started in New Jersey or started elsewhere is not material as long as the Government proved passage from New Jersey to Buffalo occurred, with Buffalo as the destination point. The indictment itself does not literally allege that the film\u2019s transportation <em>began </em>in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The variance in the present case is far less important than that in <em>United States v. Knuckles, supra, </em>concurred in by my esteemed brother Oakes. In that case, the indictment contained a substantive count charging distribution of heroin and possession of heroin with intent to distribute on or about a certain date. The trial court charged the jury that it could convict if it found all elements of the offense established beyond a reasonable doubt even if the jury found that the substance was cocaine rather than heroin. This court rejected a claim of material variance, noting that \u201cthe <em>only </em>variance alleged by the appellants is the exact nature of the substance involved, heroin or cocaine; the time, place, people, and object proved at trial are in all respects those alleged in . the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311 (emphasis in original). Such a variance \u201ccannot have prejudiced the ability of the defendants to make their defense to the charge that they violated 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>United States v. Garguilo, supra. </em>Since the defendants were \u201csufficiently apprised of the charges laid against them\u201d and there was no danger of a second prosecution for the same offense, <em>id., </em>the variance was not material and the conviction was affirmed even though presumably a \u201ccocaine theory\u201d was not presented to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">In the present case, the variance is <em>a fortiori </em>immaterial. Whether the trip began in New Jersey and ended in Buffalo or began in New York City, went into New Jersey, and then continued from New Jersey to Buffalo does not affect the elements of the crime in the slightest. It certainly does not render the offense proved at trial a different crime from the one alleged in the indictment. Nor should it have affected defense counsel\u2019s preparation for trial. As Judge Oakes concedes, the defendants had the Greyhound Lines bus bill showing that the transportation of the film initiated from the New York City bus terminal. Since the indictment, literally read, only alleged that the film had passed from New Jersey to Buffalo and did not allege that the trip started in New Jersey, defense counsel had ample time to investigate whether such interstate passage actually occurred. Indeed, when the issue of the point of origin of the film\u2019s trip was first raised at trial, during the testimony of the second Government witness, defense counsel was well prepared. On cross-examination he asked the witness about a particular Greyhound bus route from New York City through Poughkeepsie to Albany to Buffalo without ever leaving New York State and he elicited the fact that routes were sometimes changed according to traffic conditions. There was no objection by defendants to the introduction of the testimony concerning the New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>pass-through.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In short, this record fails to demonstrate prejudice or even surprise on the part of the defense that the interstate trip involved did not originate in New Jersey. The \u201cseveral courses\u201d suggested by Judge Oakes in hindsight were fully available to the defense through foresight as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960), which Judge Oakes regards as controlling, is easily distinguished. In <em>Stirone </em>the indictment charged that the defendant illegally obstructed the movement of sand in interstate commerce into Pennsylvania. The Government introduced evidence at trial that there was also illegal interference by the defendant with the prospective movement of steel out of Pennsylvania, and the jury was permitted to convict if either interference was established beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that there was a material variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Judge Oakes appears to argue that the material variance in <em>Stirone </em>was solely that of exportation as compared to importation. Even if that were true, the alleged variance here is far less relevant. Proof of exportation from Pennsylvania involved not only a different .product (steel) but a different aspect of interstate commerce than proof of importation of sand into Pennsylvania. Here the trip charged in the indictment is clearly the same trip as that proved at trial. The sole alleged variance here is whether the indictment implied that the trip started in New Jersey when in fact it started elsewhere and continued through New Jersey to Buffalo. Unlike <em>Stirone </em>the proof was not that the product was transported <em>from </em>Buffalo to New Jersey or was not in fact film at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In addition, this court has already adopted the distinction made by Judge Leventhal in <em>Jackson v. United States, </em>123 U.S.App.D.C. 276, 279, 359 F.2d 260, 263, <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 877, 87 S.Ct. 55, 17 L.Ed.2d 62 (1966): \u201c[i]n <em>Stirone </em>the prosecution was relying at trial on a complex of facts distinctly different from that which the grand jury set forth in the indictment.\u201d See <em>United States v. Knuckles, supra, </em>581 F.2d at 312. In <em>Stirone, </em>the indictment was concerned with the movement of sand, whereas the evidence at trial included the prospective movement of steel at a later point in time. This is obviously \u201ca complex of facts distinctly different\u201d from the indictment. In the present case, the only alleged variance involves one very minor detail\u2014 whether the trip started in New Jersey or started elsewhere and continued through New Jersey. The date, the film, the carriers, and the people involved were all the same. <em>Stirone </em>would be applicable if the Government had convicted the defendants on evidence of a later shipment of a different film, but that is obviously not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Judge Oakes also suggests that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462 requires proof that the defendants have knowingly used interstate commerce for the shipment of the film, as compared to proof that they knowingly used a common carrier which then in fact traveled in interstate commerce. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The statute imposes a fine or imprisonment, or both, on anyone who \u201cbrings into the United States, or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or knowingly uses any express company or other common carrier, for carriage in interstate or foreign commerce \u2014 (a) any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy . motion-picture film . .\u201d The statute also applies to anyone who \u201cknowingly takes from such express company or other common carrier any matter or thing the carriage of which is herein made unlawful . . .\u201d See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Judge Oakes apparently concedes that the latter portion of the statute does not require knowledge by the recipient of the film removed from the common carrier that it had actually been transported in interstate commerce, see footnote 3 of the concurring opinion, since Judge Oakes does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>feel that New Buffalo can avail itself of this argument.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But it is unclear why an additional knowledge element must be proved against the shipper as compared to the recipient. Such an internal inconsistency in the elements of the offense should not be lightly attributed to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The purpose of the statute is \u201cto prevent the channels of interstate commerce from being used to disseminate\u201d obscene material. <em>United States v. Alpers, </em>338 U.S. 680, 683, 70 S.Ct. 75, 94 L.Ed. 492 (1950). Since Congress \u201chas a legitimate interest in protecting the public commercial environment by preventing such [obscene] material from entering the stream of commerce,\u201d the Constitution permits Congress to undertake \u201ccomprehensive federal regulation of interstate transportation of obscene material.\u201d See <em>United States v. Orito, </em>413 U.S. 139, 143, 93 S.Ct. 2674, 2678, 37 L.Ed.2d 513 (1973). That is exactly what Congress has done in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">It is reasonable for Congress to view the common carrier as the important entrance into the stream of interstate commerce. A carrier such as the Greyhound bus company is obviously integrally connected with interstate commerce; even if a Greyhound bus does not cross state lines, it almost invariably travels on interstate highways or purposefully connects with other buses which do.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The common carrier is an important aspect of the \u201cpublic commercial environment\u201d which Congress is protecting. The Greyhound bus schedule which was admitted into evidence at trial well demonstrates how involved the common carrier is with interstate and foreign commerce even if one portion of the trip is purely intrastate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Congress requires that the defendant knowingly use a common carrier to transport obscene material. That knowing use of a common carrier establishes that the defendant is willing to pollute the public commercial environment with obscenity. The additional requirement that there be \u201ccarriage in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d simply establishes federal jurisdiction. Given the comprehensive purpose behind 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462 and the broad power of Congress pursuant to the Commerce Clause, see <em>United States v. Orito, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 143-44, 93 S.Ct. 26.74, it would be improper for this court to create an additional knowledge requirement in order to cut back on the reach of the statute. The statute does not on its face require knowledge that the common carrier will actually move across state lines, and there is no policy reason to support inferring such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">In view of the majority\u2019s decision, no purpose would be served by a discussion in this dissent of the other issues raised by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\n<em>Notes of Special Agents Allan M.

Defendants did object to the admission into evidence of Government Exhibit 10, the Greyhound bus schedule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\">. Appellants as well focus only on Levene and Aquarius in raising this argument; New Buffalo is relegated to one footnote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">. It could be argued that the obscene material need not cross state lines at all, as long as the common carrier uses channels of interstate commerce such as interstate highways. However, since the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt, following the instructions of the trial court, that the common carrier in fact crossed the state line from New Jersey to New York, that issue is not before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">. According to the only Greyhound bus timetable in evidence, Greyhound Timetable No. 70, Government Exhibit 10, there were in January, 1973, 10 bus trips scheduled daily from New York, NY, to Buffalo, NY (Nos. 339, 3201, 331, 3300, 1505, 351, 3211, 1509, 1511, 333), all but one of which (No. 3300) stopped at Paramus, New Jersey. Moreover, all but one of the 10 trips (No. 3300) were scheduled to proceed on to Toronto or London, Canada, some after a brief delay in Buffalo, which confirms the predominately interstate and foreign nature of the commerce involved.</p>\n<p id=\"AxP\">Judge Oakes refers (in Footnote 1 to his opinion) to other routes shown in the January, 1973, edition of a publication entitled \u201cRussell\u2019s Official National Motor Coach Guide,\u201d which is not in evidence, is not referred to in the trial record, and has not been furnished to the court. The only reference to it is in Footnote 31 to appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"a7d-dedup-0\">Since the Russell\u2019s guide is not in evidence, has not been made available, and may not accurately reflect the actual Greyhound bus schedule in effect between New York and Buffalo on January 26, 1973,1 am unwilling on this appeal to place any reliance upon it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
