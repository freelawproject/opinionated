BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1415-10\">During 1974 and 1975 the Retail Clerks Union (the Union) attempted to organize one drug store in a seven-store chain in Montana. Considerable litigation has ensued. The Board\u2019s decision is reported at 231 N.L.R.B. No. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-11\">This petition under \u00a7 10(e) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), seeks enforcement of an NLRB bargaining order against Western Drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-14\">Substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the findings of the NLRB that Western violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1) and (3), by docking wages, reducing working hours, and requiring two employees to take compensatory time off, all by reason of the employees\u2019 union activities, and by responding to those activities with interrogations, threats, solicitation of grievances, and promises of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-15\">A more difficult problem is presented by the Board\u2019s remedial order which requires Western to bargain with the Union. Under <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 614, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), the Board may enter a bargaining order if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-16\">(1) the union once represented a majority of the unit employees,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-17\">(2) the employer has committed serious unfair labor practices, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-18\">(3) \u201cthe possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election (or a fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies, though present, is slight and that employee sentiment once expressed through cards would, on balance, be better protected by a bargaining order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1415-19\">The parties agree, and the record substantiates, that serious unfair labor practices were committed. Whether the Union once represented a majority of the unit employees is unclear,<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> but we do not reach that question, for it is clear to us that the third criterion has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-20\">Although we afford the Board wide discretion in balancing the sometimes conflicting objectives furthered by the Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number><em>NLRB v. Tahoe Nugget, Inc., </em>584 F.2d 293, 304 (CA 9 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 2847, 61 L.Ed.2d 290 (1979), the above criteria limit that discretion. Under <em>Gissel </em>the Board must determine in each case that a bargaining order would best serve the interests of the affected employees. Here, the Board has mechanically applied the <em>Gissel </em>criteria without examining the present context. The Board\u2019s perfunctory conclusion that a bargaining order is proper has denied the present employees their freedom of choice without warrant. <em>Cf. Pacific Southwest Airlines </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>587 F.2d 1032 (CA 9 1978) (Board\u2019s <em>per se </em>approach to unit determination for plant clericals criticized); <em>NLRB v. Tri-Ex Tower Corp., </em>595 F.2d 1 (CA 9 1979) (inflexibility in timing of elections).</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-8\">Although new employees are presumed to support the union in the same ratio as their predecessors and a bargaining order ordinarily will be enforced despite employee turnover,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> elections are the preferred method for ascertaining employee sentiment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Employee turnover, however, should be considered, when, as here, the employer\u2019s misconduct is serious but not outrageous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here each of the three unit employees resigned before the unfair labor practice charges were even heard and long before the Board reviewed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-17\">This is not a situation where the offending party sought to benefit from the backlog facing the Board or the courts of appeal. Nor does the record indicate that Western\u2019s past practices would \u201ccontinue to repress employee sentiment long after most, or even all, original participants have departed.\u201d <em>Bandag, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>583 F.2d 765 (CA 5 1978). Accordingly, we find that an election untainted by the prior coercive practices could have been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-18\">We limit our holding to the facts presented.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The circumstances changed completely before the unfair practice charges were tried,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and there was no unusual delay in trying the charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All the employees in the unit voluntarily terminated their em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>ployment for reasons unrelated to the unfair practices. And the Board\u2019s findings do not suggest any alternative ground for concluding that an election would not reflect the present employees\u2019 true wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">By ignoring the turnover in personnel, the Board denied the present employees the right to choose their bargaining representative. Because the primary objective of the Act is to guarantee employees this right, the Board must not routinely place a premium on deterring employer misconduct. <em>See Daisy\u2019s Originals, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>468 F.2d 493, 503 (CA 5 1972). We share the Board\u2019s concern for maintaining industrial peace, but the order in this case violates the delicate balance between stability and freedom of choice implicit in the <em>Gissel </em>guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">Enforced in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1415-13\"> The Board reversed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s determination that the unit comprised five employees. The Board excluded two temporary employees, Rice and Wallila, both of whom did not sign authorizations. Rice was properly excluded, see <em>NLRB v. Adrian Belt Co., </em>578 F.2d 1304, 1308 (CA 9 1978), but the Board\u2019s exclusion of Wallila is questionable. There are two tests for determining whether a temporary employee should be included in the unit, the reasonable expectation test and the date certain test. <em>NLRB v. New England Lithographic Co., </em>589 F.2d 29 (CA 1 1978) (endorses use of the date certain test). Inasmuch as we hold that issuance of a bargaining order was an abuse of discretion because a fair election could have been held, we do not decide which is the proper test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">. <em>Compare NLRB v. Little Rock Downtowner, Inc., </em>414 F.2d 1084, 1091 (CA8 1969), <em>with NLRB v. Pacific Southwest Airlines, </em>550 F.2d 1148, 1153 (CA 9 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1416-10\">. <em>See, e.g., Brooks </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>348 U.S. 96, 104 &amp; n. 18, 75 S.Ct. 176, 99 L.Ed. 125 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1416-11\">. <em>NLRB v. American Cable Systems, Inc., </em>427 F.2d 446 (CA 5), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 957, 91 S.Ct. 356, 27 L.Ed.2d 266 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1416-12\">. Because the ALJ found that the Union never had a card majority, he never considered whether a fair election could be held. When the Board reversed this finding, it then determined that a bargaining order was necessary without the benefit of a recommendation by the ALJ based on his findings regarding the possibility of holding a fair election.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1416-13\">. We hold only that the Board must consider events occurring before the administrative hearing. At what point after the hearing, changed circumstances may be ignored by the Board is another question. <em>See generally NLRB v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>472 F.2d 140, 141 (CA 9 1972); Note, 31 <em>Stan.L.Rev. </em>505 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1416-14\">. Furthermore, some of the Employer\u2019s other contentions, though not accepted by this court, did raise substantial legal and factual issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1416-19\">. <em>Compare NLRB v. L. B. Foster Co., </em>418 F.2d 1, 4 (CA 9 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 1124, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-20\">\u201cIt is possible that, as of now, there is not a single remaining employee who was concerned with the original election. Thus reliance is placed primarily upon facts occurring after the invalid election, and after the Board\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-21\">\u201cWe do not think that these facts permit us to refuse to enforce the Board\u2019s order. The delay is not the fault of the union; if it is anyone\u2019s fault, it is that of the employer. But regardless of fault, it is an unfortunate but inevitable result of the process of hearing, decision and review prescribed in the Act. And to deny enforcement, with or without remand for reconsideration on the basis of facts occurring after the Board\u2019s decision, is to put a premium upon continued litigation by the employer; it can hope that the resulting delay will produce a new set of facts, as to which the Board must then readjudicate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWD1\">with <em>NLRB v. American Cable Systems, Inc., </em>427 F.2d at 448-49. <em>But cf. NLRB </em>v. <em>Washington Manor, Inc., </em>519 F.2d 750, 753 (CA 6 1975) (100% turnover did not support employer\u2019s refusal to bargain).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
