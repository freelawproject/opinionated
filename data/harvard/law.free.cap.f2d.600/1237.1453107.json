Renner, and that any appeal be directly to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit from the judgment entered by this court consistent with and pursuant to the [proposed] Findings and Recommendation of the Magistrate, and without appeal to the undersigned from the proposed Findings and Recommendation of the Magistrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-13\">This type of order of reference * * * is improper because it is well established in this circuit that this court is without jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from a decision of a United States Magistrate. <em>Swanson &amp; Young-dale, Inc. v. Seagrave Corp., </em>542 F.2d 1008 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>Reciprocal Exch. v. Noland, </em>542 F.2d 462 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Haley, </em>541 F.2d 678 (8th Cir. 1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-16\">Furthermore, the final order is deficient because it fails to indicate the court considered issues of law. After trial the magistrate filed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommended Order for Judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1328-17\"><em>Duryea v.
