These orders are the latest stage in prolonged litigation involving conditions in the Dallas County jails.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We vacate the orders, along with all other orders and stays still in effect, and remand with directions to the district court to discontinue further exercise of its retained jurisdiction and to dismiss the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-14\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-15\">This case began on October 26, 1971, when four inmates of the Dallas County Jail filed a class action suit alleging that they and other prisoners were being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment and otherwise deprived of due process and denied equal protection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also claimed that conditions at the jail violated Texas statutory law. On June 5, 1972, after a trial on the merits, the district court issued a memorandum opinion and judgment. <em>Taylor v. Sterrett, </em>N.D.Tex., 1972, 344 F.Supp. 411. Noting that the County did \u201cnot contest the pendent jurisdiction of this Court to adjudicate the State law ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>tion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 418, the trial judge found \u201cthat the county does not provide the minimum facilities required by\u201d Texas state law. <em>Id. </em>at 421. She enjoined the County \u201cfrom further violating\u201d state law and directed it \u201cto provide immediately\u201d extensive changes in the jail\u2019s physical makeup and operating procedures.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court did not hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>that conditions at the jail violated the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">The County appealed and we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment with only slight modification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Sterrett, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 499 F.2d 367. We observed that \u201c[i]t could hardly be expected that a United States District Court, in the exercise of appropriate pendent jurisdiction, would decline the enforcement of laws which the state, of its own volition, had enacted for the improvement of prison conditions within its jurisdiction,\u201d and concluded that the County\u2019s criticisms of \u201cthe decree with reference to state requirements at this jail\u201d should be \u201cleft to the sound judicial discretion of the trial court, with full power to assay the merits of these criticisms and decree accordingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368. We remanded \u201cthe entire cause ... to the District Court for the exercise of a retained jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">Since entering judgment in 1972, the district court has vigorously monitored the County\u2019s attempts to upgrade its prison system. The trial judge has paid numerous personal visits to the original jail and to subsequently opened facilities and has required the County to file a series of reports detailing its progress in improving conditions. Following each report, the court has issued an order appraising the County\u2019s efforts to date and identifying the topics to be covered in the next account. The court\u2019s orders and the County\u2019s ensuing reports have gone much beyond the scope of the 1972 decree, discussing in great detail both day-to-day administrative matters and issues of long-term policy planning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">In an order dated February 8, 1977, the district judge expressed concern \u201cabout the overcrowded condition and security of the downtown jail and likewise of the underuse of\u201d a new minimum security facility \u201cas well as the activities carried on in all areas of the jail, and . . . the little progress being made in providing expanded quarters.\u201d To assist the court \u201cin obtaining complete information\u201d and \u201cin evaluating the present Dallas County jail system,\u201d the judge appointed a Special Master \u2014 the retired warden of the Federal Correctional Institution at Fort Worth \u2014 and gave him \u201cfull authority\u201d to visit facilities in the County system, question employees and prisoners and examine jail records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>The Special Master issued a report on April 14, 1977. After stating that he \u201cwas instructed to obtain comprehensive information about activities and conditions in Dallas County jail facilities,\u201d the Master proceeded to enumerate 25 wide-ranging recommendations concerning, among other things, jail design, training of officers and supervisors and relations between guards and inmates.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The report also commented upon the County\u2019s \u201cprogress toward compliance\u201d with the 1972 decree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">On April 25, the County filed a \u201cResponse to the Written Report of the Special Master.\u201d Besides attacking the Master\u2019s qualifications,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this document asserted that the district court \u201chas repeatedly held that this case merely involves compliance with state law.\u201d While \u201cthere was no agency for enforcing state laws\u201d when the court originally \u201cretained jurisdiction of this case,\u201d the County pointed out that Texas had since established by statute a \u201cCommission on Jail Standards,\u201d with \u201cauthority to promulgate and enforce minimum standards for county jails\u201d and \u201cbroad powers . to close a county jail which does not comply with the standards and rules, as well as to enjoin violation of its orders, rules, or procedures or of\u201d Texas law. Accordingly, the County prayed \u201cthat the Court . decline to retain further jurisdiction of this cause and remand same to the Texas Commission on Jail Standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">The district judge entered an order on April 27 that referred in passing to \u201cthe completely irresponsible reply of the Commissioners\u2019 report to the Special Master\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>report.\u201d Though she concluded that the County \u201cis in compliance with most of the orders contained in the Court\u2019s order of June 5, 1972,\u201d the judge also approved all 25 of the Special Master\u2019s recommendations and issued 11 further directions to the County. On May 2, the County filed a \u201cMotion for Separate Order,\u201d asking the court \u201cto enter a separate document containing the eleven paragraphs of directions . found [in] its order dated April 27 . .\u201d The court issued the requested separate order on May 12; its contents are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">The County appeals the orders of April 27 and May 12, which, in sum, informed the County that \u201c[i]t is expected that\u201d the Master\u2019s 25 recommendations \u201cwill be followed\u201d and required the County to implement 11 additional changes in the jail system\u2019s organization and operating procedures. In addition, we necessarily construe the April 27 order as a denial of the County\u2019s motion that the district court \u201cdecline to retain further jurisdiction of this cause.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-13\">\n<em>II. The District Court is Directed to Stop Exercising Jurisdiction and Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-15\">As Mr. Justice Powell declared in <em>Procunier v. Martinez, </em>federal courts hearing inmate challenges to prison conditions must \u201ctake cognizance of constitutional claims whether arising in a federal or state institution. When a prison regulation or practice offends a fundamental constitutional guarantee, federal courts will dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>charge their duty to protect constitutional rights.\u201d 416 U.S. 396, 405, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1807-1808, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974). This court has consistently fulfilled its obligation to safeguard the constitutional rights of prisoners in state institutions, affirming numerous decisions of the district courts that granted inmates extensive relief and ordered fundamental change in prison facilities and procedures. <em>See, e.g., Newman v. Alabama, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 559 F.2d 283; Williams v. <em>Edwards, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 547 F.2d 1206; <em>Gates v. Collier, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 501 F.2d 1291. In this case, moreover, even without a finding of constitutional infirmity we upheld a wide-ranging order requiring the County\u2019s jail system to comply with Texas state law. However, we have always recognized that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has articulated for the federal courts a policy of minimum intrusion into the affairs of state prison administration; state prison officials enjoy wide discretion in the operation of state penal institutions.\u201d <em>Williams v. Edwards, supra, </em>547 F.2d 1206, at 1211-1212. This \u201cpolicy of minimum intrusion\u201d flows from an awareness that \u201ccourts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform. Judicial recognition of that fact reflects no more than a healthy sense of realism. Moreover, where state penal institutions are involved, federal courts have a further reason for deference to the appropriate prison authorities.\u201d <em>Procunier v. Martinez, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 405, 94 S.Ct. at 1807. <em>See, e.g., Newman v. Alabama, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 286; <em>Williams v. Edwards, supra, </em>547 F.2d at 1211-12; <em>Newman v. Alabama, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 503 F.2d 1320, 1328; Gates v. <em>Collier, supra, </em>501 F.2d at 1301; <em>Taylor v. Sterrett, supra, </em>499 F.2d at 369; <em>Cruz v. Hauck, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 475 F.2d 475, 476; <em>Taylor v. Sterrett, supra, </em>344 F.Supp. at 412. Thus, we have cautioned that \u201c. . .in the prison context . . . federal courts should keep their eyes on the main objective, the Eighth Amendment command for the eradication of cruel and unusual punishment. The remedy must be designed to accomplish that goal, not to exercise judicial power for the attainment of what we as individuals might like to see accomplished in the way of ideal prison conditions.\u201d <em>Newman v. Alabama, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">The district judge deserves the commendation of this court and the Dallas community for her vigilance in ensuring that the County obey the 1972 judgment. We are convinced, however, that the district court\u2019s role in the process of improving the Dallas jails is now complete. The objects sought to be accomplished in the original suit have been accomplished. That which was sought to be remedied has now been remedied. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the trial judge should have granted the County\u2019s motion that the court \u201cdecline to retain further jurisdiction of this cause and remand same to the Texas Commission on Jail Standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">Throughout this lengthy litigation, neither we nor the district court have ever held that the conditions in the County\u2019s jails involved in this appeal violate the Constitution. In her initial 1972 decision, the trial judge simply found that the County\u2019s penal system did not conform to Texas state law. As we read the various subsequent orders of the district court and the Special Master\u2019s report, the County now stands in substantial compliance with both Texas state law and the 1972 decree of the district court. Counsel for plaintiff inmates conceded as much during oral argument. With regard to the issue of overcrowding, for example, the central concern of the 1972 order, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney said in oral argument that this is currently \u201cno particular . problem,\u201d since the Dallas County system now has significant <em>excess </em>capacity. Furthermore, County voters have passed a major bond issue to finance construction of a new jail, which is now under way, making the problem of overcrowding unlikely to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">Moreover, in 1975, the State of Texas by statute created a Commission on Jail Stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>dards to enforce a state policy \u201cthat all county jail facilities . . . conform to certain minimum standards of construction, maintenance, and operation.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>mission has comprehensive powers over the construction and maintenance of county jails, the custody and treatment of prisoners, the number of supervisory personnel and the conduct of education, recreation and rehabilitation programs. It also has the authority to close nonconforming facilities.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Unlike the federal courts, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>which \u201care not prison managers,\u201d <em>Cruz v. Hauck, supra, </em>475 F.2d at 476, the Commission is charged with supervising day-to-day administration and long-term planning in Texas county jails. The establishment of this body indicates a strong state commitment to improving conditions in those jails and, coupled with the fact that this case involves no federal constitutional violations, creates an especially compelling need for federal judicial \u201cdeference to the appropriate prison authorities.\u201d <em>Procunier v. Martinez, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 405, 94 S.Ct. at 1807. Thus, it is apparent that control of-the County jails must now be returned to local and state jurisdiction, since the role of the federal court in this matter is now complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-14\">Accordingly, we vacate the orders of April 27 and May 12, 1977, as well as all other orders and stays that remain in ef-</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-28\"><em>J </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>feet, and remand with directions to the district court to discontinue the further exercise of its retained jurisdiction and to dismiss the cause.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1226-9\">. We have previously handed down three reported decisions in this case. In addition to the appeal from the district court\u2019s original judgment, <em>see Taylor v. </em>Sterrett, 5 Cir., 1974, 499 F.2d 367, which we discuss in the body of this opinion, we ruled on the appealability of one of the district court\u2019s subsequent orders, <em>see </em>5 Cir., 1976, 527 F.2d 856, and issued a decision in an appeal concerning restrictions on inmate mail and a district court order prohibiting visits from representatives of the district attorney\u2019s office to prisoners without the inmates\u2019 consent. <em>See </em>5 Cir., 1976, 532 F.2d 462.

The inmates, who sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, sought a \u201cdeclaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunction and other appropriate relief.\u201d Plaintiffs charged that they had been deprived of numerous rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-11\">including (a) the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, (b) the right to be free, from arbitrary and capricious punishment, (c) the right to minimal due process safeguards in decisions determing [sic] fundamental liberties, (d) the right to be fed, housed, clothed, and receive medical treatment so as not to be subjected to loss of health or life, (e) the right to unhampered and uncensored access to counsel and the courts, (f) the right to effective representation and preparation for trial, (h) the right to be presumed innocent, (i) the right to a fair trial, (j) the right to freedom of political and religious thought, (k) the right to freedom of association, (1) the right to freedom of speech and press, (m) the right to petition the government for redress of grievences [sic], (n) the right to be free from the abuses of fellow prisoners in all aspects of daily life, (o) the right to be free from racial segregation, (p) the right to minimal recreational opportunities, (q) the right to even minimal standards of comfort, and sanitary facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APIu\">(Letter g missing in complaint.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">. In view of the foregoing conditions at the Dallas County jail, it is the Judgment of this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-6\">1. The Commissioners Court is enjoined from further violating the provisions of Article 5115 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes and is directed to provide immediately as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-7\">a. Sufficient cells and tanks to accommodate a number of inmates equal to the largest number in the Dallas County jail during 1972 in any one day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-8\">b. Solitary cells of not less than 40 sq. feet, provided with a bunk, water closet and a combination drinking fountain and lavatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-9\">c. The capacity of the hospital ward for men shall be increased and bunks provided for all patients confined therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-10\">d. Padded cells with hammocks for insane persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-11\">It is suggested in this connection that the old jail be renovated and the women\u2019s floor in the new jail be redesigned to accommodate both male and female inmates. A reasonable time for the completion of these improvements in the opinion of the Court is six months. Even with such remodeling and repairs the provisions of Article 5115 will not be wholly complied with. The Court directs that the Commissioners Court make immediate plans for full compliance within a reasonable time. A Regional Jail is a possible answer to the complete fulfillment of these requirements but plans for a Regional Jail are not sufficient reason for the failure to implement all the statutory provisions for a \u201csafe and suitable\u201d jail as required by Article 5115.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-12\">2. The Commissioners Court is directed to provide an outdoor area for exercise and a rehabilitative program of recreation. As a temporary arrangement it is suggested that the roof of the jail be remodeled to provide for such facilities, the possibility for which was suggested by the Sheriff. In a permanent plan for new facilities, quarters should be provided for chapel services and educational programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-13\">3. The Commissioners Court is directed to provide jail guards sufficient for security for jail facilities without the use of inmate assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-14\">4. The permanent injunction heretofore issued relating to censorship of mail is affirmed and carried forward in this judgment. The Sheriff is directed not to open or censor mail transmitted between inmates of the jail and the following persons: courts, prosecuting attorneys, probation and parole officers, governmental agencies, lawyers and the press.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-15\">5. The preliminary injunction, heretofore issued relating to the destruction of reading matter belonging to inmates is made a permanent injunction and the Sheriff and other jail officials are enjoined from destroying law books, legal materials, legal documents, books, magazines and newspaper clippings provided such material is maintained in good condition and does not create a fire or health hazard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai7\">6. While this Court will not interfere in the standards set up by the Sheriff for inmates receiving magazines or books, it appears that the policy has not been adhered to and the Sheriff is directed to see that greater care is exercised in determining the books and magazines made available to inmates so as to permit inmates to have reading material not prohibited and to restrict the receipt by inmates of prohibited material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaau\">7. The Sheriff is directed to make effective the new policy relating to rules of conduct of inmates. These rules must be communicated to the inmates apprising them of what conduct can subject them to discipline, the penalty for infraction and the procedure by which such a determination will be made. Before any punishment for confinement of more than 3 days in solitary is inflicted hearings should be held. In case of the appeal of any sentence, the officer charging or sentencing the inmate should not be a member of the Board of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar4\">8. The Sheriff is directed not to allow persons to see prisoners except with the consent or request of the inmates. This has particular reference to \u201ccopout\u201d men, who have had free access to the jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7V\">9. The Sheriff is directed to inaugurate a classification system taking into consideration security, integration and status of inmates as to whether they are pretrial detainees or convicted inmates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHMs\">10. The Sheriff is enjoined from using inmates as corridor bosses to enforce rules and preserve discipline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A41\">11. The Sheriff is directed not to use any cell of less than 40 square feet, not to place more inmates in cells and tanks than those such facilities are designed to accommodate, nor to place anyone in a solitary cell unless it is provided with a bunk, water closet and a combination fountain and lavatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arqz\">12. The Sheriff is directed to have employees and inmates handling food examined by a licensed physician to detect the presence of communicable diseases as required by Article 705d of the Texas Penal Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJL\">Attorneys fees are denied. Costs are taxed against Defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avlx\">While this opinion closes this case it may be reopened within a reasonable time on application of the plaintiffs contending that Defendants are not making a diligent, good faith effort to comply with the order of this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzX4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number><em>Taylor v.

We noted \u201c[a]s to Paragraph 7 of the District Court order, relating to rules of conduct of inmates . . that the Sheriff has, . . filed such rules with the District Court.\u201d Although we concluded that this issue was therefore \u201csubstantially moot,\u201d we stated that \u201cthe District Court will be free to enter any modification or amendments as may appear appropriate within\u201d Supreme Court precedent. 499 F.2d at 368. Regarding Paragraph 8 of the District Court order, which directed the Sheriff \u201cnot to allow persons to see prisoners except with the consent or the request of the inmates,\u201d we called this provision \u201ctoo restrictive, especially since the primary jurisdiction of the federal courts in this area is limited to the vindication of rights guaranteed by the federal constitution,\u201d and suggested that upon remand the district court attempt \u201cspecifically to limit this requirement to the evil it is intended to extirpate, if that evil does, in fact, rise to constitutional dimensions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">. For example, in an order dated October 9, 1974 the district court expressed an interest \u201cin the attitude of inmates toward the use of closed TV for religious and exercise programs and of commercial channels for education and entertainment, and in the effect of such programs on the discipline in the jail. The Defendants are directed to report specifically on such results.\u201d Similarly, in her December 10, 1974 order, the district judge requested the Commissioners \u201cto report specifically\u201d on, among other things, \u201cthe effect of commercial television on the attitude of the inmates and its effect on rule violations, sick calls and the general atmosphere of the jail,\u201d as well as \u201cthe hiring of a full time dentist.\u201d The district court advised the County in an order dated June 23, 1975 that the adoption of a bond program to finance new jail facilities \u201cshould be the first objective of the Commissioner\u2019s Court,\u201d suggested that \u201c[a] program to bring to the people information concerning the needs of the county in providing\u201d an effective \u201ccriminal justice system should be adopted immediately and forthwith implemented,\u201d and stated that \u201c[a]n informed electorate should therefore be the first objective of the Commissioner\u2019s Court.\u201d In her October 4, 1976 order, the trial judge \u201curged\u201d the jail director \u201cto try to obtain volunteers to assist in the library,\u201d and the sheriff \u201cto continue to hire retired army personnel\u201d for his department\u2019s Detentions Bureau.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">. In addition to numerous comments regarding the design of the existing jail, which he viewed as \u201cthe worst imaginable,\u201d the Special Master recommended the reorganization of \u201cthe Sheriffs Department staff in such a manner as to provide a clear distinction between detention officers and deputy sheriffs who have other duties.\u201d He suggested that supervisory personnel be sent \u201cto some of the many institutes, seminars, and conferences on criminal justice, detention, and corrections,\u201d because \u201c[o]ver time, this will result in many valuable contacts being made,\u201d and advised that \u201c[t]he Sheriffs Department should be prepared to do without the jail director\u2019s services for several months . in order that he can get some training and be prepared to do his job adequately.\u201d The Master further recommended a thorough \u201cscouring and cleaning\u201d of the cells on two floors, in part because this activity \u201cwould be of great help in enabling the officers and inmates to get to know each other better,\u201d and urged \u201cthat the supervisors require the officers who work\u201d the floors of the jail to \u201cstay mobile, that they walk through the tank corridors frequently on non-scheduled basis\u201d and \u201cdevelop the practice of engaging in numerous casual conversations with the inmates.\u201d According to the Master, \u201c[pjeople in confinement need to have a frequent means of expressing themselves,\u201d and \u201c[cjasual ongoing banter with the personnel . . relieves frustration, takes off the pressure, and results in a safer and more civil situation.\u201d The Master also advised changes in the allotment of soap powder and the frequency with which inmates\u2019 \u201cunderwear and socks\u201d were laundered, suggested \u201can upgrading of the computer capability of the Sheriff\u2019s Department,\u201d discussed the need for hot food carts and recommended \u201cthat the opaque glass in the window slots on the outside walls be replaced with transparent glass or plexiglass.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1229-11\">. The Master reported that \u201c[cjurrently used segregation cells ... do not meet the standards provided\u201d under Texas law, but noted that \u201cit will not be physically possible for the County to achieve compliance with\u201d state law regarding overcrowding \u201cuntil new facilities become available.\u201d He said that the County had not yet constructed an outdoor recreation area, but added that \u201c[t]he necessity for a place for outdoor recreation ... is currently being taken into account by those involved in planning new facilities.\u201d Finally, the Master stated that the County had not developed \u201can adequate classification system,\u201d as required by the 1972 injunction. Otherwise, he concluded that the County had fully complied with the district court\u2019s original order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1229-12\">. The County asserted that \u201cthe Master\u2019s expertise is wholly limited to federal penitentiaries which serve an entirely different function\u201d than do the County\u2019s jails, contended that his experience also involved \u201cprimarily minimum security facilities,\u201d while the County system consisted \u201cprimarily [of] maximum security facilities,\u201d pointed out that the Master had no background in prison design, and noted that \u201cthe facilities planned by the Commissioners Court include,\u201d along with a new County jail, \u201cother elements of a criminal justice system such as courts, clerk\u2019s offices, judges\u2019 chambers [and] sheriff\u2019s office. . . . The evidence fails to show that the Master has had any experience, operational or otherwise, in connection with such facilities rendering him completely lacking in qualifications to design or oversee the design of any such facilities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">. Under the May 12 order,</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">1. The Commissioners are directed by July 15, 1977, to select a site for new facilities, to enter into a contract for the purchase of same and to have adopted a plan for jail and court facilities to be completed by July 15, 1979. Otherwise, the jail will be immediately, closed to any new inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">2. Beginning on May 2, 1977, the Sheriff is directed not to accept any inmates beyond the capacity of each of these two facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">3. The Commissioner\u2019s Court is directed to provide sufficient deputies to the Sheriff for the security of the jail and for county patrol. Undoubtedly citizens of this county are interested in having a safer and secure jail to house criminals and to patrol the county to prevent crime and to serve warrants and other court writs. The Court noted with satisfaction from the newspapers that $300,000 had been released by the Commissioner\u2019s Court to the Sheriff for his needs. While this Court is not sufficiently informed to determine the exact number of deputies needed or the amount of money needed, it is obvious that the present number is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">4. The Sheriff is directed to inaugurate a systematic means of selecting inmates for Woodlawn so as to materially increase their number. With an improved system this is possible. The number should reach 200 to 250 inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">5. The Sheriff is directed to provide at least one hour per week of outdoor exercise for each Woodlawn inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-11\">6. The Sheriff is directed to furnish sufficient deputies for fully implementing the exercise and closed circuit TV programs. It is impossible for the deputy in charge of these programs to perform his duties adequately without additional assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad1n\">7. The Commissioner\u2019s Court is directed to furnish food carts adequate to serve hot food for every floor of the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"arr-dedup-1\">8. The Sheriff is directed to improve mail handling procedure so that letters from lawyers and the courts are not even inadvertently opened.</p>\n<p id=\"AxNs\">9. The Commissioner\u2019s Court is directed to expand the pre-trial release program.</p>\n<p id=\"A_6\">10. The Commissioner\u2019s Court is directed to furnish more adequate facilities for visiting between inmates and their families.</p>\n<p id=\"A1j\">11. The Commissioner\u2019s Court and Sheriff are directed to file their next report on August 1, 1977. Said report shall include progress on all matters herein ordered except the items on which an earlier report has been ordered. The Sheriff is also directed to include in his report the daily number of inmates in each of the jail facilities from July 15th to July 30th, 1977. The report should also include plans for the future use of the present downtown facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1230-21\">. Plaintiffs contend that the April 27 and May 12 orders are not appealable. However, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) the courts of appeals have jurisdiction of appeals from interlocutory orders of the district courts \u201cgranting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions . . . In our view, the two orders appealed from, by issuing further directions to the County, have the effect of modifying the district court\u2019s 1972 injunction. Moreover, the County\u2019s response to the report of the Special Master asked the district court to \u201cdecline to retain further jurisdiction\u201d; we interpret this request as a motion to dissolve the original injunction and therefore regard the April 27 and May 12 orders as examples of the refusals \u201cto dissolve or modify injunctions\u201d contemplated by section 1292(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">.
