They advertised the plate through a direct mailing to about 675,000 people. Trein\u2019s obtained the names by purchasing approximately 1,000,000 gummed mailing labels from Midwest Lists, a list broker connected with Bradford. Trein\u2019s paid $40,000 for the labels and agreed not to make or keep copies of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-19\">In January 1978, Bradford brought this action, charging Trein\u2019s with trade-mark violation, deceptive trade practices, unfair competition, and appropriation of Bradford\u2019s reputation and good will. They sought compensatory and punitive damages, and an order restraining Trein\u2019s from copying or imitating Bradford\u2019s logo or any of its business forms or literature. In addition, Bradford asked that Trein\u2019s \u201cbe ordered to inform their customers in writing that they have no connection or association of any kind with The Bradford Exchange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-20\">Within a short time after the action was filed, attorneys for the parties met and arrived at a partial settlement which included an agreed injunction. The injunction, which was approved by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>court on January 24, 1978, required Trein\u2019s to notify all persons to whom the plate advertisement was sent that Trein\u2019s has no connection, association, or affiliation with Bradford.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Trein\u2019s assert that when they received a copy of the agreed injunction, they discovered that their attorney had agreed to an injunction which required them to send a disclaimer to all persons who received the advertisement, rather than to 9,000 persons who had ordered the plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The attorney for Trein\u2019s immediately wrote to the attorney for Bradford to explain the mistake, and proposed an amendment to the injunction by which Trein\u2019s would send disclaimers to only those people who answered the advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Bradford refused to amend the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">On February 3, 1978, Trein\u2019s filed a motion to correct the agreed injunction. In the notice of motion, Trein\u2019s set out the facts and sought equitable relief on the ground that it was unfair to hold them to the terms of the agreed injunction which had been executed by mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">On February 10, 1978, the district court denied the motion, but suggested that the parties try to agree upon an amendment to the injunction, \u201cwhich the court believes should be possible.\u201d The court stated that \u201cif defendants cannot reach an agreed amendment with plaintiff . . ., then a hearing will be required either on a motion filed under F.R.C.P. 60(b) or on some other equitable basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Bradford again refused to amend the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">On February 21, 1978, Trein\u2019s filed a second and expanded motion to amend the injunction. They followed the district court\u2019s suggestion and moved under Rule 60(b). Trein\u2019s supported their motion with affidavits from their business manager, James Petrozzini, and their attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">In his affidavit, Petrozzini stated that, after receiving Bradford\u2019s complaint, he instructed Trein\u2019s attorneys to settle the in-junctive aspects of the case. In particular, he told the attorneys that Trein\u2019s would agree to notify all of their \u201ccustomers that The Trein\u2019s Exchange had no connection with The Bradford Exchange.\u201d He assumed that the disclaimer would be sent to people who responded to the solicitation for the plate. Petrozzini did not believe that Bradford had a valid action, but he did not want to incur the costs of defense, particularly since the mailing campaign was so unsuccessful. He said that only about 9,000 people answered the advertisement, and that Trein\u2019s expected to lose at least $70,000 on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">Petrozzini also stated that it would cost Trein\u2019s $140,000 to send disclaimers to all of the 675,000 people to whom the plate advertisement was sent. That, he asserted, was more than the cost of litigating the whole action. In addition, Trein\u2019s would have to purchase a new mailing list because they no longer had the original labels. There was no guarantee, however, that a new list would contain the same names as the original labels. And even if an identical list could be obtained, Petrozzini contended that he had no way to determine which 675,000 people received the plate advertisement, because approximately 300,000 out of the original 1,000,000 labels were used in a mailing which is unrelated to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">Finally, Petrozzini said that, if requested, Trein\u2019s would place disclaimer notices in trade magazines of general circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-18\">Trein\u2019s attorney also filed an affidavit in which he said that his clients authorized him to agree to send a disclaimer to their customers as part of an agreed injunction. He \u201cmistakenly assumed that this meant the persons to whom the [plate advertisement] was sent. After entry of the injunction, I was informed that my clients . would not have agreed to send the disclaimer to everyone who received the mailing</p>\n<p id=\"b191-19\">Bradford did not controvert either affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-20\">The court denied Trein\u2019s second motion without a hearing, even though it stated that \u201cthe hardship imposed on [Trein\u2019s] be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>cause of the apparent misunderstanding of their attorney may be onerous and expensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">A motion under Rule 60(b) is addressed to the sound discretion of the district court and will be disturbed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>De Filippis v. United States, </em>567 F.2d 341 (7th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">An attorney may not consent to a final disposition of his client\u2019s case without express authority. <em>Associates Discount Corporation v. Goldman, </em>524 F.2d 1051 (3rd Cir. 1975); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Colorado Trust Deed Funds, Inc., </em>366 F.2d 136 (10th Cir. 1966). Although an attorney of record is presumed to have his client\u2019s authority to compromise and settle litigation, a judgment entered upon an agreement by the attorney may be set aside on affirmative proof that the attorney had no right to consent to its entry. <em>United States v. Beebe, </em>180 U.S. 343, 21 S.Ct. 371, 45 L.Ed. 563 (1901); <em>Thomas v. Colorado Trust Deed Funds, Inc., supra; In re Gsand, </em>153 F.2d 1001 (3rd Cir. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In <em>Gsand, </em>a creditor\u2019s attorney was employed to prosecute a claim against a bankrupt debtor. He had no authority to consent to an order that cash payments previously made by the debtor were voidable preferences, so that his client had no right to them. The court held that the attorney\u2019s lack of authority entitled the creditor to have the consent order vacated under Rule 60(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In <em>Thomas v. Colorado Trust Deed Funds, supra, </em>defendant Thomas did not authorize his attorney to stipulate to a judgment against him in an action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against five defendants. Thomas filed a motion under Rule 60(b) to vacate the judgment. The district court denied the motion. The Court of Appeals reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">In <em>Associates Discount v. Goldman, supra, </em>defendant\u2019s attorney stipulated to a consent judgment against defendant on a written guaranty. Defendant later contended that her attorney had no authority to stipulate to the consent judgment. She filed a motion to vacate the judgment. The district court denied the motion on the ground, among others, that even though the record was equivocal on the issue of counsel\u2019s authority, there was no basis for a finding of inadvertence or excusable neglect under Rule 60(b)(1). The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to the district court to consider counsel\u2019s authority to consent to the entry of judgment. The Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">\u201c[t]he question of authority in this respect blends into a consideration of the allegations of mistake and inadvertence.. These grounds may be invoked whether they apply to counsel or to client.\u201d 524 F.2d at 1054.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Here, Trein\u2019s presented affirmative evidence that their attorney had no authority to consent to an injunction which would require them to mail at least 675,000 disclaimers. Bradford has not controverted any of these statements. In our view, the obligations which Trein\u2019s assumed were so onerous and costly that it is dubious whether Trein\u2019s would have given their attorneys authority to stipulate to an injunction with such a provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">In the circumstances, we remand this case to the district court to consider the existence of counsel\u2019s authority to consent to the agreed injunction, and to determine whether Trein\u2019s is entitled to be relieved of that portion of the injunction which requires them to send disclaimers to all persons who received the plate advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b192-14\">HARLINGTON WOOD, Jr., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVT8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">Plaintiff raises issues questioning the timeliness of the appeal and the use by defendant of a Rule 60(b) motion. Although the majority does not directly address those preliminary issues, I have come to the conclusion, as is implied by the majority, that although the issues are not without some substance they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>However, I would not remand the issue of the attorney\u2019s authority for further hearing. I view this ease only as one in which the defendants now seek to have this court relieve them from the burden of their own agreement, a burden which on second thought they decided was too much.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">No one suggests that defendants\u2019 counsel was not experienced and competent, nor that defendants were not knowledgeable and experienced businessmen. They were in communication with each other. The language' of this stipulation was plain, simple and understandable even by laymen. It provided that the defendants were to notify in writing \u201call persons\u201d to whom they had sent the advertising material appropriated from plaintiff. Now defendants argue that they intended only to agree to notify those on the list who had responded and become \u201ccustomers\u201d of the defendants. \u201cCustomers\u201d appears to be a new word. It does not appear in the stipulation. There is ample reason and justification for requiring defendants to notify all the people the second time that they did the first time whether the recipients of the misleading advertising responded or not. The effects of the misleading advertising could be lingering and harmful to plaintiff in its business and customer relations as plaintiff has alleged. It should be noted that defendants do not question the other provisions of the stipulation enjoining defendants from copying plaintiff\u2019s logo and forms, or distributing any more misleading advertising, or the requirement that defendants destroy what they have left of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">I do not find it so dubious, as does the majority, that defendants would have agreed to use the same list the second time that they did the first. Originally when defendants thought they could benefit from a large mailing of misleading advertising in search of customers they did not question the expense involved. It would be expensive both times, but although the second mailing would not generate profits, it could at least be expected to minimize any damages which might be found owing by defendants. Defendants apparently did not consider their first improper mailing to be onerous, so I would not find a mailing for a good purpose to be onerous the second time around.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">I would not disturb the trial judge\u2019s ruling and would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
