Because of concessions made by Petitioners, only one issue remained for decision, namely, whether G-0 Enterprises, Inc., a corporation in which Petitioner John R. Ozier was a stockholder, was eligible under Sections 1371 and 1372 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C.), to elect to be taxed in 1969 as a small business corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-27\">The Tax Court, in its Memorandum Findings of Fact and Opinion, held that G-0 Enterprises, Inc. was not eligible to elect to be taxed in 1969 as a small business corporation. T.C.Memo. 1977-53, Docket No. 4392-74. Pursuant to that determination the Tax Court entered its Decision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>there is a deficiency in the amount of $66,-244.28 in Petitioners\u2019 income tax for the taxable year 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Upon consideration, we are of the opinion that the findings of fact adopted by the Tax Court are supported by substantial evidence and its conclusions of law are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We therefore affirm the decision of the Tax Court on its Memorandum Findings of Fact and Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
