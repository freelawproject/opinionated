ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b995-17\">In these cases, petitioners challenge the validity of regulations promulgated for medium and heavy trucks <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) purportedly pursuant to the Noise Control Act of 1972.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because of jurisdictional limitations on review of these regulations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we find ourselves unable to rule on the merits of petitioners\u2019 arguments save in one respect. That exception is their attack on warranty provisions of the regulations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and these we find to be invalid under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b995-19\">The Noise Control Act of 1972 is another in the series of major congressional efforts to achieve at least a minimum acceptable level of environmental quality. A prominent and integral feature of the Act\u2019s regulatory scheme is the promulgation of noise emission standards,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a function delegated to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Administrator is required to compile and publish a report identifying those products or classes of products which in his judgment constitute \u201cmajor sources of noise.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It thereafter becomes incumbent upon the Administrator to prescribe regulations covering identified products within four categories when noise emission standards are deemed feasible.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The regulations must set standards limiting noise emission from such products, and may erect testing procedures to acquire compliance with the emission standards.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With exceptions inapplicable here, distribution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>noncomplying products in interstate commerce is prohibited.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In 1974, responsively to these statutory mandates, the Administrator identified as major noise sources medium and heavy trucks with gross vehicle weight ratings in excess of 10,000 pounds, and proposed detailed regulations dealing with them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The proposals included not only noise emission standards but test methodology, enforcement programs and warranty requirements as well. After rulemaking proceedings, regulations on these subjects became final in 1976.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Timely petitions for review were filed in this court by four major American truck manufacturers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While petitioners do not question the emission standards<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or the testing procedures<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> thus established, they do assail the enforcement<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and warranty<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> regulations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The enforcement program permits EPA to inspect and. monitor regulated products and required records,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to recall noncomplying products,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and to put an end to distribution of vehicles by manufacturers disregarding specified regulations.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The warranty provisions exact from the manufacturer responsible for production verification of the vehicle <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> a warranty that it was \u201cdesigned, built and equipped to conform at the time of sale . with all applicable U.S. EPA noise control regulations.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On both statutory and constitutional grounds, petitioners say these administrative exertions are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>II.- THE ENFORCEMENT REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">At the outset, we are confronted with a challenge to our jurisdiction to review the enforcement procedures.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Noise Control Act, in common with other environmental legislation,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> provides preclusively for direct review of the Administrator\u2019s performances in certain instances.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Section 16(a), pursuant to which our jurisdiction is invoked, designates the one instance relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-5\">A petition for review of action of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in promulgating any standard or regulation under section 6, 17, or 18 of this Act . . . may be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">Since Sections 17 <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and 18 <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> relate respectively to standards for railroads and interstate motor carriers<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and therefore are inapplicable to this litigation, we focus our attention on Section 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">That section calls upon the Administrator to publish for each covered product<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> proposed regulations which \u201cshall include a noise emission standard\u201d meeting enumerated specifications and which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0Lm\">[i]n addition . . . may contain testing procedures necessary to assure compliance with the [applicable] emission standard . . . and may contain provisions respecting instructions of the manufacturer for the maintenance, use, or repair of the product.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ae4-dedup-0\">Section 6 also establishes time limits for the publication of regulations proposed thereunder,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and requires manufacturers to \u201cwarrant to the ultimate purchaser\u201d that regulated products are in conformity with the regulations adopted.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Petitioner Ford Motor Company contends that the narrow grant of Section 6 rulemak-ing authority does not afford a substantive basis for the enforcement regulations, and that resultantly we lack jurisdiction under Section 16(a) to pass on their validity. The Administrator argues, however, that a broad reading of Section 16(a) permits our consideration of these provisions because, he says, they are closely related to regulations that clearly would be authorized by Section 6, and therefore under Section 16(a) are <em>\u201caction[s] of the Administrator . in promulgating </em>[a] standard or regulation under section 6.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We disagree with the Administrator.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The unequivocal language of Section 6 restricts legislative rulemaking to but three subjects: noise emission standards, testing procedures and manufacturers\u2019 instructions.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Nothing in the legislative history of Section 6 suggests in any way that additional types of regulations were contemplated.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> More particularly, there is no indication in either the text or the history of Section 6 that it was meant to confer authority to establish an enforcement process, and additional considerations serve further to negate the possibility that Congress intended enforcement regulations to derive from Section 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-16\">Other provisions of the Noise Control Act deal overtly with the subject of enforcement.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Moreover, the Clean Air Amendments of 1970 <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> \u2014 on which the Noise Control Act of 1972 was modeled<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> \u2014 expressly, and entirely apart from any general standard-setting or testing provision, licensed entry into a manufacturer\u2019s facility.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>seems inconceivable that Congress would have been ever so clear in the one instance but would leave the authority to be sought between the lines in a closely related statute subsequently enacted. To boot, Section 6 does not lend itself to so broad an interpretation that enforcement regulations would be encompassed, for it lacks a grant of general rulemaking power<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> \u2014 a grant that is explicit in other environmental statutes administered by EPA.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus the plain language of Section 6, viewed in the context of the Act, its legislative history and a comparison of its provisions with those of other environmental enactments, would authorize promulgation of legislative regulations on no more than noise emission standards, testing procedures and manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Because EPA\u2019s enforcement regulations \u2014 which include provisions for entry and inspection, recall and stopped deliveries \u2014 do not fit within any of these categories, they would not appear to be \u201cstandard[s] or regulation[s] under section 6 ... of [the] Act\u201d within Section 16(a) review jurisdiction.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">In support of the claim that under the latter section we may nevertheless examine the enforcement procedures as \u201cactionfs] of the Administrator ... in promulgating\u201d Section 6 regulations,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> the Administrator cites the legislative history and case law on nearly identical review provisions found in the Clean Air Amendments of 1970<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> as well as policy arguments weighing in favor of immediate review.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Nothing to which we are thus referred convinces us, however, that Section 16(a) gives us the jurisdiction the Administrator would have us exercise.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">We turn first to judicial interpretations of similar review provisions in other environmental statutes. Section 509(b)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act allows \u201c[r]eview of the Administrator\u2019s action ... in approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under Section 301, 302, or 306\u201d in federal courts of appeals.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Administrator contends that this language has been held to permit direct review of Section 304 effluent guidelines and urges us to give Section 16(a) a similar construction. An examination of the Water Act cases yields the sounder view that jurisdiction to review under Section 509(b)(1) depends upon whether the Administrator acted under Section 301, not on an exaggerated reading of its review grant.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> In <em>E.I. Du Pont De </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number><em>Nemours &amp; Co. v. Train,</em><footnotemark><em>53</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court recently approved this approach, first determining that effluent limitations for existing point sources had been promulgated under Section 301,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and then concluding that therefore the plain wording of Section 509(b)(1) established review jurisdiction.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Very significantly, the Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUiy\">[i]f EPA is correct that its regulations are \u2018effluent limitation[s] under section 301\u2019 the regulations are directly reviewable in the Court of Appeals. If industry is correct that the regulations can only be considered \u00a7 304 guidelines, suit to review the regulations could probably be brought only in the District Court, if anywhere.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">This court had previously taken the same tack in exploring its jurisdiction to review actions of the Administrator pursuant to Section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> In <em>District of Columbia v. </em>Train<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> we stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Far from exhorting an expansive reading of Section 16(a), these decisions confirm our view that the appropriate inquiry is whether the enforcement rules are Section 6 regulations or standards \u2014 a question we have already answered in the negative.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Section 307(b)(1) grants exclusive jurisdiction to an appropriate court of appeals to hear challenges to a limited class of actions taken by the Administrator. By its terms, the statute allows review here only if the Administrator\u2019s actions are taken pursuant to Sections 110, 111(d), or 119(c)(2)(A), (B), or (C) of the Act. If the action is <em>not </em>taken pursuant to one of these provisions, a court of appeals is without authority to hear a challenge to it in the first instance.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>To be sure, language similar to \u201caction of the Administrator ... in promulgating\u201d <footnotemark>61</footnotemark> has occasionally been utilized to better demonstrate our jurisdiction to review an action beyond, but an indispensable forerunner of, one explicitly embraced by an environmental review provision. Those instances are, however, readily distinguishable from the situation before us. In <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. Train</em><footnotemark><em>62</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we indicated that although not expressly designated as a subject of review, listing of a substance as toxic under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act would be a reviewable action because it was taken in the course of and was a necessary prerequisite to promulgation of final effluent standards.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> This suggestion was followed in <em>National Asphalt Pavement Ass'n v. Train,</em><footnotemark><em>64</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which we held reviewable the designation of a source category as a \u201csignificant contributor\u201d under the Clean Air Amendments.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> It cannot seriously be contended that the enforcement rules in controversy were similarly a step that had to be taken before Section 6 emission standards or testing procedures could be devised. On the contrary, it was only with reference to the latter that the enforcement regulations could be formulated and addressed.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">The Administrator\u2019s argument that the legislative history of Section 16(a) supports his sweeping interpretation of that provision also is unpersuasive. In fashioning the Noise Control Act, Congress did not articulate any purpose behind Section 16(a) beyond those evident from its text. However, because Section 307(b) of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970 <footnotemark>67</footnotemark> served as the model for the review provision of the Noise Control Act,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> the legislative history of that section is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-12\">Because many of these administrative actions are national in scope and require even and consistent national application, the provision specifies that any review of such actions shall be in the United States Court of Appeals for the\u2019 District of Columbia. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-13\">In order to maintain the integrity of the time sequences provided throughout the Act, the bill would provide that any review sought must be filed within 30 days of the date of the challenged promulgation or approval.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyBJ\">Thus the congressional objective was \u201cto limit judicial review as to forum and time so as to assure expeditious, authoritative and central judicial resolution of issues which were national in impact and which could hold up the timely accomplishment of the Act\u2019s objectives if not settled at the outset.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> The fact that, simultaneously with stating that aim, Congress expressly authorized review of only some of the Administrator\u2019s actions to which the congressional reasoning might apply casts considerable doubt on the Administrator\u2019s position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>that Section 16(a) aspires to review of more than the actions enumerated. The purpose Congress declared is much more easily fitted to standards and testing than to an enforcement scheme: Until national standards were finalized, the Act would be completely ineffective, but once standards were in place, uncertainty as to the enforcement scheme would not preclude environmental progress.' That Congress viewed timely setting of countrywide standards as more important than timely creation of an enforcement process is apparent from its designation of time limits for accomplishment of the former but not the latter.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">A final consideration advanced by the Administrator is the judicial policy of avoiding bifurcation of review wherever possible. That factor comes into play, however, only when the jurisdictional provision reasonably lends itself to differing interpretations.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> In the legislation before us, Congress specifically listed, by section number, the provisions that are subject to our review. Assuming ambiguity arguably to be discerned in the phrase \u201caction of the Administrator . in promulgating,\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> an application of judicial policy cannot justify an undertaking to overrule the unambiguous enumeration of the provisions reviewable. In this milieu, avoidance of bifurcated review would persuade us to no more than an exercise of ancillary jurisdiction to combine review of Section 6 provisions with indispensable review of other closely allied provisions.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Moreover, even if the legislative history and the policy against bifurcated review were stretched to the point urged by the Administrator, their limited support for his broad interpretation of Section 16(a) would easily be outweighed by stronger policy considerations for declining to indulge in so expansive an interpretation. In order to effectuate the purpose of centralized and timely review of specified administrative actions,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Congress not only conferred jurisdiction upon this court but it simultaneously withdrew jurisdiction from all other courts in all other related proceedings. Section 16(a) decrees that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABi\">[ajction of [the] Administrator with respect to which review could have been obtained under this subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA9\">So, once the period for seeking review in this court has expired, the facial validity of a provision reviewable under Section 16(a) is ostensibly beyond challenge.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> This phenomenon raises the spectre of possible unfairness, particularly to small manufacturers who may lack resources to monitor the Administrator\u2019s actions to assure protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>of the opportunity to contest regulations affecting their interests.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Indeed, the Administrative Conference of the United States has recommended amendment of the environmental statutes to allow the invalidity of a regulation to be raised as a defense in an enforcement proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-4\">The express preclusion of review at the enforcement stage creates a highly unusual and unnecessary harsh restriction on the right to challenge the validity of a regulation to which one is subject.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxYM\">And the Supreme Court has suggested that the constitutional validity of the preclusive review provision of the Clean Air Act Amendments merits serious consideration.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Although, in <em>Yakus v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>81</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court sustained the constitutionality of a similar provision in the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942,<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> that holding may be distinguishable on the ground that the Ya<em>kus </em>provision was a \u201cwar emergency measure.\u201d <footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The nagging presence of a substantial due process question indicates, then, at the very least, the propriety of a narrow interpretation of Section 16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">We are mindful that an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers is entitled to great deference.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> But, yielding that, it is ultimately for us to make the determination on our jurisdiction to hear a case.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> On its face, Section 16(a) limits us to review of standards and regulations promulgated under particular sections of the Act<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> \u2014 in the present instance, Section 6 <footnotemark>87</footnotemark> \u2014and we find that the Administrator\u2019s enforcement procedures cannot rest on Section 6.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> While Section 16(a) might lend itself to an interpretation permitting review of some actions somewhat beyond Section 6 standards and regulations, the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>sions construing identical provisions of the Clean Air Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act caution that, with minor apparent but not real exceptions, the scope of review is strictly limited by the precise language of Section 16(a).<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> And though competing policy considerations bear on the jurisdictional question, on balance they too weigh in favor of a narrow interpretation of the Act\u2019s preclusive review provision.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> We conclude, then, that we are without jurisdiction to review the Administrator\u2019s enforcement procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">III. THE WARRANTY REGULATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Section 6(d)(1) of the Noise Control Act of 1972 specifies that as soon as a regulation establishing a noise emission standard becomes effective,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayg-dedup-2\">the manufacturer of each new product to which such regulation applies shall warrant to the ultimate purchaser <footnotemark>91</footnotemark> and each subsequent purchaser that such product is designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with such regulation.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">However straightforward this provision may be for other contexts, the organization of the truck-manufacturing industry generates a potential problem for its operation therein. Not uncommonly, one manufacturer constructs the basic vehicle \u2014 the chassis, engine and operator\u2019s compartment, known as a chassis-cab \u2014 and a subsequent manufacturer independently conducts whatever additional production processes\u2014 for example, the mounting of a special-purpose body and equipment \u2014 are needed to adapt and ready the vehicle for its intended use. Thus, superficially at least, a question arises as to who, for purposes of the Act\u2019s warranty section, \u201cthe manufacturer\u201d of that particular truck is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">When the Administrator originally proposed a body of noise control and related regulations, he included a provision placing liability upon both the manufacturer of the unfinished truck and the manufacturer who later rendered it functional.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> After notice and comment, however, the Administrator confined the warranty to the initial manufacturer. In relevant part, the final regulation called upon \u201c[t]he vehicle manufacturer who is required to production verify\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> to warrant to the ultimate purchaser that the \u201cvehicle was designed, built and equipped to conform at the time of sale to [him] with all applicable U.S. EPA noise control regulations.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Petitioners General Motors Corporation and International Harvester Company attack this provision on the ground that it contravenes the language of the Act and the intent of Congress. They further assert that the regulation unlawfully holds manufacturers of incomplete trucks vicariously responsible for nonconformance by subsequent manufacturers who complete them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-15\">We do not encounter a jurisdictional barrier to consideration of these claims. The Act does not direct the Administrator to fashion a warranty regulation, but that does not mean that he cannot issue a regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>lation interpreting Section 6(d)(1), the statutory warranty provision.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> In the regulations \u2014 both proposed and final \u2014 on that subject, the Administrator has endeavored to clarify the meaning of that section in its application to the truck-manufacturing industry. For better or for worse, he has articulated his understanding of the Section 6(d)(1) term \u201cmanufacturer\u201d in its relation to that industry.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> We are authorized to review \u201caction of the Administrator . in promulgating [a] regulation under section 6 . . .of [the] Act,\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> and the warranty regulation is plainly of that nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">A. <em>Consistency With the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Reverting, then, to the merits, we first address the contention that the regulation is in conflict with the Act. The Administrator would relieve from any warranty obligation manufacturers who wind up the production of a theretofore unfinished truck, and would place full warranty liability upon the manufacturer of the basic vehicle, not only for his own departures from the noise emission standards but also for those of subsequent manufacturers.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> The Administrator thus has sharply restricted the tenor of the word \u201cmanufacturer\u201d as used in Section 6(d)(1), and in doing so has come fatally into collision with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">The Act levies the warranty upon \u201cthe manufacturer of each new product to which [a noise emission] regulation applies.\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> The statutory definition of \u201cmanufacturer\u201d includes <em>\u201cany </em>person engaged in the manufacturing or <em>assembling </em>of new products.\u201d <footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Even if the Act said no more, we would think it reasonably clear that the manufacturer who completes the basic truck for commercial use is intercepted by the warranty section.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> The fact is, however, that the Act does say significantly more. It ties the warranty to \u201ceach new product\u201d <footnotemark>103</footnotemark> and, with exceptions inapposite here, declares that \u201c[t]he term \u2018product\u2019 means any manufactured article or goods or component thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> So, not only are those who \u201cmanufactur[e] . . . new products\u201d \u201cto which [a noise emission] regulation applies\u201d subjected to the Act\u2019s warranty requirement but also those who produce similarly covered \u201cnew produces]\u201d through \u201cassembl[y]\u201d of newly \u201cmanufactured article[s] ... or components] thereof.\u201d It follows that the Act fastens the warranty obligation upon the manufacturer who assembles the basic truck and other components into the finished product \u2014 the \u201cnew product to which [the] regulation applies.\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-16\">Our construction of Section 6(d)(1) does not suffer from any lack of a decisional parallel. In <em>Rex Chainbelt, Inc. v. Volpe,</em><footnotemark><em>106</em></footnotemark><em> </em>regulations purportedly issued under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 <footnotemark>107</footnotemark> commanded final-stage manufacturers of motor vehicles to make the sole certification of compliance of the entire vehicle, including portions produced and installed by the incomplete-vehicle manufacturer, with federal safety standards. One section of that legislation instructed \u201cevery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>manufacturer\u201d to furnish the certification of compliance,<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> and another defined \u201cmanufacturer\u201d as including \u201cany person engaged in the manufacturing or assembling of motor vehicles \"or motor vehicle equipment.\u201d <footnotemark>109</footnotemark> To the court, the latter provision \u201cplainly indicate[d] that an \u2018incomplete vehicle manufacturer\u2019 is a \u2018manufacturer\u2019 within the meaning of\u201d the statute.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> The Administrator argues that <em>Rex Chainbelt </em>is distinguishable because the certification requirement there was laid on \u201cevery manufacturer.\u201d We are unable to detect the difference suggested since Section 6(d)(1) here imposes the warranty on \u201cthe manufacturer,\u201d who is <em>\u201cany </em>person engaged in the manufacturing or assembling of new products.\u201d <footnotemark>111</footnotemark> In sum, \u201cany\u201d \u201cmanufacturer\u201d can mean no less than \u201cevery\u201d manufacturer.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">We do not lose sight of the deference courts traditionally yield to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute,<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> particularly when it \u201c \u2018involves a contemporaneous construction of a statute by the men charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion; of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are [as] yet untried and new.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> This principle, however, is much less an encumbrance to independent adjudication when, as here, the administrative ruling is interpretive rather than legislative in character.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> Moreover, courts simply cannot approve a reading of the statute that is contrary to its plain language.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> The Administrator\u2019s regulation undertakes to exempt one type of truck manufacturer from compliance with the statutory warranty provision, and in so doing it contravenes the Act\u2019s mandate on that score.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>B. <em>Imposition or Vicarious Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Even if Section 6(d)(1) were susceptible to the Administrator\u2019s interpretation, we would nonetheless be constrained to invalidate this regulation. The additional difficulty is encounters is that it seeks to cast liability on the incomplete-vehicle manufacturer for noise-emission violations \u2014 additional to those of his own making \u2014 attributable wholly to the subsequent independent manufacturer who finishes the vehicle. The Administrator\u2019s regulation explicitly requires that the Section 6(d)(1) warranty include the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-5\">This warranty is not limited to any particular part, component or system of the vehicle. Defects in the design, assembly, or in any part, component or system of the vehicle which, at the time sale to [the ultimate purchaser] cause noise emission levels to exceed Federal standards are covered by this warranty for the life of the vehicle.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Since the regulation would confine the warranty obligation to the chassis-cab manufacturer,<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> the Administrator clearly contemplates that that manufacturer will bear the responsibility for any action of the subsequent manufacturer taking the vehicle out of compliance with the noise emission standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">This allocation of warranty liability forebodes dire consequences for first-stage manufacturers. Section 6(d)(2) of the Act provides that \u201cany cost obligation of any dealer incurred as a result of [the warranty requirement of Section 6(d)(1)] shall be borne by the manufacturer,\u201d <footnotemark>119</footnotemark> and' in the Administrator\u2019s view that manufacturer is the one who completes the chassis-cab for marketing. We are aware that some protection from liability flows from Sections 10(a)(2)<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> and 11(a),<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> which ban alteration of noise-related systems in a complying though unfinished vehicle and impose substantial penalties for failure to observe that prohibition. The Administrator also asserts that \u201c[t]he manufacturer of the basic truck can protect himself from the subsequent manufacturer\u2019s breaking that law through indemnification agreements and other contractual arrangements.\u201d<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> To be sure, these provisions may reduce the incidence of liability, but most certainly they cannot entirely eliminate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">The Administrator does not refer us to anything in the Act that might undergird a regulation imposing liability on first-stage manufacturers for noise-emission violations that are wholly the fault of second-stage manufacturers, and we search in vain for statutory authorization of that sort. Indeed, the legislative history of the Act is precisely to the contrary: the Senate Committee expressly stated that it intended that the manufacturer be liable only for those changes in noise emissions which are in fact within his control.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Nor is there a common law basis upon which liability could be predicated vicariously, for <em>in </em>the situation complained of the chassis-cab manufacturer has no dominion whatsoever over the subsequent manufacturer. In decisionally indistinguishable circumstances we have twice held that the Administrator lacks power to impose liability upon a blameless party for the acts of another beyond his control.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> These rulings are fully binding upon us, and they dictate the same result here. We are fully cognizant of the difficulties of allocating the warranty burden between separate manufacturers, but we are confident that the Administrator can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>deal adequately with the problems through new regulations.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">We find that we have no jurisdiction to pass on the validity of the Administrator\u2019s enforcement regulations. We conclude that the challenged warranty provision is unauthorized. We remand this litigation to the Administrator for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-10\">. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 205 (1977).
