We find the informal adjudicatory procedures employed by the FAA created a record which contains substantial evidence supporting the no-hazard decision. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Act), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1301-1542 (1976), authorizes the FAA to promote air safety, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1303(a), 1655(c)(1) (1976), and to regulate the use of navigable air space, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7. 1348(a), 1655(c)(1) (1976). Section 1101 of the Act specifically recognizes the threat that tall structures may pose to air safety and provides that the FAA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0gz\">shall, by rules and regulations, or by order where necessary, require all persons to give adequate public notice, in the form and manner prescribed by the [Administrator], of the construction or alteration, or of the proposed construction or alteration, of any structure where notice will promote safety in air commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"avj-dedup-0\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1501, 1655(c)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-15\">Pursuant to these statutory powers, the FAA promulgated Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 77 (1978). The pertinent provisions of these regulations require each person who proposes construction or alteration of structures of particular dimensions and within specific proximity to airports to notify the FAA. 14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 77.11, .13, .15. The FAA uses this information to make \u201c[determinations of the possible hazardous effect x&gt;f the proposed construction or alteration on air navigation.\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 77.11(b)(2). The regulations set out various standards against which proposals may be evaluated, <em>see </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 77.23(a), and also require the FAA to conduct aeronautical studies in certain circumstances, <em>see </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 77.-19(c)(3), .35(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-17\">The initial hazard/no-hazard decision is made by a staff member in the FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Division. That decision is final unless the Administrator of the FAA (Administrator) grants discretionary review. 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 77.37. The Administrator\u2019s review may be based on written materials or on a public hearing held in accordance with procedures prescribed in 14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 77.-41\u201469, .37(c)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-18\">Once issued, a hazard/no-hazard determination has no enforceable legal effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>The FAA is not empowered to prohibit or limit proposed construction it deems dangerous to air navigation. Nevertheless, the ruling has substantial practical impact. The Federal Communications Commission, for example, considers the FAA\u2019s classification in granting permits for the construction of broadcast towers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.4 (1978). The ruling may also affect the ability of a sponsor proposing construction to acquire insurance or to secure financing. Primarily, however, the determination promotes air safety through \u201cmoral suasion\u201d by encouraging the voluntary cooperation of sponsors of potentially hazardous structures. <em>Air Line Pilots\u2019 Association International v. FAA, </em>446 F.2d 236, 240 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">This case arises out of the proposed construction of a television antenna tower by WSET, Inc. (WSET)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> near Thaxton, Virginia.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The initial height of the tower, I, 506 feet above ground level,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> exceeded the 200 foot notice standard set out in Subpart B of the FAA\u2019s regulations, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 77.13(a)(1). Accordingly, on April 28, 1976, WSET notified the FAA of its plan to construct the tower. On May 12, 1976, the FAA acknowledged receipt of the notice, stated that it would conduct an aeronautical study to determine the effect of the proposed tower upon air safety, and invited the comments of interested persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-18\">AOPA,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> among others,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> lodged written objections to the tower construction with the FAA. The objecting parties primarily contended that the tower would interfere with Visual Flight Rule (VFR) flyways<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and would require an increase in minimum altitudes for radar vectoring<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in the area.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 4-14, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-19\">On July 30, 1976, the FAA held an informal meeting to solicit further comments of interested persons. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 77.-35(b)(4). Opponents of the tower repeated their concern that it would interfere with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>VFR operations, especially during marginal weather conditions. They also asserted that the tower would impair Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) operations<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Air Traffic Control procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">The FAA began its investigation by surveying the number of VFR flights traveling between Lynchburg, Virginia, and Roanoke, Virginia, within close proximity to the tower. During the one-month period of June 23 to July 26, 1976, the survey showed twenty flight plans were filed in which aircraft passed within two miles of the site at an altitude of 3,500 feet or below. J.A. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">On November 2, 1976, the FAA conducted a comprehensive on-site flight inspection and evaluation of the tower proposal, including simulation of all phases of VFR operations. The study focused particularly on IFR and VFR interference and concluded that the tower would have \u201cno substantial adverse effect on aeronautical operations\u201d provided it was equipped with high intensity white obstruction lights. <em>Id. </em>at 33. The FAA, relying on this study, gave the tower a no-hazard rating on November 22, 1976. <em>Id. </em>at 30-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">Within a month of the initial decision, AOPA petitioned the FAA for review. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 77.37. The petition reasserted previously raised objections with regard to VFR and IFR operations. AOPA further claimed that the FAA\u2019s decision violated specific hazard guidelines set out in FAA Handbook 7400.2B (Handbook).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">The FAA Director of Air Traffic Service <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> granted discretionary review by notice on January 10, 1977. The notice stated that the review would be conducted \u201cwithout public hearing\u201d on \u201cthe basis of written materials\u201d in accordance with 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 77.37(c)(1). J.A. at 53-54. The notice also stated that the review would \u201cconsider all material relevant to the question of whether the proposed construction would have a substantial adverse effect on the safe and efficient use of airspace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54. To this end, the FAA invited interested persons to comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">On January 25, 1977, ATC Associates, Inc. (ATC), aviation consultants for WSET, submitted remarks with respect to AOPA\u2019s petition for review. On February 15, 1977, AOPA responded to ATC\u2019s report, suggesting that the FAA establish an antenna farm <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> southwest of Roanoke and relocate the tower in that area.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> By letter dated March 2, 1977, the FAA stated that the proposal was incorporated into the record and would be considered \u201cin the discretionary review.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-13\">On March 14, 1977, the FAA conducted another in-flight evaluation of the site. It again surveyed the VFR flights operating between Lynchburg and Roanoke at altitudes below 4,500 feet. According to the survey, only four such flight plans were filed between March 1 and 13, 1977. <em>Id. </em>at 84, 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-14\">After the protesting parties renewed their objections, the FAA engaged in infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>mal negotiations with ATC concerning possible relocation of the tower.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> ATC agreed to reexamine the proposal and asked the FAA to hold review in abeyance pending further exploration of WSET\u2019s alternatives. On May 17, 1977, ATC advised the FAA that WSET was willing to lower the tower height at the Thaxton site by 300 feet. <em>Id. </em>at 91. The FAA informed WSET and other participants in the proceeding that review would continue based on a reduced height of 1,206 feet above ground level. The FAA allowed ten days for comment. <em>Id. </em>at 92. AOPA and others<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> indicated that the 300 foot decrease did not alter their prior objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">On July 12, 1977, the Director of Air Traffic Service<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> affirmed the no-hazard determination. The Director thoroughly reviewed the evidence, evaluated the objections, and concluded that the tower constituted no hazard to air safety at the reduced height, provided it was equipped with high intensity obstruction lights. <em>Id. </em>at 107-18. The FAA forwarded a copy of this affirmation and accompanying opinion to the FCC.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">AOPA filed a petition for reconsideration on July 29, 1977. The FAA denied the request. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">At the outset, both parties squarely call upon us to define the parameters of our review. Section 1006(e) of the Act provides that \u201cfindings of fact by the [Civil Aeronautics] Board or the [Administrator of the FAA], if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486(e) (1976). The question presented is how should a court apply the substantial evidence standard of review to an informal adjudication during which the agency deci-sionmaker receives information through nonadversary proceedings and written submissions, rather than formal, trial-type hearings. The FAA contends that the purpose of substantial evidence review cannot be served by application to informal adjudication not held on a formal record. The FAA urges, instead, application of the arguably less rigorous arbitrary and capricious standard.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> AOPA counters by insisting that we adhere to the plain language of the statutory standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-16\">The FAA premises its argument on an analogy to the review provisions set out in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Substantial evidence review under the APA is properly invoked only in cases subject to the formal hearing procedures of sections 556 and 557 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 556, 557 (1976), or otherwise reviewed after a formal agency hearing required by statute. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E) (1976).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The no-hazard determination in this case, as discussed previously, occurred after interested parties had the opportunity to comment upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>proposed construction and to meet informally with FAA officials. <em>See </em>text at-- - of 195 U.S.App.D.C., 967-968 of 600 F.2d <em>supra. </em>Unlike formal adjudication under sections 556 and 557, however, the process did not involve trial-type, adversarial hearings, nor was the FAA\u2019s decision confined to a formal record. In fact, the regulations governing procedures for hazard/no-hazard determinations specifically exclude application of sections 556 and 557.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">The FAA proceeds by analyzing the relationship that exists between the formal record compiled in the course of trial-type proceedings and application of the substantial evidence standard. According to the FAA, the substantial evidence requirement insures the integrity of a decision required to be made on the record of a mandatory hearing by precluding consideration of extra-record evidence which the parties had no opportunity to refute. A reviewing court determining whether the factual findings of the agency are based on substantial evidence weighs the evidence in the record supporting the decision against that which is contradictory. As long as sufficient evidence exists that \u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938), the agency\u2019s findings must be upheld. <em>Universal Camera Co. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1957). The FAA contends that if a hearing is merely a discretionary adjunct to an agency\u2019s internal factfinding process, as it is here, and if the decision need not be confined to the parameters of a public record, the restrictive purpose of the substantial evidence constraint no longer obtains. <em>See City of Chicago v. FPC, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 312, 325, 458 F.2d 731, 744 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 1074, 92 S.Ct. 1495, 31 L.Ed.2d 808 (1972).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>Scalia &amp; Goodman, <em>Procedural Aspects of the Consumer Product Safety Act, </em>20 U.C.L.A.L. Rev. 899, 933-36 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-13\">We recognize that application of the substantial evidence standard may be troublesome, as well as purposeless, when applied to an informal adjudicatory decision made absent the creation of an adequate record. <em>Tiger International, Inc. v. CAB, </em>554 F.2d 926 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 975, 98 S.Ct. 532, 54 L.Ed.2d 467 (1977), relied upon by the FAA, illustrates the inherent problems. In <em>Tiger, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that a Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) decision rendered without a hearing was properly reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard despite the plain language of section 1006(e) of the Act. <em>Id. </em>Particularly compelling to the court was the fact that, because of the permissible use of informal procedures, only the petitioners submitted evidence. The court refused to require the CAB to reach a result supported by substantial evidence on a record compiled essentially by only one side of the controversy. <em>Id. </em>at 936 &amp; n. 19.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Similarly, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number><em>Association of Bank Travel Bureaus, Inc. v. Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System, </em>568 F.2d 549, 552 &amp; n. 5 (7th Cir. 1978), the Seventh Circuit, although acknowledging the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d language of the pertinent judicial review statute, declined to review the results of informal rulemaking by the Federal Reserve Board under the substantial evidence standard.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">AOPA opposes the FAA by contending that the explicit statutory language of section 1006(e) mandates application of the substantial evidence standard and that the standard, as traditionally formulated, can be applied to the record now before us. AOPA specifically relies upon <em>Pillai v. CAB, </em>158 U.S.App.D.C. 239, 485 F.2d 1018 (1973), in which this court reviewed under the substantial evidence standard CAB orders issued without a formal hearing. The court held the statutory standard applicable, notwithstanding the sparse record before the CAB:<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u201cTo the extent that the [CAB\u2019s] \u2018public interest\u2019 determination involved factual predicates, the substantive statute requires that they be supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>158 U.S.App.D.C. at 244, 485 F.2d at 1023 (footnote omitted). <em>Accord, Air Line Pilots\u2019 Association International v. FAA, </em>446 F.2d at 241; <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. CAB, </em>120 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 231-32, 345 F.2d 445, 448-49 &amp; n. 9 (1965). <em>See also Public Systems v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>No. 76-1609, slip op. at 11-14 &amp; nn. 32-34 (D.C.Cir. Feb. 16, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">AOPA argues that the present action not only falls squarely within,the requirement of <em>Pillai, </em>but in fact presents a stronger case. The record before the FAA in this action was not sparse. Although the FAA was not confined to the public record, that record embraced all facts necessary to make a hazard/no-hazard determination; and there is no indication that the FAA relied upon any extra-record evidence. We thus do not encounter the practical difficulty, illustrated by <em>Tiger, </em>of applying the substantial evidence test to agency action based on internal agency knowledge. AOPA concludes that because application of the substantial evidence test is feasible in this case, we may not deviate from the plain wording of section 1006(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">We agree that as long as the substantial evidence standard can be applied, section 1006(e) mandates that it must be applied. In so holding, we need not rule on the appropriate standard for reviewing a decision made on the basis of informal procedures which result in the creation of a record containing arguments and evidence of just one party.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In the ease before us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>we can and do meaningfully apply the substantial evidence standard to the record consisting of arguments and evidence submitted by opposing sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">AOPA asks us to set aside the FAA\u2019s no-hazard determination as unsupported by any probative evidence. AOPA further charges that the decision violates provisions of the Handbook<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> that prescribe criteria for hazard/no-hazard evaluations. Neither objection is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">Contrary to AOPA\u2019s first contention, the evidence contained in the comprehensive aeronautical study conducted by the FAA sufficiently supports its no-hazard determination. This study analyzed separately the IFR and VFR effects of the proposed tower. With respect to IFR operations, the study disclosed that the tower would not: (a) require change to the Minimum Enroute Altitude of Federal Airway Victor 16-260,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> nor interfere with aeronautical operations on this airway; (b) require change in Roanoke Airport\u2019s standard instrument approach procedures; (c) interfere with departure procedures or require the establishment of take-off m\u00ednimums; (d) substantially adversely affect local radar vectoring operations, although an increase in the vectoring altitude from 3,800 to 4,400 feet in proximity to the tower would be required. J.A. at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">AOPA does not challenge the validity of these findings. Rather, AOPA argues that the study is defective for failure to address the tower\u2019s effect on IFR departures from Lynchburg Airport. The FAA explained that because the minimum altitude of these flights is 5,000 feet \u2014 2,000 feet above the reduced level of the tower \u2014 they would not be affected by the proposed construction. <em>Id. </em>at 115. AOPA disputes this logic, contending that the tower jeopardizes the safety of pilots who encounter engine trouble and lose altitude while flying over the tower. We find the reasonableness of the FAA\u2019s conclusion undisturbed by this generalized complaint which, on its face, could be levied against construction of any tall structure. AOPA has not come forth with any evidence showing that the WSET tower poses a particular threat to pilots flying under IFR rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">With respect to VFR operations, the study demonstrated that the tower would not interfere with traffic pattern operations at any airport. The study analyzed the effects on VFR enroute operations and found that the tower would not: (1) impede flights visually guided by the highway, U.S. Route 460; (2) necessitate substantial change in operations using Federal Airway Victor 16-260; (3) have any impact on north or south bound VFR operations because the northern mountainous terrain causes approaching flights to proceed at higher altitudes. <em>Id. </em>at 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-14\">AOPA\u2019s attack on the validity of the FAA\u2019s conclusion that the tower presents no hazard to VFR flights centers on application of the Handbook criteria. The Handbook presents a series of \u201cinformal\u201d guidelines <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> governing \u201cprocedures for handling airspace matters.\u201d Appendix to Brief for Petitioner at 16. Section 1441 of the Handbook defines adverse effect on air navigation, as relevant to this case, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-15\">A proposed structure would have . an adverse effect if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"asl-dedup-1\">a. ... An IFR operation procedure or minimum flight altitude would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>require a change if the proposed structure is erected .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-5\">b. . . . A VFR operation would be required to change from regular flight course or altitude if the proposed structure is erected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 17. Section 1442 states that if a structure has an adverse effect, that effect will be deemed \u201csubstantial\u201d if \u201ca significant volume . . . of aeronautical operations . . . would be affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 1445 of the Handbook provides that \u201csignificant volume\u201d means that \u201cone or more aeronautical operations per day [are] affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, section 1444(b) of the Handbook states that a no-hazard determination is normally required when the evidence demonstrates that the proposed construction will have \u201cno substantial adverse effect\u201d on air navigation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">The FAA contends that the proposed tower does not have a substantial adverse effect on flight operations within the meaning of sections 1442 and 1445 because, according to its survey of filed VFR flight plans, a significant volume of VFR flights would not be affected. A survey of flight plans covering a two-week period in March 1977 indicated that only four VFR flights, operating at 4,500 feet or below, passed within two miles of the tower. <em>See </em>text at - of 195 U.S.App.D.C., 968 of 600 F.2d <em>supra. </em>An earlier canvas conducted between June 23 and July 22, 1976 showed twenty flights, operating at or below 3,500 feet, passed over the tower. <em>See </em>text at -- of 195 U.S.App.D.C., 968 of 600 F.2d <em>supra. </em>The FAA\u2019s conclusion, based on the results of these surveys, is consistent with the Handbook stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-14\">AOPA argues, however, that the survey results are illusory. It contends that the Lynchburg route is a popular VFR and IFR flyway and that the FAA figures represent no more than ten or fifteen percent of actual operations. AOPA offers no support for this proposition save its own bald assertion. It presents neither countervailing statistics, nor corroborative documentation. We cannot replace the expert judgment of the FAA, which appears solidly based on evidence in the record, with the speculative assumptions of AOPA.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-18\">Further, even were we to assume that the flights comprised a substantial volume of traffic within the meaning of sections 1442 and 1445, we need not necessarily find the FAA\u2019s no-hazard determination inconsistent with the Handbook.
