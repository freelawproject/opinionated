(PTT) and General Telephone Co. of California (GT) appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-19\">I. <em>Statement of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-20\">On September 13, 1977, the Public Utilities Commission of California (PUC), which regulates certain charges of PTT and GT, entered its Decision No. 87838. It ordered the two companies, engaged in providing telephone service in California, to refund certain monies paid by ratepayers for years prior to 1978 and to make rate reductions for the year 1978 and beyond. In so deciding, the PUC stated explicitly that it assumed that its order would not destroy the utilities\u2019 eligibility to take advantage of certain federal tax rules pertaining to accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-21\">The PUC refused appellants\u2019 request for a rehearing on Decision No. 87838. The PUC, however, stayed implementation of its order pending judicial review. Upon two petitions by the utilities, the California Supreme Court refused to disturb the PUC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And the United States Supreme Court denied two writs of certiorari and later denied appellants\u2019 petitions for rehearing. On March 14,1979, the PUC ended the stay of its order because \u201cthe avenues of judicial review have been exhausted\u201d and also again denied appellants\u2019 petitions for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-5\">Meanwhile, the utilities sought rulings from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concerning their eligibility for accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits under Decision No. 87838. The IRS ruled that the utilities would not be eligible for the tax advantages under the PUC\u2019s Decision No. 87838.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-6\">On March 15, 1979, a day after the PUC ended the stay of its order, the utilities began the instant litigation. PTT filed suit against the PUC and various federal officials related to the IRS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking to enjoin implementation of the PUC\u2019s rate order and seeking a declaratory judgment regarding PTT\u2019s eligibility for the tax advantages under the PUC\u2019s order. PTT also requested that if the court determined that PTT would be ineligible, then the PUC should be enjoined permanently from putting its order into effect. On the same day, GT instituted a similar suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-7\">PTT and GT each sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary injunction against implementation of the PUC\u2019s order. The cities of Los Angeles and San Diego, the City and County of San Francisco, and an organization called Toward Utility Rate Normalization were allowed to intervene. The PUC and these intervenors<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> opposed the motions for in-junctive relief. The federal Government filed a motion to dismiss the action insofar as declaratory relief was sought.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-11\">The district court granted a TRO staying implementation of the PUC order. Two weeks later the district court dissolved the TRO<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and denied appellants\u2019 prayers for preliminary injunctions. On the same day, PTT and GT filed appeals in this court. A few days later this court enjoined implementation of the PUC order pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-12\">II. <em>Application of Res Judicata</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-13\">The district court determined that appellants were not entitled to preliminary relief because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1401-14\">The relief requested by plaintiffs herein is barred under the doctrine of res judica-ta by the denial by the California Supreme Court without written opinion of petitions for writ of review of Decision No. 87838 filed by General and Pacific.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ank-dedup-1\">The district court properly applied the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-15\">A. <em>Application of Res Judicata in California Rate Cases: The Napa Valley Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-16\">The United States Supreme Court and this court have acknowledged that, under California law, the California Supreme Court\u2019s denial of writs of review of rate decisions constitutes a denial on the merits and have held that such denials are entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>to res judicata effect in federal courts. In <em>Napa Valley Electric Co. v. Railroad Commission, </em>251 U.S. 366, 40 S.Ct. 174, 64 L.Ed. 310 (1920), a California electric company filed suit in federal district court seeking an injunction against a rate order of the California Railroad Commission, a forerunner of the present PUC. After the Commission had issued its rate order, the utility unsuccessfully sought a rehearing. The California Supreme Court later denied the utilities\u2019 petition for a writ of review. The federal suit was thereupon filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">The district court denied the injunction and dismissed the federal suit because \u201cthe Electric Company filed in the [California] Supreme Court a petition for a review of the decision and order of the Commission and for their annulment, and . . the Supreme Court denied the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370, 40 S.Ct. at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-6\">The United States Supreme Court held that the district court had properly invoked the doctrine of res judicata. <em>See id. </em>at 367, 40 S.Ct. 174. The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1402-7\">Whether . . . the [California] court was required to pursue the details of the section or decide upon the petition was a matter of the construction of the [California statutory] section and the procedure under it. And the [California] Supreme Court has so decided. [Citations omitted.] In those cases the applications for writs of certiorari were denied, which was tantamount to a decision of the [California] court that the orders and decisions of the Commission did not exceed its authority or violate any right of the several petitioners under the Constitution of the United States or of the State of California. . . . And we agree with the District Court that \u201cthe denial of the petition was necessarily a final judicial determination . . . .\u201d And . \u201cSuch a determination is as effectual as an estoppel as would have been a formal judgment upon issues of fact.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1402-14\">The [district] court held, and we concur, that absence of an opinion by the [California] Supreme Court did not affect the quality of its decision or detract from its efficacy as a judgment upon the questions presented, and <em>its subsequent conclusive effect upon the rights of the Electric Company.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1402-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 372-73, 40 S.Ct. at 176 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This Circuit has subsequently embraced the <em>Napa Valley </em>doctrine. <em>See Southern Pacific Co. v. Van Hoosear, </em>72 F.2d 903, 905 (9th Cir. 1934); <em>Wallace Ranch Water Co. v. Railroad Commission, </em>47 F.2d 8, 9 (9th Cir. 1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-16\">B. <em>Continued Vitality of Napa Valley</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-17\">The procedure for obtaining review of rate orders with which the Supreme Court dealt in <em>Napa Valley </em>has since been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>slightly modified and recodified, but the essential attributes of the procedure upon which the Supreme Court relied have remained the same.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>People v. West-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>era <em>Air Lines, </em>42 Cal.2d 621, 268 P.2d 723 (1954),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>appeal dismissed, </em>348 U.S. 859, 75 S.Ct. 87, 99 L.Ed. 677 (1955),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the California Supreme Court reaffirmed the rule relied upon in <em>Napa Valley </em>that denial of a writ of review is a final judgment on the merits; it also applied that rule specifically to the PUC. The California court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-4\">Direct attack [on PUC orders] is made available by application for writ of review to this court .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-5\">It is established</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-6\">that the denial by this court of a petition for review of an order of the commission is a decision on the merits both as to the law and the facts presented in the review proceedings. [Citation omitted.] This is so even though the order of this court is without opinion. Napa Valley -Electric Co.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1404-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 630-31, 268 P.2d at 728. The court then quoted extensively from <em>Napa Valley, </em>including its language regarding application of res judicata to denials of writs of review by the California court. <em>Id. </em>We conclude, therefore, that the recodification of California law has not affected the vitality of the <em>Napa Valley </em>reading of California procedure or of the <em>Napa Valley </em>decision itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-8\">C. <em>Effect of People v. Medina</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-9\">Appellants contend that <em>People v. Medina, </em>6 Cal.3d 484, 99 Cal.Rptr. 630, 492 P.2d 686 (1972), has undermined the rule that the California Supreme Court\u2019s denial of a writ of review of a PUC order constitutes a final adjudication for res judicata purposes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-17\">Medina was charged in a criminal prosecution with unlawfully possessing heroin for sale. At a pretrial hearing he moved to suppress evidence because of an alleged unlawful search. The trial court denied the motion. Medina filed a formally sufficient petition for a writ of prohibition to gain review of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling as provided by California Penal Code \u00a7 1538.5.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal denied the petition without opinion and the California Supreme Court denied a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-18\">After conviction Medina appealed, again claiming that the evidence should have been suppressed. The Court of Appeal held that the denial of the writ of prohibition was res judicata upon this direct appeal, creating a conflict with another Court of Appeal decision which held \u201cthat the denial without opinion of a defendant\u2019s pretrial petition for a writ under section 1538.5 is not a conclusive determination of the validity of the challenged search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 632, 492 P.2d at 688. The California Supreme Court held that the latter view of a denial of a \u00a7 1538.5 writ was correct. <em>Id. </em>at 488, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 632, 492 P.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>The California Supreme Court first noted that the legislative history of Penal Code \u00a7 1538.5 showed that the state legislature intended \u201cthat the merits of search and seizure challenges raised by a defendant\u2019s unsuccessful petition for a pretrial writ may remain open for further review on appeal from an ensuing judgment of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 633, 492 P.2d at 689. The court also observed that the legislature in enacting \u201cnew procedures for the presentation of search and seizure challenges\u201d did not intend to alter the traditional California procedure affording a criminal defendant a written opinion and formal hearing as to his fourth amendment contentions. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 633, 492 P.2d at 689. Yet, the court wrote, if the denial of a writ, which does not require a hearing or written opinion under the California constitution or procedure, were given res judicata effect, then the criminal defendant would lose those benefits traditionally afforded. Moreover, defense counsel, recognizing this problem, would cease to invoke \u00a7 1538.5, thus undermining the legislature\u2019s intent to provide this method of challenging admissibility of evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 633-34, 492 P.2d at 689-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">The court rejected the People\u2019s argument that res judicata should be applied anyway because \u201cthe sole possible ground of the denial of defendant\u2019s petition was on the merits . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 634, 492 P.2d at 690. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-7\">[W]e cannot accept the People\u2019s contention that the sole possible ground for denying defendant\u2019s petition for the writ was a determination against him on the merits. We have continued to recognize that the writs of mandate and prohibition are \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cprerogative\u201d and that therefore their use for pretrial review . . . should be confined to questions of general importance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1405-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 491, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 634, 402 P.2d at 690. The court then referred to the many reasons, not related to the merits, because of which the Court of Appeal may have denied the writ. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-12\">In light of the various considerations which may impel appellate justices to vote to deny a defendant\u2019s petition for a pretrial writ under section 1538.5 without opinion, we believe that giving such a minute order conclusive effect on an appeal from a subsequent judgment of conviction would amount to improper conjecture and surmise as to the theoretically possible mental processes of the justices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1405-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 492, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 635, 492 P.2d at 691. The court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-14\">In view of the express language of section 1538.5, application of the doctrine of res judicata to give conclusive effect on appeal from a judgment of conviction to an appellate court\u2019s earlier decision denying defendant\u2019s application for a pretrial writ would be inappropriate even when the denial of the writ is by an opinion demonstrating adjudication of the merits. The statute permits the defendant to seek further review of the validity of the challenged search on appeal from a judgment of conviction .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1405-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 492, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 635, 492 P.2d at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-16\">The foregoing indicates that <em>Medina </em>did not affect the long-time California rule, reaffirmed in <em>Western Air Lines, </em>that the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of a writ of review of a rate order is a decision on the merits for res judicata purposes. <em>Medina </em>dealt with the res judicata effect of the denial of an extraordinary writ provided by the legislature under Penal Code \u00a7 1538.5 to afford a criminal defendant two opportunities to obtain review of trial court rulings on fourth amendment questions. The California Supreme Court concluded that application of res judicata, whether denial of a writ under \u00a7 1538.5 is with or without opinion, would be inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s intent in providing two opportunities for review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>Thus, <em>Medina </em>did not deal with the noncriminal writ of review provided by Public Utilities Code \u00a7 1756 as the sole means of obtaining judicial review of PUC rate orders.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Medina </em>did not purport to overrule or limit <em>Western Air Lines </em>or the traditional rule applied in <em>Napa Valley. </em>Indeed, the <em>Medina </em>court did not even cite <em>Western Air Lines, </em>though one would expect such a citation were <em>Medina </em>intended to overrule the long-followed practice reaffirmed in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">Appellants argue that <em>Medina </em>found the constitutional requirement of a written opinion to be an obstacle to application of res judicata when a writ is denied without written opinion. This is incorrect. First, while the particular case before the court involved a denial without written opinion, the court indicated that whether or not an opinion had been issued in denying a \u00a7 1538.5 writ, giving res judicata effect to the denial would conflict with the legislature\u2019s intent to provide duplicitous review.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, the court noted that the California constitutional provision requiring written opinions in some cases did not apply to the denial of writs. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 633, 492 P.2d at 689. Indeed, the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-5\">The denial without opinion of a petition for a writ of mandate or prohibition is not res judicata except when the sole possible ground of denial was on the merits or it affirmatively appears that the denial was intended to be on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyL7\"><em>Id. </em>at 491 n.6, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 634 n.6, 492 P.2d at 690 n.6. Thus, although the court also noted that the multitude of reasons why a writ under Penal Code \u00a7 1538.5 might be denied made it difficult to read the denial (at least in the case before it) as on the merits, it indicated that even in the context of writs of prohibition and mandate the absence of a written opinion was not necessarily fatal to application of res judi-cata.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-11\">In short, we conclude that <em>Medina </em>did not undermine the long-followed California rule that the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of a writ of review of a rate order without opinion constitutes a final judgment entitled to res judicata effect. Therefore, <em>Napa Valley, </em>involving a situation almost identical to the case before us, mandates application of res judicata in the present case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court\u2019s invocation of res judicata and its judgment are</p>\n<p id=\"akh-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1401-17\">. The procedural aspects of the California Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to disturb the PUC\u2019s order are discussed in part II <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1401-18\">. The federal officials were the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1401-19\">. The United States has filed a brief in this court as amicus curiae discussing the Government\u2019s analysis of the tax questions relating to the utilities\u2019 eligibility for accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits under the PUC\u2019s order. <em>See </em>note 4 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1401-20\">. The present appeal involves interlocutory review of a district court order regarding an injunction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). We do not discuss the utilities\u2019 request for declaratory relief, nor do we intimate any view on the proper interpretation of the federal tax statutes regarding accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits. See note 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1401-23\">. The district court issued the TRO on March 15, 1979. Because of the ten-day time limit on TRO\u2019s imposed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(b), on March 20, 1979, the parties stipulated to the extension of the TRO until March 30, 1979. The district court issued its order dissolving the TRO and denying the preliminary injunctions on March 30, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1402-9\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Napa Valley </em>indicates that the California Supreme Court\u2019s denial of review should be given res judicata effect even as to questions of federal constitutional law. Appellants suggest that the federal courts are now more reluctant to apply res judicata based on state court decisions when questions of construction of federal statutory or constitutional provisions exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-10\">We note that subsequent to <em>Napa Valley, </em>the California legislature modified the law regarding judicial review of rate orders to broaden and enhance the California Supreme Court\u2019s ability to inquire into federal constitutional questions in rate review. Cal.Pub.Util.Code \u00a7 1760, <em>quoted at </em>note 7 <em>infra; see Pac. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, </em>62 Cal.2d 634, 646, 44 Cal.Rptr. 1, 8, 401 P.2d 353, 360 (1965). This militates in favor of the <em>Napa Valley </em>approach.</p>\n<p id=\"asq-dedup-2\">We need not determine, however, if later cases have eroded federal deference to state interpretations of federal questions. In the instant case appellants\u2019 constitutional claims are frivolous. <em>See </em>note 15 <em>infra. </em>And the federal courts have not been asked in this proceeding for injunctive relief to interpret a federal statute. Appellants went to state court to have it overturn a state agency\u2019s rate order. Now they ask the federal courts to overturn the order. While appellants\u2019 underlying disagreement with the rate order is that the PUC allegedly misunderstood federal tax law (assuming that the IRS\u2019s interpretation is correct), whether this misunderstanding vitiates the rate order does not involve construction of a federal statute, but rather depends upon the scope of the PUC\u2019s discretion in setting rates. <em>Cf. Napa Valley Electric Co. v. R. R. Comm\u2019n, </em>251 U.S. 366, 372, 40 S.Ct. 174, 64 L.Ed. 310 (1920).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">.

Between the date of <em>Western Air Lines </em>and the present, there has been only one minor modification of the procedure for judicial review of rate orders. The final sentence of \u00a7 1756 as quoted in note 7 <em>supra </em>was added in 1963. 1963 Cal.Stats. ch. 461, p. 1310, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-13\">Prior to that time, \u00a7 1756 ended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-14\">The writ shall be made returnable not later than 30 days after the date of issuance, and shall direct the commission to certify its record in the case to the court. On the return day, the cause shall be heard by the Supreme Court, unless for a good reason shown it is continued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1404-15\">This administrative change gives the California Supreme Court greater flexibility in timing returns, records, and hearings. It does not affect the essential procedures for obtaining review of rate orders which underlay <em>Napa Valley </em>and <em>Western Air Lines.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1404-20\">. The United States Supreme Court wrote in a per curiam:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-21\">The motion to dismiss is granted and the appeal is dismissed for the want of a substantial federal question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1404-22\">348 U.S. at 859, 75 S.Ct. at 87. <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1404-23\">. The <em>Medina </em>court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-24\">Section 1538.5 provides that the defendant may seek pretrial appellate court review of the superior court\u2019s order denying his motion to suppress evidence by petitioning for a writ of mandate or prohibition and that he \u201cmay seek further review of the validity of a search or seizure on appeal from a conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">6 Cal.3d at 488, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 632, 492 P.2d at 688 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1405-17\">. <em>See </em>the preceding quotation in text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1406-6\">. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1406-7\">. 6 Cal.3d at 492, 99 Cal.Rptr. at 635, 492 P.2d at 691. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1406-8\">. As noted <em>supra, </em>we do not believe that <em>Medina, </em>dealing with a particular type of writ of prohibition or mandate in the criminal context, can reasonably be read as impinging upon the much different context of the writ of review provided by Cal.Pub.Util. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1756-1760. However, even if we assume that <em>Medina </em>states the standard for application of res judicata to writs of review of PUC orders, res judicata was properly applied here. While Cal.Pen.Code \u00a7 1538.5 provides for duplicitous appellate review which may be denied without resort to the merits, Cal.Pub.Util.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1756-1760 provide the exclusive means of obtaining appellate review of a PUC order. Thus, a denial of a writ of review must be interpreted as having involved rejection on the merits of appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1406-9\">. Appellants contend that it is both unfair and violative of due process to invoke res judicata here, allegedly because they have not had their day in court. We disagree. Appellants have presented their claims to the PUC on three occasions. They have also presented their claims to the California Supreme Court and sought a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court as well as a rehearing on the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of certiorari. Moreover, appellants will have an opportunity to present to the federal courts their contentions regarding the proper interpretation of federal tax statutes if and when the IRS seeks to collect the contested taxes. Additionally, appellants may also have an opportunity to litigate those interpretations in their declaratory relief action, though we express no opinion as to the propriety or proper outcome of that matter. <em>See </em>note 4 <em>supra. </em>That appellants\u2019 litigation efforts have been unsuccessful does not warrant rejection of res judicata; that doctrine is generally applied only because one side to litigation has lost and one side has won.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
