More than four months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>before the date of bankruptcy, the Bank had brought a creditor\u2019s suit in state court to impose and enforce a lien on this property. In affirming the referee\u2019s order, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that the Bank\u2019s lien had been obtained through legal proceedings within four months before bankruptcy, that the lien was voidable under section 67a(l) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(a)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the bankruptcy court therefore had jurisdiction of the property and could sell it. This court has jurisdiction under section 24a of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 47(a), and under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1334. For reasons hereinafter given, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In March, 1973, the Bank recovered two judgments in the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County, Florida, against Ralph Buchman, the bankrupt herein, who was then a resident of Florida. At the same time, writs of execution were issued thereon, and were returned nulla bona on February 25, 1975. On March 27, 1975 (more than four months before Buchman\u2019s bankruptcy), the Bank filed a creditor\u2019s suit and lis pendens in the Circuit Court for Pasco County, Florida, to enforce an equitable lien on Buchman\u2019s interest in certain real and personal property, located in Pasco County and held by Rex A. King as trustee under a joint venture agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 7, 1975 (less than four months before bankruptcy), Buchman, who had moved to South Dakota, was personally served with process.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">On August 1, 1975, Buchman filed a petition in bankruptcy in the District of South Dakota. The referee authorized the sale of all the bankrupt\u2019s assets, real or personal, and on January 11, 1977, after a report by the trustee, the referee confirmed the sale of the \u201ctrustee\u2019s equity, if any,\u201d in the real estate in Pasco County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On February 14, 1977, counsel for the Bank filed an affidavit, informing the bankruptcy court of the creditor\u2019s suit in Florida and stating that the complaint in that suit had been filed \u201cmore than four months prior to\u201d the date of bankruptcy. Claiming that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction of the property, the Bank moved that the referee vacate his order of January 11, deny approval of the sale of the real estate interest, and also deny approval of the proposed sale of Buchman\u2019s interest in the partnership called \u201cRex A. King As Trustee.\u201d On the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>day (February 14), the referee orally denied the Bank\u2019s motions and confirmed the sale of the \u201ctrustee\u2019s equity, if any,\u201d in Buch-man\u2019s partnership interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One week later, a written denial of the Bank\u2019s motions was entered and the Bank appealed to the district court arguing that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In the interval since the filing of the bankruptcy petition, the Bank had been proceeding with its creditor\u2019s suit in the Florida state court. On July 2, 1976, the state court granted the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment and subsequently scheduled a sale of Buchman\u2019s partnership interest for March 11, 1977. On March 4, 1977, the trustee in bankruptcy learned of this intended sale and obtained ex parte from the bankruptcy referee a stay of the sale. From the issuance of this stay, the Bank appealed to the district court, again challenging the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction over the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">In addition, the Bank moved that the referee reconsider the issuance of his stay order. Full argument was had on May 24, 1977, and on May 27 the referee denied the Bank\u2019s motion. The Bank then took its third appeal to the district court, raising the same issue of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">On consolidation of the three appeals, the district court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-13\">(1) that \u201c[u]pon the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, all property of Buch-man, including the equitable property in the joint venture with Rex King, vested in the bankruptcy court;\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-14\">(2) that under Florida law, the lien created by the commencement of a creditor\u2019s suit arises upon service of process, not upon mere filing of the suit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-15\">(3) that the Bank\u2019s lien was therefore obtained within four months of bankruptcy, and did not \u201cremove the assets from the bankruptcy court jurisdiction;\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-16\">(4) that the state court action to declare and enforce this lien was subject to the stay of Bankruptcy Rule 601.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Accordingly, the district court affirmed the referee\u2019s order confirming the sales of Buchman\u2019s interests in the real estate and joint venture. The referee\u2019s order staying the sale by the Florida court was upheld as a \u201creaffirmation\u201d and \u201cenforcement\u201d of the automatic stay of Rule 601.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Bank appeals only from the affirmance of the sale of Buchman\u2019s partnership interest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">On appeal the Bank argues that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction of the partnership interest for either of two reasons: (1) that the interest was subject to a lien enforcement proceeding begun in state court more than four months prior to bankruptcy; or (2) that the Bank had obtained a valid lien on the interest upon the <em>filing of </em>its creditor\u2019s suit (more than four months before bankruptcy), rather than upon service of process, and that by virtue of the commencement before bankruptcy of the suit to enforce this lien, the state court acquired exclusive jurisdiction of the partnership interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Implicit in appellant\u2019s argument were the assumptions that the bankruptcy court had to have jurisdiction of the partnership interest in order to sell it, and that the court\u2019s asserted lack of jurisdiction rendered the sale void.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">It is, of course, fundamental that a court must have subject matter jurisdiction in order to take any action in the proceeding before it. Confusion in the present case has arisen, however, through appellant\u2019s failure to distinguish between the prerequisites of bankruptcy court jurisdiction in two different kinds of situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Generally, where there is a dispute between the trustee in bankruptcy and an adverse claimant about the ownership of property, or about the validity or amount of a lien thereon, the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to resolve the dispute only if it has actual or constructive possession of the property, or consent to its jurisdiction by the adverse claimant. <em>Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Thompson, </em>106 F.2d 217, 222 (8th Cir. 1939), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>309 U.S. 478, 60 S.Ct. 628, 84 L.Ed. 876 (1940); <em>Page v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., </em>53 F.2d 27, 33-34 (8th Cir. 1931), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>286 U.S., 269, 52 S.Ct. 507, 76 L.Ed. 1096 (1932); 2 Collier H 23.04[2] (1974). It is this kind of jurisdiction that the Bank insists was a precondition of the sale in issue. The problem with this argument is that there was no dispute or controversy of the sort just mentioned, the determination of which would require the bankruptcy court to have possession of the property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> All that occurred was the referee\u2019s confirmation of a sale of the bankrupt\u2019s property over the Bank\u2019s objection that the bankruptcy court lacked authority to sell. Because the disagreement directly concerned only the extent of the court\u2019s authority, and not the rights of the parties in any specific piece of property, the court\u2019s jurisdiction did not depend on possession of any given property.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The kind of subject matter jurisdiction that is relevant here is the power of a bankruptcy court to sell the property of the bankrupt estate. Section 2a(7) of the Act grants the court jurisdiction to \u201c[cjause the estates of bankrupts to be collected, reduced to money, and distributed . . .\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 11(a)(7) (1976). Under section 70a(5), the trustee is vested, as of the filing date, with the bankrupt\u2019s title to any property \u201cwhich prior to the filing of the petition [the bankrupt]' could by any means have transferred or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him . . 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(a)(5) (1976). Florida law provides that a partnership interest is both \u201ctransferable\u201d and \u201cleviable;\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> therefore, Buch-man\u2019s partnership interest became part of the bankrupt estate, and the trustee acquired Buchman\u2019s title to it. The bankruptcy court clearly had general subject matter jurisdiction to sell the partnership interest. Provided that the court complied with any specific requirements relating to the kind of sale made, the sale was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">A bankruptcy sale may be either subject to all valid liens and incumbrances, or free and clear of all liens and incumbrances. Property may be sold subject to all valid<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> liens if the trustee has title to the property, regardless of whether the court has possession of it. <em>Piedmont Coal Co. v. Hustead (In re Thompson), </em>294 F. 247, 250-51 (3d Cir. 1923), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 U.S. 582, 44 S.Ct. 331, 68 L.Ed. 860 (1924), <em>quoted in </em>5 H.

According to <em>Collier:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Z\">Whatever property is transferred to the trustee by operation of law, the bankruptcy court generally may order sold. The right to sell is a natural corollary of the transfer of title. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">4B Collier \u00b6 70.97[5], at 1147-48 (1967) (footnote omitted). If, however, the court wishes to sell property free and clear of all liens and incumbrances (with the liens being transferred to the proceeds of the sale), then the court must have actual or constructive possession of the property. <em>See, e. g., Bradley v. St. Louis Terminal Warehouse Co., </em>189 F.2d 818 (8th Cir. 1951); <em>In re Cabezal Supermarket, Inc., </em>406 F.Supp. 345, 350 (D.N.D.1976); 4B Collier \u00b6 70.99[1], at 1214-15 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">In the present case, the referee\u2019s order confirmed the sale of the \u201ctrustee\u2019s equity, if any,\u201d in the partnership interest. From the' meaning of \u201cequity\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>and from the use of the phrase \u201cif any,\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it is obvious that this sale was subject to all valid liens. As discussed above, the trustee had title to the partnership interest. Since the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction to sell Buchman\u2019s partnership interest and since the prerequisite of a sale subject to liens (title in the trustee) was met, the sale of the partnership interest was valid.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">For the reasons discussed above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-6\">.

By a written agreement of August, 1967, Buchman, King .and a third person had formed this joint venture to develop a specified parcel of real estate, each of the three \u201cOwners\u201d contributing an equal amount toward the purchase price of the land. Solely for convenience in the purchase, improvement and resale of the land, King took title in his name, alone, as trustee for the three \u201cOwners.\u201d Under Florida law, such \u201can agreement among two or more to purchase specific property for speculation or resale at a profit is a joint adventure\u201d and \u201cis governed by partnership law.\u201d <em>Drew v.

Hearne, </em>100 Fla. 1180, 1186-87, 131 So. 173, 176 (1930). Moreover, the decision of the parties to carry on their venture in the form of a trust does not change the nature of the relationship among themselves. <em>Alter v. Finesmith, </em>214 So.2d 732, 737 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1968), cer<em>t. denied, </em>225 So.2d 538 (Fla.1969), or their liability to third parties, <em>Drew v.

Hoggson Corp., </em>90 Fla. 343, 354-55, 106 So. 408, 412 (1925). Thus, despite the formal appearance that Buchman was a beneficiary of a trust, the corpus of which was the land and proceeds from its sale, Buchman\u2019s interest was really that of a partner and the land and proceeds were partnership property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-14\">. The bankrupt himself, through his attorney, was the purchaser at this sale; the purchase price was $450; the Bank\u2019s earlier bid of $400 was rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\">. The equity in the partnership interest and in some other property was sold to Buchman\u2019s wife for $1,600.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\">. This statement appeared in the part of the opinion dealing with the validity of the stay order, but the proposition was also logically necessary to the court\u2019s reasoning as to the validity of the sales. Insofar as the court was referring to <em>title </em>to bankrupt\u2019s property, the sentence is fundamentally correct. The court, however, accepted the statement as a premise of its finding that the bankruptcy court had <em>jurisdiction </em>of the property. In doing so, the court confused <em>title </em>to the bankrupt\u2019s property with <em>possession </em>of the property (which is the basis for summary jurisdiction over any specific property). <em>See, e.g., Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., </em>309 U.S. 478, 481, 60 S.Ct. 628, 630, 84 L.Ed. 876 (1940) (\u201cBankruptcy courts have summary jurisdiction to adjudicate controversies relating to property over which they have actual or constructive possession. And the test of this jurisdiction is not title in but possession by the bankrupt at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">. The court\u2019s reasoning on this point was unclear, but apparently reliance was placed on \u00a7 67a(l) of the Act. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>The United States Supreme Court has held, however, that a lien subject to this section is not \u201cvoid,\u201d but merely voidable. <em>Fischer v. Pauline Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>309 U.S. 294, 300-03, 60 S.Ct. 535, 84 L.Ed. 764 (1940). A trustee seeking to invoke the section must, for the benefit of the lienholder, obtain a judicial determination of the applicability of the section. <em>Id. </em>at 302, 60 S.Ct. 535. Moreover, in the absence of \u201cfraud,\u201d the trustee bears the burden of proving that the debtor was insolvent when the lien was obtained. <em>Liberty Nat\u2019l Bank v. Bear, </em>265 U.S. 365, 369-70, 44 S.Ct. 499, 68 L.Ed. 1057 (1924); <em>First State Bank v. Fox, </em>10 F.2d 116, 118-19 (8th Cir. 1925); <em>Stone-Ordean-Wells Co. v.

Furthermore, there is no evidence that the trustee ever alleged \u2014 let alone proved \u2014 that Buchman was insolvent when the lien arose. These facts make it quite tenuous to base a finding of the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction upon the invalidity of the Bank\u2019s lien under \u00a7 67a(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b253-19\">.

Cas. Co. v. Pennsylvania ex rel. Schnader, </em>294 U.S. 189, 198, 55 S.Ct. 126, 79 L.Ed. 651 (1935); <em>Federal Nat\u2019l Mortgage Ass\u2019n v. Tieso &amp; Kostka Corp., </em>137 F.Supp. 186, 188-89 (D.Minn.1955)). Thus, the question would be whether the bankruptcy court\u2019s sale interfered in any way with the Florida court\u2019s presumed exclusive right of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-18\">In such a situation, where a valid lien is being foreclosed in a state court proceeding begun before bankruptcy, the trustee in bankruptcy may intervene in the state proceeding in order to claim the surplus and thereby protect the interest of the bankrupt estate. <em>E.g., Straton </em>v. New, 283 U.S. 318, 327, 51 S.Ct. 465, 75 L.Ed. 1060 (1931); <em>McGonigle v. Foutch, </em>51 . F.2d 455, 461 (8th Cir. 1931); <em>In re Baumchen, </em>97 F.Supp. 1005, 1006, 1007-08 (D.N.D.1951). In effect, the sale of the trustee\u2019s equity in the partnership interest simply transferred, from the trustee to the purchaser (Buchman\u2019s wife), the right to intervene in the Florida suit and claim the surplus. The mere change in identity of the person entitled to intervene would not have interfered in any way with the Florida court\u2019s exclusive control. Therefore, the bankruptcy court\u2019s sale would still have been valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-19\">The most difficult question posed by this case is why the Bank appealed. Since the sale was subject to all valid liens, and since the trustee did not attempt to avoid the Bank\u2019s lien, appellant had absolutely nothing to gain from this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
