Second Supplemental Appropriations Act, Pub.L. No. 89-16, tit. IV, 79 Stat. 108 (1965) (the Appropriation Act).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Southern Paiute Judgment Distribution Act, Pub.L. No. 90-584, 82 Stat. 1147 (1968) (the Distribution Act) was enacted three years later to provide for distribution of the judgment fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-22\">The Distribution Act directed the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to prepare a roll of all persons who met the requirements of membership in six specified groups or categories of Southern Paiutes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>Applications for inclusion on the roll were required to be filed in the manner and within the time limits prescribed by the Secretary, whose determination on all applications was to be final. After deducting expenses, the Secretary was directed to apportion the remainder of the fund among the six groups of persons entitled to enrollment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">Regulations promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to the Distribution Act repeat the eligibility requirements outlined in the act and further require that applications for enrollment be postmarked by June 30, 1969. 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.3(7 )(l)-(4) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">Plaintiffs brought this suit for damages in federal district court contending that the United States made inadequate attempts to enroll eligible persons residing in remote areas, which caused plaintiffs and the class they represent to fail to receive their rightful shares of the settlement. Plaintiffs\u2019 district court complaint, as amended, denominated five causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-6\">(1) breach of a trust created by the Distribution Act and regulations promulgated thereunder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-7\">(2) breach of a trust created by general federal Indian statutes, regulations and judicial decisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-8\">(3) breach of statutory duties established by the Distribution Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-9\">(4) taking of property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-11\">(5) deprivation of property without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1424-13\">Plaintiffs asserted that the district court had jurisdiction over these claims by virtue of a provision of the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a) (1976), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-14\">(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the Court of Claims, of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-15\">(2) Any . . . civil action or claim against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1424-18\">The district court concluded that its Tucker Act jurisdiction did not extend to any of the claims alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The court was of the view that the Distribution Act did not establish a trust or create other substantive rights in the plaintiffs that were enforceable under the Tucker Act, and accordingly dismissed the first and third causes of action. The second cause of action was dismissed on the ground that an action for breach of trust was beyond the district court\u2019s Tucker Act jurisdiction. The court further concluded that plaintiffs did not enjoy a property right in the judgment fund cognizable under the Fifth Amendment and therefore dismissed the fourth and fifth causes of action. Whether dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as to each of these claims was proper is the only issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-20\">We begin our review of the trial court\u2019s disposition by noting that through the Tucker Act the United States has consented to be sued in the district courts and the Court of Claims for money damages arising out of certain specified circumstances. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491 (1976). <em>See United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 590, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941); <em>International Engineering Co. v. Richardson, </em>167 U.S.App.D.C. 396, 512 F.2d 573, 577 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1048, 96 S.Ct. 774, 46 L.Ed.2d 636 (1976); <em>Pasha v. United States, </em>484 F.2d 630, 633 (7th Cir. 1973); <em>Konecny v. United States, </em>388 F.2d 59, 62 (8th Cir. 1967). However, the act itself does not provide any substantive rights enforceable against the United States in a suit for damages; it merely confers jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>whenever such a substantive right falling within the categories enumerated in the Tucker Act otherwise exists. <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). It is not enough that a complaint contain allegations comporting with Tucker Act claim categories. The Supreme Court in <em>Testan </em>made it clear that before a court may hear a Tucker Act claim against the United States, it must first determine that some \u201cfederal statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2018can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.\u2019 \u201d 424 U.S. at 400, 96 S.Ct. at 954 (quoting <em>Eastport Steamship Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>178 Ct.Cl. 599, 372 F.2d 1002, 1009 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">Since plaintiffs\u2019 claims are premised on the Constitution, federal statutes, and executive regulations, they are within the specific categories enumerated in the Tucker Act. Inasmuch as the Distribution Act gave plaintiffs the right to share in the judgment proceeds,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the controlling question is whether federal law mandates compensation for damages plaintiffs may have sustained because of the Secretary\u2019s actions in derogation of their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-7\"> Our analysis of the question focuses first on the breach of trust claims. At the outset we express our full agreement with plaintiffs\u2019 contention that a legislative declaration of trust status for a particular fund is itself a congressional mandate, fully consistent with the <em>Testan-Eastport </em>standard discussed above, that the United States assume financial responsibility for its failure adequately to perform its fiduciary obligations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Liability on the part of a trustee for breach of his fiduciary duties is inherent in a trust relationship. Unless it appeared affirmatively that Congress meant to create something less than a trust relationship when it used the term \u201ctrust\u201d in referring to a particular fund, we would necessarily assume that Congress intended to establish nothing less than a valid trust \u2014 complete with fiduciary duties and concomitant financial liability for their breach. That congressional creation of a trust relationship itself mandates compensation for damages sustained from breach of that trust has recently been recognized by the Court of Claims in a decision involving amicus Quinault Allottees Association. <em>See Mitchell v. United States, </em>591 F.2d 1300, 1302 (Ct.Cl.1979).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-14\">While we accept plaintiffs\u2019 basic jurisdictional premise, we cannot agree that Congress in any way indicated that the judgment fund in question was to be held in trust pending distribution or that the Secretary was to act as a trustee in distributing the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-15\">The Appropriation Act did not indicate that the fund would be held in trust pend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>ing distribution. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 89-16, tit. IV, 79 Stat. 108. Neither did the Distribution Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 90-584, 82 Stat. 1147. Plaintiffs refer to several statutes concerning trusts, but none has applicability to the fund in question. <em>E. g., </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (1976) (concerning stocks, bonds, and other securities held by the Secretary for certain Indians on June 10, 1876); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 161 (1976) (Secretary authorized to deposit into the Treasury certain funds held by him as trustee on April 1, 1880); 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 547a (1976) (investment procedure for trust funds).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">Plaintiffs place substantial reliance on 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 725s(a)(20) (1976),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> contending it declares that the judgment fund, while held in the Treasury pending distribution, was held in trust. At first blush, the section does appear to have the effect plaintiffs attribute to it. Although the government inexplicably makes no attempt to refute the claimed significance of the section, our independent research leads us to conclude that the section does not have the sweeping meaning that a simple reading of it might indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">Section 725s provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-6\">(a) The funds appearing on the books of the Government and listed in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be classified on the books of the Treasury as trust funds. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-7\">(20) Indian moneys, proceeds of labor, agencies, schools, and so forth (5t301).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-8\">The key to understanding the scope of subsection 20 is found in the rather cryptic parenthetical notation \u201c(5t301).\u201d This notation refers to the particular Treasury account to which the specified funds were credited. 78 Cong.Ree. 8242 (1934) (remarks of Rep. Griffin). The funds so credited were described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-12\">This fund covers deposits in the Treasury of the United States of proceeds of pasturage and sales of timber, coal, or other products and miscellaneous revenues of any Indian reservation, except those of the Five Civilized Tribes, and not the result of the labor of any one member of a tribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-13\">Hearing on H.R. 9410 Before the Subcomm. on Permanent Appropriations of the House Appropriations Comm., 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 255 (1934). The Chief Finance Officer of the Indian Service further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-14\">In the negotiation of the treaties with the several tribes of Indians, tracts of land were set aside for agencies, schools, and administrative purposes. Frequently the Indians were compensated in some way for the land so held. The title to the land is vested in the United States. There were set aside anywhere from 160 to 640 acres of land, all of which is not needed. Some of that land may be leased for grazing purposes, the agency may operate a farm on it, or the land may be put to some other use. The revenue derived from that land comes in, not to the credit of the tribe, but is taken up in the account as \u201cIndian Moneys, Proceeds of Labor\u201d, and is available for expenditure by the several schools or agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 258 (testimony of Mr. Dodd).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-16\">It is clear that this provision dealt only with a narrow range of \u201cIndian moneys,\u201d and not with all funds that might be so described. It is equally clear that funds appropriated in settlement of claims brought before the Indian Claims Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>sion are not within that narrow range. It follows that this section provides no basis for concluding that the judgment proceeds were held in trust at the time they were distributed by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">Plaintiffs advance the further argument that an analysis of the existing body of law and regulations applicable to Indians, taken as a whole, supports the conclusion that the relationship of the United States to its Indian citizens is in the nature of a trust. This point is not without some appeal and, indeed, it is entirely accurate as a general proposition. But this characterization simply does not satisfy the <em>Testan-Eastport </em>requirement of a specific congressional mandate to compensate those injured by the violation of some substantive right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">For the reasons outlined in this opinion, we agree that plaintiffs\u2019 breach of trust claims were properly dismissed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In so deciding, we are not unmindful of language in <em>Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes v. United States, </em>512 F.2d 1390, 1392 (Ct.Cl.1975), \u201cthat funds appropriated to Indians to satisfy judgments of the Indian Claims Commission or of [the Court of Claims], as well as funds produced by tribal activities, are, when kept in the Treasury, held in trust for the Indians.\u201d The <em>Cheyenne-Arapaho </em>case involved several types of trust funds, including two held by the Southern Ute Tribe which were derived from an Indian Claims Commission award. That case is readily distinguishable from this one, however, in that specific congressional legislation declared the funds in <em>Cheyenne-Arapaho </em>to be held in trust.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In any event, insofar as the cited language in <em>Cheyenne-Arapaho </em>would lead us to a conclusion incompatible with the standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>announced in <em>Testan, </em>we are unable to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">Plaintiffs have also drawn our attention to two cases decided by the Court of Claims subsequent to its decision in <em>Mitchell.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Both decisions, <em>Duncan v. United States, </em>597 F.2d 1337 (Ct.Cl.1979), and <em>Cherry v. United States, </em>594 F.2d 795 (Ct.Cl.1979), concluded that Tucker Act jurisdiction existed for breach of trust claims presented by plaintiffs in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">In <em>Cherry, </em>the court reasoned that a statute and related regulations \u201cenvision[ed]\u201d a trust relationship between the Air Force and missing Air Force personnel insofar as management of compensation accruing to servicemen missing in action was concerned. 594 F.2d at 799. This result was reached despite the absence of the word \u201ctrustee\u201d in the provisions relied on. We agree that use of the word \u201ctrustee\u201d is not absolutely essential to the finding of a trust relationship when it is otherwise clear that Congress intended a trust relationship to exist.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But even if the Court of Claims was correct in discerning a trust relationship in the provisions considered in <em>Cherry, </em>we are unable to reach a similar conclusion in the case before us. We simply do not find in the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions an enumeration of duties which would justify a conclusion that Congress intended the Secretary to be a trustee in carrying out the provisions of the Distribution Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">In <em>Duncan, </em>the court cited <em>Cherry </em>for the proposition that \u201cCongress need not expressly use a talismanic phrase such as \u2018trust relationship\u2019 or \u2018hold in trust\u2019 in order to establish a trust relationship.\u201d 597 F.2d at 1342. However, the case was like <em>Mitchell</em>\u2014and unlike <em>Cherry</em>\u2014in that it involved a statutory provision which explicitly recognized the existence of a trust relationship. <em>See id. </em>at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-11\">Whether or not these cases are at variance with <em>Testan </em>is not clear. Insofar as they are, we of course cannot follow them. Insofar as they are not, they do not require a conclusion different from the one we have reached here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 third cause of action was properly dismissed. This cause of action was based on alleged breach of statutory duties established by the Distribution Act, independent of any trust relationship. The requisite mandate of federal compensation for damages sustained is not to be found in these provisions. <em>See United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. at 400, 96 S.Ct. 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-15\">Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims in counts 4 and 5 were also properly dismissed. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs had no constitutionally cognizable individual property rights in the undistributed fund of which they could have been deprived in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>The legislative scheme for settlement of Indian claims before the Indian Claims Commission was designed to provide relief for group claims as opposed to individual claims. <em>See Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians </em>v. <em>United States, </em>203 Ct.Cl. 426, 490 F.2d 935, 951 (1974). We see no basis for concluding that the individuals in this case had somehow come to enjoy individual property interests in the judgment award at the time of distribution. The Distribution Act establishes no basis for such a conclusion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It provides that the fund be distributed \u201camong the <em>groups </em>of persons entitled to enrollment on the Southern Paiute Indian roll.\u201d Pub.L. No. 90-584, \u00a7 3, 82 Stat. 1147 (emphasis added). Further indication that individual property interests were not intended on behalf of all persons coming within the categories in the Distribution Act is seen in section 4 of the act. It provides that the judgment award shares payable to two groups of Southern Paiutes, the Kaibab Band and the Moapa Band, be \u201credeposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the respective bands,\u201d for use <em>\u201cin any manner </em>authorized by the governing body [of each band] and approved by the Secretary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4 (emphasis added). Although the distributional section applicable to plaintiffs directed distribution to individuals, the right to such an individual payment, and thus a specific property right in the judgment award, was predicated upon enrollment by the Secretary. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5. Plaintiffs were not so enrolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">Given the variety and complexity of acts and regulations providing for distribution of judgment awards and other funds among Indians, we intentionally avoid making sweeping statements concerning the existence or scope of constitutionally significant property interests in these funds generally. We simply hold that these particular plaintiffs did not, as a matter of law, have such property interests in this particular judgment fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">For the reasons outlined- in this opinion, the order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1423-14\">. The settlement was stipulated to before the Indian Claims Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1423-15\">. Title IV of Pub.L.

For purposes of this determination, an \u201cauthorized regulation\u201d is the equivalent of a statute. <em>See United States v.

No. 90-584, \u00a7 1(g), 82 Stat. 1147.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1425-10\">. We do not believe <em>Testan </em>requires that Congress expressly state that damages are recoverable before jurisdiction under the Tucker Act will lie. <em>See Mitchell v. United States, </em>591 F.2d 1300, 1302 (Ct.Cl., 1979). The <em>Eastport </em>decision noted that the right to monetary recovery could be granted \u201cexpressly or by implication.\u201d 178 Ct.Cl. 599, 372 F.2d at 1007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1425-17\">. The conclusion that the Tucker Act provides a jurisdictional basis for claims alleging breach of a congressionally created trust is by no means novel. In <em>United States v.

The Court did not, however, question the Court of Claims\u2019 conclusion that the Tucker Act was a proper jurisdictional basis for bringing such a claim. <em>See </em>412 U.S. at 394 n. 5, 93 S.Ct. 2202.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1426-9\">. The only express mention in the Distribution Act of a trust relationship is in section 6. That section merely authorizes the Secretary to establish trusts in favor of individual enroilees under certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-10\">Sums payable to enroilees or their heirs or legatees who are less than twenty-one years of age or who are under a legal disability shall be paid in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary determines will best protect their interests, including the establishment of trusts.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1426-18\">.

The parties devote some attention to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)\u2019s grant of jurisdiction over claims against the United States \u201cfor liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d Even assuming an action for breach of trust fits within this category of claim\u2014 which it certainly seems to do \u2014 appellants must still demonstrate the existence of the requisite congressional intention that monetary compensation be available for violation of a substantive right. We have stated that congressional establishment of a trust itself satisfies this requirement for claims based on breach of that trust. No such establishment of a trust has been demonstrated by plaintiffs in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-8\">This problem may be of no more than theoretical interest in any event. Any congressional creation of a trust would be accomplished directly, by statute, or indirectly, by authorized regulation. An action for breach of that trust would therefore readily fit within the \u201cAct of Congress\u201d and \u201cregulation of an executive department\u201d prongs of the Tucker Act, making resort to the more amorphous \u201ccases not sounding in tort\u201d category unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1427-9\">. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 672, enacted in 1951, divided certain trust funds, giving a portion to the Southern Utes. That statute directed that this portion be credited to the Southern Utes\u2019 \u201cexisting\u201d trust account established pursuant to other provisions of Title 25. When Congress ordered distribution of the Indian Claims Commission award forming the trust res at issue in <em>Cheyenne-Arapaho, </em>it simply directed that the judgment share attributable to the Southern Utes be \u201cavailable for use in accordance with existing authorization,\u201d including \u00a7 672. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 676a (1976). Moreover, Congress expressly referred to the Southern Utes\u2019 judgment award as constituting a trust fund. <em>Id. </em>Thus there was present in the <em>Cheyenne-Arapaho </em>case precisely what is missing in this case \u2014 a specific congressionally created trust relationship from which a congressional mandate for compensatory damages for breach of trust can be fairly implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-13\">We recognize that \u00a7 676a refers to \u201cthe trust fund . . . appropriated by the Second Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1965.\u201d This act, of course, also appropriated the sum to pay the Southern Paiute award involved in the instant case. The fact that the Appropriation Act does not itself refer to trust funds being appropriated and the absence in the Southern Paiute Distribution Act of any reference to a pre-distribution trust relationship nonetheless compel the conclusion that the quoted phrase in \u00a7 676a refers only to the Ute award dealt with by that section, and not to the Southern Paiute award. Our comprehensive review of the legislative history of \u00a7 676a indicates there is no basis for concluding that Congress meant to express its intention that <em>all </em>sums appropriated by the Appropriation Act, including those in no way expressly affected by \u00a7 676a, were to be held as trust funds. In this regard, a comparison of \u00a7 676a with the Distribution Act is insightful: While \u00a7 676a, dealing with Southern Utes, refers to \u201cthe <em>trust fund . . </em>appropriated by the Second Supplemental Appropriations Act,\u201d \u00a7 1 of the Distribution Act, dealing with Southern Paiutes, refers to \u201cthe <em>sum . . </em>appropriated [by that same appropriation act].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">.

By the same token, as noted earlier in this opinion, mere use of the term \u201ctrust\u201d would not <em>necessarily </em>justify a conclusion that an actual trust relationship had been intended by Congress. <em>See </em>text following note 5 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1428-9\">. It should be noted that a panel member dissented in <em>Cherry, </em>stating that a trust \u201ccannot be implied from authorities relied upon by the court.\u201d 594 F.2d at 802. The dissent focused on the jurisdictional standards announced in <em>Testan </em>and <em>Eastport </em>(decisions curiously overlooked by the <em>Cherry </em>majority) and criticized the majority\u2019s use of <em>Mitchell:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-16\">The court has not pointed to any passage in the Missing Persons Act which creates \u201cexpressly or by implication\u201d the statutory authorization for a trust which it required in <em>Mitchell </em>as the \u201csubstantive right\u201d which mandates compensation. It is very important to note in this connection that in <em>Mitchell </em>the holding that the statute authorized suit for monetary recovery was based on an implication which derived from the statute\u2019s express declaration of a trust. It is the absence of the latter which here deprives the court of the analogy it seeks to establish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1428-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 803.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">.
