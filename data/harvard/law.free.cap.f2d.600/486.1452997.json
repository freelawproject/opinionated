Because the constitutional challenge to the statute is insubstantial and a forum is available in which the attack on the regulation can be adjudicated, it is not necessary to decide whether Congress could totally preclude judicial review of its legislative actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-19\">Several licensed optometrists initiated this action in federal district court for in-junctive and declaratory relief in a constitutional challenge to that part of the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395x(r), which for most purposes excludes doctors of optometry from the definition of \u201cphysician\u201d under the Medicare Part B Health Insurance Program. Part B of the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395j-1395w, is a voluntary health insurance program in which a qualifying individual who obtains a covered service can either pay for the service and request reimbursement or assign the right of reimbursement to the person providing the service.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Functions covered by Part B are limited to certain \u201cmedical and other health services,\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395k, which include \u201cphysician\u2019s services,\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395x(s)(l); that is, professional services performed by \u201cphysicians.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395x(q).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Section 1395x(r), the section of Part B of the Act challenged by plaintiffs, defines the term \u201cphysician\u201d in certain enumerated categories including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">(1) a [licensed] doctor of medicine or osteopathy . \u2022 . ., (4) a doctor of optometry who is legally authorized to practice optometry by the State in which he performs such function, but only with respect to establishing the necessity for prosthetic lenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">To the extent the statutory definition of \u201cphysicians\u201d limits its inclusion of the plaintiff-optometrists, their patients cannot be reimbursed or assign the right of reimbursement for optometric services. Plaintiffs argue that doctors of medicine or osteopathy, whose qualifying patients are always entitled to reimbursement, may perform many of the identical diagnostic services performed by doctors of optometry. Yet unless the optometric services are for the purpose of establishing the necessity for prosthetic lenses, their patients cannot receive Part B reimbursement. This overlap of services, plaintiffs say, makes the statutory classification excluding their patients from the benefits of the Act arbitrary, irrational, and not justified by any governmental interest. Thus, they claim that \u00a7 1395x(r) violates their right to equal protection under the fifth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Alternatively, plaintiffs challenge the validity of a regulation, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.232c, promulgated by the Secretary to implement \u00a7 1395x(r), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">The prescription or order of a doctor of optometry will be accepted as evidence of the medical need for prosthetic lenses. However, optometric examinations for any purpose are not covered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">They ask that the regulation be declared void because it cannot be reconciled with the definition of \u201cphysician\u201d in \u00a7 1395x(r)(4) \u00e1s written.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Jurisdiction was invoked under 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1331(a), 1346(a)(2), and 1361. The district court dismissed the action for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">Congress enacted the Medicare Act as part of the Social Security Act, incorporating the latter Act\u2019s limitation on federal court involvement. Section 205(h) of the Social Security Act, expressly incorporated into the Medicare Act by 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395\u00dc, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-14\">The findings and decisions of the Secretary after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing. No findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided. No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 41 [presently including \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1346] of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">In <em>Weinberger v, Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975), the Supreme Court analyzed the language of \u00a7 205(h) to determine how it affected the Court\u2019s jurisdiction over a constitutional challenge to a provision of the Social Security Act classifying eligible beneficiaries. It found that the third sentence of \u00a7 205(h) totally \u201cpreclude[d] resort to federal-question jurisdiction for the adjudication of ap-pellees\u2019 constitutional [challenges].\u201d 422 U.S. at 761, 95 S.Ct. at 2464-65. However, the Court was not faced with a situation in which absolutely no judicial consideration of the constitutional issue was available, because a separate section of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g), contains specific procedures for raising claims under the Act, culminating with judicial review in a federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">The Medicare Act has no provision comparable to \u00a7 405(g) setting forth the precise avenues of review in a case such as this.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet, absence of a statutory mechanism permitting the judicial scrutiny of claims under the Medicare Act did not force this court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation v. Califano, </em>571 F.2d 328 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 893, 99 S.Ct. 250, 58 L.Ed.2d 238 (1978), to read the third sentence of \u00a7 405(h) any less broadly than <em>Salfi </em>did in the context of the Social Security Act. In <em>MacDonald Foundation </em>this court was presented with a constitutional challenge to the Secretary\u2019s decision to reduce reimbursable costs under Part A of the Medicare Act in certain circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The en banc court, relying on <em>Salfi, </em>concluded that \u00a7 405(h) \u201cprecludes all review of the Secretary\u2019s decisions by federal district courts brought under [28 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 1331,\u201d 571 F.2d at 331, but added that judicial review of the constitutional question before it was not thereby totally barred. It pointed out that the Court of Claims in <em>Whitecliff, Inc. v. United States, </em>536 F.2d 347, 210 Ct.Cl. 53 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 969, 97 S.Ct. 1652, 52 L.Ed.2d 361 (1977), had previously asserted jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1491 to review constitutional and statutory claims against a decision by the Secretary despite \u00a7 405(h). Given the availability of such Court of Claims jurisdiction, this court found the absence of \u00a7 405(g) from the Medicare system an insufficient distinction between the two statutory schemes to merit an interpretation of \u00a7 405(h) different from <em>Salfi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Plaintiffs argue that <em>MacDonald Foundation </em>cannot control this case. They maintain that this court must take jurisdiction despite the congressional bar in \u00a7 405(h) because there is no alternate forum available in the Court of Claims or elsewhere to adjudicate their claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\"><em>MacDonald Foundation </em>controls the present appeal. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief on both the statutory and regulatory claims under the general jurisdictional grants of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1331(a) and 1346(a)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The general grant of jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1491, authorizes that court to entertain damage actions against the United States. By that court\u2019s own determination, \u00a7 405(h) does not affect its authority under \u00a7 1491 to review Medicare disputes, in the absence of statutory review procedures, \u201cat least so far as to ensure compliance with statutory and constitutional provisions.\u201d <em>Whitecliff, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>536 F.2d at 351.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>extent that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are cognizable under \u00a7 1491, <em>MacDonald Foundation </em>governs this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Section 1491 does not authorize the Court of Claims to grant the declaratory relief sought in this suit. <em>United States v. Tes-tan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976); <em>United States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969). This does not change the result. We are concerned not with whether plaintiffs can receive the precise relief requested but whether the issues raised can be heard. In <em>American Association of Medical Staffs v. Califano, </em>575 F.2d 1367 (5th Cir. 1978), this court was confronted with a similar request for declaratory and injunctive relief in constitutional and statutory claims against regulations promulgated under the Medicare Act. As in today\u2019s case, that particular suit could not be brought in the Court of Claims. That fact did not prevent this court from dismissing for lack of jurisdiction because \u201cthe <em>issue </em>raised by the plaintiff could be heard by [the Court of Claims] if [the plaintiff] can state a claim for damages or at least for nominal damages.\u201d 575 F.2d at 1373. <em>Medical Staffs </em>concluded that the due process claim could support a request for nominal damages and that the allegations suggested the existence of actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the questioned regulation, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.232c, can easily be recast to assert their patients\u2019 Medicare rights as assignees to reimbursement for optometric services rendered.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because Court of Claims jurisdiction is available, total preclusion of judicial review does not result from the congressional decision to restrict district court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">It is argued that neither <em>MacDonald Foundation </em>nor <em>Medical Staffs </em>apply to define our jurisdiction over the issue in which plaintiffs challenge the statute\u2019s constitutionality. Plaintiffs contend that, since the equal protection challenge to \u00a7 1395x(r) involves no Secretarial act, regulation, or decision, the claim is not one \u201carising under\u201d the Medicare Act and thus the plain language of \u00a7 405(h) renders its jurisdictional limitation inapplicable. While this exact issue was not addressed by the court in <em>MacDonald Foundation </em>or <em>Medical </em>Staffs,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the argument was expressly rejected by the <em>Salfi </em>Court which found that a constitutional challenge to a statutory classification defining Social Security beneficiaries was a \u201cclaim arising under\u201d the Act and was barred from direct judicial scrutiny by \u00a7 405(h). <em>Accord, Califano </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). Despite the fact that the main challenge sought to invoke constitutional rights rather than the Secretary\u2019s actions under the statutory scheme, the Court reasoned that it was one \u201carising under\u201d the Act because the answer to the constitutional question would determine whether or not benefits were to be awarded.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the same manner, a resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tion of the constitutionality of \u00a7 1395x(r) here would determine the expenditure of Medicare funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">A more critical distinction is raised by plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the equal protection claim could never result in a damage award if successful and therefore could not be drafted so as to invoke Court of Claims jurisdiction under \u00a7 1491. Unlike the alleged due process violation in <em>Medical Staffs, </em>an equal protection claim, plaintiffs argue, cannot exact nominal damages. Even so, they say, any damage award would be barred by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The gist of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim is that the congressional decision to allocate Medicare funds by classifying the type of \u201cphysician\u201d who renders the service is irrational because it fails to account for overlaps of services performed by different classes of doctors. Plaintiffs agree, however, that the classification is constitutional if it is rationally related to furthering a legitimate state interest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">This inquiry employs a relatively relaxed standard reflecting the Court\u2019s awareness that the drawing of lines that create distinctions is peculiarly a legislative task and an unavoidable one. Perfection in making the necessary classifications is neither possible nor necessary. Such action by the legislature is presumed to be valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\"><em>Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Mun-gra, </em>427 U.S. 307, 314, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 2567, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976); <em>Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1976). Our power to overturn a statute, where fundamental interests or suspect groups are absent, is limited to the situation in which \u201cthe varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that we can only conclude that the legislature\u2019s actions were irrational. <em>Barry </em>v. Barchi,- U.S. -, -, 99 S.Ct. 2642, 61 L.Ed.2d 365 (1979) <em>quoting, Vance v. </em>Bradley, - U.S. -, -, 99 S.Ct. 939, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979). Accordingly, plaintiffs would raise a substantial constitutional claim only if they could show that Congress, in distinguishing between the diagnostic services provided by optometrists and doctors of medicine for the purposes of Medicare reimbursement, acted irrationally. <em>Rastetter v. Weinberger, </em>379 F.Supp. 170, 173 (D.Ariz.1974), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>419 U.S. 1098, 95 S.Ct. 767, 42 L.Ed.2d 795 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-17\">Before enacting the Social Security amendments of 1967, Congress requested the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to conduct a study of the desirability of extending the use of Part B Medicare funds for services of additional types of licensed health practitioners. With the help of input from the affected health professions, the Secretary\u2019s comprehensive study concluded with a recommendation that, although there may be some overlap of diagnostic procedures of optometrists and ophthalmologists, their training was sufficiently different to indicate that the funds of the Part B program could best be used by limiting reimbursement to optometrists. HEW, Independent Practitioners Under Medicare: A Report to the Congress, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>114-22 (1968). In the face of this conscientious effort to maximize Medicare\u2019s coverage for the various healing professions, it cannot be said that Congress acted irrationally in providing reimbursement distinctions between the diagnostic services provided by a medical doctor and those provided by an optometrist. The failure to provide equal benefits to every conceivable interest in enacting reform legislation \u201cdoes not violate the equal protection clause. <em>Rastetter v. Weinberger, supra, </em>379 F.Supp. 170. Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional issue is clearly an insubstantial one. This being true, we need not rule on the converse \u2014 whether in the presence of a substantial constitutional claim, jurisdiction will lie under \u00a7 1331. <em>Cervoni v. Secretary of HEW, </em>581 F.2d 1010 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>Kechijian v. Califano, </em>458 F.Supp. 159 (D.R.I.1978).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Congress, the source of inferior federal court jurisdiction, has opted to restrict our ability to consider claims arising under the Medicare Act.

The appellants attacked the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the regulation, the validity of the regulation, and claimed that the decision to reduce reimbursements was an unconstitutional denial of substantive due process.

Plaintiffs also seek mandamus against the Secretary under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361 for his \u201cclearly illegal act\u201d of promulgating an allegedly invalid regulation. <em>American Association of Medical Staffs v. Califano, </em>575 F.2d 1367 (5th Cir. 1978), in dicta, suggested that recasting challenges under the Medicare Act in terms of mandamus might avoid the jurisdictional problem of \u00a7 405(h). Other courts which have considered the effect of \u00a7 405(h) on jurisdiction invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361 are not in agreement. <em>See, e.g., Cervoni v.
