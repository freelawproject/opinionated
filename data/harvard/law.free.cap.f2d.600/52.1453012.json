Two police officers, called to the scene by a neighbor, intercepted the youth as he ran from the back of the house to a six foot cyclone fence in the back yard. Using a 38-calibre pistol loaded with hollow point bullets, one of the officers shot and killed the boy from a range of 30 to 40 feet as he climbed the fence to escape. After shining a flashlight on the boy as he crouched by the fence, the officer identified himself as a policeman and yelled \u201cHalt.\u201d He could see that the fleeing felon was a youth and was apparently unarmed. As the boy jumped to get over the fence, the officer fired at the upper part of the body, as he was trained to do by his superiors at the Memphis Police Department. He shot because he believed the boy would elude capture in the dark once he was over the fence. The officer was taught that it was proper to kill a fleeing felon rather than run the risk of allowing him to escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">The District Court dismissed the suit of decedent\u2019s father brought against the City under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976) to recover damages for wrongful death caused by claimed constitutional violations of the fourth, eighth and fourteenth amendments. In accordance with then existing law, the District Court held that a city is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u201cperson\u201d subject to suit under \u00a7 1983; but <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), in which the Supreme Court so ruled, was overruled on this point last term by the case of <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Following a bench trial, the District Court also dismissed the case against the officer and his superiors holding, in accordance with our decisions in <em>Beech v. Melancon, </em>465 F.2d 425 (6th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1114, 93 S.Ct. 927, 34 L.Ed.2d 696 (1973); <em>Qualls v. Parrish, </em>534 F.2d 690 (6th Cir. 1976); and <em>Wiley v. Memphis Police Department, </em>548 F.2d 1247 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 822, 98 S.Ct. 65, 54 L.Ed.2d 78 (1977), that the officers acted in good faith reliance on Tennessee law which allows an officer to kill a fleeing felon rather than run the risk of allowing him to escape apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">We conclude that the District Court did not err in finding that the individual defendants acted in good faith reliance on Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-808 which provides that an officer \u201cmay use all the necessary means to effect the arrest\u201d of a fleeing felon. As our previous cases, cited above, point out, Tennessee courts have interpreted this statute as a codification of the common law rule allowing officers to kill fleeing felons rather than run the risk of permitting them to escape apprehension. This rule applies to fleeing felons suspected of property crimes not endangering human life, as well as life-endangering crimes, and to felons who pose no threat of bodily harm to others, if not apprehended immediately, as well as felons who may be dangerous to others if left at large. Applying the qualified \u201cgood faith\u201d privilege or immunity from liability for constitutional claims, as announced in our previous decisions cited above, we affirm that portion of the District Court\u2019s judgment dismissing the case against the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We reverse and remand the case against the City, however, for reconsideration by the District Court in light of <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, supra. Monell </em>holds that a city may be held liable in damages under \u00a7 1983 for constitutional deprivations that result from a \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d followed by the city. 436 U.S. at 694 and n. 66, 98 S.Ct. 2018.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Our previous decisions do not establish the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-808, permitting a city to authorize its officers to use deadly force against a fleeing felon, nor have they established the constitutionality of the city\u2019s use of hollow point bullets. Although there is discussion of the constitutionality of the Tennessee statute in the <em>Beech, Qualls </em>and <em>Wiley </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>all three of those cases dealt with actions against individual officers under \u00a7 1983, and not liability based on the \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d of a governmental entity. Those cases held that it \u201cwould be unfair\u201d to impose liability on an officer \u201cwho relied, in good faith, upon the settled law of his state that he relieved him from liability for the particular acts performed in his official capacity.\u201d <em>Qualls v. Parrish, supra </em>at 694, quoted in <em>Wiley v. Memphis Police Department, supra </em>at 1253. The essential holding of those cases was that an individual officer has a qualified privilege or immunity from liability for constitutional claims based on good faith performance of his duties in accordance with statutory or administrative authority, a holding subsequently approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 496-508, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978). Although the qualified immunity developed in those cases insulates the officers and officials from personal liability in this case, as the District Court held, the following questions in the case against the city are still open under <em>Monell:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">1. Does a municipality have a similar qualified immunity or privilege based on good faith under <em>Monell </em>?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>2. If not, is a municipality\u2019s use of deadly force under Tennessee law to capture allegedly nondangerous felons fleeing from nonviolent crimes constitutionally permissible under the fourth, sixth, eighth and fourteenth amendments? <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">3. Is the municipality\u2019s use of hollow point bullets constitutionally permissible under these provisions of the Constitution?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">4. If the municipal conduct in any of these respects violates the Constitution, did the conduct flow from a \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d for which the City is liable in damages under Monelll<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We remand the case against the City to the District Court for reconsideration in light of <em>Monell, </em>including consideration of these questions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\">. <em>See </em>discussion of this question in <em>Liete v.

According to the same reports, Memphis police officers killed twenty-four individuals during this period in connection with crimes of violence or in self-defense; they attempted to use deadly force on 177 occasions, 114 of which were in connection with property crimes.
