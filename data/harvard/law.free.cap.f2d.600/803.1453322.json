We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The pig iron was subject to a special dumping duty under section 202 of the An-tidumping Act of 1921, as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 161 (1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Customs assessed dumping duties equal to the differences between the foreign market value and the purchase prices.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant challenged these assessments in the Customs Court, arguing that no foreign market value was determinable at the time of the importations and, therefore, the dumping duties should have been computed as the differences between constructed value and purchase prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">To support its argument, appellant presented to the court seven exhibits which included a list of prices at which the producer of the pig iron in question had sold its production of pig iron in Canada and a letter written by Mr. Hobbs, President of Western Canada Steel, the exporter of the subject pig iron.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The letter contained the following statement concerning a Canadian market value:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\">Our prices in the Canadian market have varied based upon a number of factors which we take into account, but there is no regular price structure in terms of class of customer, quantity or other factors which are specifically definable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-14\">All our sales are made on a delivered price basis, per long ton, and all money amounts are given in Canadian currency. No discounts are allowed. As shown in the tabulation, these prices include freight, and a standard $1 allowance per long ton for sales commission. The quality of the merchandise sold in the home market is the same as that sold for export to the United States. There is no financial relationship, directly or indirectly, between this company and any purchaser in Canada.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">No witnesses were called before the Customs Court and appellant offered no further evidence with regard to the pricing policy of any of the other Canadian producers of pig iron.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">\n<em>Customs Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-17\">The Customs Court noted that foreign market value can be determined from the value at which \u201csuch or similar\u201d merchandise was sold or offered for sale. According to the Customs Court, the definition of \u201csuch or similar merchandise\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> required ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>pellant to offer evidence to negate the existence of a determinable market value for each type of merchandise set forth in the subparagraphs of the definition. The court concluded appellant\u2019s price list at best showed sales at varying prices but, stated that without further explanation, such a list was insufficient to establish that no one price existed at which the pig iron could be purchased. The court noted that the record was silent with regard to the sales or offers of the other pig iron producers and that, although the record reflected sales to Japan by Western Canada Steel, no information was submitted concerning the prices and quantities involved. The court held that the value as found by Customs had not been rebutted because of appellant\u2019s failure to introduce evidence to meet every material issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Despite appellant\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the Customs Court correctly concluded that in order to prove that no foreign market value existed for the pig iron in question, it was necessary for appellant to negate the existence of a determinable value for each of the types of merchandise described in the six subparagraphs of the definition of \u201csuch or similar merchandise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">In <em>Nichols v. United States, </em>454 F.2d 1183, 59 CCPA 67, C.A.D. 1041 (1972), this court held that an importer wishing to disprove the existence of foreign value for particular merchandise on the basis of lack of a free market in the country of origin must establish that \u201csimilar\u201d as well as \u201csuch\u201d merchandise was not freely offered for sale in the relevant country during the relevant period.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In essence, the court took cognizance of the conjunctive construction of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-19\">Section 205 of the Antidumping Act of 1921, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 164, also requires examination of the price of \u201csuch or similar\u201d merchandise. In this instance, this phrase is defined in the statute<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the legislative history of the definition makes clear its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>The definition first appeared in Pub.L. No. 85-630, 72 Stat. 583, which amended the Antidumping Act of 1921. The amendment was accompanied by the following statement in the Senate Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-5\">Section 5 of the bill, as reported, inserts a new section 212 in the law, entitled \u201cDefinitions.\u201d Section 212(3) defines \u201csuch or similar merchandise.\u201d Subparagraphs (A) and (B) describe merchandise which is identical \u2014 i. e., \u201csuch\u201d merchandise. Sub-paragraphs (C), (D), (E), and (F) describe merchandise which can be considered \u201csimilar.\u201d Section 202(b)(3) and (c)(3) of the Antidumping Act, as added by section 2 of the bill, as reported, provide that where \u201csimilar\u201d merchandise (i. e., merchandise described in sec. 212(3)(C), (D), (E), or (F)) rather than \u201csuch\u201d merchandise (i. e., merchandise described in sec. 212(3)(A) or (B)) is being compared, allowance may be made for differences between the articles under consideration<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aed-dedup-1\">No significant amendments were made to the definition of \u201csuch or similar merchandise\u201d between the time of its enactment and the date of the subject importations.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">With the definition of \u201csuch or similar merchandise\u201d and its legislative history in mind, it is apparent that it was incumbent upon appellant to negate the existence of a determinable value under each of the sub-paragraphs of the definition. Since the only evidence introduced by appellant consisted of the unexplained price lists and the eonclusory statement of Mr. Hobbs, and since no evidence was presented concerning the sales of the other Canadian producers of pig iron, we hold that appellant has fallen far short of fulfilling its burden. Further, appellant failed to establish why any offers for sale of pig iron within Canada or sales of pig iron for export to Japan contemporaneously with the subject importations should not have been considered as provided in section 205 of the Antidumping Act, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Appellant has failed to rebut the existence of a foreign market value for pig iron under section 205 of the Antidumping Act of 1921, as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 164 (1970).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judgment of the Customs Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\">. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 164 (1970), provides as follows: Determination of foreign market value.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-9\">For the purposes of sections 160 to 171 of this title the foreign market value of imported merchandise shall be the price, at the time of\u2019 exportation of such merchandise to the United States, at which such or similar merchandise is sold or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale in the principal markets of the country from which exported, in the usual wholesale quantities and in the ordinary course of trade for home consumption (or, if not so sold or offered for sale for home consumption, or if the Secretary determines that the quantity sold for home consumption is so small in relation to the quantity sold for exportation to countries other than the United States as to form an inadequate basis for comparison, then the price at which so sold or offered for sale for exportation to countries other than the United States) * * *. In the ascertainment of foreign market value for the purposes of sections 160-171 of this title no pretended sale or offer for sale, and no sale or offer for sale intended to establish a fictitious market, shall be taken into account.

The values of the purchase prices for the entries of pig iron under consideration are not in dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b895-20\">. Appellant is the importer of the entries at issue. Western Canada Steel was the exporter of the pig iron and it, in turn, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Comineo Ltd., the producer of the pig iron. The record establishes that at the time of the subject importations there existed at least two other Canadian producers of pig iron.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b895-21\">. Appellant had attempted to solicit information concerning \u201cthe general expenses and profits of other producers of pig iron in Canada\u201d at the time of the subject entries but was unsuccessful due to the claimed confidentiality of the information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b895-22\">. The definition of \u201csuch or similar merchandise\u201d at the time of the importations at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>was provided in section 212(3) of the Anti-dumping Act of 1921, as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 170a (1970), which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4P1\">Definitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7t\">For the purposes of sections 160 to 171 of this title\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO8f\">(3) The term \u201csuch or similar merchandise\u201d means merchandise in the first of the following categories in respect of which a determination for the purposes of sections 160 to 171 of this title can be satisfactorily made:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWP\">(A) The merchandise under consideration and other merchandise which is identical in physical characteristics with, and was produced in the same country by the same person as, the merchandise under consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ash-dedup-1\">(B) Merchandise which is identical in physical characteristics with, and was produced by another person in the same country as, the merchandise under consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aox-dedup-0\">(C) Merchandise (i) produced in the same country and by the same person as the merchandise under consideration, (ii) like the merchandise under consideration in component material or materials and in the purposes for which used, and (iii) approximately equal in commercial value to the merchandise under consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aig-dedup-0\">(D) Merchandise which satisfies all the requirements of subdivision (C) except that it was produced by another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmAi\">(E) Merchandise (i) produced in the same country and by the same person and of the same general class or kind as the merchandise under consideration, (ii) like the merchandise under consideration in the purposes for which used, and (iii) which the Secretary or his delegate determines may reasonably be compared for the purposes of sections 160-171 of this title with the merchandise under consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVW\">(F) Merchandise which satisfies all the requirements of subdivision (E) except that it was produced by another person.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b896-23\">.

At issue in <em>Nichols </em>was whether a foreign value existed for certain nylon and acrylic staple fibers manufactured in France and subsequently imported into this country.
