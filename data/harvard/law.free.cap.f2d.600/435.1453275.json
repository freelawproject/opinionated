This appeal is taken from the district court\u2019s order of June 14, 1978, sentencing the appellant to serve a term of eighteen months in prison, the term to run concurrently with the sentence the appellant is already serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-18\">The appellant contends on appeal (1) that the evidence was insufficient to support the district court\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal or to support the jury\u2019s verdict, (2) that the verdict represented an impermissible coerced compromise resulting from the trial court\u2019s insistence that the jurors continue their deliberations after they had reported themselves deadlocked and (3) that the appellant was denied a fair trial due to the government\u2019s failure, through negligence, to produce two defense witnesses. We have considered these contentions and find them to be wholly without merit. However, our examination of the record reveals an error which we are obliged to notice and which requires reversal of the conviction and a new trial, namely, the request of the trial judge to the jury that he be informed of the jury\u2019s numerical division on the question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-19\">The trial took place on May 30, 1978. The following day, after the jury had been deliberating for several hours, the foreman of the jury notified the trial judge that the jury was unable to arrive at a decision. The trial judge then sent a note to the foreman asking for advice on how the jury was divided and requesting that the numbers be inserted in two spaces provided at the bottom of the note. The note was returned to the trial judge with the spaces filled in indicating a division of ten to two.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-20\">The Supreme Court has held that the trial judge\u2019s inquiry of a jury which is unable to reach agreement as to its numerical division is reversible error. <em>Brasfield v. United States, </em>272 U.S. 448, 47 S.Ct. 135, 71 L.Ed. 345 (1926). The Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-21\">We deem it essential to the fair and impartial conduct of the trial, that the inquiry itself should be regarded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ground for reversal. Such procedure serves no useful purpose that cannot be attained by questions not requiring the jury to reveal the nature or extent of its division. Its effect upon a divided jury will often depend upon circumstances which cannot properly be known to .the trial judge or to the appellate courts and may vary widely in different situations, but in general its tendency is coercive. It can rarely be resorted to without bringing to bear in some degree, serious although not measurable, an improper influence upon the jury, from whose deliberations every consideration other than that of the evidence and the law as expounded in a proper charge, should be excluded. Such a practice, which is never useful and is generally harmful, is not to be sanctioned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">272 U.S. at 450, 47 S.Ct. at 135-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We are not here concerned with the question whether the rule stated in <em>Bras-field v. United States </em>is one of constitutional dimension and, therefore, applicable to state as well as federal courts as held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Aragon, </em>89 N.M. 91, 547 P.2d 574, 580 (Ct.App.1976), and <em>People v. Wilson, </em>390 Mich. 689, 213 N.W.2d 193 (1973). <em>But see Ellis v. Reed, </em>596 F.2d 1195 (4th Cir. 1979), contra. For it is, at the least, a rule adopted by the Supreme Court under its supervisory power over the courts of the United States and, thus, applicable to the courts of the Third Federal Judicial Circuit, of which the District Court of the Virgin Islands is one. <em>See Government of Virgin Islands v. Solis, </em>4 V.I. 615, 619-620, 334 F.2d 517, 519-520 (3d Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The failure of counsel to bring this error to the court\u2019s attention does not preclude its correction on appeal since the error, once committed, cannot be cured. <em>Brasfield </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>272 U.S. at 450, 47 S.Ct. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
