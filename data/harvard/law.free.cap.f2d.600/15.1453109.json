Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b106-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">The parties in this action, three insurance companies, each contributed funds in settlement of a tort action brought against their common insured. Two of the companies then brought this declaratory judgment action against the third to determine the companies\u2019 respective liabilities under the settlement agreement. The district court entered a judgment from which the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">This court <em>sua sponte </em>raises a question concerning its subject matter jurisdiction. The alleged jurisdictional basis for this action is diversity of citizenship. When jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint must specifically allege each party\u2019s citizenship, and these allegations must show that the plaintiff and defendant are citizens of different states. <em>McGovern v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>511 F.2d 653 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">In this case the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint simply alleged that all three parties were \u201cforeign corporations\u201d which were \u201clicensed to do business and doing business in Louisiana.\u201d It failed, however, to specify the citizenship of the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because of this defect in the pleadings, we cannot tell if in fact the parties are diverse. Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court for it to determine if there is jurisdiction. It can do this by giving the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their defective pleadings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653. Of course, if the amendments show that there is no diversity of citizenship, the district court must dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-12\">. For purposes of determining diversity of citizenship a corporation is deemed \u201ca citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business . . . .\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c). The plaintiffs are required to provide this information in their pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
