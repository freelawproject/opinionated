(Edison) seeks to set aside a final order <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (Commissioner) refusing approval of its new drug application (NDA) for the drug Cothyrobal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Edison contends that the Commissioner\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence and that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) failed to conduct a full and fair evidentiary hearing on all issues relevant to approvability of the NDA, as ordered by this court in <em>Edison Pharmaceutical Co. v. FDA, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 513 F.2d 1063, 1072 (1975). We conclude that Edison\u2019s contentions are without merit and accordingly, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s order refusing approval of the NDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">I BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">In the 1950\u2019s, Dr. Murray Israel developed Cothyrobal, an injectable drug<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> intended to treat hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cothyrobal is a combination of the thyroid extract, sodium levothyroxine, and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12). Levothyroxine is a cholesterol lowering substance with some toxic side effects. Proponents of Cothyrobal claim that vitamin Bi2 inhibits the toxicity of levothyroxine while retaining its medicinal benefits. <em>See Edison Pharmaceutical Co. v. FDA, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 513 F.2d at 1066; 42 Fed.Reg. 28602-03 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-17\">In May 1969, Edison filed the NDA for Cothyrobal that is the subject of this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commissioner found the information offered in support of the application deficient under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (Act), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b) (1976),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and denied the application in December 1969. Dr. Israel and Edison responded by filing an antitrust suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that an FDA consultant, an FDA employee, and manufacturers of a similar drug, Choloxin,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> had conspired to prevent full and fair consideration of Edison\u2019s application by the FDA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>The district court dismissed the suit,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but on appeal, this court reinstated the action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Israel v. Baxter Laboratories, Inc., </em>151 U.S.App.D.C. 101, 466 F.2d 272, 282 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">After reinstatement of the antitrust suit, Edison requested reactivation of its NDA. Although Edison had an opportunity to supplement the NDA, it offered no additional information. The FDA reviewed Edison\u2019s NDA for the second time and again found it deficient. Edison responded by filing its application over protest. <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110(d), (e) (1978).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A third group of FDA personnel examined the NDA and concluded it could not be approved. <em>See Edison Pharmaceutical Co. v. FDA, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 513 F.2d at 1067; 38 Fed.Reg. 17027 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Edison then requested a hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.200(a)(2) (1978). The Commissioner concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that Edison had failed to set forth facts demonstrating the existence of a genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring a hearing on its NDA, <em>see </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.200(g) (1978),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and denied the request. The basis for the Commissioner\u2019s decision was Edison\u2019s failure to submit double-blind controlled studies comparing the effects of Cothyrobal and levothyroxine<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which he determined were necessary to prove the efficacy of the drug. Edison appealed that ruling to this court, contending that the studies it had submitted were as scientifically sound as humanly possible. <em>See Edison Pharmaceutical Co. v. FDA, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 513 F.2d at 1070-72. A panel of this court reversed and ordered the Commissioner to hold \u201ca full evidentiary hearing\u201d to determine whether double-blind testing comparing the effects of levothyroxine and Cothyrobal could be conducted safely and to determine <em>\u201call </em>relevant issues relating to the approvability of [Edison\u2019s] application.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1071-72 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>The FDA held the required hearings in December 1975 and January 1976. The administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that limited double-blind testing could be performed safely. He further found that the studies submitted with the NDA failed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Cothyrobal, as required by section 505(d) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d) (1976),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that Edison had failed in a variety of ways to comply with statutes and regulations .governing NDA approval. Accordingly, the ALJ refused approval of the NDA. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 8a-14a.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">That decision was affirmed by the Commissioner on May 27, 1977. In a thorough opinion, <em>see </em>42 Fed.Reg. 28602-23, the Commissioner reviewed the ALJ\u2019s decision and Edison\u2019s exceptions. The Commissioner concluded: (1) that double-blind control group testing comparing the effects of Cothyrobal and levothyroxine could safely and ethically be performed on non-cardiac patients after preliminary testing, that such double-blind testing could not safely be performed on cardiac patients, and that it would be unsafe and unethical to administer Cothyrobal to cardiac patients before testing with non-cardiac patients was complete; (2) that even if double-blind controlled testing could not be performed, Edison\u2019s NDA, as submitted, did not sufficiently prove the safety and efficacy of Cothyro-bal, and failed to comply with various statutory and regulatory provisions; and (3) that the administrative hearing was complete and fair. <em>Id. </em>at 28607, 28622-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">In this court, Edison contends (1) that the Commissioner\u2019s refusal of its NDA is not supported by substantial evidence, <em>see 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 355(h) (1976); and (2) that the FDA failed to provide the full evidentiary hearing mandated in <em>Edison Pharmaceutical Co. v. FDA, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 513 F.2d 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">II SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"a_g-dedup-0\">Before a new drug intended for human use<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> can be marketed in interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>commerce, it must be \u201cclinically tested\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to establish it is both safe and effective. The Act requires an applicant to include reports of these tests in the NDA. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(a), (b). NDAs must also contain certain technical information, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b) (1976), and must be filed in accord with procedural specifications, <em>see </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.1 (1978). The Commissioner concluded that Edison\u2019s NDA failed to demonstrate either the safety or efficacy of Cothyrobal. He further found that Edison had not complied with labeling specifications and rules requiring submission of samples and certain manufacturing information.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">A. <em>Efficacy of Cothyrobal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Under section 505(d)(5) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(5), an NDA must be denied if there is a lack of \u201csubstantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use\u201d contained in the proposed labeling. Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d). Uncontrolled studies or partially controlled studies alone are insufficient proof of a drug\u2019s efficacy. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.111(a)(5)(ii)(c) (1978). \u201cIsolated case reports, random experience, and reports lacking details which permit scientific evaluation will not be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An \u201cadequate and well-controlled investigation,\u201d as defined in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.111(a)(5)(ii)(a )(4) (1978),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> is, <em>inter alia, </em>one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>which \u201c[pjrovides a comparison of the results of treatment or diagnosis with a control in such a fashion as to permit quantitative evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Clinically controlled testing usually involves administration of treatment to two groups of comparable subjects afflicted with the same condition. The first group receives the test drug; the second group, the control group, receives either an inactive preparation known as a placebo or a known drug to which the test drug is being compared.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The results of the two groups are then analyzed. Since human reaction to disease treatment may be influenced by a patient\u2019s expectations, and since observation of symptoms, particularly subjective symptoms, may be influenced by an observer\u2019s expectations, controlled investigations are usually conducted so neither subject nor observer knows which patient is receiving the test drug and which patient is part of the control group. This technique is called double-blinding. Double-blinding techniques<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> are generally required to assure the formation of a scientifically valid judgment as to the therapeutic efficacy of a particular treatment. <em>See </em>J.A. at 7a. In certain circumstances, however, such as those involving diseases with high and predictable mortality rates, or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or severity, the regulations permit the use of historical controls. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.111(a)(5)(ii)(a )(4 )(iv) (1978). In an historically controlled study, the effects of the medication on a test population are compared with adequately documented accounts of the natural history of the disease instead of with control groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">A double-blind controlled clinical investigation of Cothyrobal would require comparison of the effects of Cothyrobal with those of levothyroxine. Edison failed to perform such testing on the ground that the toxic effects of levothyroxine make it humanly impossible to administer the drug safely.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> 42 Fed.Reg. 28604-05. Edison argues that use of historical controls is therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">1. <em>Double-blind studies: </em>The threshold question to be resolved by the Commissioner was whether double-blind controlled testing of Cothyrobal and levo-thyroxine is humanly possible. The Commissioner concluded that although it would be unethical to conduct this kind of study comparing two groups of cardiac patients, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>see <em>id. </em>at 28605 &amp; n. 2, clinical tests comparing non-cardiac patients could be performed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 28605-06. The Commissioner described this type of test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3q9\">A double-blind test comparing a control group receiving oral thyroid medication plus a placebo injection, a control group receiving oral thyroid medication [see note 3 <em>supra </em>] plus the amount of levothy-roxine in Cothyrobal and a treated group receiving oral thyroid medication plus Cothyrobal would be proper if non-cardiac young adults were used, if preliminary testing had shown that the cyanocobala-min component of Cothyrobal blocked thyrotoxic effects and if an acceptable theory were advanced to justify concurrent administration of oral thyroid and the levothyroxine in Cothyrobal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">42 Fed.Reg. 28622. The Commissioner further stated that ethically, Cothyrobal could not be administered to cardiac patients until concurrent controlled clinical tests with non-cardiac patients demonstrated the efficacy of the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Dr. Israel, the developer of Cothyrobal and one of Edison\u2019s major witnesses, admitted that a study such as the one suggested by the Commissioner would be safe and ethical. <em>See id. </em>at 28606. Edison, nevertheless, challenges the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion primarily on the ground that this type of study \u201cwould not only fail to reveal anything relevant, but in this case the whole procedure would constitute an almost ludicrous circumvention of the issue.\u201d Brief in Support of Petition for Review to Set Aside the Final Order of the Food and Drug Administration (Brief for Petitioner) at 16. Edison apparently is arguing that because this testing would not indicate the effect of Cothyrobal on older cardiac patients, to whom the drug would most often be administered, it would be superfluous. <em>See </em>42 Fed.Reg. 28606. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">This study would demonstrate the general efficacy of Cothyrobal in adding benefits to oral thyroid therapy alone. It would also show whether Cothyrobal has some effect greater than that which would be achieved by mere injection of one of its ingredients. <em>See id. </em>Adverse side effects, lesser in degree than cardiac arrest, <em>see </em>note 22 <em>supra, </em>could also be discerned. We appreciate the Commissioner\u2019s concern about the potential danger of Cothyrobal use and cannot agree with Edison that the cautious step-by-step testing he suggests is either \u201cludicrous,\u201d irrelevant, or unsafe. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioner at 16. Rather, we find the decision supported by substantial evidence and well within the Commissioner\u2019s authority. <em>See Unimed Inc. v. Richardson, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 458 F.2d 787, 789 (1972) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">2. <em>Edison\u2019s controls: </em>Edison attempted to prove the efficacy of Cothyrobal through' submission of studies it claims qualify as either clinically or historically controlled tests. In compliance with our mandate that the FDA hold a hearing and determine <em>all </em>issues relevant to the approv-ability of Edison\u2019s NDA, the Commissioner assumed arguendo that concurrent control group testing of Cothyrobal and levothyrox-ine was too dangerous to perform and examined each study submitted with the NDA to determine the approvability of the application. The Commissioner found these studies uniformly replete with inaccuracies and ambiguities, lacking protocol<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and statistical analysis. Specifically, the Commissioner set out in detail the substantive deficiencies of each.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Commissioner concluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>and we agree, that the studies were not \u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d within the meaning of section 505(d) and did not establish the efficacy of Cothyrobal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">On appeal, Edison does not dispute the specific inadequacies of the studies found by the Commissioner. <em>See </em>note 24 <em>supra. </em>Rather, it asserts that the FDA \u201cignored . [petitioner's long-term historical control,\u201d and \u201cat no time . . . considered] . . . [petitioner's study,\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 14, 16. The record belies Edison\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The ALJ and the Commissioner both explicitly recognized the propriety of historical controls in certain circumstances, <em>see </em>J.A. at 10a; 42 Fed.Reg. at 28607, and carefully assessed Edison\u2019s studies against the appropriate standards, <em>see </em>J.A. at 10a-12a; 42 Fed.Reg. 28607-13. The ALJ and the Commissioner did not \u201cignore,\u201d the studies; they found them insufficient. In the absence of any argument that the Commissioner\u2019s specific findings of inadequacy are incorrect, we reject Edison\u2019s complaint. The Commissioner\u2019s decision that Edison\u2019s NDA failed to provide \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of efficacy in the form of either clinically or historically controlled studies is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(5), (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">B. <em>Safety of Cothyrobal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Section 505(d)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(1) (1976), requires that an NDA include \u201cadequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not such drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof.\u201d The Commissioner concluded that Edison failed to prove the safety of Cothyrobal. 42 Fed.Reg. 28613. The Commissioner noted that Edison\u2019s own attempt to avoid the usual double-blind studies places the safety of the Cothyrobal in question. Because Edison argues that the toxic effects of levothyroxine make it humanly impossible to administer that drug in controlled testing, patients receiving Cothyrobal may be subject to the same risks as those receiving levothyroxine, absent a showing of the claimed ability of vitamin B12 to mitigate the antithyrotoxic effects of levothyroxine. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">Although the Commissioner recognized that studies showing the safety of a drug need not be adequate and well-controlled within the meaning of 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.-111(a)(5), <em>compare 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(1) <em>with 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(5), he properly ruled that they \u201cmust be adequately constructed so that scientists can draw reasonable con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>elusions from them.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 28614. The Commissioner, relying on testimony of three expert witnesses, concluded that both the animal studies and clinical testing offered by Edison were deficient and failed to demonstrate the safety of Cothyrobal.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Id In addition, a number of witnesses, including some called by Edison, testified to adverse side effects, such as tachycardia<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and insomnia, which may have resulted from treatment with Cothyrobal. Id Edison failed to rebut this evidence. The Commissioner therefore concluded that Edison did not carry its burden of proving the safety of the drug. See <em>Edison Pharmaceutical Co. v. FDA, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 513 F.2d at 1065. In view of the foregoing, we find the Commissioner\u2019s decision supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">C. <em>Manufacturing Data, Samples Submitted, and Proposed Labeling</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8W\">The Commissioner found that Edison failed to comply with statutory provisions and regulations governing the manufacturing, sampling, and labeling of Cothyrobal. 42 Fed.Reg. 28614-15. Edison did not provide a description of the sampling methods used in the manufacturing process, as required by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.1(c)(2)8d (1978). <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b)(4), (d)(5). Under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.1(c)(2)8f (1978), the applicant must provide signed statements from each outside firm performing various parts of the manufacturing process. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b)(4), (d)(3). Edison failed to submit this information. Adequate information on the characteristics and test methods used for the container, closure, and other component parts of the drug package was not submitted as required by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.1(c)(2)8i (1978). <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b)(4), (d)(3). Samples of the drug were not submitted in conformity with the requirements under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.1(c)(2)9 (1978). The drug label lacked the standard warning prohibiting dispensing without a prescription, as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321(k), 353(b)(4), 355(d)(6) (1976), and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.20 (1978). Finally, information on the stability of the drug was insufficient under the standards set forth in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.1(c)(2)8p (1978). <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b)(4), (d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Edison does not challenge these findings on appeal. As the Commissioner noted in his opinion, although each of these deficiencies can be remedied with a minimum of effort, Edison\u2019s failure to comply with statutory and regulatory provisions rendered the NDA unapprovable. 42 Fed.Reg. 28615.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Ill THE HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Edison contends that the evidentiary hearing on its NDA was neither complete nor fair. We have reviewed Edison\u2019s numerous complaints and find them all without merit. Only three warrant comment.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Edison argues that the \u201cmyopically restrictive rulings of the FDA,\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 19, resulted in the improper exclusion of evidence that it contends constitutes the very \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d necessary to approve the NDA. Edison primarily attacks rulings by the ALJ excluding evidence of tests not submitted with the NDA and \u201ctestimonial\u201d evidence. Edison also objects to the exclusion of evidence of the FDA\u2019s treatment of the similar drug Choloxin <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> which it alleges was appreciably more favorable than the treatment accorded Cothyrobal. The Commissioner approved each of these exclusions.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> 42 Fed. Reg. 28616-17, 28621.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>The statutory scheme of the Act contemplates that a new drug will be approved or disapproved on the basis of the scientific tests contained in the NDA. <em>See USV Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Secretary of Health, Education &amp; Welfare, </em>151 U.S.App.D.C. 284, 466 F.2d 455, 456-57 (1972). The hearing offers an opportunity to test the strength and credibility of this material. <em>Cf. Upjohn Co. v. Finch, </em>422 F.2d 944, 955 (6th Cir. 1970) (\u201cNo amount of examination and cross-examination can change the scientific studies and the data reported into something they are not.\u201d) The applicant may present testimony or evidence at the hearing to show that the studies and data submitted with the NDA in fact constitute the \u201cadequate tests,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(1) and \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(5), necessary for NDA approval. <em>See generally Cooper Laboratories, Inc. v. FDA, </em>163 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 501 F.2d 772, 792 (1974) (Leventhal, J., dissenting); <em>CIBA</em>\u2014Geigy <em>Corp. v. Richardson, </em>446 F.2d 466, 468 (2d Cir. 1971) (per curiam). The applicant cannot, however, submit new studies at the hearing to be considered in the first instance by the ALJ. To do so would effectively shield an applicant\u2019s data from the initial scrutiny of FDA staff experts contemplated by section 505 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The regulations provide a procedure for the filing of new studies consistent with the statutory scheme. An applicant may supplement an NDA under submission pursuant to the procedures set out in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.6 (1978). Edison failed to invoke this provision and, absent unusual circumstances, cannot now be heard to complain. If Edison were able to surmount all the other difficulties identified by the FDA, it would be free to seek consideration of another NDA containing the new tests it sought to introduce at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Edison next objects to the exclusion of testimonial evidence which it alleges demonstrates the efficacy of Cothyrobal. Edison argues that because the symptoms of hypothyroidism are difficult to recognize, efficacy can be assessed most accurately through the degree of relief experienced by the patients. Brief for Petitioner at 12-14, 19. Thus, according to Edison, the \u201cbest way\u201d to prove that the drug works \u201cis to bring the patients in themselves\u201d and allow them to testify. <em>Id. </em>at Addendum 11, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Similarly, Edison contends that the most relevant expert testimony is that of doctors who have administered Cothyrobal and can relate their clinical impressions of the ability of the drug to relieve pain. <em>Id. </em>at 12-16. Edison, therefore, characterizes the testimony of non-clinical FDA experts,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> despite their impressive credentials and scientific experience, <em>see </em>42 Fed.Reg. 28603, as \u201cmeaningless,\u201d Brief for Petitioners at 14, and suggests that the ALJ erred when he considered their criticisms of the studies submitted with the NDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Edison\u2019s attempt to replace evidence of \u201ccontrolled\u201d investigation with testimony relating personal experiences or clinical impressions is inconsistent with the Act, the accompanying regulations, and explicit Supreme Court precedent, <em>see Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc., </em>412 U.S. 609, 619, 630, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). As we previously have explained, section 505(d)(5) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d), requires \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d consisting of well-controlled scientific testing, to prove that a drug is effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>tive. \u201cIsolated case reports, random experience, and reports lacking the details which permit scientific evaluation\u201d are not to be considered. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.111(a)(5)(ii)(c). The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d requirement responds to the need for \u201can <em>objective </em>determination of efficacy of the drug products placed on the market,\u201d S.Rep.No. 448, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 187 (1961) (emphasis added); see S.Rep.No. 1744, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 11, 15-16 (1962), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1962, p. 2884, and as the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc., </em>412 U.S. at 630, 93 S.Ct. at 2483, \u201cthe test [is] a rigorous one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">Personal testimonials simply do not meet the exacting standards required by the Act and the regulations. The Court explained that the statutory and regulatory criteria</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-5\">express well-established principles of scientific investigation. Moreover, their strict and demanding standards, barring anecdotal evidence indicating that doctors \u201cbelieve\u201d in the efficacy of a drug, are amply justified by the legislative history. The hearings underlying the 1962 Act show a marked concern that impressions or beliefs of physicians, no matter how fervently held, are treacherous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 619 (footnote omitted). Subjective evaluations by selected patients are even more suspect. We therefore conclude that the ALJ\u2019s rulings excluding personal testimonials accord with applicable law. <em>See Cooper Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>FDA, </em>163 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 501 F.2d at 778-79; <em>Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association v. Richardson, </em>318 F.Supp. 301, 306-10 (D.Del.1970). We further find the admission of non-clinical FDA expert testimony entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Edison also attempted to introduce evidence of the allegedly different treatment rendered by the FDA to the drug Choloxin. The ALJ properly excluded this evidence as irrelevant. Edison\u2019s failure to meet the specific statutory requirements governing NDA approval cannot be excused on the basis of prior action with regard to another drug. <em>Cf. Chem-Haulers, Inc. v. ICC, </em>565 F.2d 728, 730 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (\u201cThe mere fact that the Commission may have nodded on one occasion does not entitle a litigant to a repetition of its blunder.\u201d); <em>Texas International Airlines v. CAB, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 363, 458 F.2d 782, 785 (1971) (\u201cAssuming that the Government made a mistake as to [another] in the application of [a] regulation, the law does not require the Government to perpetuate the mistake.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">For the foregoing reasons we find that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s conclusions that double-blind testing of Cothyrobal humanly may be performed on non-cardiac patients and is necessary before the drug can be administered to cardiac patients, that Edison\u2019s NDA falls far short of congressionally prescribed standards governing approval, and that Edison was afforded a full and fair hearing. Accordingly, we affirm the FDA\u2019s refusal to approve Edison\u2019s NDA for Cothyrobal and finally put this \u201cbalky case,\u201d <em>Edison Pharmaceutical Co. v. FDA, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 517 F.2d 164, 167 (1975), to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-9\">.

First, the court ruled that the suit fell within the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine which exempts from the antitrust laws joint efforts to influence legislative or executive action, even when such efforts are designed to injure or eliminate competition. <em>See United Mine Workers </em>v. <em>Pennington, </em>381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965); <em>Eastern R.R.
