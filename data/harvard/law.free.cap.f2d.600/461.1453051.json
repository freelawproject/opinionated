The court was correct in that plaintiff had failed to make out a prima facie case on his claim that he was discharged because of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>age.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of failure to rehire \u2014 he belonged to a protected class, he was not rehired, he was replaced by a younger person outside the class, and he was qualified to do the job. The burden shifted to Schlitz to demonstrate reasonable factors other than age for the refusal to rehire. It urges many of these reasons to us, but we do not sit as jurors. Schlitz\u2019s major argument is that no job was available when plaintiff asked to be rehired, but this argument does not dispose of the case. Schlitz had offered the job to another person, but later the offer was refused and still later Schlitz hired a younger person, outside the protected class, to fill the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-27\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-14\">.
