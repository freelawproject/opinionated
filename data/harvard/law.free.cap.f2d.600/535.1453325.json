In July, 1972, he was hospitalized because of a condition called atriofibrillation \u2014 a rapid, irregular heart beat \u2014 accompanied by heart failure and lung congestion. These afflictions forced him to stop working for some months. In October of that year he applied for social security disability benefits. In March, 1973, the Social Security Administration (SSA) awarded him disability benefits, retroactive to January, 1973. In the meantime, Phillips had begun working again, although not at the pace he maintained before his illness; indeed during several weeks he did not work at all. But until March, 1974, about eighteen months after he resumed work, he did not tell the SSA that he was again working. In October, 1974, his benefits were terminated. Three years later he was charged with a misdemeanor for having failed to notify the SSA about his employment between November, 1972 and March, 1974. He was convicted by a jury and he now appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Phillips was convicted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">Whoever . having knowledge of the occurrence of any event affecting (1) his initial or continued right to any payment under this subchapter . . \u2022. conceals or fails to disclose such event with an intent fraudulently to secure payment either in a greater amount than is due or when no payment is authorized . shall be guilty of a misdemean- or .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">Phillips does not deny that his employment was substantial and prolonged enough to affect his right to disability payments. Of course he does not deny that he knew he was employed; and he admits that he first told the Social Security Administration about his employment in March of 1974, even though he had been working, on and off, since November 1972. The only remaining question under \u00a7 408(d) is whether Phillips had \u201can intent fraudulently to secure payment.\u201d We hold that the government did not adduce enough evidence that Phillips had such a fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">\u201cFraudulent intent\u201d under \u00a7 408(d) has never been authoritatively defined. Indeed \u00a7 408(d) is apparently the basis for few prosecutions and seems seldom to have been interpreted. In this case, however, the trial judge, the prosecution, and the defense all seem to agree on what constitutes fraudulent intent, and we believe their interpretation of the statute is correct. First, the government must show that the defendant knew that he was legally obligated to disclose certain information. Second, the government must prove that the defendant knew that by withholding the information he would receive greater payments than he was entitled to. In other words, a defendant is not guilty under \u00a7 408(d) unless he is aware both that he is deceiving the government and that the government will pay out more money because of his deception. <em>Cf. </em>Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 525 (1939) (to be guilty of deceit, defendant must have intended that plaintiff rely on defendant\u2019s misrepresentation).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">The second element is apparent on the face of the statute; Congress required an intent \u201cto secure payment . . . in a greater amount than is due,\u201d and a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>fendant cannot intend a consequence \u2014 here, receiving a greater amount than is due<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 unless he knows, or can reasonably be charged with knowing, that his action would have that consequence. The first element is almost equally apparent. Congress required a certain \u201cintent,\u201d choosing not to punish careless failures to disclose; the nondisclosure must be deliberate. Congress also required an \u201cintent <em>fraudulently </em>to secure payment . . . in a greater amount than is due\u201d (emphasis added). Congress must, therefore, have wanted to exempt recipients who deliberately failed to disclose certain information because they intended to increase their payments, but whose intention was nonetheless innocent. A recipient who thought he was entitled not to disclose would fall in this category. Finally, whatever else it involves, fraud is a matter of deliberate deception. But if a defendant does not know that the government expects him to reveal certain information, then he does not know that the government will be misled by not receiving it; so if he has deceived the government, he has not done so deliberately, and he cannot be said to have acted with a fraudulent intent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Phillips\u2019s application for disability benefits specified that he was to notify the Social Security Administration if he became able to work or returned to work. Phillips, who has only a sixth-grade education, signed the application, but he testified that he did not read it; it was filled out by a Social Security representative to whom he supplied the necessary information. That representative testified that she could not remember Phillips specifically but that as a general practice she asked applicants, among other questions, whether they agreed to notify the SSA if they returned to. work. Phillips testified that he did not remember that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">On the basis of his October, 1972, application and some medical reports, Phillips was awarded disability benefits in March, 1973, retroactive to January, 1973. In January, 1974, the SSA sent Phillips a letter and a questionnaire, asking for the names of doctors he had consulted and asking if he had done any work. This was part of a routine reconsideration the SSA undertook because it thought Phillips had the kind of condition that was likely to improve. On February 7 the SSA, having received no reply, sent another letter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When it still did not receive a reply, the SSA sent a representative, Michael J. Wolpert, to call on Phillips at his home. Agent Wolpert testified that Phillips told him he was working eight hours a day, two to five days a week, and that he did not remember exactly when he had begun working. Wolpert also reported that Phillips was earning more than $200 a month. Wolpert told Phillips that his payments would probably be terminated, but testified that had he been asked, which he was not, he would have advised Phillips to cash the checks he was receiving and not to return them, \u201cbecause as far as I knew he was not found . . rehabilitated, that or found un-disabled. As far as I knew at that point he was still disabled.\u201d Agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Wolpert was quite emphatic on this point. <em>See </em>R.Vol. 4 at 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">As a result of Wolpert\u2019s interview report, the SSA inquired of Phillips\u2019s employer and learned that Phillips had been working irregularly since October, 1972. In October of 1974, the SSA decided that its original decision to award Phillips disability benefits was mistaken and it terminated his benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">For the next two years the SSA seems to have had no contact with Phillips. Then in October, 1976, another SSA representative, Ms. Eloise Mobley, interviewed Phillips at his home. Agent Mobley\u2019s testimony was the heart of the government\u2019s effort to show that Phillips acted fraudulently. Mobley\u2019s testimony is questionable for several reasons,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but these need not detain us. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">He stated that he had been told at the initial interview that if he should return to work or if his condition improved, that he was supposed to report this to the Administration. He felt the reason why he did not report his return to work was because he felt that the check he was going to receive on disability, that he was receiving, was rightfully his, regardless of whether he worked or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">Q Did Mr. Phillips indicate during the course of his interview that he understood the meaning of disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">A Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">Q Did he give a reason as to why he did not report the work activity to the Social Security Administration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">A Well, his reason was that, you know, he had worked and paid into the Social Security fund and disability had already been established for him so, you know, whether he worked or not, these checks were rightfully his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">Q Did you ask Mr. Phillips if he intended to refund the overpayment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">A Yes, I did ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-14\">Q And what, how did he respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-15\">A Without hesitation he said no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-16\">Q Did you ask Mr. Phillips if he reported that he had worked to the Social Security Administration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-17\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-18\">Q And what did he answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-19\">A He said no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-20\">R.Vol. 4 at 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-21\">This evidence, taken together, can support a jury\u2019s conclusion that Phillips knew he had an obligation to report his resumed employment. The jury might have decided to discount Phillips\u2019s testimony on this point in the face of the application, the testimony of the agent who filled it out, and Agent Mobley\u2019s directly contradictory recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-22\"> But the evidence of the other element of fraudulent intent \u2014 that Phillips knew he was not entitled to the payments he was receiving \u2014 is far too threadbare. The government stresses Agent Mobley\u2019s testimony that Phillips \u201cindicated\u201d that he \u201cunderstood the meaning of disability,\u201d but this alone cannot suffice. In the first place, this testimony may be inadmissible; arguably, it \u201camount[ed] to little more than choosing up sides\u201d on an ultimate issue of fact, Fed.R.Evid. 701, Advisory Comm. Note, precisely what the Federal Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Rules\u2019 limitations on lay opinion are designed to exclude.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether or not it was inadmissible, however, Agent Mobley\u2019s observation, by itself, is insufficient to support a finding that Phillips acted with fraudulent intent. Agent Mobley did not reveal what Phillips had said, or done, to convince her that he understood \u201cthe meaning of disability.\u201d She did not quote, paraphrase,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or even objectively summarize any statements that might have helped the jury decide whether Phillips knew that he was not entitled to the payments. Consequently, her testimony gave the jury no basis for making any independent judgment about Phillips\u2019s state of mind.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With only Agent Mobley\u2019s unsupported lay opinion before it, a reasonable jury would be left with some reasonable doubt, <em>see </em>United <em>States v. Buckley, </em>586 F.2d 498, 504 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>quoting United States v. Stephenson, </em>474 F.2d 1353, 1355 (5th Cir. 1973), that Phillips knew he was defrauding the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Oddly, the government also makes much of Agent Mobley\u2019s testimony that Phillips \u201cstated that, you know, that they [the checks] were rightfully his since he had paid into the fund, you know, over such a long period of time.\u201d R.Vol. 4 at 108. <em>See also </em>R.Vol. 4 at 96. On its face, Phillips\u2019s assertion that he was entitled to the benefits is exculpatory; it tends to show that he did not think he was doing wrong. Indeed, the government\u2019s position is almost perverse; simply by saying that the checks were rightfully his, Phillips \u2014 claims the government \u2014 revealed that he thought the checks were <em>not </em>rightfully his. Of course, Phillips\u2019s statement may be evidence that he believed himself morally entitled to the benefits no matter what the law provided; that in turn may be evidence that Phillips ignored legal requirements in an effort to keep receiving the benefits. But this inference is attenuated, and scarcely unavoidable. Phillips may instead have been saying that since he had once worked, he did not consider his payments a handout and therefore had no qualms about accepting the money, which he thought the government willingly disbursed. He may have been suggesting that since he had no moral doubts about accepting the money, he was not alerted to the possible legal problems. <em>Cf. Screws v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 104-05, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945) (plurality opinion) (defendant who intentionally deprives a person of clear constitutional right cannot claim lack of fair notice that his act was criminal (prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242)). Since the jury did not itself see and hear Phillips make the statement, and since Agent Mobley did not specify the context and the circumstances in which it was made, the jury would have had no basis whatever for placing the most in-culpatory construction on Phillips\u2019s remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Of course, the government does not have to prove Phillips\u2019s intent from Phillips\u2019s statements alone. Two other avenues are open in a case like this. The government might argue that a jury can conclude, from its common sense knowledge, that every disability recipient who applies for benefits on his own initiative understands enough to know that if he returns to work his benefits will be reduced or terminated. If Phillips had returned to his previous job at the same wages and hours, this argument would be more persuasive. But after his illness Phillips worked irregularly. In some weeks he did earn almost as much as he had before he became ill, but this occurred infrequently. Phillips\u2019s supervisor at work testified that Phillips\u2019s illness impaired his ability to work and forced him to work fewer hours. In some weeks Phillips was wholly unable to work. His doctors treated him frequent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ly and at one point he had to be hospitalized again. He said he feared that at any time he might again become unable to work for long periods. Some might argue that in a more compassionate society, Phillips\u2019s condition would entitle him to disability benefits, and that Phillips\u2019s believing that ours is such a society does not make him a criminal. Whatever the merits of that view, the basic issue is the extent to which we can expect citizens to understand the internal logic of complex government programs. To some degree, of course, we must act on the assumption that they do understand and hold them responsible if they do not. But here we deal with a criminal prosecution; with a defendant who has a sixth-grade education; and with a case of disability that was at least somewhat ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">In any event, Agent Wolpert\u2019s testimony vanquishes any suggestion that Phillips was so healthy that he must have known he was ineligible for payments. Wolpert testified that even after being told how much work Phillips was doing he would still have advised Phillips to continue cashing the checks he received and not to return them. From this we must infer that Wolpert, a trained SSA employee, did not think that Phillips was clearly ineligible for disability benefits; and from that we must conclude that a reasonable jury would have had some reasonable doubt that Phillips knew he was not entitled to the benefits. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Critzer, </em>498 F.2d 1160, 1162 (4th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Finally, the government might have been able to establish Phillips\u2019s fraudulent intent if his behavior had been so devious, and so uncharacteristic of an innocent person, that the jury could infer that Phillips must have known he was doing wrong. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Callahan, </em>588 F.2d 1078, 1080-81, 1083 (5th Cir. 1979) (alleged tax evader kept elaborate fictitious records); <em>United States v. Schafer, </em>580 F.2d 774, 782 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 970, 99 S.Ct. 463, 58 L.Ed.2d 430 (1978) (alleged tax evader avoided keeping records, and concealed information from, and made false statements to, government agents). But Phillips devised no elaborate schemes; he had no such craft. Agent Wolpert noted on his report that in their interview Phillips was very forthcoming, and in fact Phillips provided Wolpert with accurate information about his work. Agent Mobley also found Phillips cooperative, and she too was given truthful answers. The government has not suggested that Philips ever made a false statement to the SSA, either verbally or in writing. He never attempted to mislead the SSA about who his employer was or how much he was working. Indeed on forms he filled out at the hospital where he was treated, Phillips disclosed the details about his employment. Phillips\u2019s actions betray no sign of an effort to cheat the government. Essentially, then, the government\u2019s case that Phillips knew he was doing wrong rests on his failure to answer the letters sent to him. For many purposes, of course, the government is entitled to assume that citizens will read mail sent to them and be aware of its contents. But in a criminal prosecution where the government must show fraudulent intent, those of us who are comfortable with the forms and documents and often unlovely prose of the bureaucracy must not rush to assume that everyone is equally at ease with them. When Phillips dealt in the medium to which he was plainly more accustomed \u2014 verbal, face-to-face communications with the government agents \u2014 he was indisputably honest. Possibly, he ignored the SSA\u2019s letters because he felt slightly overwhelmed by written papers, or because he simply did not understand quite what to do with them. The government, which of course had the burden of proof, did not show otherwise; certainly it did not show that his ignoring the letters was part of a crude effort to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Indeed Phillips may have been guilty of nothing worse than insisting that the government know its place. His best precedent may be the case of Miss Emily Grier-son, the elderly, unhappy heroine of an early Faulkner story. Miss Emily was forgiven her taxes by an erstwhile mayor of the town of Jefferson named Colonel Sartoris. \u201cNot that Miss Emily would have accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>charity. Colonel Sartoris invented an involved tale to the effect that Miss Emily\u2019s father had loaned money to the town which the town, as a matter of business, preferred this way of repaying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">When the next generation, with its more modern ideas, became mayors and aider-men, this arrangement created some little dissatisfaction. On the first of the year they mailed her a tax notice. February came, and there was no reply. They wrote her a formal letter, asking her to call at the sheriff\u2019s office at her convenience. A week later the mayor wrote her himself, offering to call or to send his car for her, and received in reply a note on paper of an archaic shape, in a thin, flowing calligraphy in faded ink, to the effect that she no longer went out at all. The tax notice was also enclosed, without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">They called a special meeting of the Board of Aldermen. A deputation waited upon her, knocked at the door through which no visitor had passed since she ceased giving china-painting lessons eight or ten years earlier. . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">She did not ask them to sit. She just stood in the door and listened quietly until the spokesman came to a stumbling halt. Then they could hear the invisible watch ticking at the end of the gold chain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">Her voice was dry and cold. \u201cI have no taxes in Jefferson. Colonel Sartoris explained it to me. Perhaps one of you can gain access to the city records and satisfy yourselves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">\u201cBut we have. We are the city authorities, Miss Emily. Didn\u2019t you get a notice from the sheriff, signed by him?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">\u201cI received a paper, yes,\u201d Miss Emily said. \u201cPerhaps he considers himself the sheriff ... I have no taxes in Jefferson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">\u201cBut there is nothing on the books to show that, you see. We must go by the \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">\u201cSee Colonel Sartoris. I have no taxes in Jefferson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">\u201cBut, Miss Emily \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">\u201cSee Colonel Sartoris.\u201d (Colonel Sar-toris had been dead almost ten years.) \u201cI have no taxes in Jefferson. Tobe!\u201d The [butler] appeared. \u201cShow these gentlemen out.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">By comparison Mr. Phillips treated the SSA quite well. Whatever his civil liabilities, he is not a criminal and he should not have been convicted of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-13\">. Literally, or literalistically, a statute requiring \u201can intent ... to secure payment . in a greater amount than is due\u201d might be satisfied by an intent to secure any payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>which is in fact greater than the amount due. That is, it might require only proof that the defendant knew he would receive payments, not proof that he knew the payments were greater than the amount due. This interpretation would differ from that proposed in the text in only one respect. It would reach a defendant who knew he had a duty to disclose certain information, and knew that by not disclosing he could increase his payments, but thought\u2014 honestly although mistakenly \u2014 that he was entitled to the greater payments. Whether Congress intended to cover this unlikely case is an issue we need not decide here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-13\">. <em>See also United States v.

Agent Mobley recounted her conversation with Phillips at a suppression hearing before a magistrate and again at a hearing before the district judge. There were several significant inconsistencies in her accounts. <em>Compare </em>R.Vol. 2 at 36-38 (Phillips refused to sign waiver of rights <em>before </em>being questioned) with R.Vol. 3 at 18-20, 23, 30, 32, 34 (after being questioned); R.Vol. 2 at 28, 29, 32 (Phillips was advised that interview was part of a criminal investigation) <em>with </em>R.Vol. 3 at 25 <em>and </em>R.Vol. 4 at 103 (Phillips was not so advised); R.Vol. 3 at 31 (Phillips asked Mobley about his refunding overpayments) <em>with </em>R.Vol. 4 at 97, 106 (Mobley asked Phillips if he would refund overpay-ments). Nevertheless we do not disturb the district judge\u2019s ruling that Phillips\u2019s statements to Mobley were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"axq-dedup-1\">More or less as Phillips spoke to her, Mobley recorded his statements on a form which she expected him to sign.
