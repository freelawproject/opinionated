We hold these provisions unconstitutional and reverse the district court\u2019s judgment to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The plaintiff union brought the action both as an employer-contributor to an employment compensation fund governed by the Indiana Employment Security Act, Ind. Code Ann. \u00a7 <em>22-4-1-1, et seq. </em>(Burns), and on behalf of those of its members denied compensation from the fund because of the challenged statutory provisions. In addition, five individual plaintiffs assert claims for unemployment compensation and also seek to represent a class of all women similarly situated. The defendants are Indiana officials responsible for administering the Act. Proceeding under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, plaintiffs claim that the provisions in question violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Other alleged bases of jurisdiction and theories of invalidity need not concern us. The district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted without determining whether the action should proceed as a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">The Indiana Employment Security Act provides for the payment of unemployment compensation benefits to unemployed persons who are able to work, available for work, and making an effort to obtain work, and who have neither left their previous place of employment voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employer nor been discharged for misconduct in connection with work. Ind. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 <em>22-4-</em>14-1 through 22-4-14-7 and 22-4-15-1 through 22-4-15-8 (Burns). The provisions challenged in this case provided that if an \u201cindividual\u2019s unemployment is due to pregnancy\u201d she would be deemed unavailable for work and therefore ineligible to receive benefits, former \u00a7 22-4-14-3(d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> repealed in relevant part, Pub.L. No. 253, \u00a7 1 (1975), and that a woman separated from employment \u201cbecause of pregnancy\u201d was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits, former \u00a7 22-4-15-1,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> repealed in relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>part, Pub.L. No. 262, \u00a7 25 (1977). The amended complaint in the case at bar alleges that at least one of the individual plaintiffs was denied unemployment benefits on the ground, among others, of her pregnancy and that another was not even allowed to file a claim because of her pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">As we view the case, it falls squarely within <em>Turner v. Department of Employment Security of Utah, </em>423 U.S. 44, 96 S.Ct. 249, 46 L.Ed.2d 181 (1975), which held unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment a Utah statute that made \u201cpregnant women ineligible for unemployment benefits for a period extending from 12 weeks before the expected date of childbirth until a date six weeks after childbirth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In so holding, the Court relied upon <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. La-Fleur, </em>414 U.S. 632, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974). Regardless of the current status of the irrebuttable presumption doctrine, <em>see Trafelet v. Thompson, </em>594 F.2d 623, 629-630 (7th Cir. 1979), we are of course bound to follow the <em>Turner </em>holding. A state statute that denies unemployment benefits to all women who are unemployed because of pregnancy without regard to whether individual pregnant women have the physical capacity 'to continue work is invalid under that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Indeed, counsel for defendants has recognized the authority of <em>Turner </em>in his oral argument and his brief, although in the latter a desultory reference is made to <em>Ged-uldig v. Aiello, </em>417 U.S. 484, 94 S.Ct. 2485, 41 L.Ed.2d 256 (1974), <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976), and <em>Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, </em>434 U.S. 136, 98 S.Ct. 347, 54 L.Ed.2d 356 (1977), as cases \u201cthis case should follow.\u201d Counsel\u2019s only attempt to distinguish <em>Turner </em>is his argument that the challenged Indiana statutory provisions \u201cdo not deny the woman a chance to show that she is able and willing to work,\u201d and that \u201conly women who are unable or unwilling to work because of pregnancy are denied benefits.\u201d This argument simply ignores the unequivocal statutory declarations that \u201cunavailability for work of an individual shall be deemed to exist . . . [in] any case in which ... it is found [t]hat such individual\u2019s unemployment is due to pregnancy,\u201d see note 1, <em>supra, </em>and that \u201c[separation from employment because of pregnancy shall be construed as within the purview of the disqualification provided\u201d with respect to individuals who left their employment voluntarily without good caus\u00e9 attributable to the employer or who were discharged for misconduct, see note 2, <em>supra. </em>When the defendants\u2019 attempt to distort the statutory language is disposed of, nothing is left of their argument and <em>Turner </em>plainly controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to determine whether it should proceed as a class action and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\">.
