The Commission held that the proposed surcharges amount to retroactive ratemaking, which is prohibited by the Federal Power Act. Petitioners counter that the surcharges are necessary because of changes in the companies\u2019 rate structure, and that they are not retroactive ratemak-ing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-18\">The First, Third and Fourth Circuits have already ruled on this issue. The First Circuit <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> largely agreed with the position taken by the petitioners here. The Third<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Fourth<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Circuits, on the other hand, held that it was proper for the Commission to reject the surcharges as prohibited retroactive ratemaking. We agree with the decisions by the Third and Fourth Circuits and affirm the Commission\u2019s orders, except those involving petitioner Appalachian Power Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-20\">Approved rates for electric service usually have two components. The \u201cdemand charge\u201d covers the utility\u2019s fixed (capacity related) costs. The \u201cenergy charge\u201d is designed to recover variable costs, primarily the cost of fuel, which recently has been increasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-21\">The energy charge also has two elements. The first element is the \u201cbasic energy rate.\u201d It recovers the \u201cbase cost\u201d of fuel, which is an estimate of what fuel will cost. The basic energy rate must be approved in advance by the Commission. The second element is the \u201cfuel adjustment\u201d charge. This charge is based on a formula designed to recover the difference between the base cost of fuel and the actual cost of fuel. A utility\u2019s fuel adjustment formula must be approved by the Commission, for it is considered part of the utility\u2019s filed rate. The monthly charge calculated under the fuel adjustment formula, however, is not subject to Commission approval. Thus, fuel adjustment clauses enable utilities to keep their rates in line with the current cost of their fuel without continually having to file for rate increases and decreases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>While a utility\u2019s fuel adjustment clause must fall within certain boundaries, much of the design is left to the utility. Basically, utilities have used one of two types of fuel adjustment formula. \u201cCost of service\u201d tariffs are designed to reimburse the utility for its actual fuel expenditures. These tariffs have the advantage of being accurate, but the inclusion of current costs in the monthly billings must be deferred while the utility collects and assimilates current data. \u201cFixed rate\u201d tariffs incorporate a charge of a \u201cpredetermined price per unit based on costs incurred during a past test period, subject to some adjustments.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Fixed rate tariffs are less accurate than cost of service tariffs, but monthly billings need not be postponed until information on fuel costs is tabulated. Each type of fuel adjustment formula has its advantages and disadvantages, and the Commission allows a utility to use either one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">Until late 1975, the fuel adjustment clauses employed by the petitioners used fuel costs from up to six months earlier to compute current fuel adjustment charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For example, Public Service\u2019s January billing incorporated a fuel adjustment charge which reflected the difference between the base cost and the actual cost of fuel in the preceding November. Petitioners term this a \u201cbilling lag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">Petitioners were forced to amend their filed rates in late 1975 because of a change in Commission regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Some of the petitioners chose this occasion to eliminate the \u201cbilling lag\u201d in their fuel adjustment charges. That is, rather than computing current fuel adjustment charges on the basis of costs in a period prior to the billing period, the utilities switched to formulas that incorporated the actual cost of the fuel in the billing month. Thus, where under Public Service\u2019s old formula the January fuel adjustment charge was based on the cost of fuel in the preceding November, under the new formula, the January charge is computed on the basis of the actual January cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">In addition to the changes just mentioned, petitioners requested approval for temporary rate surcharges. The surcharges are designed to recover \u201cdeferred charges\u201d related to the \u201clag period\u201d which petitioners allege are still owed by customers under the old (superseded) fuel adjustment clauses. Petitioners maintain that adoption of the new (non \u201cbilling lag\u201d) fuel adjustment clauses wiped out the \u201cdeferred charges\u201d and made them uncollectable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">Public Service\u2019s experience illustrates how elimination of the \u201cbilling lag\u201d arguably makes \u201cdeferred charges\u201d unrecoverable. Public Service\u2019s superseded fuel adjustment formula was based on the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>fuel in \u201cthe second preceding month.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The January fuel adjustment charge reflected the cost of fuel in the preceding November. Therefore, recovery of the difference between the basic energy charge and November costs was \u201cdeferred\u201d until the following January.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Public Service\u2019s new fuel adjustment clause, which eliminated the \u201cbilling lag,\u201d became effective on January 1, 1976. Under the new \u201ccost of service\u201d clause the cost of fuel in January is accounted for in the January charge. The January charge no longer reflects the difference between the actual and estimated costs in November. Thus, the \u201cdeferred charge\u201d from November, 1975, and December as well, became uncollectable under the new fuel adjustment formula. (Instead the higher January cost was collected). Petitioners argue that the surcharges are necessary to recoup costs for such periods, which were never included in any billings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-13\">The Commission refused to approve the surcharges. It held that (1) the proposed surcharges would be retroactive rate increases, and (2) the Federal Power Act prohibits retroactive ratemaking.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-15\">The primary issue in this case is whether imposition of the proposed surcharges would be retroactive ratemaking. Petitioners argue that the surcharges are not retroactive rate increases. They contend that the fuel adjustment clauses which were superseded were <em>cost of service </em>tariffs with deferred billing and therefore that they (petitioners) were entitled under the superseded clauses to be compensated for all incurred fuel costs;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that since the surcharges merely enable petitioners to recover costs to which they were already entitled, but for which billing had been deferred, imposition of the surcharges would not constitute retroactive ratemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>The Commission disagrees with petitioners\u2019 characterization <em>of </em>the superseded fuel adjustment clauses. It contends that the old clauses were <em>fixed rate </em>rather than cost of service tariffs. That is, the superseded clauses established a \u201cformula, based on past experience, <em>i. e., </em>costs incurred during a prior test period, to\u201d approximate the actual cost of fuel in the billing month.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In Public Service\u2019s case, for example, the costs in the second preceding month were a proxy for the costs in the billing month. Under this view, once a utility collected the fixed rate charge based on the costs in an earlier month it was fully paid, according to the rationale of its rate, for the service provided in the billing month. There were no \u201cdeferred charges\u201d still owed by the customer. Under this analysis the requested surcharges would be retroactive rate increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">Whether approval of the proposed surcharges would be retroactive ratemaking depends upon one\u2019s characterization of the superseded fuel adjustment clauses. If those clauses are viewed (as petitioners do) as cost of service tariffs with deferred billing, then the requested surcharges \u2014 which merely assure that the utilities recover their fuel costs \u2014 would not be retroactive rate increases. But if the superseded clauses are viewed (as the Commission does) as fixed rate tariffs which used past costs as a proxy for the actual current cost, then the proposed surcharges would indeed be retroactive rate increases. We believe that the superseded fuel adjustment clauses were fixed rate tariffs, and therefore, we agree with the Commission\u2019s finding that approval of the surcharges would be retroactive ratemaking.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-13\">Petitioners make four arguments to support their claim that the superseded clauses were cost of service tariffs with deferred billing. First, they argue that the language of the clauses supports their interpretation. That is not true. While the clauses do not state that past costs are a proxy for current costs,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> neither do they state that the formulas are a method by which billing is deferred. Construed most favorably to the petitioners, the clauses are ambiguous. In light of this ambiguity, other evidence must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-14\">Petitioners\u2019 second argument is based on their use of \u201cdeferred fuel accounting.\u201d Public Service\u2019s deferred fuel accounting method \u201creflect[s] the amount to be collected for [fuel adjustment] charges in the month in which the increased fuel costs are incurred.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For example, the money to be received from a January billing is \u201centered in current revenues\u201d for the preceding November.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Pennsylvania Electric and Metropolitan Edison use a similar (though slightly different) accounting system. According to their counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>[The] accounting method defers recognition of actual expense . . . until such time as those actual dollar amounts are billed under the fuel clause. Thus, the portion of the fuel cost that is included in Penelec\u2019s base rates is charged as an expense each month and the portion in excess of that base amount is deferred. The deferred costs are carried forward and recognized as expenses in the month in which the related fuel adjustment revenues are billed. Thus deferred fuel cost accounting properly matches costs and revenues.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">Petitioners contend that their use of deferred fuel accounting \u201cwould not make sense\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> unless the superseded clauses were cost of service tariffs with deferred billing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">Petitioners\u2019 use of deferred fuel accounting is consistent with their claim that one month\u2019s fuel adjustment charge was merely deferred billing for an earlier month\u2019s costs. Nevertheless, petitioners\u2019 choice of this accounting method does not establish that the superseded clauses were cost of service tariffs with deferred billing. First, at least with respect to Public Service, the deferred fuel accounting method was not adopted until over one year after the superseded fuel adjustment clause became effective.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to Public Service\u2019s counsel\u2019s contention, this accounting method is not \u201ctangible evidence of the Company\u2019s intent\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> at the time the superseded clause became effective.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Second, a company\u2019s accounting method may or may not evidence its intention with respect to fuel adjustment charges. Deferred fuel accounting may have been adopted because the companies believed that their fuel adjustment clauses were cost of service tariffs with deferred billing. But adoption of this accounting method may have been for entirely different reasons. The switch to this accounting method resulted in an increase in assets on the books of the utilities and could have helped in sales of their securities at a time when they were hard hit by the foreign oil embargo.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, a utility\u2019s choice of an accounting method does not necessarily control the Commission\u2019s decision as to the nature of the filed rate. Also, there is nothing in the Commission\u2019s prior approval of the filed rate that requires a conclusion that it is a cost of service tariff. We are not persuaded, therefore, that petitioners\u2019 accounting method establishes that the superseded clauses merely deferred billing.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-16\">Petitioners\u2019 third argument is based on Commission regulation 35.14(a)(1). This regulation provides that a fuel adjustment formula must reflect \u201cthe difference between the fuel cost ... in the base period and in the current period. . \u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Petitioners contend that this regulation \u201cscrupulously require[s] that only actual fuel costs enter into this calcula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>tion [of the fuel adjustment charge].\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Since only \u201cactual\u201d costs can be reflected in the formula, petitioners maintain that the reference to past costs must have been a way to defer billing, rather than as a proxy for current costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">The flaw in this argument is the assumption that \u201ccurrent costs\u201d can not be estimated. If this assumption were correct, then the regulation would have the effect of prohibiting fixed rate tariffs entirely. Petitioners cite no language in the regulation that supports their assumption and there is no basis for us to conclude that the Commission would have instituted such a major change from its past practice in less than explicit language. A much more reasonable conclusion, which is consistent with Commission practice, is that \u201ccurrent costs\u201d is a tferm of art. In cost of service tariffs, \u201ccurrent costs\u201d are indeed the actual costs. But in fixed rate tariffs, \u201ccurrent costs\u201d means an estimate of costs based on past experience. Therefore, we reject the argument that because of regulation 35.14 the superseded clauses must be viewed as cost of service tariffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">Finally, petitioners contend that in light of the Commission policy of making utilities whole the superseded fuel adjustment clauses must be viewed as cost of service tariffs. We acknowledge, of course, that the goal of fuel adjustment clauses is to accurately compensate utilities for their fuel costs, and that cost of service tariffs are the best way of doing this. The Commission, however, does not require that utilities use cost of service tariffs. Within certain boundaries, utilities are permitted to design their own fuel adjustment clauses. The risk involved in the selection of a fuel adjustment clause is on the utility.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus, when a utility chooses a fixed rate tariff, a kind of fuel clause that has long been permitted, Commission policy does not require that courts transform the clause into a cost of service tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">In short, none of petitioners\u2019 arguments warrants the conclusion that the superseded fuel adjustment clauses were cost of service tariffs with deferred billing. We therefore turn to the arguments in support of the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-13\">We concur, for three reasons, in the Commission\u2019s judgment that the superseded fuel adjustment clauses were fixed rate tariffs. First, the scheme of the superseded fuel adjustment clauses belies petitioners\u2019 claim that the clauses were cost of service tariffs with deferred billing. Petitioners acknowledge that the superseded clauses were based on formulas. Their argument is that those formulas merely postponed recovery of the actual cost of service. An examination of the superseded clauses, however, indicates that was not the case. If the clauses were cost of service tariffs with deferred billing, then the formulas would have applied the fuel adjustment factor based on a particular month\u2019s fuel costs to the amount of energy used by the customer during that month.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But instead, the clauses involved in the tariffs filed in this case (except Appalachian) applied the fuel adjustment factor (which was based on fuel costs in a prior month or months) \u201cto all kilowatt-hours supplied <em>during the billing month.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, the fuel adjustment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>charge that was used was <em>not </em>based on the cost of fuel that had been used to generate the power for which users were billed. Since customer usage varies from month to month, this mismatch \u2014 applying a fuel adjustment factor based on one month to kilowatt-hours used during another month\u2014 would not lead to exact recovery of actual fuel expenses.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus, the superseded clauses did not simply defer recovery of the cost of fuel. The clauses brought about a charge that differed from actual cost. This result is inconsistent with petitioners\u2019 claim that the clauses were cost of service tariffs with deferred billing. But the result squares with the Commission\u2019s view that the clauses were fixed rate tariffs which used fuel costs in a prior period as a proxy for actual current costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Second, petitioners\u2019 billing practice is inconsistent with their claim that the superseded fuel adjustment clauses were merely a means of deferred billing. If these clauses were a method of deferred billing, then the utilities would not have begun billing under the superseded clauses immediately after the clauses became effective. Rather, they would have waited until the \u201cbilling lag\u201d had elapsed. Yet the petitioners<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> began billing under the superseded fuel adjustment clauses the first month they were effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">Public Service\u2019s billing practice illustrates this inconsistency. Its superseded fuel adjustment formula became effective in January, 1973. Public Service began billing in accordance with that formula immediately. Under petitioners\u2019 analysis, the January bill was really a deferred charge for the \u201csecond preceding month\u201d \u2014 November, 1972. But as the Commission notes, Public Service could not have intended to charge for November, 1972, because its customers had already paid for service received in November, and therefore the January charge \u201cwould have constituted retroactive rate-making and would have been barred.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> If Public Service really intended its fuel adjustment clause to be a means of deferred billing, then the proper procedure would have been to start billing under that clause in March, 1973. The only reasonable explanation for Public Service\u2019s decision to bill under the superseded clause the first month it was effective is the one arrived at by the Commission: the superseded clauses were fixed rate tariffs which used costs incurred during a prior test period as a proxy for actual current costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-13\">Petitioners have no real answer to this point. They lamely contend that \u201cthe initial billings show no more than a lack of refined thinking on the correct application of the clause.\u201d However, we cannot ascribe such carelessness in applying the clauses as their application is in conformance with their wording and they were obviously drafted in a very careful manner.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Petitioners have generously offered to refund the extra money billed during the first months the superseded clauses were effective in exchange for the much greater amounts they would receive if their arguments about deferred billing were accepted. We are not persuaded. One\u2019s thinking need not be very \u201crefined\u201d to understand that if the purpose of a fuel adjustment clause is to defer billing, then billing must be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>ferred.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Petitioners\u2019 decision to bill during the first months the superseded clauses were effective is a clear indication that petitioners did not consider the clauses to be cost of service tariffs with deferred billing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">Finally, the language and tone of the superseded fuel adjustment clauses is consistent with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that they were fixed rate tariffs. It would have been very easy for petitioners, who wrote the clauses, to have included explicit language indicating that the fuel clauses merely deferred billing for one month\u2019s fuel costs until a subsequent month. But the clauses do not contain such language. Instead they provide, for example, that a \u201cfuel cost adjustment factor shall be applied ... in accordance with the formula set forth . . . \u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This emphasis on a formula, which as we indicated above, did not result in an exact recovery of fuel costs, belies petitioners\u2019 claim that the clauses merely deferred billing for a few months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">For these reasons, we believe that the Commission properly characterized the superseded fuel adjustment clauses as fixed rate tariffs. Since we agree with the Commission, it is not necessary to address the niceties between various standards of review. <em>Associated Press v. Federal Communications Commission, </em>146 U.S.App.D.C. 361, 366-67, 452 F.2d 1290, 1295-96 (1971). But even if we did not agree with the Commission, reversal on this point would be inappropriate. The Commission\u2019s interpretation of fuel adjustment clauses is entitled to a considerable amount of deference. As Judge Leventhal wrote for the court in <em>Gulf-States Utilities Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Power Commission, </em>171 U.S.App.D.C. 57, 64, 518 F.2d 450, 457 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-13\">where the decision involves the interpretation of the parties\u2019 intent as revealed in the language of a contract, it is proper to defer to the Commission\u2019s expertise if its decision is \u201camply supported both factually and legally.\u201d <em>United Gas Pipe Line Co. v.

In the instant case, even if one were somewhat persuaded by petitioners\u2019 arguments, there is no question that the Commission\u2019s finding is \u201camply supported.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">The Commission held hearings before it concluded that the surcharges-proposed by Public Service, Pennsylvania Electric and Metropolitan Edison are retroactive rate increases. No such hearings were held involving Appalachian Power. Instead, relying on its decision in <em>Public Service No. </em>790<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> the Commission \u201csummarily disallow[ed] the proposed fuel surcharge . .\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Appalachian Power contends that even if the Commission is correct with respect to the other petitioners, rejection of Appalachian Power\u2019s surcharges without a hearing was error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">The Commission may reach decisions without holding evidentiary hearings only when there are no material facts in dispute. <em>Citizens for Allegan County, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Power Commission, </em>134 U.S.App.D.C. 229, 232, 414 F.2d 1125, 1128 (1969); <em>Independent Bankers Association of Georgia v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, </em>170 U.S.App.D.C. 278, 292, 516 F.2d 1206, 1220 (1975). On this record, material facts are in dispute and Appalachian Power\u2019s formula as drafted does not determine the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">The central factual issue is whether the two superseded fuel adjustment clauses used by Appalachian Power were cost of service tariffs with deferred billing or fixed rate tariffs. Our decision that the clauses used by the other petitioners were fixed rate tariffs is based primarily on two facts. First, the formulas mismatched the costs from an earlier month with the power consumption in the billing month. Second, petitioners\u2019 billing was not deferred. In Appalachian Power\u2019s case these facts are not established in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">1. <em>Mismatch. </em>The fuel adjustment clauses that were used by Public Service, Pennsylvania Electric and Metropolitan Edison plainly applied the fuel adjustment factor (which was based on fuel costs in a prior month) \u201cto all kilowatt-hours supplied during the billing month.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Thus there was a mismatch of costs from one month with fuel usage in a later month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">The record does not conclusively establish that Appalachian Power\u2019s superseded fuel adjustment clauses prescribed such a mismatch. For example, the clause in Appalachian Power\u2019s filed rates for its wholesale customers provided that if the cost of fuel exceeded the base cost, then \u201can additional charge . . . equal to the product of the actual kiloWatt-hours used and a fuel clause adjustment factor . . . shall be made . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Appalachian Power acknowledges that the fuel adjustment factor was based on the costs in the second preceding month.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Its fuel adjustment factor, therefore, was essentially the same as that used by the other petitioners. But while the fuel adjustment factor was similar, the fuel consumption that this factor was applied to may have been different. Appalachian Power\u2019s clause (see Appendix of 195 U.S.App.D.C., 963 of 600 F.2d) provides that the factor should be applied to \u201cthe actual kiloWatt-hours used,\u201d but the clause does not indicate which month\u2019s \u201cactual kiloWatt-hours\u201d is intended. Perhaps the factor was applied to the kilowatt-hours consumed in the billing month, just as in the clauses used by the other petitioners. But it is also possible that the factor was applied to the kilowatt-hours used in the second preceding month\u2014 the same month that was the basis for the fuel adjustment factor. If the latter were true, then the fuel adjustment charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>would have accurately recovered the actual cost of service on a deferred basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">The testimony of Appalachian Power\u2019s witnesses supports its contention that there was no mismatch in Appalachian Power\u2019s fuel adjustment clauses. One witness stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-5\">The terms of the [superseded] clause reflected, as a practical matter a billing lag; i. e., if fuel cost in one month were above (or below) the base rate level, then this increased fuel cost would be recovered in the rates for the next succeeding month.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Similarly, another Appalachian Power witness indicated that under the superseded fuel adjustment clause the exact difference between the base cost and actual cost of fuel in one month was recovered in a subsequent month.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">Since the fuel adjustment clause is ambiguous, and since Appalachian Power\u2019s witnesses support the company\u2019s claim that there was no mismatch in billing under the superseded clauses, we are unable to agree with the Commission that there are no material facts in dispute. At the same time, the testimony provided by Appalachian Power does not establish that there was not a mismatch. On remand, therefore, the Commission should determine the actual billing practice used by Appalachian. If the Commission finds that the fuel adjustment factor was applied to fuel consumption in the billing month, then this would support the Commission\u2019s belief that the clause was a fixed rate tariff. But if the superseded clause was applied in a way that resulted in exact recovery of actual costs (e. g., no mismatch), then this would support the company\u2019s claim that the clause was a cost of service tariff with deferred billing.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">2. <em>Immediate billing of fuel adjustment charges. </em>With respect to billing practices, Public Service, Pennsylvania Electric and Metropolitan Edison all started billing customers for fuel adjustment charges in the first month that their superseded clauses were effective. This billing practice is inconsistent with their claim that the fuel adjustment clauses were a method of deferred billing.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But since no hearings were held on Appalachian Power\u2019s billing practice, we have no record evidence to review. Thus, as with the mismatch question, this factual issue is still in dispute as to Appalachian.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">In summary, it is not certain, on this record, that Appalachian Power\u2019s superseded clauses mismatched costs and consumption. Similarly, there is no evidence as to Appalachian Power\u2019s billing practice. In short, the primary reasons that the other petitioners\u2019 superseded clauses were found to be fixed rate tariffs do not appear on this record to be true as to Appalachian Power. Neither are such reasons disproved. The Commission\u2019s rejection of Appalachian Power\u2019s proposed surcharges based solely on the Commission\u2019s holding with respect to the other petitioners, therefore, was erroneous. There is still a dispute as to whether Appalachian Power\u2019s superseded clauses were fixed rate tariffs. A remand on that question is therefore necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-14\">Thus far, we have determined that the superseded clauses were fixed rate tariffs, and therefore that the proposed surcharges are retroactive rate increases.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The second major issue to be resolved is whether this finding absolutely precludes approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>surcharges. The Commission held that it does, relying on the rule against retroactive ratemaking. The First Circuit, however, suggests that the rule need not be strictly applied, and that in some cases retroactive ratemaking is permissible.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Since we disagree with the decision of the First Circuit, and since the rule against retroactive rate-making was barely mentioned in the opinions by the Third and Fourth Circuits<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> we will address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">This court stated in <em>Nader v. Federal Communications Commission, </em>172 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 21, 520 F.2d 182, 202 (1975) that \u201c[i]t is ... a cardinal principle of rate-making that a utility may not set rates to recoup past losses, nor may the Commission prescribe rates on that principle.\u201d Though this rule is applied in a variety of settings,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> it is most prominent in ratemaking under the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d (1977) and the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c (1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-6\">[a]ll rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(a) (1977). If the Commission finds that existing rates are unreasonable, then it may establish reasonable rates \u201cto be <em>thereafter </em>observed and in force . .\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717d(a) (emphasis added). The provisions of the Natural Gas Act are \u201cvirtually identical.\u201d As a result of the similarity in the two Acts, cases applying the rule against retroactive ratemaking to ratemaking under one Act have been viewed as authority for applying the rule to ratemaking under the other Act as well. <em>Indiana &amp; Michigan Electric Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 334, 342, 502 F.2d 336, 344 n.2 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 946, 95 S.Ct. 1326, 43 L.Ed.2d 424 (1975).<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">Perhaps the leading case dealing with ratemaking under the Federal Power Act is <em>Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Services Co., </em>341 U.S. 246, 254, 71 S.Ct. 692, 696, 95 L.Ed. 912 (1951). Therein, the court cited the legislative history of the Act for the proposition that \u201cCongress withheld from the Commission power to grant reparations.\u201d Justice Frankfurter\u2019s dissent (on other grounds) elaborated on this same point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-13\">Despite the unqualified statutory declaration that unreasonable rates are unlawful, we think it clear that Congress did not intend either court or Commission to have the power to award reparations on the ground that a properly filed rate or charge has in fact been unreasonably high or low.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-14\">341 U.S. at 258, 71 S.Ct. at 698. Similarly, in <em>Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., </em>350 U.S. 348, 355, 76 S.Ct. 368, 372, 100 L.Ed. 388 (1956), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-15\">while it may be that the Commission may not normally <em>impose </em>upon a public utility a rate which would produce less than a fair return, it does not follow that the public utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate affording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bargain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Finally, this Circuit stated in <em>Indiana &amp; Michigan, supra, </em>that the \u201cSupreme Court has interpreted [the Federal Power Act] as precluding the Commission from ordering refunds, even when it determines that the rates in effect are unjust and unreasonable.\u201d 162 U.S.App.D.C. at 343, 502 F.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">The rule against retroactive rate-making is forcefully stated in cases involving the Natural Gas Act. The Supreme Court wrote in <em>Federal Power Commission v. Tennessee Gas Co., </em>371 U.S. 145, 152-53, 83 S.Ct. 211, 215, 9 L.Ed.2d 199 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACk8\">[A] rate for one class or zone of customers may be found by the Commission to be too low, but the company cannot recoup its losses by making retroactive the higher rate subsequently allowed . . . The company having initially filed the rates and . . failed to collect a sufficient one must, under the theory of the Act, shoulder the hazards incident to its action including ... its losses where its filed rate is found to be inadequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">Accord: <em>Atlantic Ref. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>360 U.S. 378, 389, 79 S.Ct. 1246, 3 L.Ed.2d 1312 (1959), <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n v. Hope Natural Gas, </em>320 U.S. 591, 618, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944), <em>Gillring Oil Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>566 F.2d 1323, 1325 (5th Cir. 1978), and <em>State Corporation Comm\u2019n of Kansas </em>v. <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>215 F.2d 176, 184 (8th Cir. 1954). In summary, cases under both the Federal Power Act (which applies here) and the Natural Gas Act establish the principle that only prospective ratemaking is allowed. A rate designed to recoup past losses is retroactive and illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">Basically, petitioners do not contest the validity of the rule against retroactive rate-making. The force of their argument is, as Appalachian Power stated, that the \u201cproposed surcharge is not a reparations award.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> But to a certain extent, petitioners pick up on the theme enunciated in the First Circuit\u2019s <em>Maine Public Service </em>opinion: that the \u201cCommission has more latitude in shaping a lawful rate than it has recognized.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-13\">The First Circuit\u2019s reasoning appears to be that while retroactive ratemaking is generally forbidden, in light of the unique circumstances involved in fuel adjustment clause cases, the rule should not be applied inflexibly.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Judge Campbell explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AecZ\">the validity of the surcharge presents a unique policy question for the Commission rather than a black or white legal issue. The surcharge falls somewhere between a species of the forbidden \u201cretroactive rate-making\u201d and an acceptable adaptation of the earlier fuel clause to special conditions. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-14\">The difficulty in classification stems not only from the inflationary rise in fuel costs that triggered the problem, but from the fact that fuel cost adjustment clauses are themselves unique animals that are not easily assimilated to classical rate-making principles. We believe that the Commission erred insofar as it regarded itself as automatically precluded by prior judicial decision such as <em>Montana-Dakota </em>or <em>Hope Natural Gas </em>from approving the surcharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\">579 F.2d at 668. Thus, the First Circuit held that the Commission erred when it rejected the surcharge proposal solely on the basis of the rule against retroactive ratemaking. In so ruling the Court stated that the Commission should have paid more attention to whether the surcharge was \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d and it ordered a remand on the reasonableness issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-16\">The First Circuit offered four reasons for its conclusion that the rule against retroactive ratemaking was not controlling in cases involving fuel adjustment clauses. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>\u201cfuel cost adjustment clauses are . unique animals\u201d <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> designed \u201c \u2018to make utilities whole,\u2019 and the surcharge can now be defended as simply implementing the same policy.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Second, a Commission regulation permits \u201cdeviation from the prescribed operation of fuel adjustment clauses . for good cause shown . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Third, \u201cthe Commission does allow in other circumstances for \u2018after the fact matching of actual costs and revenues,\u2019 . . .\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Finally, \u201cthe Commission . . has permitted a type of refund outside of the ordinary rate-suspension context.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by any of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">1. <em>\u201cUnique Animals.\u201d </em>The purpose of fuel adjustment clauses is to enable utilities to recover their fuel costs without constantly having to file amendments to their tariffs. According to the Commission, \u201c[t]he philosophy underlying the design of fuel adjustment clauses is to increase or decrease the charge to the customer by an amount reflecting the actual increase or decrease in the cost of fuel.\u201d <em>New England Power Co., </em>48 F.P.C. 899, 921 (1972). Following the lead of the First Circuit in <em>Maine Public Service, supra, </em>petitioners argue that since fuel adjustment clauses are \u201cunique animals\u201d intended to ensure accurate recovery of fuel costs, the goal of accurate recovery should take precedence over the rule against retroactive ratemaking. Therefore they maintain that reasonable retroactive rate increases, which merely permit a utility to recover fuel costs missed by the prior filed rate, should be allowed.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">If we were writing on a clean slate this argument would have some attraction. But there is nothing new about the goal that utility rates should accurately reflect costs and ensure a reasonable return on investment. And despite this goal, courts have consistently held that while the Commission can not require a utility to adopt an unfavorable rate, it has no authority to retroactively allow an increase when the utility has voluntarily adopted a non-compensatory rate.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Neither petitioners nor the First Circuit cite any cases to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-16\">In addition, although fuel adjustment clauses are intended to enable utilities to recover the actual cost of fuel, the particular design of a clause is left to the utility. The Commission permits both fixed rate and cost of service tariffs. The goal of accurate recovery of actual fuel costs is best met by cost of service tariffs, but petitioners opted instead for fixed rate formulas.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Having made that choice, they now argue that they should be exempt from the rule against retroactive ratemaking because the rate they chose did not recover their costs. Perhaps the Commission should, in the interest of accurate recovery, permit only cost of service tariffs. The fact is, however, that fixed rate tariffs are permitted, and petitioners chose to use them. We simply can not accept the argument that petitioners\u2019 improvident choice entitles them to an exemption from the well established rule against retroactive ratemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-17\">2. <em>Commission Regulation. </em>The First Circuit implies that 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.14(a)(10) (1974) permits retroactive rate-making. Section 35.14(a) delineates filing requirements for.fuel adjustment clauses. Section 35.14(a)(10) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-18\">Whenever particular circumstances prevent the use of the standards provided for herein, or the use thereof would result in an undue burden, the Commission may, upon application under \u00a7 1.7(b) of the rules of practice and procedure and for good cause shown, permit deviation from these regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>We do not understand this provision as allowing retroactive ratemaking. Since nothing in the regulation relates to the rule against retroactive ratemaking, it is hard to see how allowing a deviation from its filing requirements could have any substantive impact on the rule. Moreover, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Federal Power Act as prohibiting retroactive ratemaking, and we do not believe that the Commission in its regulations had either the intention or the authority to exceed this statutory limitation. Therefore, section 35.14(a)(10) merely permits deviation from the filing requirements for prospective rather than retroactive rate changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">3. <em>After the Fact Matching. </em>Petitioners maintain that Commission approval of after the fact matching in other areas belies the agency\u2019s claim that retroactive ratemaking is uniformly prohibited. Petitioners cite two examples of authorized after the fact matching: purchased gas cost adjustment (PGA) clauses and research demonstration and development (RD&amp;D) expense adjustment clauses.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> PGA clauses permit utilities to \u201crecover or return\u201d the difference between actual fuel costs and the amount recovered by the fuel charge.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> RD&amp;D expense adjustment clauses recover prior research and development expenditures.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> According to the First Circuit</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFi5u\">Though these adjustment provisions differ from fuel cost adjustment clauses in several respects their retrospective nature is similar to that of the adjustment clause, and their existence indicates that the Commission may not be so devoid of the power to match past costs and present revenues as it here maintains.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT8\"><em>Maine Public Service, supra, </em>579 F.2d at 668 n.13.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">The existence of PGA and RD&amp;D clauses conclusively establishes that the Commission permits after the fact matching. The First Circuit errs, however, by equating after the fact matching with retroactive ratemaking. All cost of service clauses involve after the fact matching of costs and charges, and there is no question that the Commission can, under the Federal Power Act, approve cost of service clauses. The Commission\u2019s approval of both Public Service\u2019s and Appalachian Power\u2019s new cost of service fuel adjustment clauses is an example of this. Both clauses allow the utility to conform the fuel adjustment charge to fuel costs after those costs have been incurred. They are not retroactive rate increases, however, because both clauses were prospectively approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-12\">The question before us is not whether cost of service clauses with their after the fact matching can be approved. Rather, it is whether the Commission may retroactively change a fixed rate clause to a cost of service clause. The prospective application of the previously approved cost of service PGA and RD&amp;D clauses can not support an affirmative answer to this question.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Therefore we reject the argument that</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>PGA and RD&amp;D clauses are precedent for permitting retroactive rate increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">4. <em>Extra-ordinary Refunds. </em>In <em>Indiana &amp; Michigan Electric Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 334, 341-42, 502 F.2d 336, 343-44 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 946, 95 S.Ct. 1326, 43 L.Ed.2d 424 (1975), this court held that the Commission unlawfully \u201cdelayed the effective date of I&amp;M\u2019s rate filings . . ..\u201d The court ordered \u201cI&amp;M\u2019s customers ... to pay retroactive rate increases for the five-month period during which the Commission\u2019s unlawful suspension was in effect.\u201d The First Circuit states that this is an example in which the rule against retroactive ratemaking was ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">The Commission persuasively responds that its power to correct its own mistakes does not establish the existence of a power to remedy insufficient rate filings by utilities. The Supreme Court specifically addressed the difference between these two powers. Justice Douglas wrote for the Court in <em>United Gas v. Callery Properties, </em>382 U.S. 223, 229-30, 86 S.Ct. 360, 364, 15 L.Ed.2d 284 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-9\">We also conclude that the Commission\u2019s refund order was allowable. We reject, as did the Court of Appeals below, the suggestion that the Commission lacked authority to order any refund. While the Commission \u201chas no power to make reparation orders,\u201d <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 618 [64 S.Ct. 281, 295, 88 L.Ed. 333], its power to fix rates under \u00a7 5 being prospective only, <em>Atlantic Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>[360 U.S.] at 389 [79 S.Ct. 1246, 1254], it is not so restricted where its order, which never became final, has been overturned by a reviewing court. Here the original certificate orders were subject to judicial review; and judicial review at times results in the return of benefits received under the upset administrative order. See <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 200-201 [67 S.Ct. 1575, 1579-1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995], An agency, like a court, can undo what is wrongfully done by virtue of its order. Under these circumstances, the Commission could properly conclude that the public interest required the producers to make refunds for the period in which they sold their gas at prices exceeding those properly determined to be in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-16\">Thus, as <em>United Gas </em>and <em>Indiana &amp; Michigan </em>indicate, the Commission may \u201cundo what is wrongfully done by virtue of its order.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> But the Commission may not permit a utility to retroactively increase its filed rate.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-17\">In summary, then, we are not persuaded by any of the reasons cited by the First Circuit for its conclusion that the \u201cCommission has more latitude in shaping a lawful rate than it has recognized.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> On the contrary, precedent establishes that the Commission is prohibited under the Federal Power Act from approving retroactive rate increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-18\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-19\">In summary, we affirm the Commission orders involving Public Service, Pennsylvania Electric and Metropolitan Edison. The Commission correctly determined that their proposed surcharges are illegal retroactive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>rate increases. We remand the orders dealing with Appalachian Power Company. The facts that established that the superseded fuel adjustment clauses used by the other petitioners were fixed rate tariffs have not been conclusively proven with respect to Appalachian Power.

Under the old regulations, nuclear fuel costs were not included in the \u201cbase cost\u201d and therefore were not recovered by the \u201cbasic energy charge.\u201d The requirement that nuclear fuel be figured into the base cost resulted in some recovery of nuclear fuel costs by the basic energy charge. Of course, the difference between the actual cost of nuclear fuel and the \u201cbase cost\u201d would still be reflected in the fuel adjustment charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">.

The January charge would not recover the exact difference between the base cost and the actual cost of fuel in November because the quantity of fuel used differs from month to month, and the fuel adjustment factor was applied to kilowatt-hours used in the billing month. <em>See </em>discussion at III.B., <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">. Pennsylvania Electric, Metropolitan Edison, and Appalachian Power (in its tariff to its affiliate Kingsport Power) did not eliminate the billing lag in their fuel adjustment clauses.
