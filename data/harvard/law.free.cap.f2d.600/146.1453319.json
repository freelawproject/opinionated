Petitioner filed the instant habeas corpus action in May 1978. On August 25, 1978, before issuance of the district court\u2019s order, petitioner escaped from federal custody. Nonetheless, the district court on January 11, 1979, entered its order requiring the Parole Commission to conduct a new parole hearing for Kirby within 60 days of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">On appeal the Government informs us that Kirby was arrested by the F.B.I. on an escape warrant on April 10, 1979. The Government urges that the case is not mooted by reason of petitioner\u2019s recapture. <em>Compare Hicks v. United States Board of Paroles &amp; Pardons, </em>550 F.2d 401, 402 n. 3 (8th Cir. 1977) <em>with Taylor v. Egeler, </em>575 F.2d 773 (6th Cir. 1978). We do not reach that issue. Even if we were to approve the district court\u2019s opinion requiring the Parole Commission to grant petitioner a new hearing, it is obvious the fact of petitioner\u2019s escape would enter into the Commission\u2019s consideration. In view of this new development of the case, i. e., the fact of Kirby\u2019s escape, we vacate the district court\u2019s order. Petitioner should seek any further relief directly from the Parole Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The order is vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
