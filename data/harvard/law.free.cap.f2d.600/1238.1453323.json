The indictment charged each of the defendants with conspiracy to import marijuana, conspiracy to distribute marijuana, importation of marijuana, and attempt to possess marijuana with intent to distribute it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-21\">Humphries moved for an order suppressing his identity \u201cas a defendant in this matter and any and all other physical evidence and statements obtained as a result of the illegal arrest of [Humphries] in this matter.\u201d Judge Muecke heard the argument on Humphries\u2019 motion and granted that motion on January 26, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-22\">On February 3, the Government moved for a \u201cDetermination of Admissibility of Evidence.\u201d This second motion was heard by Judge Davies, who denied it on February 17, ordering that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-23\">all evidence concerning the identity and participation of defendant HUMPHRIES in this case is suppressed for the reason that the Plaintiff has not shown that any of said evidence is derived from a source other than the illegal arrest of defendant HUMPHRIES.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1330-24\">The Government appeals from this second order. On May 25, two members of this court denied Humphries\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal for failure to file timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-25\">II. <em>J urisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-26\">Humphries contends that this court is without jurisdiction over the United States\u2019 appeal in this case. He urges that the Government has attempted to circumvent the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 by moving for a \u201cDetermination of Admissibility\u201d and appealing within 30 days of that order, but more than 30 days after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>district court\u2019s initial decision on Hum-phries\u2019 suppression motion. We hold that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">The courts often have been called upon to construe 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, the Criminal Appeals Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Of their decisions, Professors Wright and Miller have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-5\">Appeals [under \u00a7 3731] are clearly allowed from interlocutory orders suppressing or excluding evidence or requiring the return of property, in marked contrast to the rules governing appeals by criminal defendants or witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">15 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3919, at 656 (footnote omitted); see, e. <em>g., United States v. Donovan, </em>429 U.S. 413, 421 n.8, 97 S.Ct. 658, 50 L.Ed.2d 652 (1977); <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>514 F.2d 308, 310 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>428 U.S. 543, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">Section 3731 is broadly construed, for its legislative history makes it clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azv0\">\u201cCongress intended to remove all statutory barriers to Government appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1331-16\"><em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 568, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 1353, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977), <em>quoting United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 337, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The only limitation on Government appeals under \u00a7 3731 is the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution. <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>554 F.2d 938, 941 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>supplemented, </em>574 F.2d 476 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>see </em>note 4 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-17\">Humphries contends that the Government\u2019s appeal is not properly before this court because it is a \u201cMotion to Determine the Admissibility of Evidence\u201d and not within the express language of \u00a7 3731. Humphries does not argue that the Government\u2019s appeal here violates the constitutional prohibition against placing him twice in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-18\"> To hold that the order here is not appealable under \u00a7 3731 because a denial of a \u201cMotion to Determine the Admissibility of Evidence\u201d is not a \u201cdecision . . . suppressing or excluding evidence\u201d is to focus on the title of the Government\u2019s motion rather than the effect of the district court\u2019s order. Such an approach flies in the face of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>the intent of Congress and is contrary to consistent judicial authority. Section 3731 must be construed broadly; a Government appeal should not be rejected on a hyper-technical jurisdictional ground. Thus, we refuse to limit the Government\u2019s right to appeal under \u00a7 3731 solely because of the title of its motion. Instead, we \u201cfocu[s] on the effect of the ruling sought to be appealed.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>534 F.2d 585, 587 n.3 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>430 U.S. 564, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977); <em>see United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 95 S.Ct. 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">Humphries alternatively argues that the Government has in fact appealed from the January 26 order of Judge Muecke; that the Government\u2019s \u201cMotion\u2019to Determine the Admissibility of Evidence\u201d and its appeal from Judge Davies\u2019 order denying that motion were merely an attempt to circumvent the time limits on appeals under \u00a7 3731.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">Judge Muecke\u2019s order granted Hum-phries\u2019 motion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1332-6\">the identity of JOHN RICHARD HUM-PHRIES as a defendant in this matter and any and all other physical evidence and statements obtained as a result of the illegal arrest of the defendant [be suppressed] in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1332-14\">His decision did not elaborate on what evidence was covered by his order; the opinion merely addressed the illegality of the arrest or detention of Humphries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-15\">The Government made its \u201cMotion to Determine the Admissibility of Evidence\u201d eight days after Judge Muecke entered his order. The Government did not challenge Judge Muecke\u2019s order; instead it sought only a decision on whether \u201ccertain identification evidence concerning defendant HUMPHRIES\u201d was admissible under the previous order. A careful review of the transcripts and record in this case indicates that there was considerable confusion as to the scope of Judge Muecke\u2019s ruling<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the testimony presented in the hearing before Judge Davies on the Government\u2019s motion was significantly different from that presented to Judge Muecke on the previous motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>Given the confusion surrounding the earlier order, and that the Government indeed presented different evidence in the hearing on its motion, we cannot agree with Humphries that the Government\u2019s actions were calculated to circumvent the requirements of the Criminal Appeals Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s appeal is one from Judge Davies\u2019 order suppressing all evidence relating to Humphries. Such an appeal is proper under \u00a7 3731 and was timely filed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We thus have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">III. <em>Suppression of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">Judge Davies ordered that all evidence concerning Humphries\u2019 identity and participation in the marijuana smuggling operation in this case be suppressed. The Government appeals from this order only as to three categories of evidence: (1) the testimony of Frank Sisto; (2) evidence gained as the result of the surveillance of a residence in Scottsdale, Arizona; and (3) the testimony of James \u201cBullet\u201d Thompson, the alleged pilot of the crashed marijuana-laden plane involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-11\">A. <em>Sisto\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-12\">Frank Sisto testified that on the evening of October 23, 1976, he met two strangers at the home of his daughter, just north of San Carlos, Arizona.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> One of the men introduced himself as \u201cTony\u201d and explained that their truck had broken down about three miles north of the residence. He asked to use the telephone to call his wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>to pick them up. When Sisto gave his permission to use the phone, \u201cTony\u201d asked where the best place to wait for his wife would be. Sisto suggested the San Carlos police station but \u201cTony\u201d said that he did not wish to wait there. Sisto then suggested the tribal store in San Carlos and offered to give the two men a ride to that point. \u201cTony\u201d accepted Sisto\u2019s offer. After taking the two men to the store, Sisto called the police station because he was \u201cworried\u201d and had a \u201cfunny feeling\u201d about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">Sisto\u2019s message was passed along to Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Special Agent Little Whiteman, who was investigating a downed aircraft loaded with marijuana near the area where Sisto initially saw the two men. Little Whiteman ordered one of his officers to go to the tribal store to see if the two were still there. Upon receiving word that the two men were still at the tribal store, Little Whiteman ordered them brought in for questioning. This detention was held an illegal arrest by Judge Muecke.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">In court Sisto pointed to Humphries as one of the men to whom he had given a ride. His testimony and identification were based solely on his contact with Humphries and his codefendant, Richardo Rubio (\u201cTony\u201d) prior to the unlawful arrest. It is not in any way a \u201cfruit\u201d of that unlawful arrest. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>436 F.2d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 912, 91 S.Ct. 1392, 28 L.Ed.2d 654 (1971). Thus, we reverse Judge Davies\u2019 order insofar as it suppresses Sisto\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">B. <em>The Surveillance Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">Agent Little Whiteman testified before Judge Davies concerning the discovery of a downed airplane containing a large quantity of marijuana. He related the discovery of papers in the plane and his follow-up investigation which led to the identification of James \u201cBullet\u201d Thompson as the pilot of that aircraft. This information, along with information obtained during the illegal arrest and detention of Humphries (name, address, fingerprints and photograph), was eventually passed to Agent Stine of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Narcotics Enforcement Division (DPS). Little Whiteman also gave Stine the description and license number of a beige 1971 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that he had stopped near the crash site.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-11\">On the basis of this information, Stine obtained a driver\u2019s license photograph of Humphries and proceeded to attempt to locate the pilot, Thompson, by investigating a Scottsdale address called by Thompson while he was in Chicago. Arriving at the Scottsdale residence, Stine noticed a beige Monte Carlo in the driveway. Unable to read the license plate from the street, he drove up the driveway and positively identified the auto as the one stopped by Little Whiteman. He also noticed two persons at the residence while in the driveway, one of whom he identified as Humphries from the driver\u2019s license photo in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-12\">Relying on the information from Little Whiteman and his observations while in the driveway, Stine ordered around-the-clock surveillance of the Scottsdale address. During the course of their stakeout, DPS agents photographed Humphries and others at the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-13\">In the hearing before Judge Davies, the Government stipulated that it would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>introduce evidence concerning the identification of Humphries made by Stine in the driveway of the Scottsdale residence. Therefore, we are concerned only with the admissibility of the license number of the Monte Carlo and the photographs and other evidence garnered as a result of the surveillance of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">1. <em>Identification of the Automobile in Scottsdale</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">The license plate number and description of an automobile which Stine had when he spotted the car in Scottsdale and entered the driveway to check the license plate of that car was derived from a stop of a vehicle- by BIA agents. The legality of that stop is unchallenged in this case. Moreover, the stop was wholly unrelated to the illegal arrest of Humphries. Thus, the BIA information concerning the auto stopped near the crash site was untainted; its use by Stine was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">However, Humphries points out that Stine matched the license plate number of the car in Scottsdale with the number in his possession only by trespassing onto a private driveway. Judge Davies\u2019 order and opinion, holding as it did that the license number identification was tainted by Hum-phries\u2019 illegal arrest, did not reach Hum-phries\u2019 trespass theory. Since we have concluded that the illegal arrest of Humphries did not taint the BIA information concerning the auto stopped near the crash site, we must reach this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-8\">In <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), the Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 88 S.Ct. at 512, <em>quoting Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 304, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967). It concluded that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 88 S.Ct. at 511; <em>see Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. at 304, 87 S.Ct. at 1648 (\u201cthe principal object of the Fourth Amendment is the protection of privacy rather than property\u201d). \u201c[T]he reach of [the Fourth] Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion . . . .\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. at 353, 88 S.Ct. at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-12\">Only when there is an invasion of some reasonable expectation of privacy can police action constitute a search subject to the strictures of the fourth amendment. <em>See United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 42, 96 S.Ct. 2406, 49 L.Ed.2d 300 (1976); <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. at 349-53, 88 S.Ct. 507. Although a driveway may be private under common law notions of property, it may not be for purposes of the fourth amendment. <em>See United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. at 42, 96 S.Ct. 2406 (doorway of private home a \u201cpublic place\u201d where visible from street); <em>United States v. Hersh, </em>464 F.2d 228, 230 (9th Cir. 1972) (officers going upon front porch of house and looking into window did not violate fourth amendment privacy rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-13\">Considering all of the circumstances surrounding Stine\u2019s entry into the driveway and identification of the Monte Carlo as the automobile previously stopped by BIA agents near the crash site, we conclude that the entry and identification did not violate any reasonable expectation of privacy held by Humphries. The auto was visible from the street. It does not appear from the record that the driveway was enclosed by a fence, shrubbery or other barrier. Stine did not move bushes or other objects in order to make his observations. <em>See United States v. Hersh, </em>464 F.2d at 230; <em>United States v. Davis, </em>327 F.2d 301, 303-04 (9th Cir. 1964). Moreover, a license plate is affixed on an automobile for the very purpose of allowing identification of it by law enforcement agencies and others.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>Thus, Stine\u2019s conduct did not constitute a search subject to fourth amendment limitations. His testimony regarding his identification of the car was improperly suppressed. We reverse Judge Davies\u2019s order insofar as it suppresses that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">2. <em>Photographs and Other Surveillance Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">Agent Stine testified that the surveillance of the Scottsdale residence was undertaken because of his identification of Hum-phries and the automobile while he was in the driveway of that address. The surveillance and all evidence derived from it is tainted by the illegal arrest of Humphries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">In <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court announced the appropriate test of whether evidence is inadmissible as the fruit of unlawful police action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-7\">Rather, the more apt question in such a case is \u201cwhether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1336-8\">371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), <em>quoting </em>Maguire, Evidence of Guilt 221 (1959). Exploitation of illegalities is the focus of the fruits doctrine for the reason that the exclusionary rule is aimed at deterring police conduct in violation of the fourth amendment \u201cin the only effectively available way \u2014 by removing the incentive to disregard it.\u201d <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 484, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3047, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), <em>quoting Elkins v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 217, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-9\">Concern for fourth amendment rights must be balanced against the costs of the exclusionary rule, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-10\">[application of the rule . . . deflects the truthfinding process and often frees the guilty. The disparity in particular cases between the error committed by the police officer and the windfall afforded a guilty defendant by application of the rule is contrary to the idea of proportionality that is essential to the concept of justice. Thus, although the rule is thought to deter unlawful police activity in part through the nurturing of respect for Fourth Amendment values, if applied indiscriminately it may well have the opposite effect of generating disrespect for the law and administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1336-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 490-91, 96 S.Ct. at 3050 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-15\">Balancing our concern for the protection of Humphries\u2019 fourth amendment rights against our concern for the truth, we find that the exclusionary rule and the fruits of the poisonous tree doctrine bar the use of any and all evidence gained as a result of the surveillance of the Scottsdale residence. Stine exploited the illegal arrest of Humphries when he used information gathered during Humphries\u2019 detention to identify Humphries in Scottsdale. That identification played a large part in Stone\u2019s ordering the stakeout of that residence. Thus, the road from the illegal actions of the BIA to the evidence gained by surveilling was short and straight. <em>See United States v. Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. 268, 275, 98 S.Ct. 1054, 55 L.Ed.2d 268 (1978). In such a case, the deterrence of the exclusionary rule is required, and the public\u2019s interest in convicting lawbreakers must be subordinated to fourth amendment interests. We therefore find that Judge Davies did not err in suppressing the photographs and other evidence from the surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-16\">C. <em>Thompson\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"AR8m\">James \u201cBullet\u201d Thompson was located by Agent Stine from information discovered by BIA agents investigating the crashed airplane near San Carlos.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There was no taint from the illegal arrest attaching to Stine\u2019s location of Thompson. Once locat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>ed, however, Thompson only implicated Humphries in the marijuana smuggling operation upon being asked specifically about him. And Stine questioned Thompson specifically about Humphries only because of information tainted by the illegal arrest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">In <em>United States v. Ceccolini, </em>the Supreme Court held that the taint of unlawful police action could be dissipated by the exercise of free will by a witness. The Court said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-6\">Evaluating the standards for application of the exclusionary rule to live-witness testimony in light of this balance, we are first impelled to conclude that the degree of free will exercised by the witness is not irrelevant in determining the extent to which the basic purpose of the exclusionary rule is advanced by its application. This is certainly true when the challenged statements are made by a putative defendant after arrest, <em>Wong Sun [v. United States, </em>371 U.S. at 491, 83 S.Ct. 407]; <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>[422 U.S. 590, 603, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975)], and <em>a fortiori </em>it is true of testimony given by nondefendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">435 U.S. at 276, 98 S.Ct. at 1060. Thus, a distinction was made between the \u201clive-witness\u201d testimony of a potential co-defendant and that of a witness not arrested and not implicated in the criminal activities at issue. Additionally, the Court stated that an exercise of free will by a witness may dissipate the taint of unlawful police action only where \u201cany statements [made by the witness] are truly the product of detached reflection and a desire to be cooperative.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-14\">In this case, it is clear that Thompson was implicated in the marijuana smuggling operations: he was the alleged pilot of the marijuana-carrying airplane. Moreover, Thompson answered Stine\u2019s questions as part of a \u201cplea agreement.\u201d \u201cUnder such circumstances it is unreasonable to infer that [Thompson\u2019s] response [to Stine\u2019s questions] was sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint . . . .\u201d <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 416. Therefore, the testimony of Thompson concerning Humphries and his part in the criminal endeavor is tainted and was properly suppressed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-16\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-17\">In sum, we affirm so much of Judge Davies\u2019 order, as suppresses the photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>graphs taken during, and other evidence obtained through, the surveillance of the Scottsdale residence. We also affirm that portion of the order suppressing Thompson\u2019s testimony concerning the identity and participation of Humphries in the marijuana smuggling operation.

Humphries has argued both to this court and below that the Government\u2019s motion was only an attempt to relitigate matters covered by Judge Muecke\u2019s order. The Government has countered that its motion was aimed at determining whether certain evidence was obtained as a result of the illegal arrest of Humphries and thus excluded under Judge Muecke\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">In arguing its position, the Government points out a statement made by Humphries\u2019 counsel during the hearing before Judge Muecke:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1332-9\">Then, of course, we run into the problem, going down the line, as to what is or what is not tainted .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">Yet the order of Judge Muecke merely granted the motion by Humphries that all identification evidence as to him be suppressed. We find that the transcript of the hearing before Judge Davies further indicates the confusion of the parties and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1332-11\">THE COURT: Gentlemen, the reason I asked you to come in, I think I know of a way to solve this thing, deny the government\u2019s motion and let them appeal it.

HOFFMAN: I don\u2019t, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayzm\">THE COURT: The motion is denied.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1332-22\">. In the hearing on Humphries\u2019 motion to suppress, the Government presented the following evidence: (1) the testimony of Frank Sisto that he had picked up two men and taken them to the tribal store in San Carlos to await a ride home and that Humphries, seated in the courtroom, was one of those men and (2) the testimony of Everett Little Whiteman, Special Office for the Bureau of Indian Affairs concerning the illegal arrest or detention, photographing and fingerprinting of Humphries. In support of his motion, Humphries called Douglas R. Stine, an agent of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Narcotics Enforcement Division, who testified that his part in the investigation of this case included investigating some telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>calls from a suspect in the case to a certain address in the Phoenix area, and that in surveil-ling that address he identified Humphries from a driver\u2019s license photograph he had previously obtained because Agent Little Whiteman had given him Humphries\u2019 name.</p>\n<p id=\"Aygy\">In the hearing on the Government\u2019s motion before Judge Davies, the Government elicited testimony of an entirely different nature, even though the same individuals testified. The evidence in the second hearing concerned the discovery of the crash site by Agent Little White-man and his follow-up investigation leading to the identification of James Thompson, the pilot of the downed plane. Agent Stine testified that based on this information, which Little White-man gave him, and because Little Whiteman supplied Stine with Humphries\u2019 name, Stine staked out a certain address called by Thompson, identified Humphries at that address, took a photograph\u2019 of Humphries at that address, and asked Thompson whether he knew Hum-phries and about Humphries\u2019 involvement in the marijuana smuggling operation.</p>\n<p id=\"afb-dedup-1\">Clearly, then, the evidence presented to Judge Davies in the hearing on the Government\u2019s motion did not merely duplicate that heard by Judge Muecke. Thus it does not appear to us that the Government was merely attempting to relitigate matters already determined in Judge Muecke\u2019s order. Judge Davies recognized this fact when he said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agu-dedup-0\">The government may, in view of this Court, produce independent, nonrelated, untainted evidence [of Humphries\u2019 identity] in these proceedings that is not at all void by the order moved by Judge Muecke .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI4\">and when he made it clear that his denial of the Government\u2019s motion was based not on the ground \u201cthat it was encompassed by Judge Muecke\u2019s order\u201d but on the ground that the Government had failed to meet the Ninth Circuit requirements as to its burden of showing that the evidence offered was not tainted by the illegal arrest/detention. We agree with Judge Davies\u2019 position that the Government\u2019s motion was not foreclosed by Judge Muecke\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1333-14\">. Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Humphries is correct in characterizing the Government\u2019s motion and appeal from Judge Davies\u2019 order as an attempt to relitigate a matter already decided by Judge Muecke, and that he is correct in his contention that the appeal is in fact one from the order of Judge Muecke, this appeal would not be barred by the 30 day limitation contained in \u00a7 3731. That limitation period is not jurisdictional. <em>Meier v. Keller, </em>521 F.2d 548, 553 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 943, 96 S.Ct. 1410, 47 L.Ed.2d 348 (1976). Although appeals after the 30 day period are \u201cnot to be regarded with favor,\u201d <em>id. </em>where, as here, there is no showing of bad faith on the part of the Government in delaying the appeal, no prejudice has resulted to any party, and the Government appears to be prosecuting the case diligently, this court may exercise jurisdiction over an appeal under \u00a7 3731. The Government should not be penalized for providing the district court with an opportunity to reconsider its earlier decision, especially when there appears to be a great deal of confusion about the meaning of that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1333-15\">. Judge Davies\u2019 order was entered on February 17, 1978. The Government filed its appeal with this court on March 17, 1978, within the 30 day limit of \u00a7 3731.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1333-16\">. San Carlos is wholly within an Apache Indian Reservation. The police organ in San Carlos is headed by Bureau of Indian Affairs Special Agent Everett Little Whiteman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">. The Government does not take issue with Judge Muecke\u2019s ruling that the San Carlos detention of Humphries was an illegal arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1334-9\">. Humphries argues that the Government is barred from contesting the suppression of Sis-to\u2019s testimony as Sisto did not testify before Judge Davies. However, Sisto did testify before Judge Muecke. As we have indicated <em>supra, </em>Judge Muecke\u2019s order left the parties in some confusion over what evidence had in fact been suppressed. In the memorandum accompanying the Government\u2019s motion, essentially one to determine the scope of Judge Muecke\u2019s order, it was argued that Sisto\u2019s testimony was free of the taint of the illegal arrest of Hum-phries.</p>\n<p id=\"AN-X\">Thus, the issue of the admissibility of Sisto\u2019s testimony was squarely before Judge Davies. We do not believe that it is necessary that Sisto have testified before Judge Davies for this court to review the suppression of his testimony, given the procedural posture of the Government\u2019s motion below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1335-9\">. We do not today hold that the license number of an automobile is never protected by the fourth amendment. Instead, we only recognize that the nature of a license plate, something designed specifically for identification purposes, affects the reasonableness of expectations of privacy concerning it. In this case, all of the circumstances surrounding Stine\u2019s actions indicate that Humphries had no reasonable expectation of privacy as to the license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>number of the auto parked in the Scottsdale driveway. The nature of the license plate is only one factor in our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1336-17\">. BIA agents discovering the downed aircraft located a motel receipt inside the cockpit in Thompson\u2019s name. They also received infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>mation from a truck driver who took a man from the area of the crash to the local airport. The airport manager told them that the hitchhiker had called a taxi and in checking with the motel to which the taxi took the hitchhiker, they discovered his name: James \u201cBullet\u201d Thompson. In following up these leads, Stine located Thompson. It therefore appears that Stine\u2019s discovery of Thompson was in no way related to the illegal arrest of Humphries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1337-10\">. Stine claims to have had knowledge of Hum-phries\u2019 identity and possible involvement in the smuggling venture through two separate sources. The first of these was through information obtained during the illegal arrest of Humphries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">Humphries\u2019 name had also entered the investigation when BIA agents stopped Lon Raymond Jordan near the crash site. Stine knew Jordan to have been arrested for drug-related offenses in the past. He therefore obtained a list of Jordan\u2019s known associates, among whom was Humphries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-12\">In response to questioning by defense counsel Stine testified that Jordan had \u201c[r]oughly 30 to 40\u201d known associates all of whom were \u201cchecked out.\u201d Driver\u2019s license pictures of each were compared to photos taken during the surveillance of the house in Scottsdale.</p>\n<p id=\"acz-dedup-1\">Neither of these sources of information about Humphries was free from the taint of his illegal arrest. The BIA information about Humphries was obtained during that arrest, while the BIA information concerning Jordan indicated that Humphries was a suspect only when the pictures of Jordan\u2019s associates were compared with pictures taken during the surveillance tainted by the illegal arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1337-20\">. We do not here decide the question of whether an exercise of free will could ever dissipate a taint attaching to information used to question any witness or potential witness. Whether the <em>Ceccolini </em>rationale, announced as it was in a case involving the use of tainted information to <em>discover </em>a witness, is properly applicable to a situation where the discovery of the witness is untainted but the information <em>used to question </em>that witness is tainted is unclear. We only decide that, even if <em>Ceccolini </em>is applicable to a case such as that at hand, the standards for dissipation are not met under the facts and circumstances before the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
