We conclude that the withdrawal of an offer does not end the employee\u2019s \u201cperiod of refusal\u201d under the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, and, therefore, that the withdrawal of an offer does not entitle the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>to benefits. Accordingly, we affirm the decisions of the WCAC and the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The facts of this case are essentially undisputed. Plaintiff Ramon Perez injured his back while working for defendant Keeler Brass Company in 1986. He was off work for a few weeks, and then returned to a light-duty job. After a few months on the light-duty job, plaintiff quit to go to New Jersey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time he quit, plaintiff refused to sign a \u201cquit slip.\u201d Defendant waited two or three days, and, when plaintiff did not show up for work, defendant formally terminated him. This formal termination occurred in April 1987. Nearly two years later, in January 1989, plaintiff filed a petition for worker\u2019s compensation benefits. In November 1990, plaintiff offered to return to work for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The worker\u2019s compensation magistrate found that plaintiff had suffered a work-related injury. However, the magistrate found that plaintiff was offered reasonable employment, and that he was performing that reasonable employment until the day he quit. The magistrate was \u201cnot persuaded that Plaintiff left his job because he was unable to perform it.\u201d On that basis, the magistrate concluded that plaintiff \u201cunreasonably refused favoring work\u201d (more properly termed \u201creasonable employment\u201d under the statute). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The magistrate also found that plaintiff was terminated less than three days after this unreasonable refusal. The magistrate then found that plaintiff\u2019s disability ended on February 1, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The parties do not argue that the magistrate\u2019s findings, as outlined above, were inaccurate. Instead, the parties dispute the application of the law to those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">n. the law</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The relevant provisions of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (wdca) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-8\">(1) An employee, who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment by an employer who is subject to this act at the time of the injury, shall be paid compensation as provided in this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-9\">(5) If disability is established pursuant to subsection (4), entitlement to weekly wage loss benefits shall be determined pursuant to this section and as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-10\">(a) If an employee receives a bona fide offer of reasonable employment from the previous employer, another employer, or through the Michigan employment security commission and the employee refuses that employment without good and reasonable cause, the employee shall be considered to have voluntarily removed himself or herself from the work force and is no longer entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act dining the period of such refusal. [MCL 418.301; MSA 17.237(301).][<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Subsection (5) was added to the statute in 1982. See 1981 PA 200. Before that time, the statute did not address \u201creasonable employment,\u201d and this issue was governed by an area of the common law known as the \u201cfavored-work doctrine.\u201d <em>Arnold v General Motors Corp, </em>456 Mich 682, 683, n 2; 575 NW2d 540 (1998). Now, however, the quoted statutory provisions establish the law in this area. The Legislature chose the words of the statute, and we are bound by them. Any cases decided under the common law before subsection (5) was enacted are essentially irrelevant; to the extent that the common-law favored work doctrine is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute, the Legislature has changed the common law. This is a proper exercise of legislative authority. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">m. APPLICATION OF THE LAW BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">The magistrate treated plaintiffs decision to quit as an unreasonable refusal of reasonable employment. However, the magistrate also treated the employer\u2019s subsequent termination of plaintiff as a withdrawal of the offer of reasonable employment. The magistrate then concluded that once the offer was withdrawn, there was nothing left for plaintiff to refuse, and therefore that benefits should be awarded starting with the termination and continuing until the disability ended on February 1, 1990.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The magistrate\u2019s position is essentially the same one that three justices of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>this Court advocated in <em>Derr v Murphy Motor Freight Lines, </em>452 Mich 375; 550 NW2d 759 (1996).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-3\">Defendant appealed the magistrate\u2019s award of benefits to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission (wcac). In a divided opinion, the wcac reversed the magistrate\u2019s award of benefits. In its primary holding, the wcac majority relied on the common law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and found that plaintiff\u2019s decision to quit reasonable employment justified permanent forfeiture of benefits. Notwithstanding, the WCAC also recognized that the statute allows an employee who initially refuses reasonable employment without ever attempting to perform that employment to later end the \u201cperiod of refusal\u201d and thereby obtain benefits. The wcac did not attempt to explain this apparent inconsistency between the statute, which allows benefits when an employee\u2019s period of refusal ends, and the presubsection (5) case law, which allowed permanent forfeiture of benefits after an unreasonable refusal. The WCAC simply indicated that refusing \u201creasonable employment\u201d from the beginning only results in a \u201csuspension\u201d of benefits, while quitting reasonable employment results in a permanent forfeiture' of benefits. 1997 Mich ACO 2960.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">The WCAC denied benefits on two alternative theories. First, the wcac found that plaintiff\u2019s disability ended before his \u201cperiod of refusal\u201d ended. Second, the WCAC concluded that plaintiff was terminated for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>\u201cgood cause\u201d and, therefore, that he was no longer entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs application for leave to appeal in a one-paragraph order, relying solely on one of the wcac\u2019s alternative grounds\u2014that plaintiff\u2019s disability ended before his period of refusal ended. We granted plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal and ordered that this case be argued and submitted with <em>McJunkin v Cellasto Plastic Corp.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>459 Mich 927 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">We must begin by noting the issues that are <em>not </em>before us. Defendant has not contested the magistrate\u2019s finding that plaintiff suffered a work-related disability. Defendant also acknowledges that it formally terminated plaintiff in April 1987, within a few days after plaintiff left his job. Finally, defendant admits that plaintiff sought to return to his light-duty job in November 1990. Similarly, plaintiff admits that the record supports the magistrate\u2019s finding that he voluntarily refused reasonable employment. Plaintiff does not challenge the magistrate\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s disability ended in February 1990. With those issues already resolved, our analysis is limited to the legal effect of the parties\u2019 actions after plaintiff quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Because the facts are not in dispute, leaving only a question of statutory construction, our review is de novo. <em>DiBenedetto v West Shore Hosp, </em>461 Mich 394, 401; 605 NW2d 300 (2000); <em>Donajkowski v Alpena Power Co, </em>460 Mich 243, 248; 596 NW2d 574 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The parties have not addressed directly one of the preliminary questions presented in this case: namely, does the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act apply in circumstances where an employer offers reasonable employment, and the employee performs that reasonable employment (or attempts to perform it), but later quits? Plaintiff appears to assume that the act applies. Defendant never directly addresses the question, but argues that we should apply pre-subsection (5) case law. As noted above, to the extent that the common law is inconsistent with the statute, the common law has been changed, and pre-subsection (5) case law is no longer relevant. We conclude that application of the common law to this case would be inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The wdca does not expressly provide for a person who \u201cquits reasonable employment.\u201d Instead, it refers to an employee who \u201crefuses [reasonable] employment,\u201d MCL 418.301(5)(a); MSA 17.237(301)(5)(a), an employee who \u201closes his or her job through no fault of the employee,\u201d MCL 418.301(5)(d); MSA 17.237(301)(5)(d), and an employee who \u201closes his or her job for whatever reason,\u201d MCL 418.301(5)(e); MSA 17.237(301)(5)(e). We are to construe common words found in our statutes according to their everyday, plain meaning. MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1). An employee who quits cannot reasonably be said to have \u201clost\u201d his job within the common understanding of that word. Thus, subsections (d) and (e) do not apply to an employee who quits. The only remaining question is whether an employee who quits reasonable employment can be said to have \u201crefused that employment\u201d within the plain meaning of subsection (a). In this endeavor, it is essential to remember that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>we are looking to the words of the statute in an attempt to divine the intent of the Legislature. <em>In re MCI, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Subsection (a) refers to an employee who \u201crefuses [reasonable] employment.\u201d We conclude that that phrase, standing alone, is ambiguous on the question whether it encompasses quitting. On one hand, the term \u201crefuses\u201d could be construed narrowly to apply only to an employee\u2019s rejection of the employer\u2019s initial offer of reasonable employment. On the other hand, \u201crefuses\u201d can be read more broadly to encompass an employee\u2019s refusal to do the offered work, even if the employee has performed the work previously. Such ambiguity is often easily resolved by reference to other language in a statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AP3\">MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-6\">An employee, who receives a personal iryury arising out of and in the course of employment by an employer who is subject to this act at the time of the injury, <em>shall be paid compensation as provided in this act. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Similarly, the first paragraph of MCL 418.301(5); MSA 17.237(301)(5), provides: \u201cIf disability is established pursuant to subsection (4), entitlement to weekly wage loss benefits <em>shall be determined pursuant to this section </em>and as follows:\u201d (emphasis added). Clearly, the Legislature intended the statute to be comprehensive. Under these circumstances, we can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>only assume that the Legislature used the term \u201crefuses\u201d broadly to encompass all situations where an employee elects not to perform the offered reasonable employment. Any other construction would require us to look outside the statute, which would be patently inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s express intent that an employee \u201cshall be paid compensation as provided in this act,\u201d and that benefits \u201cshall be determined\u201d pursuant to the statute. On that basis, we conclude that we must examine the statute alone for guidance, and that the wcac erred in applying the common law to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Examining the words of the statute, it becomes clear that a disabled worker who quits or otherwise refuses reasonable employment does not permanently forfeit benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, the worker loses benefits \u201cduring the period of such refusal.\u201d This leads us to the issue left unresolved by our fractured decision in <em>Derr, </em>when does the \u201cperiod of refusal\u201d end?</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">In <em>Derr, </em>the plaintiff was injured on the job and was no longer able to perform his normal duties. After several months of medical leave, the defendant employer offered the plaintiff a light-duty job. The plaintiff refused the light-duty job, and the employer terminated his worker\u2019s compensation benefits. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>plaintiff eventually sought reinstatement of benefits. At about the same time, the employer declared bankruptcy and closed its doors. The magistrate found that the plaintiff had suffered a work-related injury, but that he had subsequently unreasonably refused a bona fide offer of favored work. Those findings were upheld by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (now the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission), the Court of Appeals, and a majority of justices of this Court. <em>Derr, supra </em>at 379-382, 394. On the basis of those findings, the only remaining issue was the effect of the employer\u2019s bankruptcy. On that point, this Court was evenly divided.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Justices Mallett, Levin, and Cavanagh all signed an opinion that would have held that an employer\u2019s decision to close its doors constituted a withdrawal of an offer, which, in turn, effectively ended the \u201cperiod of refusal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386-393. Justices Boyle and Riley and Chief Justice Brickley dissented on this point. The latter three justices did not believe that the employer\u2019s bankruptcy necessarily ended the period of refusal. <em>Id. </em>at 394 (Boyle, J.), 394-400 (Brickley, C.J., joined by Riley, J.). Because there was no majority for either position, <em>Derr </em>does not constitute a controlling opinion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Returning to the plain language of the statute, we conclude that the only party that can end the period of refusal is the disabled employee. The statute makes clear that an employee\u2019s unreasonable refusal of reasonable employment is equivalent to a withdrawal from the work force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>If an employee receives a bona fide offer of reasonable employment from the previous employer, another employer, or through the Michigan employment security commission and the <em>employee </em>refuses that employment without good and reasonable cause, <em>the employee shall be considered to have voluntarily removed himself or herself from the work force and is no longer entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act during the period of such refusal. </em>[MCL 418.301(5)(a); MSA 17.237(301)(5)(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">In his opinion in <em>Derr, </em>Chief Justice Brickley analyzed this statutory language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-6\">[T]he phrase \u201cperiod of such refusal\u201d as used in the wdca refers to the employee\u2019s voluntary removal from the work force. Accordingly, that period ends only when the voluntary removal ends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-8\">There is nothing in [the language of the statute] that equates the phrase \u201cperiod of such refusal\u201d with an inquiry into whether the offer is still open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-9\">The lead opinion\u2019s assertion that benefits must be reinstated when the offer is withdrawn does not follow from the plain language of the statute. To mandate that result, the statute would need to contain a statement that \u201cthe employee is not entitled to benefits during the period the offer is open,\u201d or similar language. Under the plain language of the act, the dispositive question is whether the refusal to work has ended, not whether the offer of employment is still open. In the language used by the Legislature, the \u201cperiod of such refusal\u201d refers to the employee\u2019s voluntary absence from the work force. The plain meaning of this statement is that the employee must end that voluntary absence in order to be entitled to the reinstatement of benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-10\">The initial burden of offering reasonable employment is on the employer; after that burden is met, the employee has the burden of not unreasonably refusing that employment. Similarly, the burden of ending the voluntary removal caused by the unreasonable refusal must fall on the employee. The majority characterizes the requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>an employee indicate a willingness to return to work as judicial engrafting not required by the statute. However, this requirement is simply common sense. The \u201cperiod of such refusal\u201d must end for benefits to be reinstated, and it must be possible to determine whether it has ended. Only the employee can end the employee\u2019s refusal, and only the employee can demonstrate that it has ended. <em>[Derr, supra </em>at 395-397.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We agree with and adopt Chief Justice Brickley\u2019s assessment of the plain language of MCL 418.301(5)0); MSA 17.237(301)(5)(a). The availability of a particular job is irrelevant to the question whether a disabled worker remains \u201cvoluntarily removed\u201d from the work force. Indeed, the statute expressly recognizes that job offers may come from \u201cthe previous employer, another employer, or through the Michigan employment security commission.\u201d The fact that one particular job disappears says nothing about the employee\u2019s decision to withdraw from the work force. The power to end the period of refusal lies solely with the employee, regardless of the circumstances of the particular employer or the job market as a whole. As Chief Justice Brickley noted: \u201cOf course, nothing prevents [an employee] from ending his period of refusal and thereby obtaining the reinstatement of his benefits.\u201d <em>Derr, supra </em>at 398. Thus, if a disabled employee unreasonably refuses a job initially, but later informs the employer of a desire to reenter the work force, the employee has ended the period of refusal, regardless of whether a suitable job is available.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>In the present case, it is undisputed that plaintiff voluntarily left his job in April 1987, thus refusing reasonable employment. Plaintiff did not take any action to end the period of refusal until November 1990. Thus, plaintiff was not entitled to benefits from April 1987 until November 1990. Had he still been disabled, plaintiff might have been entitled to reinstatement of benefits in November 1990. However, the magistrate found that plaintiff was no longer disabled as of February 1990, and plaintiff was not entitled to any benefits after that date.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">For these stated reasons, plaintiff was not entitled to benefits, and the decision of the wcac is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b911-6\">Weaver, C.J., and Cavanagh, Kelly, Taylor, Corrigan, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-8\"> Plaintiff disputes use of the term \u201cquit.\u201d Plaintiff admits, however, that the magistrate\u2019s findings in this regard are supported by substantial evidence.

In a footnote, the wcac asserted that these cases survived the codification of the \u201cfavored work\u201d doctrine in the current version of the wdca quoted above, but it did not cite any authority or offer any rationale in support of that assertion. 1997 Mich ACO 2952, 2960, n 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b904-9\"> Our opinion in <em>McJunkin </em>is also being released today. 461 Mich 590; 608 NW2d 57 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b906-8\"> For instance, if the Legislature had included a subsection expressly dealing with employees who \u201cquit reasonable employment,\u201d we would have no trouble concluding that the Legislature intended something different when it referred to an employee who \u201crefuses [reasonable] employment.\u201d See <em>Guitar v Bieniek, </em>402 Mich 152, 158; 262 NW2d 9 (1978) (\u201cdoubtful or ambiguous provisions of a statute are construed not in isolation but with reference to and in the context of related provisions\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b907-7\"> Defendant argues that we should read a \u201creasonable time\u201d provision into the statute, to protect employers from employees who wait months or years to withdraw their refusals.
