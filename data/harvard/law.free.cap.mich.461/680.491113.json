If the pau applies, defendant\u2019s potential liability would be $200,000 in Canadian funds rather than the insurance policy limit of $20,000 U.S. funds. We hold that defendant\u2019s expanded obligations under the pau are limited to lawsuits filed in Canada and therefore the pau does not apply to this lawsuit. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">I. UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">This case arises from an automobile accident involving two Michigan residents who were traveling in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Defendant\u2019s insured rear-ended plaintiff\u2019s vehicle. Plaintiff commenced this lawsuit in Wayne County against defendant\u2019s insured, alleging that she suffered a serious impairment of bodily function and permanent serious disfigurement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The policy that defendant\u2019s insured purchased limits defendant\u2019s liability for bodily injury to each injured person to $20,000, with its maximum liability for each occurrence limited to $40,000. However, defendant has filed a PAU with the Canadian government, wherein it agreed in part that it would:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-7\">[n]ot ... set up any defence to any claim, action, or proceeding, under a motor-vehicle liability insurance contract entered into by it, which might not be set up if the contract had been entered into in, and in accordance with the law relating to motor-vehicle liability insurance contracts of the Province or Territory of Canada in which such action or proceeding may be instituted, and to satisfy any final judgment rendered against it or its insured by a Court in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Province or Territory, in the claim, action, or proceeding, up to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-4\">(1) the limit or limits of liability provided in the contract; but</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-5\">(2) in any event an amount not less than the limit or limits fixed as the minimum[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] for which a contract of motor-vehicle liability insurance may be entered into in such Province or Territory of Canada, exclusive of interest and costs and subject to any priorities as to bodily injury or property damage with respect to such minimum limit or limits as may be fixed by the Province or Territory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Plaintiff moved for a declaratory ruling that the pau applied, making the applicable insurance coverage $200,000 in Canadian funds rather than the $20,000 limit stated in the insurance policy. Plaintiff argued that defendant, contrary to the PAU, was setting up a defense of limit of liability less than the $200,000 minimum coverage prescribed by Canadian law. Defendant intervened as a real party in interest to contest plaintiffs request.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">The parties eventually entered into a settlement agreement under which they submitted the question of plaintiff\u2019s total damages to an arbitration panel and plaintiff released her claims against defendant\u2019s insured in exchange for $20,000. Th\u00e9 parties agreed that they would resubmit the coverage issue to the trial court in the event the arbitrators awarded plaintiff more than $20,000. Plaintiff further agreed that she would not seek recovery from defendant\u2019s insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">The arbitration panel awarded plaintiff $95,000. Plaintiff then renewed her motion for a declaratory ruling on the coverage issue. The trial court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>pursuant to <em>ACIA v Lozanis, </em>215 Mich App 415; 546 NW2d 648 (1996), Ontario\u2019s $200,000 minimum coverage requirement applied to this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished decision stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-7\">We agree that <em>Lozanis, supra, </em>is controlling. In <em>Lozanis, </em>the claimant was injured by an unidentified motorist in Ontario. <em>Id., </em>pp 416-417. The claimant\u2019s uninsured motorist policy with acia had $20,000 limits. Although the claimant filed suit in Ontario, that suit was enjoined. <em>Id., </em>p 417. This Court concluded that ACIA had agreed in the pau filed with the Canadian government not to assert policy limits below $200,000 against an insured injured in Ontario. <em>Id., </em>pp 419-420. Acia was therefore subjected to Canadian law, and the fact that acia had filed suit in Macomb County was not dis-positive, since it had agreed to provide coverage for its insureds traveling in Canada. <em>Id., </em>p 420. The Court concluded that the pau did not require that the action be filed in Canada. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-8\">Following <em>Lozanis, </em>we conclude that here, too, the fact that the action was filed in Wayne County is not dispositive. The accident occurred in Ontario, and acia agreed in the pau to provide coverage up to the Ontario limits. Although the claimant in <em>Lozanis </em>filed suit in Ontario, that suit was enjoined and was not the basis for this Court\u2019s decision applying the Ontario limits. Neither <em>Lozanis </em>nor the instant case involved an Ontario judgment. We find <em>Lozanis </em>to be controlling authority for the application of the Ontario limits in this case.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Defendant appealed and we granted its application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">H. OTHER COURT HOLDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">There is no dispute that the higher Canadian limits would apply if plaintiff had filed her lawsuit in Ontario. However, she filed her lawsuit in Michigan. Hence, the real issue is whether the pau applies when a lawsuit is filed in Michigan that could have been filed in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Three sister state courts have addressed the issue whether a pau applies when a lawsuit is filed, not in Canada, but in one of our states.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">In <em>Mindell v Travelers Indemnity Co, </em>46 AD2d 263; 361 NYS2d 777 (1974), a passenger was injured in a one-car accident in Ontario. A lawsuit was filed in New York. The plaintiff argued that the insurance company which had filed a pau with Ontario was liable, not for the policy limits of $10,000 but the higher Ontario limit. After examining the pau the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-8\">It is clear from the language and context of the foregoing undertaking . . . that the provision quoted refers only to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>claim, action or proceeding prosecuted in a Canadian Province or Territory, and that the insurer\u2019s agreement not to set up certain defenses . . . extended only to such actions. It was in no respect an agreement to forego those defenses\u2014 and to assume an increased liability\u2014-in the present New York action. <em>[Id. </em>at 266.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">This decision by New York\u2019s intermediate appellate court was unanimously affirmed by New York\u2019s highest appellate court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">In <em>Fiste v Atlantic Mut Ins Co, </em>94 Ohio App 3d 165; 640 NE2d 551 (1994), an Ohio resident was injured by a Canadian citizen in a car accident while driving in Ontario. The plaintiff did not receive enough from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer to cover his damages and subsequently sued his own insurance company in Ohio for additional payment. Auto Club Insurance Company paid the plaintiff the $5,000 due under its policy. The plaintiff argued that the insurance company which had a pau with Ontario was responsible for an additional amount under Canadian law. The court rejected plaintiff\u2019s claim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-8\">Auto Club\u2019s execution of this power of attorney and undertaking by which it agreed to abide by Canadian law is not decisive of the issues herein, since that document applies only to causes of action arising in Canada and litigated in Canadian courts. The power of attorney and undertaking does not purport to require Auto Club to be bound by Canadian law with respect to actions against Auto Club by Ohio residents arising out of a contract of insurance executed in Ohio. <em>[Id. </em>at 168-169.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">In <em>Motorists Mut Ins Co v Howard, </em>110 Ohio App 3d 709, 713-714; 675 NE2d 51 (1996), the Ohio Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>of Appeals, without citation to or apparent knowledge of <em>Mindell, </em>or O\u2019Shei, reached a contrary result involving a PAU stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-5\">[I]t is not necessary for [the insured] to file an action in Canada to enforce the power of attorney agreement. This agreement does not state as a condition precedent to enforcement that an individual must institute an action in Canada, and, indeed, the plain language states that an action may be instituted in Canada.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">As previously indicated, our Court of Appeals also addressed a defendant\u2019s PAU in <em>Lozanis. </em>In <em>Lozanis, </em>a Michigan resident was injured while driving in Ontario. Because the driver of the truck that hit Mr. Lozanis\u2019 vehicle was never identified, Lozanis sought uninsured motorist benefits for his injuries. Lozanis filed a lawsuit in Ontario seeking $200,000 in Canadian funds, rather than the $20,000 in U.S. funds provided for in his insurance policy for uninsured motorist coverage. The acia sued Lozanis in Michigan and obtained an injunction forbidding him from continuing his Ontario lawsuit on the basis that the insurance policy required claims to be arbitrated. The circuit court did however hold that the pau applied so that $200,000 in benefits was available. The acia appealed, and the Court of Appeals considered whether the pau precluded the defendant from asserting uninsured motorist policy limits of lower than $200,000 in Canadian funds in an action by its insured arising from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Ontario accident. The Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the forum of the action determines whether the pau applies, reasoning that the defendant submitted to Ontario law by agreeing to the pau, and its execution of that document negated its contention that it did not intend to provide insurance coverage for its insureds who traveled in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">m. ANALYSIS OF THE PAU</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">The pau has an introductory paragraph and then has four undertakings labeled A, B, c and D. A review of the entire document shows that the pau contemplates an action in a Canadian court.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">The introductory paragraph requires the acia to appoint an official to receive service of process on its behalf, and requires it to promise to appear in a Canadian court in any claim filed there. Clearly this paragraph envisions a Canadian lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">In the first undertaking, the ACIA agrees to appear in any action against it or its insured in any province or territory in which such an action has been instituted. This paragraph also contemplates a lawsuit in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">In the second undertaking the acia agrees to cause notice or process to be served upon the insured upon receipt from any of the Canadian superintendents of insurance and Canadian registers of motor vehicles mentioned in the introductory paragraph of the pau. Once again, this paragraph contemplates a Canadian lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">In the third undertaking, the acia agrees</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-11\">[n]ot to set up any defence to any claim, action, or proceeding, under a motor-vehicle liability insurance contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>entered into by it, which might not be set up if the contract had been entered into in, and in accordance with the law relating to motor-vehicle liability insurance contracts of the Province or Territory of Canada in which such action or proceeding <em>may </em>be instituted, and to satisfy any final judgment rendered against it or its insured by a Court in such Province or Territory, in the claim, action, or proceeding, up to ... . [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">The dissent focuses on the word <em>may </em>in this paragraph and argues that \u201cmay\u201d implies permission, and thus that the acia has waived certain defenses in cases that \u201cmay\u201d have been brought in a Canadian court. We cannot agree. Such an interpretation ignores the impetus of the whole of the PAU contrary to the well-established principle that contracts are to be construed in their entirety.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We believe the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in context reflects the disjunctive nature of the previous phrase in the pau. Hence use of \u201cmay\u201d in this context implies that the pau applies in whatever province or territory the suit is brought, not that the ACIA waives defenses in any forum in which suit could be brought. This is consistent with the last portion of the cited language wherein the acia promises to satisfy any judgment issued by a Canadian court on the claim. This language certainly suggests a Canadian lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The fourth undertaking relates to insurance cards and does not shed light on the issue at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">After review of the entire pau, we are satisfied that the acia\u2019s additional obligations only apply when a lawsuit is filed in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>As to <em>Lozanis, </em>we find that the Court of Appeals reached the right result, but that it did not properly analyze the pau. We believe the right result was reached because Lozanis did institute a lawsuit in Canada making the pau applicable. The Canadian lawsuit was, however, enjoined at the acia\u2019s request and the matter was resolved in a state court. Thus, the state court lawsuit, was a substitute for the Canadian lawsuit and the pau did apply. Indeed, any other resolution would have allowed the ACIA to avoid its obligations under the pau. However, we disagree with the <em>Lozanis </em>Court to the extent that it suggested that the forum of the lawsuit did not affect whether the pau applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Finally, we note that Canadian courts also understand paus to apply on the basis of where an action is litigated. In <em>Potts v Gluckstein, </em>8 OR3d 556, 558 (Ont Ct App, 1992),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a plaintiff from British Columbia was injured by an Ontario defendant and brought suit in Ontario. The Ontario court, discussing the reciprocal insurance scheme, which \u201cis based upon a Power of Attorney and Undertaking,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-6\">In the event of an accident, <em>the insurer agrees to be bound by the law of the province or territory where the action is brought </em>and not the province where the policy is issued. The insurer also accepts liability to the limits prescribed in its policy or, at least, to the minimum limits established in the province or territory <em>where the action is brought. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">Later in its opinion, the court noted its earlier decision in <em>MacDonald v Proctor, </em>19 OR2d 745 (Ont Ct App, 1977), in which it stated that the effect of the pau was to commit the insurer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>to . . . observe Ontario rules to a certain extent, <em>where its insured is involved in Ontario proceedings, </em>[but that the PAU did not convert] the Manitoba policy [involved in <em>MacDonald] </em>[into] one that is \u201cmade in Ontario.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The Ontario courts have turned to this formulation repeatedly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Similarly, courts in other provinces have suggested that by issuing a pau, the insurer agrees to be bound by the laws of the forum, not any possible forum. For example, in <em>Court v Alberta Motor Ass\u2019n Ins Co, </em>47 ACWS3d 610 (BC Sup Ct, 1994), an Alberta plaintiff sued an Alberta defendant in a British Columbia court for an accident that occurred in British Columbia. The court applied British Columbia law, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-7\">[I]n any action in British Columbia against [the insurer] arising out of an automobile accident in British Columbia, [the insurer] is precluded from setting up any defence to the claim, including a defence to the limit of liability, that might not be set up if the policy were one issued in British Columbia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">The British Columbia court required that the action be in British Columbia for that province\u2019s law to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">Also instructive is the British Columbia Court of Appeals decision in <em>Marchand v Alberta Motor Ass\u2019n Ins Co, </em>47 ACWS3d 714 (BC Ct App, 1994). There, two parties from Alberta had an accident in British Columbia. An insurance company challenged the Brit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ish Columbia action, saying the plaintiff only chose that forum because the defendant insurer executed a pau with the British Columbia government. By suing in British Columbia, then, the plaintiff could take advantage of liability m\u00ednimums higher than those in both parties\u2019 home jurisdiction of Alberta. Ultimately, the court allowed the action because the accident occurred in British Columbia, but the defendant\u2019s argument, which the court acknowledged, rests on the fact that had the suit been brought in Alberta, the provisions of the pau would have been ineffective despite that the accident occurred in British Columbia. That is because the PAU only requires insurers not to raise defenses that would not be allowed under the law where the suit is brought.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">We conclude that defendant is not obligated to the higher Canadian liability limits under the pau because the lawsuit was not filed in Canada. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We remand to allow the trial court to consider plaintiff\u2019s alternative argument under MCL 500.3131(1); MSA 24.13131(1).</p>\n<judges id=\"b988-7\">Cavanagh, Kelly, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b989-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>CANADA NON-RESIDENT INTER-PROVINCE MOTOR-VEHICLE LIABILITY INSURANCE CARD</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">POWER OF ATTORNEY AND UNDERTAKING</p>\n<p id=\"Aeh\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-12\"> As a requisite to do business in Ontario and other Canadian provinces insurance companies must execute paus.

The plaintiff argued the insurance company was obligated to pay Ontario minimum limits for uninsured motorist coverage because the insurance company had filed a pau with the Canadian government. The federal court examined the pau and held that the insurance company had only obligated itself to satisfy final judgments rendered against it by Canadian courts and that the pau did not indicate any agreement to satisfy judgments entered against it by courts outside Canada. <em>Id. </em>at 8, n 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b982-10\"> Order affirmed without opinion, 38 NY2d 815; 345 NE2d 584 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b983-7\"> We note that this paragraph was nonbinding dicta because the court had already decided that Canadian law applied pursuant to a provision in the insurance policy before it discussed the pau.

That scheme \u201censures that a person who has entered into a motor vehicle insurance contract in one province is recognized as insured in other provinces.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The scheme is, however, also open to participation by United States insurers who do not insure Canadian residents and their automobiles. M; <em>Schrader v United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co, </em>59 OR2d 178 (1987), modified 59 OR2d 797 (1987). Those insurers file a PAU with the Canadian government to ensure that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>insureds have the required coverage when driving in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">H. RESIDUAL LIABILITY COVERAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">The instant case sounds in contract, not tort. I agree with defendant that Michigan law governs construction of its contract to determine the amount of residual liability coverage afforded because defendant contracted with its insured in this state and the underlying accident involved Michigan residents. See <em>Chrysler Corp v Skyline Industrial Services, Inc, </em>448 Mich 113; 528 NW2d 698 (1995); see generally <em>Sutherland v Kennington Truck Service, Ltd, </em>454 Mich 274; 562 NW2d 466 (1997). I conclude, however, that defendant explicitly waived the $20,000 limit stated in the policy and agreed to provide up to $200,000 in Canadian funds in residual liability coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">I agree with the Court of Appeals that the PAU applies to this case. Concededly, the policy that the insured purchased limits defendant\u2019s liability for bodily injury to each injured person to $20,000. Nonetheless, under the PAU, defendant intentionally relinquished its right to assert defenses that it could not assert if it had entered into the policy in, and in accordance with the law of, Ontario. Accordingly, defendant expressly waived the policy limits by entering into the PAU with the Canadian government. See <em>Book Furniture Co v Chance, </em>352 Mich 521, 526; 90 NW2d 651 (1958) (\u201c[w]aiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right\u201d); see also <em>Dahrooge v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number><em>Rochester German Ins Co, </em>177 Mich 442, 451-452; 143 NW 608 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Under the pau, defendant agreed that it would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-6\">[n]ot ... set up <em>any </em>defence to any claim, action, or proceeding, under a motor-vehicle liability insurance contract entered into by it, which might not be set up \u00bf/the contract had been entered into in, and in accordance with the law relating to motor-vehicle liability insurance contracts of the Province or Territory of Canada in which such action or proceeding <em>may </em>be instituted .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">I cannot join the majority\u2019s construction of this provision. Where no ambiguity exists, the terms of the contract control. <em>Hank v Lamb, </em>310 Mich 81, 88; 16 NW2d 671 (1944). We interpret the language used in the contract in accordance with its usual and ordinary meaning. <em>Ginsberg v Reliable Linen Service Co, </em>292 Mich 70, 75; 290 NW 331 (1940). In this case, the plain language of the pau precludes defendant from raising \u201cany\u201d defense to \u201cany claim, action, or proceeding\u201d under its automobile insurance contract that it could not assert if it had entered into the contract in accordance with the law of the province in which the action \u201cmay be instituted.\u201d The verb \u201cmay\u201d expresses possibility or permission. <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary, </em>p 838. Therefore, the clear language of the pau dictates that it applies not only to actions actually brought in an Ontario court, but to actions that could have been brought in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that, instead of its common meaning, \u201cuse of \u2018may\u2019 in this context implies that the pau applies in whatever province or territory the suit is brought . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 689. Although this Court construes a contract as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>whole,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it will not make a new contract for the parties. <em>Ginsberg, supra </em>at 75. \u201cA contract cannot be made by construction because it later appears that a different agreement should have been consummated in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cmay\u201d essentially inserts the Canadian province limitation contained in the satisfaction of judgment clause into the waiver of defenses clause. Unlike the majority, I would not remake the PAU through the addition of that limitation. See <em>Klever v Klever, </em>333 Mich 179, 187; 52 NW2d 653 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">By its terms, the PAU applies to \u201can action or proceeding against it or its insured, or its insured and another or others, arising out of a motor-vehicle accident in any of the respective Provinces or Territories . . . .\u201d This action clearly arises out of an Ontario accident, and thus, falls within the scope of the pau. Construing the term \u201cmay\u201d in accordance with its plain meaning furthers the underlying purpose of the pau\u2014to provide \u201ca uniform basis for the enforcement of motor vehicle insurance claims in Canada.\u201d <em>Potts v Gluckstein, supra </em>at 558. The majority\u2019s construction results in the opposite because different coverage levels apply, depending on the forum of the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">The majority\u2019s approval of the result in <em>ACIA v Lozanis, </em>215 Mich App 415; 546 NW2d 648 (1996), illustrates the problematic nature of its construction. In <em>Lozanis, </em>the insured brought an action in Ontario despite an arbitration clause in his insurance policy. Under the majority\u2019s view, the filing of the Ontario action is dispositive for purposes of determining coverage, even though a Michigan court subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>enjoined the insured from pursuing his claim in the Ontario court. The majority\u2019s holding will simply encourage Michigan residents to file suit against their Michigan insurers and other Michigan residents in a foreign jurisdiction. Henceforth, few Michigan insureds will bring actions arising out of an Ontario accident in a Michigan court.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">In my view, the Court of Appeals adopted the correct construction of the PAU in <em>Lozanis, supra </em>at 421. <em>Lozanis </em>considered whether the pau precluded defendant insurer from asserting uninsured motorist policy limits of lower than $200,000 in Canadian funds in an action by its insured arising from an Ontario accident. The Court rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the forum of the action determines whether the pau applies, reasoning that defendant submitted to Ontario law by agreeing to the pau and that its execution of that document negated its contention that it did not intend to provide insurance coverage for its insureds who traveled in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">In <em>Motorists Mut Ins Co v Howard, </em>110 Ohio App 3d 709, 713-714; 675 NE2d 51 (1996), the Court of Appeals of Ohio reached the same conclusion when construing identical language in a pau between another insurer and the Canadian government. That court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-6\">Clearly, this provision precludes [the insurer] from asserting \u201cany defence\u201d to \u201cany claim\u201d that it would not be allowed to assert if the insurance policy were entered into \u201cin accordance with the law relating to motor-vehicle liability insurance contracts\u201d of Ontario, Canada. . . . Further, it is not necessary for [the insured and his passenger] to file an action in Canada to enforce the power of attorney agreement. This agreement does not state as a condition precedent to enforcement that an individual must institute an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>action in Canada, and, indeed, the plain language states that an action may be instituted in Canada We believe that the proper construction of [the insurer\u2019s] power of attorney agreement with Canada is that when one of [the insurer\u2019s] insureds is involved in a collision in Canada, [the insurer] is bound by the applicable laws of Canada relating to compensation of person injured in that collision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">I agree with <em>Lozanis </em>and <em>Howard. </em>By entering into the pau, defendant effectively submitted to Ontario law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">I would decline, however, defendant\u2019s invitation to construe the pau as simply incorporating the restrictions placed on insurers licensed \u201cto carry on automobile insurance in Ontario\u201d under Ontario law. Ont Rev Stat 1980, ch 218, \u00a7 25(1), provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-7\">A licence to carry on automobile insurance in Ontario is subject to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-8\">1. In any action in Ontario against the licensed insurer or its insured arising out of an automobile accident in Ontario, the insurer shall appear and shall not set up any defence to a claim under a contract made outside Ontario, including any defence as to the limit or limits of liability under the contract, that might not be set up if the contract were evidenced by a motor vehicle liability policy issued in Ontario and such contract made outside Ontario shall be deemed to include the benefits set forth in Schedule C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Ont Rev Stat 1980, ch 218, \u00a7 25(1) effectively creates an exception to the general rule that the Ontario Insurance Act does not apply to policies covering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>automobiles that need not be registered in Ontario.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ont Rev Stat 1980, ch 218, \u00a7 202(2). The insurer must provide the coverage required by Ont Rev Stat 1980, ch 218, \u00a7 219(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-6\">Every contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability policy insures, in respect of any one accident, to the limit of at least $200,000, exclusive of interest and costs, against liability resulting from bodily injury to or the death of one or more persons and loss of or damage to property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">In <em>Schrader v United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co, </em>59 OR2d 178 (1987), modified 59 OR2d 797 (1987), the Ontario Divisional Court concluded that \u00a7 25 precludes insurers who carry automobile insurance in Ontario from asserting the defense that their United States policies do not include coverages or limits mandated by the Ontario Insurance Act. The court, however, subsequently learned that the insurer involved in <em>Schrader, supra, </em>was not licensed to do business in Ontario, but rather had filed a power of attorney and undertaking with the provincial superintendent of insurance. The court accepted the insurer\u2019s concession that the \u201csame result would have been reached by reason of the filing of the power of attorney and undertaking in Ontario by a foreign insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">I recognize that Ont Rev Stat 1980, ch 218, \u00a7 25(1) only applies to an \u201caction in Ontario.\u201d Unlike the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ute, however, the pau does not limit its application to actions brought in Ontario and other provinces. Instead, its plain language precludes defendant from raising \u201cany\u201d defense to \u201cany claim, action, or proceeding\u201d under its automobile insurance contract that it could not assert if it had entered into the contract in accordance with the law of the province in which the action \u201cmay be instituted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">In this case, defendant expressly waived its policy limits and agreed to application of the Ontario coverage limits under the PAU. The pau applies because this action could have been instituted in Ontario<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and defendant\u2019s assertion of its policy limits constitutes a defense. See <em>Potts, supra </em>at 560 (the term \u201cdefence\u201d includes any defense that the policy does not include coverages or limits mandated by the Ontario insurance act). I would therefore conclude that defendant must provide coverage of $200,000 in Canadian funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">m. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">I conclude that defendant insurer waived its policy limits and must provide up to $200,000 in Canadian funds in residual liability coverage for bodily injuries sustained in the Ontario automobile accident involving its Michigan insured and plaintiff. I would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b998-9\">Weaver, C.J., concurred with Corrigan, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b998-10\">Young, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-8\"> <em>Singer v Goff, </em>334 Mich 163, 168; 54 NW2d 290 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b997-9\"> Under Ontario law, an owner of a motor vehicle who does not reside or carry on business in Ontario for more than three months in any one year need not register the vehicle if (1) the country or state of residence grants a similar exemption for vehicles owned by residents of Ontario and registered therein, and (2) the vehicle is registered in that country or state and displays registration plates.
