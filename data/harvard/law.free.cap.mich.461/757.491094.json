Defendants sought reimbursement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>their attorney fees under MCL 213.66(3); MSA 8.265(16)(3). Although defendants and their counsel had a contingent fee agreement providing for payment of one-third of the amount by which the judgment exceeded the department\u2019s offer, the trial court ordered reimbursement to be made on the basis of the actual hours expended by counsel multiplied by counsel\u2019s hourly rate. The Court of Appeals affirmed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we granted defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal. 459 Mich 1001 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">We conclude that the trial court did not utilize the correct legal framework when considering defendants\u2019 request for reimbursement of their attorney fees. Accordingly, we remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">This is an action under the Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before filing the action, the MDOT made a written good-faith offer for the defendants\u2019 property under \u00a7 5 of the act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the amount of $1,625,655. Defendants did not contest the necessity of the taking, but objected to the adequacy of the compensation offered. The mdot filed this action and paid the amount of its earlier written offer in accordance with \u00a7 8 of the act. MCL 213.58; MSA 8.265(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">There was a lengthy jury trial, resulting in a verdict awarding just compensation in the amount of $2,593,931. With interest added, the result was a judgment entered in the amount of $2,724,615\u2014$1,098,960 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>greater than the initial offer of just compensation by the mdot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">Defendants filed a request for attorney fees and costs as permitted by \u00a7 16 of the act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The request was supported by an affidavit from defendants\u2019 counsel itemizing her legal services, and a copy of the contract between counsel and the defendants, which provided for a contingent fee of one-third of the increase over the initial offer by the MDOT. Defendants sought a total of $366,319.90, with the attorney fee component being based on the one-third provision of the contingent fee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">The trial court ordered reimbursement of attorney fees and costs, but in the amount of $120,153, roughly one-third of the amount requested. The court said that the amount requested on the basis of the contingency fee arrangement would be unreasonable. Instead, it used what is often called the \u201clodestar\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> method\u2014setting the fee by multiplying the reasonable number of hours worked by a reasonable hourly rate. The mdot had not disputed the reasonableness of the 728.2 hours claimed to have been expended by defendants\u2019 counsel, nor the reasonableness of the $165 an hour rate that she indicated she would have charged had she been retained on an hourly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">The circuit court began by noting the relevant language of the statute. As applicable at the time of these proceedings, subsection 16(3) of the act in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>eluded the following:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-4\">If the amount finally determined to be just compensation for the property acquired exceeds the amount of the good faith written offer under section 5, the court shall order reimbursement in whole or in part to the owner by the agency of the owner\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, but not in excess of 'A of the amount by which the ultimate award exceeds the agency\u2019s written offer as defined by section 5. The reasonableness of the owner\u2019s attorney fees shall be determined by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Citing <em>In re Condemnation of Property (Dep\u2019t of Transportation v D &amp; T Construction Co), </em>209 Mich App 336; 530 NW2d 183 (1995), the court said that it was required to consider the eight factors listed in MRPC 1.5(a) in determining the reasonableness of fees under the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court adopted the mdot\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>analysis of the eight factors as its own and appended them to its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">It cited <em>Howard v Canteen Corp, </em>192 Mich App 427; 481 NW2d 718 (1991), overruled in part on other grounds <em>Rafferty v Markovitz, </em>461 Mich 265; 602 NW2d 367 (1999), and <em>Rode v Dellarciprete, </em>892 F2d 1177 (CA 3, 1990), as persuasive authority that reasonable hours multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate is the preferred method of calculating attorney fees under fee-shifting statutes. The court also listed other principles and facts that it considered in determining reasonable attorney fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>The court said that awarding one-third of the difference between the judgment and the offer on the basis of the contingent fee agreement was unreasonable. Rather, $165 an hour for 728.2 hours was more closely connected to the extent of the services actually performed, and compensated counsel at the top of mid-Michigan attorney fee ranges. The court determined that the award gave defendants the benefit of the doubt regarding the reasonableness of professional time spent, but did not reward defendants for unreasonable expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\">The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-5\">The Court recognizes that this ruling will leave Defendants solely responsible for the majority of their attorney fees. Such is the nature of a contingent fee agreement. Defendants retained Ms. Bergamini, full of hope that she would obtain an excellent verdict for them, which she did. They are clearly better off than they would have been had they accepted Plaintiff\u2019s initial offer. Defendants may argue that they have not been \u201cmade whole\u201d by this decision, but they must recognize that the ucpa provides for an award of \u201creasonable\u201d attorney fees, not \u201cactual\u201d attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">The Court of Appeals majority found no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s fee award. It said that sometimes the purposes of the attorney fee provision of the statute are best served by giving an award that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>is based on a contingency fee agreement. However, the Court explained that the existence of such a contract does not mandate the award of the fee on that basis. Consideration of the eight factors in MRPC 1.5 preclude reliance on such a single formula or method. The Court could find no basis for disturbing the trial court\u2019s determination that basing the award on the contingent fee agreement would have resulted in an unreasonably large fee relative to the work performed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">On appeal, defendants contend that the Court of Appeals and the trial court did not give adequate weight to the purposes of the statutory provision allowing an award of attorney fees. They point to earlier Court of Appeals decisions that have identified three such purposes. See, e.g., <em>In re Condemnation of Private Property for Hwy Purposes (Dep\u2019t of Transportation v Curis), </em>221 Mich App 136, 142-143; 561 NW2d 459 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-7\">[TJhis Court has identified three purposes of the attorney fee provision of the ucpa. First, awarding attorney'fees will assure that the property owner receives the full amount of the award, placing the owner in as good a position as that occupied before the taking. <em>Dep\u2019t of Transportation v Robinson, </em>193 Mich App 638, 645; 484 NW2d 777 (1992). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Second, the fee structure penalizes agents of a condemnor for deliberately low offers because a low offer may result in the condemnor paying the owner\u2019s litigation expenses as well as its own. <em>Flint v Patel, </em>198 Mich App 153, 157; 497 NW2d 542 (1993); <em>Robinson, supra, </em>p 645. Third, the fee provision provides a performance incentive to the owner\u2019s attorney, because the fee awarded is directly proportional to the results achieved by counsel. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-3\">See also <em>Bay City v Surath, </em>170 Mich App 139; 428 NW2d 9 (1988); <em>Dep\u2019t of Transportation v DiMatteo, </em>136 Mich App 15, 18; 355 NW2d 622 (1984); <em>Detroit v J Cusmano &amp; Sons, Inc, </em>184 Mich App 507; 459 NW2d 3 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">We find no need to consider the Legislature\u2019s supposed rationale in enacting subsection 16(3) because, as explained below, the statutory language is clear and unambiguous and therefore must be applied as written. <em>Northern Concrete Pipe, Inc v Sinacola Companies\u2014Midwest, Inc, </em>461 Mich 316, 320; 603 NW2d 257 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Subsection 16(3) mandates reimbursement \u201cin whole or in part\u201d of the \u201cowner\u2019s reasonable attorney fees.\u201d The statute gives the trial court discretion to determine \u201c[t]he reasonableness of the owner\u2019s attorney fees.\u201d Giving effect to all of subsection 16(3), there are <em>two </em>discretionary decisions that the trial court must make in ordering reimbursement of attorney fees under subsection 16(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">Initially, the court must determine whether the \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d attorney fees are \u201creasonable.\u201d In this respect, subsection 16(3) differs from other fee-shifting statutes that simply authorize the trial court to award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>\u201creasonable attorney fees\u201d without regard to the fees actually charged. For example, under the Michigan Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2802; MSA 3.548(802), the trial court is not required to make a finding regarding the reasonableness of the attorney fees being charged to the plaintiff; instead, the court is free to award <em>any </em>fee as long as it is reasonable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, under subsection 16(3), the focus of the reasonableness determination clearly is on the <em>owner\u2019s </em>attorney fees. Indeed, subsection 16(3) specifically requires \u201creimbursement\u201d of those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">In making this reasonableness determination, the trial court should consider the eight factors listed in MRPC 1.5(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the trial court determines that the owner\u2019s attorney fees are <em>unreasonable, </em>it should utilize its discretion to determine what amount of the owner\u2019s requested attorney fees should be reimbursed by the agency.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>In those cases in which the trial court finds the owner\u2019s attorney fees to be <em>reasonable, </em>subsection 16(3) gives the trial court <em>additional </em>discretion to order reimbursement of those fees \u201cin whole or in part.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Once the trial court has determined the owner\u2019s attorney fees to be reasonable utilizing the factors in MRPC 1.5(a), the trial court should consider, for fee-shifting purposes and in its discretion, whether the condemning agency should be required to reimburse the entire amount of the owner\u2019s reasonable attorney fees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court must articulate the reasons for its decision in order to facilitate appellate review.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, any order of reimbursement is, of course, subject to the statutory maximum: one-third of the amount by which the ultimate award exceeds the agency\u2019s written offer. MCL 213.66(3); MSA 8.265(16)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">We recognize that, under the plain language of subsection 16(3), trial courts can and will reach different decisions concerning reimbursement of attorney fees. However, that is the nature of discretionary decisions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>The key in each case is that the trial court provide a reasoned basis for its decision. As we explained in <em>Alken-Ziegler v Waterbury Headers Corp, </em>461 Mich 219, 227-228; 600 NW2d 638 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-5\">An abuse of discretion involves far more than a difference in judicial opinion. <em>Williams v Hofley Mfg Co, </em>430 Mich 603, 619; 424 NW2d 278 (1988). It has been said that such abuse occurs only when the result is \u201cso palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason but rather of passion or bias.\u201d <em>Marrs v Bd of Medicine, </em>422 Mich 688, 694; 374 NW2d 321 (1985), quoting <em>Spalding v Spalding, </em>355 Mich 382, 384-385; 94 NW2d 810 (1959), and noting that, although the <em>Spalding </em>standard has been often discussed and frequently paraphrased, it has remained essentially intact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">In the instant case, although the trial court found defendant\u2019s requested fees to be \u201cunreasonable,\u201d the court did not properly begin its analysis by considering whether the attorney fee actually charged to defendants was reasonable under MRPC 1.5(a). Instead, it is apparent that the court was focused on determining what it believed to be an appropriate fee award under the circumstances without respect to the attorney fee actually charged to defendants. Again, a trial court has discretion to make such an independent determination, but only after the court has determined either (1) that the owner\u2019s attorney fees are unreasonable, or (2) that only \u201cpart\u201d of the owner\u2019s otherwise reasonable attorney fees should be reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>bursed by the agency. MCL 213.66(3); MSA 8.265(16)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">Because the trial court utilized the wrong legal framework in considering defendants\u2019 request for reimbursement of its attorney fees under subsection 16(3), we vacate the trial court\u2019s order and remand this case to the trial court for reconsideration of its decision in light of this opinion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b1065-5\">Weaver, C.J., and Cavanagh, Taylor, Corrigan, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b1065-6\">Kelly, J., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1055-8\"> 228 Mich App 91; 576 NW2d 719 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1055-9\"> MCL 213.51 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 8.265(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1055-10\"> MCL 213.55; MSA 8.265(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1056-8\"> MCL 213.66; MSA 8.265(16).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1056-9\"> See, e.g., <em>Howard v Canteen Corp, 192 </em>Mich <em>App 427, </em>439; 481 NW2d 718 (1991), overruled in part on other grounds <em>Rafferty v Markovitz, </em>461 Mich 265; 602 NW2d 367 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1057-6\"> Section 16 was amended by 1996 PA 474, effective December 26, 1996. An additional sentence was added to subsection (3) covering the treatment of attorney fees awarded as sanctions under MCR 2.403 or 2.405. In addition, two other subsections were added dealing with the authority to pay reasonable attorney fees and witnesses\u2019 fees in connection with a settlement, and providing that the agency has no obligation to reimburse attorney fees or expert witness fees that are attributable to unsuccessful challenges to necessity or the validity of the proceedings. See MCL 213.66(4), (6); MSA 8.265(16)(4), (6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1057-7\"> That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-8\">Rule 1.5 Fees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-9\">(a) A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee.

The dissent argued that an award based on a contingency fee is in accord with subsection 16(3), and nothing in the statutes or case law make such a fee unreasonable. The dissent believed that the trial court\u2019s award failed to recognize one of the major policy concerns behind the attorney fee provision of the ucpa\u2014that the property owners would not receive the full amount of the jury\u2019s award because they would be responsible for the majority of the attorney fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1062-6\"> Thus far, trial courts and, in turn, the Court of Appeals, have applied subsection 16(3) in a similar manner. Rather than beginning with the question whether the attorney fees that the owner has agreed to pay are reasonable for purposes of MRPC 1.5(a), trial courts have instead focused upon determining what amount of attorney fees should ultimately be awarded to the owner. See, e.g., <em>Curis, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1062-7\"> The weight to be given the factors requires exercise of discretion by the trial court. The existence of a contingent fee contract may, of course, be considered. Indeed, it is specifically listed in MRPC 1.5(a) as being one of the factors to consider. However, we reject defendants\u2019 argument that a one-third contingency fee is presumptively reasonable. We likewise reject the mdot\u2019s argument that the \u201clodestar\u201d method is the \u201cpreferred\u201d way of determining the reasonableness of requested attorney fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1062-8\"> We note that a trial court\u2019s determination under subsection 16(3) that the owner\u2019s attorney fees are unreasonable does not necessarily mean that the owner\u2019s fees are \u201cclearly excessive\u201d in violation of MRPC 1.5(a).
