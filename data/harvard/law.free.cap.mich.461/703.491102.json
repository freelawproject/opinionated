Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"A9d\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">In February 1993, plaintiff attended a three-week class provided by albat in which he was instructed regarding how to climb a wooden utility pole using equipment designed for that purpose. At the end of the course, plaintiff purchased from albat the equipment that he had used during the course. This equipment consisted of a body belt, gaffs, and a pole strap. The body belt is a leather belt designed for holding tools. It also has metal \u201cd\u201d rings to which the pole strap can be connected. The pole strap is designed to go around the pole and attach to the climber\u2019s body belt. The pole strap supports the climber when he leans backward. Gaffs are spikes that are strapped to the climber\u2019s legs to aid in climbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Shortly after completing the three-week climbing course, plaintiff was hired by the Hydaker-Wheatlake Company as an apprentice linesman. On April 3, 1993, plaintiff was working on a utility pole in Alma, Michigan. While in the process of descending the pole, he fell to the ground from a height of sixty feet, receiving serious injuries. In his deposition, plaintiff acknowledged that he does not remember anything about the fall or exactly how it happened. However, it apparently is undisputed that, at the time of his fall, he had disconnected his pole strap in order to maneuver around a \u201ccross bar\u201d that extended from the pole. There also is no dispute that the applicable climbing method taught by albat involved the climber unhooking his pole strap from the \u201cd\u201d ring on his body belt, moving past the obstacle, and then rehooking the strap around the pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Plaintiff subsequently filed suit against albat, among others. Plaintiffs first amended complaint set forth two counts against albat, which significantly overlapped. Count m, labeled \u201cNegligence,\u201d alleged in relevant part that albat was negligent in supplying inappropriate climbing equipment and also in failing to provide adequate instructions, education, and warning regarding pole climbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">Count IV was labeled \u201cBreach of Implied Warranty.\u201d It alleged that albat breached express or implied warranties by selling plaintiff equipment that was improperly designed, manufactured, and sold, that was supplied without adequate warnings and instructions, and that was supplied without independent fall arrest equipment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Albat moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (C)(10), arguing that it had no duty to supply plaintiff with additional equipment. Albat further argued that plaintiffs claim that it failed to provide adequate instruction regarding pole climbing was a claim for educational malpractice that, according to <em>Nalepa v Plymouth-Canton Community School Dist, </em>207 Mich App 580; 525 NW2d 897 (1994), was not a recognized cause of action in Michigan. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint against albat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The Court of Appeals, in a split opinion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Citing <em>Antcliff v State Employees Credit </em>Union, 414 Mich 624, 639-640; 327 NW2d 814 (1982), the Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the trial court properly dismissed plaintiff\u2019s claim sounding in products liability because albat had no duty to instruct or warn that the pole strap it sold to plaintiff as a component part would be safer if used in conjunction with fall arrest equipment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">However, the Court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claim that albat was negligent for failing to provide adequate instruction regarding utility pole climbing. Although the Court of Appeals majority recognized that claims of so-called \u201ceducational malpractice\u201d are widely disfavored, it believed plaintiff\u2019s claim to be one of \u201csimple negligence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-6\">This is not a case in which a plaintiff has alleged a failure in the overall educational program of an educational entity. Plaintiff is not asking the court to interfere with the purely academic decisions of an educational entity, to make judgments about the quality of broad educational policies, or to evaluate the overall quality of his education. Instead, plaintiff has made a very precise claim against a commercial vocational training entity based upon that entity\u2019s alleged failure to instruct him on the proper methods and techniques of maneuvering around an obstacle on a utility pole ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Judge Gage dissented. She argued that plaintiff \u201calleges failure to adequately instruct him on procedure and safety\u201d and that such claims \u201clie within the area recognized as educational malpractice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 460 Mich 851 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">H. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The central issue in this case is one of law: whether claims sounding in educational malpractice should be recognized in Michigan. We decide questions of law de novo. <em>Cardinal Mooney High School v Michigan High School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>437 Mich 75, 80; 467 NW2d 21 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">m. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">As an initial matter, we wish to emphasize what our decision in this case does <em>not </em>address. In his appellate brief, plaintiff argues that albat had a duty arising out of the <em>sale of the climbing equipment </em>to ensure that he was thoroughly versed in all the uses and limitations of that equipment. The problem with that theory, however, is that it was already rejected by the Court of Appeals when it affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary disposition to ALBAT on plaintiff\u2019s claim \u201csounding in products liability.\u201d Whatever the merits of that decision, we denied plaintiff\u2019s cross-application for leave to appeal. 460 Mich 851 (1999).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the only issue that is now before us involves plaintiff\u2019s alternate claim that, by offering the three-week course that plaintiff at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>tended, albat assumed a duty to teach him the fundamentals of pole climbing and that it was negligent in failing to instruct him about how to do so safely.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">A. EDUCATIONAL MALPRACTICE DEFINED</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\"><em>Peter W v San Francisco Unified School Dist, </em>60 Cal App 3d 814; 131 Cal Rptr 854 (1976), is considered to be the seminal case in the area of so-called \u201ceducational malpractice.\u201d There, the eighteen-year-old plaintiff sued his school district for, among other things, negligently failing to teach him \u201cbasic academic skills such as reading and writing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818. Refusing to recognize a cause of action for what it characterized as \u201ceducational malfeasance,\u201d the California court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-8\">On occasions when the Supreme Court has opened or sanctioned new areas of tort liability, it has noted that the wrongs and injuries involved were both comprehensible and assessable within the existing judicial framework. . . . This is simply not true of wrongful conduct and injuries allegedly involved in educational malfeasance. Unlike the activity of the highway or the marketplace, classroom methodology affords no readily acceptable standards of care, or cause, or injury. The science of pedagogy itself is fraught with different and conflicting theories of how or what a child should be taught, and any layman might\u2014and commonly does\u2014have his own emphatic views on the subject. The \u201cinjury\u201d claimed here is plaintiff\u2019s inability to read and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>write. Substantial professional authority attests that the achievement of literacy in the schools, or its failure, are influenced by a host of factors which affect the pupil subjectively, from outside the formal teaching process, and beyond the control of its ministers. They may be physical, neurological, emotional, cultural, environmental; they may be present but not perceived, recognized but not identified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-5\">We find in this situation no conceivable \u201cworkability of a rule of care\u201d against which defendants\u2019 alleged conduct may be measured ... , no reasonable \u201cdegree of certainty that . . . plaintiff suffered injury\u201d within the meaning of the law of negligence . . . , and no such perceptible \u201cconnection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the iiyury suffered,\u201d as alleged, which would establish a causal link between them within the same meaning. <em>[Id. </em>at 824-825 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\"><em>Peter W </em>represents the \u201cclassic\u201d case of educational malpractice in which a public school is alleged to have failed to adequately instruct a student in basic academic skills. Such claims, including those directed at institutions of higher learning, are uniformly disfavored.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Courts have also considered and rejected educational malpractice claims arising out of an alleged misdiagnosis of learning disabilities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Various public policy grounds have been advanced by those courts that have refused to recognize claims of educational malpractice, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-6\">(1) the lack of a satisfactory standard of care by which to evaluate an educator; (2) the inherent uncertainties about causation and the nature of damages in light of such intervening factors as a student\u2019s attitude, motivation, temperament, past experience, and home environment; (3) the potential for a flood of litigation against schools; and (4) the possibility that such claims will \u201cembroil the courts into overseeing the day-to-day operations of schools.\u201d <em>[Alsides v Brown Institute, Ltd, </em>592 NW2d 468, 472 (Minn App, 1999) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">These and other related public policy grounds have also been cited by various courts that have declined to impose liability on proprietary and trade schools for educational malpractice. In <em>Cavaliere v Duff\u2019s Business Inst, </em>413 Pa Super 357; 605 A2d 397 (1992), the Pennsylvania court upheld the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for educational malpractice brought against a court reporting school. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-8\">The concerns that are clearly appropriate in the case of an academic institution are equally raised by an attempt to inquire into the sufficiency of teaching methods at a trade or business school like the Institute. This court would be hard pressed to determine which of several alternative methods of teaching court reporting, or auto repair, or any other specialized business or trade skill was the appropriate one. Nor would it be an easy task to determine why a particular student failed to acquire certain skills after pursuing a course of instruction aimed at teaching those skills. <em>[Id. </em>at 369.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">Similarly, in <em>Tolman v CenCor Career Colleges, Inc, </em>851 P2d 203 (Colo App, 1992), aff\u2019d 868 P2d 396 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>(Colo, 1994), the Colorado court upheld the dismissal of educational malpractice claims brought by nineteen former students of a vocational school for medical and dental assistants. The court relied on the following public policy rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-5\">Since education is a collaborative and subjective process whose success is largely reliant on the student, and since the existence of such outside factors as a student\u2019s attitude and abilities render it impossible to establish any quality or curriculum deficiencies as a proximate cause to any injuries, we rule that there is no workable standard of care here and defendant would face an undue burden if forced to litigate its selection of curriculum and teaching methods. <em>[Id. </em>at 205.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">B. VIABILITY OF EDUCATIONAL MALPRACTICE CLAIMS IN MICHIGAN</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Our own Court of Appeals has also considered and rejected claims of educational malpractice. In <em>Johnson v </em>Clark, 165 Mich App 366, 367; 418 NW2d 466 (1987), the plaintiff, who had dyslexia and, as a high school graduate, could only read at the fourth-grade level, sued his teachers and the school psychologist, principal, and administrator, alleging that the \u201cdefendants\u2019 failure to properly perform annual tests and evaluations required by . . . statute and regulations promulgated thereunder resulted in plaintiff\u2019s failure to learn that he suffered from dyslexia.\u201d The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of the defendants on the ground that there was no common-law duty requiring teachers to properly test and evaluate special education students. <em>Id. </em>at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>In <em>Nalepa, supra </em>at 583, aff'd on other grounds 450 Mich 934 (1995),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the plaintiffs\u2019 second-grade son committed suicide after viewing a movie at school in which a young boy attempts suicide by hanging himself. The plaintiffs\u2019 son hanged himself by a belt from the safety rail of the upper bunk bed in his bedroom. The plaintiffs sued various teachers and counselors, among others, alleging that they were negligent in showing such a film to second-graders. Dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the Court of Appeals held that \u201callegations that teachers and faculty used improper materials and techniques to teach children amount to claims of teacher malpractice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. The Court cited <em>Johnson </em>for the proposition that a teacher\u2019s common-law liability for a student\u2019s injuries caused by the teacher \u201cdoes not extend to educational malpractice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">In reaching its decision, the <em>Nalepa </em>Court relied on the same public policy grounds commonly cited by those courts that have refused to recognized claims of educational malpractice. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-6\">The rationale for declining to recognize claims of teacher malpractice stems from the collaborative nature of the teaching process. See <em>Ross v Creighton Univ, </em>740 F Supp 1319, 1328 (ND Ill, 1990), aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d and remanded in part on other grounds 957 F2d 410 (CA 7, 1992). For a positive result to obtain, both teacher and student must work together. The ultimate responsibility for what is learned, however, remains with the student, and many considerations, beyond teacher misfeasance, can factor into whether a student receives the intended message. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>Id. </em>Further, teaching methods vary, and what is considered appropriate by some, may be considered inappropriate by others. Thus, because both the educational process and the result are subjective, there exists a practical impossibility of proving whether the alleged malpractice caused the complained-of injury. <em>Id. [Id. </em>at 594-595.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The Court also found several other \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d to be applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-6\">Even if the harm appears to flow from the alleged malpractice, for public policy reasons, we would still decline to recognize a duty. We agree with the Supreme Court of Wisconsin\u2019s statement in another educational malpractice case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7cM\">\u201cEven where the chain of causation is complete and direct, recovery may sometimes be denied on grounds of public policy because (1) the injury is too remote from the negligence; or (2) the injury is too wholly out of proportion to the culpability of the negligent tortfeasor; or (3) in retrospect it appears too highly extraordinary that the negligence should have brought about the harm; or (4) because allowance of recovery would place too unreasonable a burden [on the defendant]; or (5) because allowance of recovery would be too likely to open the way for fraudulent claims; or (6) allowance of recovery would enter a field that has no sensible or just stopping point.\u201d <em>[Wilson v Continental Ins Cos, </em>87 Wis 2d 310, 323-324; 274 NW2d 679 (1979), quoting <em>Rieck v Medical Protective Co, </em>64 Wis 2d 514, 517-518; 219 NW2d 242 (1974).] <em>[Id. </em>at 595.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">We agree with and adopt as our own the reasoning employed by those courts that have declined to recognize a cause of action for educational malpractice, whether those claims are brought against public schools, institutions of higher learning, or private proprietary and trade schools. We therefore hold that claims sounding in educational malpractice, that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>claims alleging negligent instruction, are not cognizable in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">C. PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">As stated, the essence of plaintiffs claim is that, by offering the three-week course that he attended, ALBAT assumed a duty to teach him the fundamentals of pole climbing and that it was negligent in failing to instruct plaintiff regarding how to do so safely. Plaintiff maintains that climbing with a pole strap alone is unsafe and that albat should also have instructed him regarding the use of independent fall arrest equipment. We conclude that plaintiff\u2019s claim, properly characterized, is one of educational malpractice. Because plaintiff\u2019s claim is legally deficient, it was properly dismissed under MCR 2.116(C)(8) (failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Plaintiff would have the courts second-guess albat\u2019s decision to teach pole climbing using the particular methods it chose. However, plaintiff\u2019s claim illustrates the inherent difficulty in attempting to define the applicable standard of care in these types of cases. Plaintiff argues that albat was negligent because it failed to instruct him that he should not climb utility poles without using fall arrest equipment. Albat, on the other hand, argues that it had no responsibility to do so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We decline to become em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>broiled in the task of determining whether a trade school such as albat should be held liable in tort for failing to teach specific methods of climbing. It would be practically impossible to determine the precise scope of albat\u2019s undertaking. How much was albat required to teach?</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Moreover, as is typical in educational malpractice cases, any connection between plaintiff\u2019s injury and the alleged negligence on the part of albat is remote at best. Even assuming that albat was found to have breached a duty to teach plaintiff every available method of pole climbing, a jury could only speculate about whether such negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s fall and resulting injury. Plaintiff\u2019s injury was far removed in time and place from albat\u2019s three-week course. Indeed, plaintiff was subsequently hired by the Hydaker-Wheatlake Company to perform work on utility poles. Hydaker-Wheatlake, in turn, presumably exercised independent judgment regarding plaintiff\u2019s abilities. In any event, albat certainly was not in a position to ensure that plaintiff would make proper use of the instruction he received. Allowing individuals such as plaintiff to assert claims of negligent instruction would avoid the practical reality that, in the end, it is the student who is responsible for his knowledge, including the limits of that knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"Af4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">For all the reasons stated, we hold that claims alleging negligent instruction, whether those claims are brought against public schools, institutions of higher learning, or private proprietary and trade schools, are not cognizable in Michigan. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary disposition to ALBAT.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1014-6\">Weaver, C.J., and Taylor, Corrigan, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-7\"> Fall arrest equipment, consisting primarily of a harness and lanyard, remains anchored to the pole itself to prevent a fall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1003-8\"> Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued June 5, 1998 (Docket No. 200788).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1004-8\"> The Court characterized plaintiffs products liability claim as encompassing his allegations \u201cthat the equipment was improperly designed and manufactured, that defendant sold the equipment without adequate warnings and instructions, and that defendant failed to supply the equipment with a fall arrest system which is designed to suspend a worker in the air in the event of a fall.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1005-8\"> Despite this fact, the dissent repeatedly relies on plaintiffs allegations grounded in products liability.

It identified plaintiff\u2019s claim as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-5\">a very precise claim against a commercial vocational training entity based upon that entity\u2019s alleged failure to instruct him on the proper methods and techniques of maneuvering around an obstacle on a utility pole . . . with equipment sold to him by defendant. Plaintiff testified that the manner in which he attempted to negotiate the obstacle was the only method taught to him by defendant, and plaintiff\u2019s expert testified that plaintiff should have been instructed in the use of a second pole strap, which would have prevented the accident. In short, plaintiff has made a claim sounding in simple negligence, not educational malpractice, in which plaintiff must prove duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and damages. The public policy considerations that have caused courts to conclude that educational malpractice claims are not cognizable are absent in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">In plaintiff\u2019s answer to albat\u2019s application for leave to appeal to this Court, plaintiff explained his negligence count against albat as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-7\">Michigan law recognizes that accompanying every contract is a common law duty to perform with ordinary care the thing agreed to be done, and that a negligent performance constitutes a tort as well as a breach of contract. <em>Clark v Dalman, </em>379 Mich 251, 261 [150 NW2d 755] (1967). Here Plaintiff contracted with albat to provide him with the fundamentals of working as a lineman, not least of which encompassed learning how to climb and descend telephone poles safely. Defendant had a duty to use due care in performing their [sic] obligations under this contract. Defendant, under these arrangements, should not be allowed to later claim that its negligent performance of its duties, its failure to properly instruct how to climb poles or use equipment, is shielded from liability under the rubric of \u201ceducational malpractice.\u201d Defendant\u2019s activities here are far removed from the type of curriculum decision making and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>professional guidance that this doctrine was intended to protect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-4\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-5\">Plaintiff makes a precise claim that Defendant failed to properly instruct him in the use of equipment it sold to him. This claim is one of simple negligence ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-7\">Our negligence claim against Defendant relates to the specific equipment Defendant sold to Plaintiff and how Plaintiff was instructed to use this equipment. . . . The information conveyed by Defendant about the use of the equipment Defendant supplied to Plaintiff was wrong, and it is that information which forms the basis of Plaintiff\u2019s negligence complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">Finally, at oral argument before this Court, plaintiff stated he was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-9\">not looking at or criticizing what was or was not done with regard to training but what was or was not done in relation to the supply of equipment given the fact that at the very least indicating that the training that they provided violated the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">Our review of the Court of Appeals decision on a trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition is de novo. <em>Spiek v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>456 Mich 331, 337; 572 NW2d 201 (1998). \u201cBecause we are reviewing a summary disposition in favor of the defendant, we accept as true the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co v Used Car Factory, Inc, </em>461 Mich 210, 212, n 2; 600 NW2d 630 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"A1Z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>n. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">I agree with the Court of Appeals that plaintiff has made a distinct claim of negligence that does not fall within the disfavored realm of educational malpractice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[N]egligence is conduct involving an unreasonable risk of harm.\u201d <em>Schultz v Consumers Power Co, </em>443 Mich 445, 449; 506 NW2d 175 (1993). A prima facie claim of negligence contains a sufficient allegation that (1) the defendant was negligent, (2) the defendant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant breached that duty, (4) the plaintiff suffered harm, and (5) the defendant\u2019s breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s harm. <em>Id. </em>at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">In educational malpractice cases the claim is simply that the educational institution failed to provide a quality education<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or that it used improper materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>or techniques to teach children. <em>Nalepa v Plymouth-Canton Community School Dist, </em>207 Mich App 580, 594; 525 NW2d 897 (1994). The rationale for rejecting such claims rests on policy reasons not implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">The majority quotes <em>Alsides v Brown Institute, Ltd,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to provide four policy reasons for rejecting educational malpractice cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-6\">(1) the lack of a satisfactory standard of care by which to evaluate an educator; (2) the inherent uncertainties about causation and the nature of damages in light of such intervening factors as a student\u2019s attitude, motivation, temperament, past experience, and home environment; (3) the potential for a flood of litigation against schools; and (4) the possibility that such claims will \u201cembroil the courts into overseeing the day-to-day operations of schools.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">The policy reasons cited in <em>Alsides </em>are not implicated here. First, there is a standard of care by which to evaluate the instruction plaintiff received. Plaintiff was taught a particular skill that utilized equipment albat provided to him. The manufacturer of the equipment wrote instructions telling how the equipment safely could be used. Thus, the manufacturer could testify at trial whether the instruction given was accurate. Furthermore, experienced users of the equipment are available to testify whether the method taught by albat was proper. Because such testimony is not ordinarily available in a traditional educational setting, it is difficult to establish a standard of care there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">In this case, by contrast, that testimony is available for a jury to consider. Hence, it can determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>whether albat\u2019s instruction was reasonable in light of the standard of care provided by users and the manufacturer of pole climbing equipment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Second, causation can be established under the facts of this case. Plaintiff alleged that, when he fell, he was following albat\u2019s instructions for maneuvering around an obstacle. He did not allege that albat failed to properly teach him the method it advocated. Rather, he alleged that he learned albat\u2019s technique, followed it, and was injured because the technique albat taught was wrong. There is no need to evaluate plaintiff\u2019s \u201cattitude, motivation, temperament, past experience, [or] home environment\u201d in order to determine why plaintiff did not learn what he was taught. Plaintiff did learn what he was taught. He has alleged that what he was taught was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Plaintiff claimed that \u201cat the time of the incident, [he] was descending the utility pole with equipment in the manner prescribed by [albat] and, in the process of descending around the cross-arms, sustained serious and permanent injuries.\u201d Thus, accepting plaintiff\u2019s allegation as true, but for albat\u2019s improper instructions, plaintiff would not have fallen. On remand, albat would be free to introduce testimony or evidence that plaintiff was not following the technique that he was taught. At this time there is no indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>cation in the record of any intervening causes that would supersede albat\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Third, there is no danger of a flood of litigation against schools as a result of a remand in this case. The allegation here is not a simple one concerning the quality of education received. Instead, plaintiff makes a specific claim regarding instruction about how to climb poles using a particular piece of equipment that albat provided him. There are standards by which albat\u2019s instruction can be gauged. See p 723. Thus, this case is distinct from the type of educational malpractice case that could result in a flood of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Fourth, there is no danger that allowing this case to proceed will result in courts becoming embroiled in overseeing the day-to-day operations of schools. On remand, a jury would consider whether the method taught by albat for using the pole climbing equipment was consistent with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and the experience of users. There would be no need for a court to engage itself in independently overseeing the operation of the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">The majority cites <em>Cavaliere v Duff\u2019s Business Inst, </em>413 Pa Super 357, 369; 605 A2d 397 (1992), in which that court applied policy reasons similar to those referenced above to preclude an action for educational malpractice against a court-reporting school:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-8\">The concerns that are clearly appropriate in the case of an academic institution are equally raised by an attempt to inquire into the sufficiency of teaching methods at a trade or business school like the Institute. This court would be hard pressed to determine which of several alternative methods of teaching court reporting, or auto repair, or any other specialized business or trade skill was the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>one. Nor would it be an easy task to determine why a particular student failed to acquire certain skills after pursuing a course of instruction aimed at teaching those skills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">The policy reasons cited by the <em>Cavaliere </em>court, similar to those cited by the <em>Alsides </em>court, are not implicated here. This case involves teaching a student how to use a particular piece of equipment and is distinct from a case involving general instruction. A jury has a standard of care to use in determining whether what was taught was reasonable. Accordingly, it would not be \u201chard pressed\u201d to determine whether the method taught by albat was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Furthermore, there is no reason why one would have to inquire why plaintiff did not acquire certain skills. Plaintiff is not alleging that he failed to acquire the skills that albat purported to teach.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Finally, the majority also refers to the policy reasons cited by our Court of Appeals in <em>Nalepa, supra </em>at 594-595, to support its holding that plaintiff cannot sustain his case in Michigan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-8\">The rationale for declining to recognize claims of teacher malpractice stems from the collaborative nature of the teaching process. For a positive result to obtain, both teacher and student must work together. The ultimate responsibility for what is learned, however, remains with the student, and many considerations beyond teacher misfeasance, can factor into whether a student receives the intended message. Further, teaching methods vary, and what is considered appropriate by some, may be considered inappropriate by others. Thus, because both the educational process and the result are subjective, there exists a practi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>cal impossibility of proving whether the alleged malpractice caused the complained-of injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-5\">Even if the harm appears to flow from the alleged malpractice, for public policy reasons, we would still decline to recognize a duty. We agree with the Supreme Court of Wisconsin\u2019s statement in another educational malpractice case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A03q\">\u201cEven where the chain of causation is complete and direct, recovery may sometimes be denied on grounds of public policy because (1) the injury is too remote from the negligence; or (2) the injury is too wholly out of proportion to the culpability of the negligent tortfeasor; or (3) in retrospect it appears too highly extraordinary that tire negligence should have brought about the harm; or (4) because allowance of recovery would place too unreasonable a burden [on the defendant]; or (5) because allowance of recovery would be too likely to open the way for fraudulent claims; or (6) allowance of recovery would enter a field that has no sensible or just stopping point.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">I will address each of those policy rationales in turn and show that, like those cited by the courts in <em>Alsides </em>and <em>Cavaliere, </em>this case does not implicate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">First, in this case the injury is not too remote from albat\u2019s alleged negligent pole climbing instruction. Plaintiff allegedly fell while following albat\u2019s training method. Plaintiff\u2019s injury is a normal consequence of the situation created by albat\u2019s alleged improper instruction. Thus, the injury should have been foreseeable to albat and was not too remote from albat\u2019s conduct to be actionable. See <em>Moning v Alfono, </em>400 Mich 425, 442; 254 NW2d 759 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Second, the injury is not out of proportion to the culpability of albat. A duty to exercise reasonable care arises when it is foreseeable that an actor\u2019s conduct may create a risk of harm to the victim. See <em>Schultz, supra </em>at 451-452; <em>Moning, supra </em>at 439. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Here, it was foreseeable that defendant\u2019s alleged failure to properly instruct plaintiff could result in plaintiff falling and suffering injuries. Thus, albat had a duty to instruct plaintiff in the proper manner of climbing poles and using the equipment it provided him. Albat\u2019s alleged breach of its duty caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Therefore, the harm that resulted is not out of proportion with the culpability of albat in breaching its duty to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Third, there is nothing highly extraordinary about what took place in this case. As demonstrated above, it is clear that, if albat\u2019s instruction was improper, it could cause the harm that resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Fourth, plaintiff\u2019s recovery would not place an unreasonable burden on albat. If found liable, albat could continue to instruct individuals in pole climbing techniques. However, it would simply be required to follow the guidelines or instructions of the manufacturer or users who were experienced in the equipment albat provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Fifth, remanding this case for trial would not encourage fraudulent claims. Plaintiff will be required at trial to make a showing that albat\u2019s instruction was unreasonable and to prove all the elements of a negligence claim. Absent such a showing, plaintiff will not prevail. This case does not change the typical requirements for bringing a negligence suit. Thus, I do not perceive how allowing this case to continue as a negligence suit would encourage fraudulent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Sixth, there is a sensible and just stopping point. When a plaintiff\u2019s claim violates one or more of the policy considerations provided by the majority, a sensible and just stopping point will have been reached. Here, as demonstrated above, plaintiff is able to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>implicating the policy reasons cited for precluding a case on the basis that it sounds in educational malpractice. Therefore, there is no reason to preclude plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Plaintiffs claim fits well with the confines of a general negligence claim. He is able to demonstrate that albat had a duty to exercise reasonable care in instructing him how to climb poles. That duty arose when albat provided him with pole climbing equipment and took upon itself the task of instructing him how to use it. See pp 727-728.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">In addition, albat\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care arose as a result of the special relationship between the parties. <em>Schultz, supra </em>at 450-451. Plaintiff and albat entered into a contract under which albat was to teach plaintiff how to climb telephone poles. Albat had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the execution of that contract. <em>Clark v Dalman, supra </em>at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">Also, plaintiff sufficiently pleaded the second element of a negligence claim. Plaintiff alleged that (1) albat did not advise plaintiff of a recall of the equipment, (2) albat recommended, demonstrated, and supplied inappropriate linemen\u2019s systems for plaintiff\u2019s use, and (3) albat failed to provide adequate instructions regarding the use of the equipment. We consider these allegations as true for purposes of our review. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co, supra. </em>Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s allegations are sufficient to support his claim that albat breached the duty it owed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Finally, plaintiff sufficiently pleaded the third and fourth elements of his negligence claim. He alleged that his injuries were proximately caused by albat\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Inherent in that allegation is the charge that albat\u2019s negligence caused his injuries without the intervention of any unanticipated or unforeseeable event. See <em>Nielsen v Henry H Stevens, Inc, </em>368 Mich 216; 118 NW2d 397 (1962) (defining proximate cause). To establish proximate cause plaintiff was required to allege facts sufficient to show cause in fact and legal cause. <em>Dedes v Asch, </em>233 Mich App 329; 590 NW2d 605 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Plaintiff alleged that, when he fell, he was following albat\u2019s instructions for maneuvering around an obstacle. Accepting that allegation <em>as </em>true, albat\u2019s improper instructions were the cause in fact of his fall and injuries. But for the improper instructions, plaintiff would not have fallen. Moreover, there is no indication of any intervening causes that would supersede albat\u2019s alleged negligence. Thus, I find that plaintiff made a sufficient showing of proximate cause to sustain his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">m. conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint establishes a prima facie negligence claim, and it should be heard by a jury. His negligence claim is distinct from a claim for educational malpractice and, thus, should not be foreclosed by the application of a doctrine prohibiting claims of educational malpractice. Therefore, I would affirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>the Court of Appeals decision and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1027-5\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-9\"> The majority states that I rely on plaintiffs allegations grounded in products liability to sustain plaintiffs complaint.

In order to train someone to climb poles, it is necessary to instruct in the use of pole climbing equipment. Independent of whether albat had a duty to warn or instruct plaintiff on the use of additional safety equipment, albat had another duly. It was to properly instruct plaintiff how to use the equipment needed to climb poles. See p 729. Plaintiffs negligence claim addresses that duty.
