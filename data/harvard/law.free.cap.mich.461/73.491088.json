We conclude that coparticipants in recreational activities owe each other a duty not to act recklessly. Because the trial court properly concluded that plaintiff could not show that defendant violated this standard, we reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">This case comes to us after a grant of summary disposition for defendant pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10), and therefore we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to plaintiff, she was skating at the Berkley Ice Arena during an \u201copen skating\u201d period when defendant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> then twelve years old, ran into her, knocking her down and causing serious injury to her knee. Plaintiff alleged in her complaint that defendant was skating backwards in a \u201ccareless, reckless, and negligent manner\u201d at the time of the collision. In Oakland Circuit Court, plaintiff sued defendant Halley Mann, the city of Berkley (the owner of the rink), and an ice arena employee. The city of Berkley and the ice arena employee were eventually dismissed with prejudice by stipulation of the parties. Mann moved for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10) on the grounds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cno negligent acts were carried out by the minor defendant,\u201d and that Mann\u2019s \u201ctouching of the Plaintiff while skating is foreseeable when skating at an ice arena with a number of other skaters as is to be expected.\u201d The trial court granted summary disposition for defendant, finding that an ice rink \u201cis inherently dangerous,\u201d and that \u201cdefendant\u2019s actions were not contrary to the rules governing skating.\u201d Plaintiff appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed, applying an \u201cordinary care\u201d standard and finding a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether defendant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">For purposes of appeal, defendant admits that there is a question of fact regarding whether her conduct was negligent. Similarly, plaintiff has admitted that defendant\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level of recklessness. Thus, the only question before this Court is which standard governs this case: If it is ordinary negligence, we must affirm the Court of Appeals and remand for trial; if it is recklessness, we must reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">MCR 2.116(C)(10) tests the factual support of a plaintiff\u2019s claim. In deciding a motion pursuant to sub-rule (C)(10), the trial court considers the affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, and other documentary evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party to determine whether a genuine issue of any material fact exists to warrant a trial. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>Spiek v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>456 Mich 331, 337; 572 NW2d 201 (1998); <em>Chandler v Dowell Schlumberger, Inc, </em>456 Mich 395, 397; 572 NW2d 210 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">the current state of the law</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Before we begin our review of the law in this area, we must recognize the limitations of the scope of the case before us. First, there is no allegation that defendant intended the contact with plaintiff, or that she intended plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Second, we are not asked to consider the liability of the owner or operator of the ice rink. Thus, our analysis is limited to a determination of the proper standard of care among coparticipants for unintentional conduct in recreational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">A. MICHIGAN LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">We begin by reviewing the current state of Michigan law regarding the appropriate standard of care in the recreational activity context. In one of our older cases, <em>Williams v Wood, </em>260 Mich 322; 244 NW 490 (1932), the plaintiff was injured while fishing. Apparently, the defendant tried to cast but instead hit the plaintiff in the head with the end of his rod, and, in so doing lodged a fish-hook in the plaintiff\u2019s eye. The Court reviewed a number of earlier cases from Michigan and other jurisdictions dealing with various outdoor sports, and eventually concluded that the defendant\u2019s liability was a question of \u201cordinary care\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The general rule that may be deduced from the cases hereinbefore cited is that certain risks of accident attend all outdoor sports and recovery may be had only if an iivjury is the result of negligence that could and should have been avoided by the use of ordinary care. <em>[Id. </em>at 327.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">We note that the Court did not explain the relationship between the risks that \u201cattend all outdoor sports\u201d and a participant\u2019s duty to coparticipants.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">This Court visited a related issue in <em>Felgner v Anderson, </em>375 Mich 23; 133 NW2d 136 (1965). In <em>Feigner, </em>one duck hunter shot another accidentally. The injured hunter sued the shooter for negligence. At trial, the defendant requested that the jury be instructed regarding \u201cassumption of risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. The defendant argued that, by engaging in the activity of hunting, the plaintiff had assumed the risk of being shot accidentally and, therefore, that the defendant should not be held liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The trial court refused to so instruct the jury, and the defendant appealed. This Court then held that the \u201cassumption of risk\u201d doctrine did not apply in most negligence actions, concluding instead that it should only be applied in cases in which an employment relationship existed between the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 55-56. Importantly, before <em>Feigner, </em>the assumption of risk doctrine <em>was </em>available to defendants in ordinary negligence actions. <em>Waltanen v Wiitala, </em>361 Mich 504; 105 NW2d 400 (1960). After <em>Feigner </em>abolished assumption of the risk in this context, some of the published cases began to move away from the \u201cordinary care\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">In <em>Overall v Kadella, </em>138 Mich App 351; 361 NW2d 352 (1984), on which the trial court relied, the plaintiff was injured when the defendant struck him during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>a fight that occurred after an amateur hockey game. The defendant asserted that participants in a hockey game should not be able to sue for injuries incurred during the game, arguing <em>volenti non fit injuria.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court rejected this argument, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">Participation in a game involves a manifestation of consent to those bodily contacts which are permitted by the rules of the game. Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 50, comment b. However, there is general agreement that an intentional act causing injury, which goes beyond what is ordinarily permissible, is an assault and battery for which recovery may be had. 4 Am Jur 2d, Amusements and Exhibitions, \u00a7 86, p 211. <em>[Id. </em>at 357.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Defendant cites <em>Overall </em>for the proposition that a plaintiff involved in a sport may not sue for injuries caused by conduct that is merely negligent. While some of the language in <em>Overall </em>tends to support defendant\u2019s position, <em>Overall </em>involved an intentional act, and, to the extent it suggested a standard for nonintentional acts, it did so only in dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The dicta from <em>Overall </em>became a holding in <em>Higgins v Pfeiffer, </em>215 Mich App 423; 546 NW2d 645 (1996). The plaintiff in <em>Higgins </em>was injured by an errant baseball. Before a game, a pitcher and catcher on the plaintiff\u2019s team were warming up by throwing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>a baseball back and forth. The plaintiff was sitting in the dugout, and the pitcher was throwing toward the dugout. On one particular throw, the ball sailed over the catcher\u2019s head and struck the plaintiff in the eye. The plaintiff sued, and the trial court granted summary disposition for the coach, the pitcher, and the catcher. The Court of Appeals affirmed in a two-to-one decision, with the majority concluding that a participant in a sporting activity \u201cconsents] to the risk of injury inherent in the contest . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Another Court of Appeals case, decided only weeks before <em>Higgins, </em>took a different tack. In <em>Schmidt v Youngs, </em>215 Mich App 222; 544 NW2d 743 (1996), the plaintiff was injured when he was struck by a golf ball. Contrary to the custom of staying behind the ball of the person who is about to hit, the plaintiff had positioned himself some thirty yards in front and to the right of the point where defendant was to play his ball. The defendant shanked the ball and hit the plaintiff. The Court of Appeals affirmed summary disposition for the defendant, quoting Am Jur 2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cA person who engages in the game of golf is not an insurer of the safety of others, and he is only required to exercise ordinary care for the safety of persons reasonably within the range of danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201cGenerally, one who is about to strike a golf ball must, in the exercise of ordinary care, give an adequate and timely notice to those who are unaware of his intention to play and who may be endangered by the play. Conversely, there is no duty to give advance warning to persons who are on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>contiguous holes or fairways, and not in the line of play, if danger to them is not reasonably to be anticipated. Also, where the person injured was in a place where he should have been reasonably safe, and he was aware of the player\u2019s intention to play the ball, an oral or audible warning would have been superfluous and is therefore unnecessary.\u201d [4 Am Jur 2d, Amusements and Exhibitions, \u00a7 87, pp 211-212 (1995 interim pamphlet).] [215 Mich App 225.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Although it affirmed summary disposition for the defendant, the Court in <em>Schmidt </em>applied an ordinary care standard. In doing so, the Court posited that, while one may consent to the inherent risks of being a spectator or participant in a sport, \u201cone does not ordinarily consent to another\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">On the basis of a review of the published cases in Michigan, there seems to be general agreement that participants in recreational activities are not liable for every mishap that results in injury, and that certain risks inhere in all such activities. Our older opinions generally applied an ordinary care standard. However, the more recent cases from the Court of Appeals appear to be divided regarding the level of duty, or the standard of care, owed to coparticipants.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">B. THE LAW IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Other jurisdictions have generally taken one of two approaches to this issue. In a few states, ordinary care continues to be the standard. See <em>Auckenthaler v Grundmeyer, </em>110 Nev 682; 877 P2d 1039 (1994); <em>Lestina v West Bend Mut Ins Co, </em>176 Wis 2d 901; 501 NW2d 28 (1993).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the majority of other jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tions, however, the courts have adopted a \u201creckless or intentional conduct\u201d or a \u201cwilful and wanton or intentional misconduct\u201d standard. See, e.g., <em>Jaworski v Kiernan, </em>241 Conn 399, 408; 696 A2d 332 (1997) (adopting a \u201creckless or intentional conduct\u201d standard in a case involving a coed recreational soccer game); <em>Hoke v Cullinan, </em>914 SW2d 335, 337 (Ky, 1995) (adopting a \u201creckless disregard for the safety of other[s]\u201d standard in a case involving a person hit by a ball between points in a tennis match); <em>Crawn v Campo, </em>136 NJ 494, 497; 643 A2d 600 (1994) (adopting a \u201creckless or intentional\u201d standard in a case involving a pickup softball game); <em>Hathaway v Tascosa Country Club, Inc, </em>846 SW2d 614, 616 (Tex App, 1993) (adopting a \u201creckless or intentional\u201d standard in a case involving a golfer struck by another golfer\u2019s ball); <em>Knight v Jewett, </em>3 Cal 4th 296, 302; 11 Cal Rptr 2d 2; 834 P2d 696 (1992) (adopting a \u201creckless or intentional\u201d standard in a case involving an injury suffered in a touch football game); <em>Marchetti v Kalish, </em>53 Ohio St 3d 95; 559 NE2d 699 (1990) (adopting a \u201creckless or intentional\u201d standard in a case involving children playing \u201ckick the can\u201d); <em>Gauvin v Clark, </em>404 Mass 450, 454; 537 NE2d 94 (1989) (adopting a \u201creckless disregard of safety\u201d standard in a case involving a college hockey game); <em>Turcotte v Fell, </em>68 NY2d 432; 510 NYS2d 49; 502 NE2d 964 (1986) (adopting a \u201creckless or intentional\u201d standard in a case involving a professional jockey injured in a fall during a thoroughbred horse race); <em>Ross v Clouser, </em>637 SW2d 11, 14 (Mo, 1982) (adopting a \u201creckless disregard for the safety of the other player\u201d standard in a case involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ing a slow-pitch, church league softball game).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The cases adopting a recklessness standard have recognized different reasons for departing from the ordinary negligence standard. Some courts have held that a participant \u201cassumes the risk\u201d of the activity: \u201cWe hold that where individuals engage in recreational or sports activities, they assume the ordinary risks of the activity and cannot recover for any injury unless it can be shown that the other participant\u2019s actions were either \u2018reckless\u2019 or \u2018intentional\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Marchetti, supra, </em>53 Ohio St 3d 100. In states where assumption of the risk has been abolished, some courts have held that a participant \u201cconsents\u201d to conduct normally associated with the activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">Traditionally, the participant\u2019s conduct was conveniently analyzed in terms of the defensive doctrine of assumption of risk. With the enactment of the comparative negligence statute, however, assumption of risk is no longer an absolute defense. Thus, it has become necessary, and quite proper, when measuring a defendant\u2019s duty to a plaintiff to consider the risks assumed by the plaintiff. The shift in analysis is proper because the \u201cdoctrine [of assumption of risk] deserves no separate existence (except for express assumption of risk) and is simply a confusing way of stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>certain no-duty rules.\u201d Accordingly, the analysis of care owed to plaintiff in the professional sporting event by a coparticipant and by the proprietor of the facility in which it takes place must be evaluated by considering the risks plaintiff assumed when he elected to participate in the event and how those assumed risks qualified defendants\u2019 duty to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">The risk assumed has been defined a number of ways but in its most basic sense it \u201cmeans that the plaintiff, in advance, has given his . . . consent to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him, and to take his chances of injury from a known risk arising from what the defendant is to do or leave undone. The situation is then the same as where the plaintiff consents to the infliction of what would otherwise be an intentional tort, except that the consent is to run the risk of unintended injury. . . . The result is that the defendant is relieved of legal duty to the plaintiff; and being under no duty, he cannot be charged with negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">As a general rule, participants properly may be held to have consented, by their participation, to those injury-causing events which are known, apparent or reasonably foreseeable consequences of the participation. <em>[Turcotte, supra, </em>68 NY2d 437-439 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Finally, courts have almost universally recognized a policy rationale for an elevated standard of care. Courts have recognized that a fear of litigation could alter the nature of recreational activities and sports: \u201cFear of civil liability stemming from negligent acts occurring in an athletic event could curtail the proper fervor with which the game should be played and discourage individual participation . . . .\u201d <em>Ross, supra, </em>637 SW2d 14.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">One might well conclude that something is terribly wrong with a society in which the most commonly-accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>aspects of play\u2014a traditional source of a community\u2019s conviviality and cohesion\u2014spurs litigation. The heightened recklessness standard recognizes a commonsense distinction between excessively harmful conduct and the more routine rough-and-tumble of sports that should occur freely on the playing fields and should not be second-guessed in courtrooms. <em>[Crawn, supra, </em>136 NJ 508.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Courts have also recognized the potential flood of litigation that might result from the use of an ordinary negligence standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">If simple negligence were adopted as the standard of care, every punter with whom contact is made, every midfielder high sticked, every basketball player fouled, every batter struck by a pitch, and every hockey player tripped would have the ingredients for a lawsuit if injury resulted. When the number of athletic events taking place . . . over the course of a year is considered, there exists the potential for a surfeit of lawsuits when it becomes known that simple negligence, based on an inadvertent violation of a contest rule, will suffice as a ground for recovery for an athletic injury. This should not be encouraged. <em>[Jaworski, supra, </em>241 Conn 409-410.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">We note that the Legislature has yet to modify the common law of torts regarding recreational activities, except in two narrow areas not at issue here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the development of this area of the law, for now, is up to the courts. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 7; <em>Placek v Ster</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>ling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638, 656-657; 275 NW2d 511 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">A. THE NATURE OF RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In developing the common law in this area, we must recognize the everyday reality of participation in recreational activities. A person who engages in a recreational activity is temporarily adopting a set of rules that define that particular pastime or sport. In many instances, the person is also suspending the rules that normally govern everyday life. For example, it would be a breach of etiquette, and possibly the law, to battle with other shoppers for a particularly juicy orange in the grocery store, while it is quite within the rules of basketball to battle for a rebound. Some might find certain sports, such as boxing or football, too rough for their own tastes. However, our society recognizes that there are benefits to recreational activity, and we permit individuals to agree to rules and conduct that would otherwise be prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">There are myriad ways to describe the legal effect of voluntarily participating in a recreational activity. The act of stepping onto the field of play may be described as \u201cconsent to the inherent risks of the activity,\u201d or a participant\u2019s knowledge of the rules of a game may be described as \u201cnotice\u201d sufficient to discharge the other participants\u2019 duty of care.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, participants\u2019 mutual agreement to play a game may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>described as an \u201cimplied contract\u201d between all the participants, or a voluntary participant could be described as \u201cassuming the risks\u201d inherent in the sport. No matter what terms are used, the basic premise is the same: When people engage in a recreational activity, they have voluntarily subjected themselves to certain risks inherent in that activity. When one of those risks results in injury, the participant has no ground for complaint. Justice Cardozo made this point quite eloquently in a case involving a young man injured on a ride at an amusement park:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">One who takes part in such a sport accepts the dangers that inhere in it so far as they are obvious and necessary, just as a fencer accepts the risk of a thrust by his antagonist or a spectator at a ball game the chance of contact with the ball. The antics of the clown are not the paces of the cloistered cleric. The rough and boisterous joke, the horseplay of the crowd, evokes its own guffaws, but they are not the pleasures of tranquillity. The plaintiff was not seeking a retreat for meditation. Visitors were tumbling about the belt to the merriment of onlookers when he made his choice to join them. He took the chance of a like fate, with whatever damage to his body might ensue from such a fall. The timorous may stay at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">Nothing happened to the plaintiff except what common experience tells us may happen at any time as the consequence of a sudden fall. Many a skater or a horseman can rehearse a tale of equal woe. . . . One might as well say that a skating rink should be abandoned because skaters sometimes fall. <em>[Murphy v Steeplechase Amusement Co, </em>250 NY 479, 482-483; 166 NE 173 (1929) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Justice Cardozo\u2019s observations apply just as well to the conduct of coparticipants in a recreational activity as they do to the conduct of a person enjoying an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>amusement park ride. Indeed, while most of the cited cases have addressed \u201ccontact\u201d sports or team sports, Justice Cardozo\u2019s comments help illustrate that the same general analysis applies to noncontact and individual recreational activities, hi all these activities, there are foreseeable, built-in risks of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In <em>Hathaway, supra, the </em>Texas Court of Appeals faced a similar issue regarding the difference between contact sports and other activities when it addressed golfers\u2019 duties to each other. Before <em>Hathaway, </em>Texas had recognized a \u201creckless or intentional\u201d standard of care for \u201ccompetitive contact sports.\u201d <em>Connell v Payne, </em>814 SW2d 486, 489 (Tex App, 1991). The <em>Hathaway </em>court extended this standard to golf, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">While the genteel game of golf can hardly be described as a \u201ccompetitive contact sport,\u201d we believe the reckless and intentional standard is every bit as appropriate to conduct on the links as it is to conduct on the polo field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">* <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">Acts that would be negligent if performed on a city street or in a backyard are not negligent in the context of a game where a risk of inadvertent harm is built into the sport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">As those persons who play golf well know, \u201cshanking the ball is a foreseeable and not uncommon occurrence.\u201d \u201cThe same is true of hooking, slicing, pushing, or pulling a golf shot.\u201d Because of the great likelihood of these unintended and offline shots, it can indeed be said that the risk of being inadvertently hit by a ball struck by another competitor is built into the game of golf. . . . Many bad shots carry the ball to the right or the left of an intended line of play. Golfers playing to the right or left of that line will of course be endangered by such shots. \u201cThis risk all golf players must accept.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 616-617 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The risks on an ice rink are no less obvious than those on a golf course. One cannot ice skate without ice, and the very nature of ice\u2014that it is both hard and slippery\u2014builds some risk into skating. In addition, an \u201copen skate\u201d invites those of various ages and abilities onto the ice to learn, to practice, to exercise, or simply to enjoy skating. When one combines the nature of ice with the relative proximity of skaters of various abilities, a degree of risk is readily apparent: Some skaters will be unable to control their progress and will either bump into other skaters, or fall. All skaters thus take the chance that they will fall themselves, that they will be bumped by another skater, or that they will trip over a skater who has fallen.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">B. ADOPTION OF THE RECKLESS MISCONDUCT STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">With these realities in mind, we join the majority of jurisdictions and adopt reckless misconduct as the minimum standard of care for coparticipants in recreational activities. We believe that this standard most accurately reflects the actual expectations of participants in recreational activities. As will be discussed in more detail below, we believe that participants in recreational activities do not expect to sue or be sued for mere carelessness. A recklessness standard also encourages vigorous participation in recreational activities, while still providing protection from egregious conduct. Finally, this standard lends itself to common-sense application by both judges and juries.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>C. APPLICATION OF THE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Applying a recklessness standard in this case, we conclude that summary disposition was properly granted to defendant. Although plaintiff used the word \u201creckless\u201d in her complaint, a review of the pleadings, depositions, and other documentary evidence reveals that plaintiff merely contends that defendant was skating backward without keeping a proper lookout behind her. These allegations amount to, at most, carelessness or ordinary negligence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court properly granted summary disposition for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">RESPONSE TO THE CONCURRENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Whatever else we disagree upon, those in the concurrence do agree that defendant\u2019s conduct in this case is not actionable. The fundamental difference between the two opinions turns on the standard of care each believes should apply to this and cases of like kind. As stated above, we believe that a recklessness standard most nearly comports with the expectations of participants in recreational activities. While reasonable people can differ on this issue, in rejecting our standard, the concurrence purports to apply an ordinary negligence standard. In fact, it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Among this Court\u2019s prime concerns must be the obligation to create common-law rales that create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>certainty and predictability in the law. We believe that the standard we adopt is consistent with our existing jurisprudence and lends itself to easy, common-sense application. On the other hand, the concurrence offers a bowdlerization of our traditional negligence standard that we believe would be exceedingly difficult to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The instant case provides a prime illustration of our point: As noted in the statement of facts, defendant concedes that questions of fact exist regarding whether her conduct was negligent. Even without this admission, it seems readily apparent that questions of fact abound under a negligence standard. All agree that defendant was permitted to skate backward at an open skate, but, as the concurrence acknowledges, an ordinary negligence standard required defendant to maintain a lookout in order to avoid running into other skaters. Here, defendant says she kept a lookout, but admits that she still bumped into plaintiff and knocked her down. Under these circumstances, could not reasonable jurors conclude that defendant failed to maintain a <em>sufficient </em>lookout? Surely, the question whether defendant\u2019s conduct was sufficiently careful under an ordinary negligence standard presents a question of material fact. Yet the concurrence declares, as a matter of law, that defendant\u2019s conduct was not negligent. The concurrence can only reach that point by ignoring the appropriate standard of review pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10), which requires us to draw inferences in favor of plaintiff, and by ignoring defendant\u2019s admission that questions of fact exist regarding whether her conduct was negligent. We find it hard to reconcile the concurrence\u2019s position with the facts of this case and traditional negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>gence law, and we are not persuaded that the concurrence\u2019s position comers the market on common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Ignoring the foregoing problem, the concurrence attempts to support its hybrid negligence standard by suggesting that participants who conduct themselves within the rules of the game are not subject to liability under its proposed standard.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Post </em>at 105-106. It is proposed that breaches of \u201cformal or informal rules regarding safety\u201d should be actionable, <em>id. </em>at 104, but apparently breaches of other rules should not. We think this endeavor to draw a distinction between \u201csafety rules\u201d (which apparently are inviolate) and non-safety rules (which apparently may be disregarded with legal impunity) attempts to draw a fruitless distinction that even participants themselves do not, and probably cannot, draw.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The concurrence\u2019s revised formulation of the conventional negligence standard would lead to profound doctrinal confusion, and more, rather than fewer, ancillary disputes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>More to the point, what direction would the concurrence\u2019s standard give to our beleaguered trial judges who are required to referee such questions in the crucible of litigation? We think the answer is \u201cprecious little.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Let us consider real-world examples to test whether the concurrence has presented a workable standard. In the case of soccer, which is officially a \u201cnon-contact\u201d sport, where would the concurrence draw the \u201cnegligence line\u201d if a participant is injured when she is fouled? Is a minor foul actionable? Is a foul that draws a \u201cyellow card\u201d actionable? Or would the concurrence find the foul actionable if it results in a \u201cred card\u201d? Similarly, in hockey, is a player who receives a two-minute penalty for slashing liable for any injuries caused by his rule violation, or is he even liable for the type of foul that results in a major misconduct penalty? Presumably, the concurrence would not preclude liability where a referee missed a foul, but what about a case where the referee saw the activity and concluded that no rule violation was committed? May a jury look beyond that decision and overturn it?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Surely all who participate in recreational activities do so with the hope that they will not be injured by the clumsiness or over-exuberant play of their coparticipants. However, we suspect that reasonable participants recognize that skill levels and play styles vary, and that an occasional injury is a foreseeable and natural part of being involved in recreational activities, however the \u201cinformal and formal rules\u201d are structured and enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Thus, we question whether participants in recreational activities make the kind of fine, Philadelphia lawyer-like distinctions regarding rules and their violation that the concurrence would use as the touchstone of liability. We doubt it. When a player steps on the field, she must recognize that an injury may occur, but she does not know whether she will be injured, or whether she will inadvertently injure another player. We do not believe that a player expects an injury, even if it results from a rule violation, to give rise to liability. Instead, we think it more likely that players participate with the expectation that no liability will arise unless a participant\u2019s actions exceed the normal bounds of conduct associated with the activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Consequently, we believe that the Une of liability for recreational activities should be drawn at recklessness. Recklessness is a term with a recognized legal meaning and, more importantly, is a term susceptible of a common-sense understanding and apphcation by judges, attorneys, and jurors alike in the myriad recreational activities that might become the backdrop of Utigation. Just as important, our standard more nearly comports with the common-sense understanding that participants in these activities bring to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>them. While the concurrence may disagree whether we have accurately assessed participant expectations, we think that our standard has the significant value of providing an explicit, easy to apply rule of jurisprudence. The concurrence has failed to present a sounder, clearer alternative standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that coparticipants in a recreational activity owe each other a duty not to act recklessly. Because the trial court properly concluded that plaintiff could not show that defendant violated this standard, summary disposition was proper. Thus, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision and reinstate the grant of summary disposition for defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-7\">Weaver, C.J., and Taylor and Corrigan, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\"> <em>Kammer Asphalt Paving Co v East China Twp Schools, </em>443 Mich 176, 179; 504 NW2d 635 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\"> We will use the term \u201cdefendant\u201d to refer to defendant Halley Mann.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\"> Translated literally, this Latin phrase means \u201cto a willing person a wrong is not done.\u201d Garner, <em>Dictionary of Modem Legal Usage </em>(2d ed) (New York: Oxford Univ Press, 1995), p 921.

As the majority notes, many state courts have addressed the question of the appropriate standard of care in sports injury cases. <em>Ante </em>at 81-83. Recently, most courts have held that, in order to state a cause of action, the plaintiff is required to allege that the defendant\u2019s actions were either reckless or intentional. <em>Id.) </em>55 ALR5th 529, 537. Three jurisdictions, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Arizona, explicitly judge sports injury cases according to the \u201cordinary care\u201d standard. <em>Auckenthaler v Grundmeyer, </em>110 Nev 682; 877 P2d 1039 (1994); <em>Lestina v West Bend Mut Ins Co, </em>176 Wis 901; 501 NW2d 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>(1993); <em>Estes v Tripson, </em>188 Ariz 93; 932 P2d 1364 (Ariz App, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">This Court has twice held that the proper standard of care for sports injury cases is ordinary care. <em>Felgner v Anderson, </em>375 Mich 23, 32, 56; 133 NW2d 136 (1965); <em>Williams v Wood, </em>260 Mich 322; 244 NW 490 (1932). More recently, after this Court abolished the \u201cassumption of risk\u201d doctrine in <em>Felgner, supra, </em>panels of the Michigan Court of Appeals have held both that ordinary negligence is the proper standard of care, <em>Schmidt v Youngs, </em>215 Mich App 222; 544 NW2d 743 (1996); <em>Carey v Toles, </em>7 Mich App 195; 151 NW2d 396 (1967), and that recklessness is the proper standard of care, <em>Higgins v Pfeiffer, </em>215 Mich App 423; 546 NW2d 645 (1996); <em>Overall v Kadella, </em>138 Mich App 351; 361 NW2d 352 (1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The majority now holds that the Court of Appeals in <em>Higgins </em>and <em>Overall </em>got it right: A participant in a sporting event owes a coparticipant a duty not to act recklessly. <em>Ante </em>at 89. One of the reasons advanced by the majority is evident in the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">There are myriad ways to describe the legal effect of voluntarily participating in a recreational activity. The act of stepping onto the field of play may be described as \u201cconsent to the inherent risks of the activity,\u201d or a participant\u2019s knowledge of the rules of a game may be described as \u201cnotice\u201d sufficient to discharge the other participants\u2019 duty of care. Similarly, participants\u2019 mutual agreement to play a game may be described as an \u201cimplied contract\u201d between all the participants, or a voluntary participant could be described as \u201cassuming the risks\u201d inherent in the sport. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>matter what terms are used, the basic premise is the same: When people engage in a recreational activity, they have voluntarily subjected themselves to certain risks inherent in that activity. <em>[Id. </em>at 86-87.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The majority offers further, more succinct, advantages that it discerns in the recklessness standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">We believe that this standard most accurately reflects the actual expectations of participants in recreational activities. . . . [W]e believe that participants in recreational activities do not expect to sue or be sued for mere carelessness. A recklessness standard also encourages vigorous participation in recreational activities, while still providing protection from egregious conduct. Finally, this standard lends itself to common-sense application by both judges and juries. <em>[Id. </em>at 89.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">None of the rationales advanced by the majority withstands scrutiny. The first group of reasons, quoted above, states in essence that the recklessness standard is appropriate because participants in recreational activities \u201cassume the risk\u201d of certain injuries. Not only is this a novel use of the assumption of risk doctrine (which was a complete bar to liability in tort), but, more importantly, it overlooks the fact that the assumption of risk doctrine was abrogated by this Court in <em>Felgner. </em>Furthermore, common sense dictates that none of the advantages of the recklessness standard that the majority cites actually support its conclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I believe that the majority is wrong in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>overruling this aspect of our holdings in <em>Felgner </em>and <em>Wood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">I begin with the majority\u2019s assertion that the recklessness standard \u201cencourages vigorous participation in recreational activities.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 89; see <em>id. </em>at 82-83, quoting <em>Ross v Clouser, </em>637 SW2d 11, 14 (Mo, 1982); <em>Crawn v Campo, </em>136 NJ 494, 508; 643 A2d 600 (1994). This observation echoes the reasoning of an earlier case in this area: \u201cthe law should not place unreasonable burdens on the free and vigorous participation in sports by our youth,\u201d <em>Nabozny v Barnhill, </em>31 Ill App 3d 212, 215; 334 NE2d 258 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The flaw in this reasoning, at least as applied to the state of Michigan, is that this state has observed the more exacting \u201cordinary care\u201d standard in sporting and recreational events at least since 1932, <em>Williams, supra, </em>and, despite this higher standard of care, there is no sign of any wane in the \u201cvigorousness\u201d of recreational sports in Michigan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Perhaps the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>would like to see even greater vigorousness in these activities, and plainly believes that the recklessness standard would serve this end. But, without any empirical evidence that participation or vigorousness in the state\u2019s recreational sports and activities would reach even greater heights under the recklessness standard, this Court should not attempt any social engineering in this area by altering long-existing rules of tort law.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The majority assumes that its decisions regarding tort standards of care are relevant considerations for those deciding whether to participate in recreational activities. I have my doubts regarding this proposition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But, even if we accept it as true, the majority\u2019s conclusion does not necessarily follow. Indeed, if participants in recreational activities have the legal foresight with which the majority credits them, it is just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>as likely that many would choose not to participate in these activities because the recklessness standard might encourage dangerous behavior or make it too difficult for participants to recover in the event they are injured. This heightened possibility of injury and unavailability of recovery would discourage vigorous participation, or any participation at all, by those who are less bold, or who might not want to take the financial risks presented by the possibility of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">These questions warn us that such policy issues are difficult for courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Should we require that the parties submit statistical analyses of the increased or decreased participation in recreational sports in those jurisdictions that have adopted the negligence and recklessness standards? Should we commission a study on the comparative vigorousness of play in these jurisdictions? Should we compare the per capita incidence of sports injury litigation in different jurisdictions? In the absence of reliable evidence that the negligence standard actually has an effect on the participation in or the vigorousness of recreational activities, this Court should not overrule its precedent on the basis of such a policy judgment, particularly in light of this state\u2019s longstanding policy that, \u201c[w]here there is a person negligently injured by another, normally there is recovery therefor.\u201d <em>Williams v Polgar, </em>391 Mich 6, 11; 215 NW2d 149 (1974); see <em>Parker v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Port Huron Hosp, </em>361 Mich 1, 11; 105 NW2d 1 (1960) (\u201c[N]ot only at the common law but also at the present time the general rule has been that one is liable for his negligence or tortious acts\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In <em>Feigner, </em>we stated that \u201c[assumption of risk should not again be used in this State as a substitute for, or as a supplement to, or as a corollary of, contributory negligence .... The traditional concepts of contributory negligence are more than ample to present that affirmative defense to established negligent acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56. Later, we noted that \u201cthe doctrine of contributory negligence has caused substantial injustice since it was first invoked in England in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>1809,\u201d and replaced it with comparative negligence. <em>Placek v Sterling </em>Heights, 405 Mich 638, 652; 275 NW2d 511 (1979).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, juries are responsible for deciding the degree to which a plaintiffs negligence (including the assumption of the risk), contributed to an injury, and reducing the damage award accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The majority recognizes our abrogation of the doctrine of assumption of risk in <em>Felgner. Ante </em>at 78. More important, the majority properly notes that assumption of risk includes the doctrine of <em>volenti non fit </em>injuria, and that in light of Felgner, \u201c[i]t is questionable whether this maxim retains any meaning in this state . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 79, n 3. Regardless, the majority depends upon the notion of <em>volenti non fit injuria </em>to grant partial immunity to the defendant in this case: \u201cWhen people engage in a recreational activity, they have voluntarily subjected themselves to certain risks inherent in that activity. When one of those risks results in injury, the participant has no ground for complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. The majority\u2019s statement is simply a paraphrasing of the maxim: \u201c \u2018[T]o a willing person a wrong is not done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, n 3.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Certainly, there is a sense in which assumption of risk has been recognized as surviving the adoption of contributory negligence schemes.

The plaintiff\u2019s implied consent in entering into this recreational activity is based upon the relationship that she entered into with her coparticipants. Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>pp 480-481. Since most recreational activities and sporting events have formal or informal rules regarding safety,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we must assume that the plaintiff entered into this relationship with her coparticipants with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>knowledge of these rales, and the expectation that they would be obeyed. We cannot assume most participants in such activities consent to others\u2019 behavior that is either accidentally or purposefully outside those safety rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Indeed, it would likely be a great surprise to the millions of participants in Michigan\u2019s recreational sports and activities that, by participating, they were legally consenting to their coparticipants\u2019 breach of the safety rules of those activities. One must wonder about the effect on the \u201cvigorousness\u201d of these sports, if it became common knowledge that this Count sanctioned breaches of these activities\u2019 safely rules, as long as the breaches did not amount to recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The fact that such rules exist supplies a ready definition of the legal duties that participants in sporting activities must observe: Participants have a tort-enforceable duty to one another to obey the safety rules of the sport or activity. If a participant engages in conduct outside these rules, that participant has potentially breached her legal duty to her coparticipants, and the factfinder must determine whether her conduct was reasonable under the circumstances. Participants in a sporting or recreational activity consent to actions by their coparticipants that would not satisfy the strictures of \u201cordinary care\u201d in everyday activity, but they do not consent to behavior unconstrained by the safety rules of the particular activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>By participating in the open skate, the plaintiff in the instant case impliedly consented to the defendant\u2019s backward skating, knowing that this was likely to be more dangerous than behavior that the plaintiff would encounter, for example, on a walk in her neighborhood. Cf. <em>ante </em>at 86-87. The parties agree, however, that one of the safety rules of free skating is that, while skating backward, the skater should periodically look behind her to see if she is going to run into anyone. Thus, the plaintiff consented to the heightened risk of the defendant\u2019s behavior with the knowledge that the defendant would lessen that risk by periodically looking behind her as she was skating backward.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">If the defendant was skating backward and obeying the safety rules by looking behind her, and then collided with the plaintiff, she cannot be held liable because she had no duty to behave more cautiously. Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra </em>at 481. If, however, the defendant ran into the plaintiff while she was skating backward and <em>not </em>periodically looking behind her, then she engaged in conduct that the plaintiff had not consented to, and can be held to have breached her duty toward the plaintiff if she did not act with reasonable care.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Because there is no basis in fact or law for holding that participants impliedly consent to any behavior that is more dangerous than that allowed by the activity\u2019s safety rules, primary assumption of risk is not a basis for holding that coparticipants in sporting activities have only the duty to refrain from acting recklessly. <em>Id. </em>This Court should not dash participants\u2019 expectations by insisting, without reason, that their participation indicates their consent to more dangerous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Despite my disagreement with the majority\u2019s reasoning, I reach its result because the plaintiff in this case submitted no evidence that the defendant breached any safety rules during free skating. The plaintiff has urged that the relevant rule of free skating is that \u201cthe skater has the responsibility for looking behind her when skating backward and should not rely upon others.\u201d The only evidence in the record regarding whether the defendant did look behind her while skating backward, is the defendant\u2019s deposition testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\"><em>Q. </em>Now, when you skate backward are you able or do you attempt to look where you\u2019re going by turning your head from one side to the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\"><em>Q. </em>Do you feel that when you\u2019re skating backward you can see everything behind you or is there some limitation in that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\"><em>A. </em>Well, <em>I would look </em>and then the people that were facing me, like I was skating backwards this way and you would be facing me, you would say there\u2019s people behind me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\"><em>Q. </em>So you were depending <em>somewhat </em>on the person that was skating forward to let you know if someone was behind you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\"><em>A. </em>Yeah, <em>I would check and they told me. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">While it is clear that the defendant partially relied on those skating with her to warn her about other skaters, she also unambiguously stated that she \u201clooked\u201d or \u201cchecked\u201d behind her. Thus, there is no basis on which to say that she violated any safety rales of the free skate, and no basis for finding that she violated any duty that she owed to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> MCR 2.116(C)(10).

This Court should not seek to fill the Legislature\u2019s policy-making role without compelling reasons and sound explanations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> Another relevant consideration is this Court\u2019s abolition of charitable tort immunity and interfamily tort immunity, though both these rules are supported by more compelling policy rationales than encouraging the vigorousness of sports. In <em>Parker, supra, </em>we noted that Michigan courts have prohibited tort suits against charities since 1894, relying upon \u201cpublic policy that benevolence should not be impaired by recovery of damages for torts of the employees of the charitable trust.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 13. The <em>Parker </em>Court held that this policy could not justify \u201c \u2018the injured individual\u2019s having to bear the loss wrongfully inflicted upon him ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 19, quoting <em>President &amp; Directors of Georgetown College v Hughes, </em>n 4 <em>supra, </em>p 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">We also overturned the rule that members of a family may not sue one another in tort. <em>Plumley v Klein, </em>388 Mich 1; 199 NW2d 169 (1972).

Such policy gave way, however, to the greater concern that those who are injured by negligent conduct be allowed to recover. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">In light of the abrogation of these rules, based upon the public policy of encouraging charitable giving and \u201cthe peace of the family and of society,\u201d it seems strange to base partial tort immunity in sports injury suits on a desire to encourage vigorous recreational activities. Even if we accept as true that a recklessness standard would encourage vigorous participation in sports (again, a doubtful proposition), we must take note of this Court\u2019s treatment of tort immunities based upon far more compelling rationales than this one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b398-6\"> The Legislature has recently partially affirmed and partially overturned <em>Placek, </em>replacing \u201cpure\u201d comparative negligence with \u201chybrid\u201d comparative negligence.

Where the parties agree upon the applicable safety rule of a sport, or where the rule is written into a rule book, this determination will be particularly straightforward.
