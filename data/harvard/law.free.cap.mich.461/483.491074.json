The Court of Appeals affirmed a decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission, which granted the contested benefits. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, for the reasons stated by the concurring member of the Court of Appeals panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">In 1966, the plaintiff suffered serious leg injuries in the course of his employment at a General Motors plant in Flint. These injuries left him totally and permanently disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">A person who has lost the industrial use of both legs is presumed to be disabled for a period of eight hundred weeks. This presumption, now stated in MCL 418.361(3)(g), 418.351(1); MSA 17.237(361)(3)(g), 17.237(351)(1), was in effect at the time the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>became disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the eight hundred weeks had passed, he continued to collect basic weekly benefits from his employer, and also differential benefits from the Second Injury Fund (SIF), as now provided in MCL 418.521(2); MSA 17.237(521)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">In <em>Eva King v Second Injury Fund, </em>382 Mich 480; 170 NW2d 1 (1969), this Court considered the effect of certain statutory amendments on the differential benefits available to persons who were permanently and totally disabled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff is one of a group of benefit recipients whose situation was governed by <em>King, </em>and he is thus said to be one of \u201cthe <em>Eva King </em>people.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The special status of <em>Eva King </em>people was later codified by 1980 PA 357, which added MCL 418.351(2); MSA 17.237(351)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This measure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">A totally and permanently disabled employee whose date of injury preceded July 1, 1968, is entitled to the compensation under this act that was payable to the employee imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>diately before the effective date of this subsection, or compensation equal to 50% of the state average weekly wage as last determined under [MCL 418.355; MSA 17.237(355)], whichever is greater.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In 1968, the Legislature enacted a provision that reduces benefits by five percent each year from a person\u2019s sixty-fifth birthday until the seventy-fifth birthday. The section took effect July 1, 1968,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and is now found in MCL 418.357(1); MSA 17.237(357)(1). It reads;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">When an employee who is receiving weekly payments or is entitled to weekly payments reaches or has reached or passed the age of 65, the weekly payments for each year following his or her sixty-fifth birthday shall be reduced by 5% of the weekly payment paid or payable at age 65, but not to less than 50% of the weekly benefit paid or payable at age 65, so that on his or her seventy-fifth birthday the weekly payments shall have been reduced by 50%; after which there shall not be a further reduction for the duration of the employee\u2019s life. Weekly payments shall not be reduced below the minimum weekly benefit as provided in this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">An issue soon arose regarding whether <em>Eva King </em>people were subject to these age-related reductions. Initially, the SIF assumed that the reductions applied only to persons injured on or after the effective date of the new measure (July 1, 1968) and that they were thus inapplicable to the <em>Eva King </em>people. However, the Court of Appeals held in 1982 that the reductions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>were </em>applicable. <em>Lopez v Flower Basket Nursery, </em>122 Mich App 680, 687-689; 332 NW2d 630 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The SIF responded to <em>Lopez </em>by applying the age-related reductions to all surviving <em>Eva King </em>people. It also attempted to recoup a portion of what appeared to have been overpayments to these claimants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Without farther appellate guidance, the SIF also concluded that payments to these claimants could not fall below a floor set by MCL 418.356(3); MSA 17.237(356)(3), which now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">The minimum weekly benefit for 1 or more losses stated in [MCL 418.361(2), (3); MSA 17.237(361)(2), (3)] shall be 25% of the state average weekly wage as determined under [MCL 418.355; MSA 17.237(355)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">This approach was challenged by some of the <em>Eva King </em>people, but most accepted without protest the sif\u2019s handling of this matter in the wake of <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">One of the persons who challenged the approach taken by the SIF persuaded the Court of Appeals that it had erred in <em>Lopez </em>by holding that the age-related reduction could be applied to the <em>Eva King </em>people. <em>Wozniak v General Motors Corp, </em>198 Mich App 172; 497 NW2d 562 (1993). In that decision, usually called <em>Wozniak I, </em>the Court of Appeals also ruled that the <em>Eva King </em>people had the benefit of the fifty-percent benefit floor of MCL 418.351(2); MSA 17.237(351)(2), rather than the twenty-five-percent floor found in MCL 418.356(3); MSA 17.237(356)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">The sif did not appeal <em>Wozniak I. </em>Instead, it increased differential benefit payments for <em>Eva King </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>people to at least fifty percent of the current average weekly wage, as required by MCL 418.351(2); MSA 17.237(351)(2). The SIF refused, however, to compensate the <em>Eva King </em>people for the benefit reductions between the 1985 date when <em>Lopez </em>became final and the 1993 decision in <em>Wozniak I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">This refusal was premised on several grounds, including the one-year-back rule of MCL 418.833(1); MSA 17.237(833)(1), the two-year-back rule of MCL 418.381(2); MSA 17.237(381)(2), and the belief that <em>Wozniak I </em>should not be applied for the benefit of <em>Eva King </em>people who did not seek the disputed benefits until after <em>Wozniak I </em>was decided.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In <em>Wozniak I, </em>the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the wcac for further proceedings regarding whether the sef\u2019s repayment obligation to Ms. Wozniak (who had protested immediately) was limited by either the one-year- or two-year-back rules. The eventual result was that the two-year-back rule was found inapplicable by the WCAC (the SIF did not appeal that ruling) and the one-year-back rule was found inapplicable by the Court of Appeals. <em>Wozniak v General Motors Corp (After Remand), </em>212 Mich App 40; 536 NW2d 841 (1995). This is <em>Wozniak II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The panel in <em>Wozniak II </em>did not reach an issue that pertains to many of the <em>Eva King </em>people, including the plaintiff in the present case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-3\">We decline defendants\u2019 invitation to decide whether <em>[Wozniak </em>i] should be applied retroactively to employees who did not object to the benefit reduction. [212 Mich App 44.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In 1993, the plaintiff filed a petition in which he sought recoupment of the benefits he lost during the years when <em>Lopez </em>controlled. On appeal from the decision of a magistrate, the wcac held that the plaintiff was entitled to these benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The SIF appealed to the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which affirmed the decision of the WCAC. 231 Mich App 262; 586 NW2d 241 (1998). The majority concluded that, with regard to this plaintiff, <em>\u201cWozniak I </em>should be given full retroactive effect in favor of those who did not initially object to the reduction of benefits pursuant to <em>Lopez.\u201d </em>231 Mich App 269. In a concurring opinion, Judge Whitbeck agreed with the outcome, but employed a different analysis. 231 Mich App 269-315.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Issues concerning the interpretation and application of statutes are questions of law for this Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>decide de novo. <em>Mager v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>460 Mich 134, 143, n 14; 595 NW2d 142 (1999); <em>Hoste v Shanty Creek Management, Inc, </em>459 Mich 561, 569; 592 NW2d 360 (1999). Likewise, questions concerning the retroactivity of earlier judicial decisions are for this Court to decide de novo as matters of law. See, generally, <em>Michigan Educational Employees Mut Ins Co v Morris, </em>460 Mich 180, 189-197; 596 NW2d 142 (1999), and <em>People v Neal, </em>459 Mich 72, 80-81; 586 NW2d 716 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The issue before us is whether to apply the holding of <em>Wosniak I </em>to this plaintiff, so that he can obtain the statutoiy benefits that were denied him in the years following the decision in <em>Lopez.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In resolving this question, we repeat what we said a few months ago in <em>Michigan Educational Employees Mut Ins Co v Morris, supra </em>at 189. In the course of deciding whether a 1993 decision called Profit<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> should be applied retroactively, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>In these companion cases, both defendants argue that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Profit </em>should be applied prospectively rather than retroactively. \u201c[T]he general rule is that judicial decisions are to be given complete retroactive effect .... [C]omplete prospective application has generally been limited to decisions which overrule clear and uncontradicted case law.\u201d <em>Hyde v Univ of Michigan Bd of </em>Regents, 426 Mich 223, 240; 393 NW2d 847 (1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Accordingly, the first question is whether <em>Wozniak I </em>overruled clear and uncontradicted prior case law. In turn, that leads to the question whether <em>Lopez </em>constituted a clear and uncontradicted ruling on the subject of these proceedings\u2014the relationship among the three statutory provisions discussed in <em>Wozniak I. </em>MCL 418.351(2), 418.356(3), and 418.357(1); MSA 17.237(351)(2), 17.237(356)(3), and 17.237(357)(1). Since both MCL 418.351(2); MSA 17.237(351)(2) and MCL 418.356(3); MSA 17.237(356)(3) were enacted by 1980 PA 357 and took effect January 1, 1982, it is understandable that the <em>Lopez </em>panel did not have occasion to discuss either subsection. However, in that light, it also is evident that <em>Lopez </em>can hardly constitute a clear and uncontradicted holding with regard to the issues resolved in <em>Wozniak I. </em>We therefore agree with Judge Whitbeck that <em>\u201cWozniak I </em>did not \u2018establish a new principle of law,\u2019 as prior case law has interpreted that phrase.\u201d 231 Mich App 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In this Court, the SIF acknowledges that <em>\u201cWozniak I </em>did not overrule settled precedent,\u201d though the panel disagreed with <em>Lopez. </em>Arguing against retroactive application of <em>Wozniak I, </em>the sif characterizes that decision as \u201cunforeseeable.\u201d It also writes of its reliance upon <em>Lopez </em>and its fear that the administration of civil justice will be hampered by retroactive application. We appreciate these concerns, but disagree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The language of the controlling statutes was correctly interpreted in the <em>Wozniak </em>decisions, and we see no sound reason to depart from the normal course of granting full retroactivity to a judicial decision that interprets a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In the end, this complex case must be decided on the basis identified by Judge Whitbeck:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">Simply put, this issue here is not the type of first impression question that supports prospective application. As the <em>Wozniak I </em>panel found, [MCL 418.351(2); MSA 17.237(351)(2)] is quite specific while [MCL 418.356(3); MSA. 17.237(356)(3)] is quite general. Because the two subsections were once part of the same amendatory act, the legislative intent was manifestly clear: [MCL 418.351(2); MSA 17.237(351)(2)] established a minimum benefit rate of fifty percent of the state average weekly wage, or the benefit rate in effect on December 31, 1969, whichever is greater, for totally and permanently disabled workers, such as Lincoln, whose date of injury preceded July 1, 1968. The fund\u2019s internal and purely administrative determination to the contrary was in error and its persistent reliance on that determination was without support in the wdca. Applying Blackstone\u2019s formulation,[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] the interpretation of the wdca in <em>Wozniak I </em>was always the \u201ctrue law\u201d and it must therefore be given full retroactive effect. [231 Mich App 314.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and the decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission.</p>\n<judges id=\"b788-8\">Weaver, C.J., and Cavanagh, Kelly, Taylor, Corrigan, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\"> The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (wdca), MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq., </em>has been amended often. For the sake of clarity, we will present current statutory language, noting history where appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\"> <em>King </em>concerned amendments enacted in 1955 PA 250 and 1965 PA 44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\"> An <em>Eva King </em>person is someone who was totally and permanently disabled before July 1, 1968. That cutoff reflects the effective date of 1968 PA 227, which repealed MCL 412.9(a); MSA 17.159(a), which in turn had formed the basis for the ruling in <em>King. </em>The Attorney General tells us that currently there are about 360 surviving <em>Eva King </em>people.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\"> MCL 418.351(2); MSA 17.237(351)(2) marked a legislative acknowledgment of the <em>Eva King </em>people. However, the effect of the measure actually was to reduce benefits that <em>Eva King </em>people would otherwise have received as the result of the current language of MCL 418.355; MSA 17.237(355) (from 1980 PA 357 and 1982 PA 32), which raised the maximum rate of weekly compensation to ninety percent of the state average weekly wage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\"> This provision was enacted in 1968 PA 227, after an earlier version (1965 PA 44) was held unconstitutional in <em>Brown v Saginaw Metal Casting Plants, Chevrolet Motor Div, General Motors Corp, </em>68 Mich App 85; 241 NW2d 769 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"Aqc\"> The sif reduced the continuing payments until it had recovered a year\u2019s worth of the apparent overpayments. MCL 418.833(2); MSA 17.237(833)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b784-7\"> Another potential defense relates to the fact that there are subclasses of <em>Eva King </em>people, and Ms. Wozniak (who was injured in 1964) and the present plaintiff (injured in 1966) belong to different parts of the larger group. As interpreted in <em>Rotondi v Chrysler Corp, </em>200 Mich App 368, 375-379; 504 NW2d 901 (1993), the age-related reductions of MCL 418.357(1); MSA 17.237(357)(1) do apply to persons injured on or after September 1, 1965. Of course, that would include the present plaintiff. However, because we find the fifty-percent floor of MCL 418.351(2); MSA 17.237(351)(2) applicable in this case, the practical effect of the age-related reductions appears to be slight or nonexistent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b785-9\"> The Court of Appeals initially denied leave to appeal. Unpublished order, issued September 11, 1996 (Docket No. 194191).

However, we are satisfied with the analysis offered by the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">Defendant fund argues that any retroactivity should be limited by the one-year-back rule, MCL 418.833(1); MSA 17.237(833)(1). However, this question has been conclusively [we would say \u201ccorrectly\u201d] decided in the successor case of <em>Wozniak II, supra. </em>A plaintiffs attempt to recover payments improperly withheld does not constitute an application for further compensation as defined by the statute. The two-year-back rule, MCL 418.381(2); MSA 17.237(381)(2), is inapplicable where the plaintiff has been receiving total and permanent disability benefits for an injury received before July 1, 1968. <em>Brecht v Save-Way Food Center, </em>407 Mich 743; 288 NW2d 576 (1980).
