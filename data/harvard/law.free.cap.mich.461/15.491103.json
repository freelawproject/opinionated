We conclude that \u00a7 2169 is an enactment of substantive law. Therefore, we uphold the statute as a valid exercise of the Legislature\u2019s public policy-making prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A0u\">a. <em>McDougall</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s wife, Sandra McDougall, became ill on August 27, 1990. As a result, Mrs. McDougall visited her family physician who confirmed Mrs. McDougall\u2019s belief that she was pregnant. Mrs. McDougall was then referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, but was eventually sent home. The next day, Mrs. McDougall went to Garden City Hospital complaining of nausea, vomiting, and troubled breathing. She was treated by defendant Reuben Eliuk, D.O., a specialist in internal medicine. However, Mrs. McDougall died, allegedly from resultant complications of undiagnosed diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In 1991, plaintiff brought suit against Dr. Eliuk, the hospital, and several other physicians. Plaintiff offered Glen Mark Robia, M.D., as his expert to establish the standard of care owed by Dr. Eliuk. Like Dr. Eliuk, Dr. Robia is also board certified in internal medicine. However, he has not practiced in this field for some time. Primarily, Dr. Robia works as a pathologist (as well as serving as chief of staff of a small hospital) and county coroner in Minnesota, where he lives. Dr. Robia testified in his deposition that his full-time, active practice of internal medicine began in 1979 and ended in 1982.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The trial court granted Dr. Eliuk\u2019s motion in limine to exclude Dr. Robia\u2019s testimony on the ground that Dr. Robia was not qualified under MCL 600.2169; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>MSA 27A.2169. At that time, the statute provided, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">(1) In an action alleging medical malpractice, if the defendant is a specialist, a person shall not give expert testimony on the appropriate standard of care unless the person is or was a physician licensed to practice medicine or osteopathic medicine and surgery or a dentist licensed to practice dentistry in this or another state and meets both of the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">(a) Specializes, or specialized at the time of the occurrence which is the basis for the action, in the same specialty or a related, relevant area of medicine or osteopathic medicine and surgery or dentistry as the specialist who is the defendant in the medical malpractice action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">(b) Devotes, or devoted at the time of the occurrence which is the basis for the action, a substantial portion of his or her professional time to the active clinical practice of medicine or osteopathic medicine and surgery or the active clinical practice of dentistry, or to the instruction of students in an accredited medical school, osteopathic medical school, or dental school in the same specialty or a related, relevant area of health care as the specialist who is the defendant in the medical malpractice action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">(2) In determining the qualifications of an expert witness in an action alleging medical malpractice, the court shall, at a minimum, evaluate all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">(a) The educational and professional training of the expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">(b) The area of specialization of the expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">(c) The length of time the expert witness has been engaged in the active clinical practice or instruction of medicine, osteopathic medicine and surgery, or dentistry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">(d) The relevancy of the expert witness\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">(3) This section does not limit the power of the trial court to disqualify an expert witness on grounds other than the qualifications set forth in this section. [MCL 600.2169; MSA 27A.2169.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The court rejected plaintiff\u2019s argument that the statute is unconstitutional, concluding instead that \u00a7 2169 and MRE 702, governing the admission of expert testimony,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are complementary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part. 218 Mich App 501; 554 NW2d 56 (1996). The Court of Appeals majority determined that \u00a7 2169 conflicts with MRE 702 and, moreover, that the statute is an unconstitutional violation of this Court\u2019s rule-making authority. Judge Taylor dissented, arguing that, because \u00a7 2169 is \u201cmore akin to a substantive law than a procedural rule,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 516, it takes precedence over MRE 702. We granted leave to appeal. 456 Mich 905 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">B. <em>SOBRAN</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Plaintiff<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> John Sobran was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1976. That same year, plaintiff\u2019s personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>physician, Dr. Thomas Fox, performed an ileostomy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Fifteen years later, in 1991, plaintiff began experiencing abdominal pain. He was eventually referred to defendant, Dr. Alasdair McKendrick, a board-certified colorectal surgeon. Defendant diagnosed an ileostomy dysfunction and recommended another surgery to improve the ileostomy. This operation was performed in December 1991, but it did not improve plaintiffs complaint of abdominal pain. After six months of unsuccessful treatment with defendant, plaintiff returned to Dr. Fox.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Dr. Fox performed a sigmoidoscopy<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on September 14, 1992. As a result, Dr. Fox found polyps blocking plaintiffs intestinal tract. He performed surgery in January 1993 and successfully removed the polyps.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Plaintiff filed a medical malpractice suit against defendant, alleging that defendant should have performed a sigmoidoscopy in 1991. Plaintiff claimed that, had defendant done so, he would have discovered the polyps over a year before the examination performed by Dr. Fox.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Plaintiff offered Dr. Mark Caminker as his expert to establish the standard of care owed by defendant. While Dr. Caminker is board certified in internal medicine and gastroenterology he is not a colorectal surgeon. However, Dr. Caminker testified in his deposition that internists and surgeons follow the same standards of care for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>problems and for the performance of diagnostic procedures such as sigmoidoscopy.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Shortly before trial was scheduled to begin, defendant sought to exclude Dr. Caminker\u2019s proffered expert testimony. Defendant argued in relevant part that Dr. Caminker was not qualified under MCL 600.2169; MSA 27A.2169 to testify regarding the standards of care applicable to colorectal surgeons. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and, after declining to allow plaintiff additional time to locate another expert, dismissed plaintiff\u2019s claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals, raising the constitutionality of MCL 600.2169; MSA 27A.2169. The Court acknowledged that \u00a7 2169 had been declared unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals panel in McDougall, and that the trial court\u2019s ruling was based upon the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Court upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling on the ground that Dr. Caminker was not qualified under MRE 702, a ground that was neither argued before nor decided by the trial court. We granted leave to appeal, and specifically ordered the parties to address the question whether the statute is invalid as in conflict with MRE 702. 456 Mich 905 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">n. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The constitutionality of \u00a7 2169 presents a question of law. We review questions of law de novo. <em>Cardinal Mooney High School v Michigan High School Athletic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n, </em>437 Mich 75, 80; 467 NW2d 21 (1991). Also relevant to our assessment of \u00a7 2169\u2019s validity is the well-established rule that a statute is presumed to be constitutional unless its unconstitutionality is clearly apparent. <em>Johnson v Harnischfeger Corp, </em>414 Mich 102, 112; 323 NW2d 912 (1982); <em>People v Bricker, </em>389 Mich 524, 528; 208 NW2d 172 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">HI. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">A. DO \u00a7 2169 AND MRE 702 CONFLICT?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">We first consider whether \u00a7 2169 and MRE 702 can be construed so as not to conflict, thus making it unnecessary to reach the constitutional question. When there is no inherent conflict, \u201c[w]e are not required to decide whether [the] statute is a legislative attempt to supplant the Court\u2019s authority.\u201d <em>People v </em>Mateo, 453 Mich 203, 211; 551 NW2d 891 (1996). \u201cWe do not lightly presume that the Legislature intended a conflict, calling into question this Court\u2019s authority to control practice and procedure in the courts.\u201d <em>People v Dobben, </em>440 Mich 679, 697, n 22; 488 NW2d 726 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">According to defendants, \u00a7 2169 and MRE 702 do not conflict. Rather, defendants in both cases maintain that the statute serves merely to aid the court in applying the rule and that the ultimate decision whether to admit expert testimony rests with the trial court. We cannot agree with defendants\u2019 characterization of the relationship between \u00a7 2169 and MRE 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">While MRE 702 authorizes expert testimony on the basis of \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\u201d the statute operates to preclude certain witnesses from testifying solely on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>witness\u2019 lack of practice or teaching experience in the relevant specialty. Anyone qualified by virtue of the MRE 702 criteria of skill, training, or education could nonetheless be excluded under the statute\u2019s strict practice or teaching requirements. Indeed, as the Court of Appeals in <em>McDougall </em>correctly noted, the trial court in that case considered Dr. Robia to be qualified under MRE 702. However, the trial court\u2019s discretion to permit Dr. Robia\u2019s expert testimony was limited by \u00a7 2169\u2019s practice or teaching requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Finally, it appears beyond dispute that the Legislature envisioned and intended that the statute would often compel different qualification determinations than the rule when applied to a given case. As Judge Taylor noted in his dissent in <em>McDougall, </em>the Legislature became dissatisfied with the manner in which some courts were exercising their discretion regarding expert testimony, and enacted a statute designed to limit that discretion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, given that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u00a7 2169 and MRE 702 clearly conflict, we must determine whether the statute impermissibly infringes upon this Court\u2019s constitutional authority to enact rules governing practice and procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">B. CONST 1963, ART 6, \u00a7 5</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">It is beyond question that the authority to determine rules of practice and procedure rests exclusively with this Court. Indeed, this Court\u2019s primacy in such matters is established in our 1963 Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">The supreme court shall by general rules establish, modify, amend and simplify the practice and procedure in all courts of this state.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">This exclusive rule-making authority in matters of practice and procedure is further reinforced by separation of powers principles. See Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2; <em>In re 1976 PA 267, </em>400 Mich 660; 255 NW2d 635 (1977). Thus, in <em>Perin v Peuler (On Rehearing), </em>373 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Mich 531, 541; 130 NW2d 4 (1964), we properly emphasized that \u201c[t]he function of enacting and amending judicial rules or practice and procedure has been committed exclusively to this Court . . .; a function with which the legislature may not meddle or interfere save as the Court may acquiesce and adopt for retention at judicial will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">At the same time, it cannot be gainsaid that this Court is not authorized to enact court rules that establish, abrogate, or modify the substantive law. <em>Shannon v Ottawa Circuit Judge, </em>245 Mich 220, 223; 222 NW 168 (1928). Rather, as is evident from the plain language of art 6, \u00a7 5, this Court\u2019s constitutional rule-making authority extends <em>only </em>to matters of practice and procedure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Shannon, supra </em>at 222-223. Accordingly, in order to assess the constitutionality of MCL 600.2169; MSA 27A.2169, we must determine whether the statute addresses purely procedural matters or substantive law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">C. SECTION 2169: A MATTER OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW OR PROCEDURE?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">We are faced in these cases with a statutory provision that undoubtedly acts as a rule of evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Indeed, as previously discussed, \u00a7 2169 contains strict requirements concerning the qualification of expert witnesses in medical malpractice cases. The statute affects what expert testimonial evidence may be admitted in the trial of such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Plaintiffs in both cases, along with the dissent, simply contend that all \u201crules of evidence\u201d are procedural in nature. Therefore, plaintiffs argue, because \u00a7 2169 purports to govern the admissibility of standard of care testimony in medical malpractice actions involving specialists, it represents an impermissible infringement on this Court\u2019s rule-making power. As would be expected, plaintiffs rely primarily on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Perin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In <em>Perin, </em>this Court considered the validity of a statute prohibiting the admission in <em>any </em>civil action of evidence relating to a violation of the motor vehicle code.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court found the statute to be of no effect to the extent that it conflicted with longstanding rules of evidence relating to impeachment of witness credibility. In doing so, the <em>Perin </em>Court declared that this Court\u2019s constitutional authority regarding practice and procedure \u201cinclude[s],\u201d of course, the \u201crules of evidence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">\u201cThe judicial function constitutionally empowers <em>the courts to make their own rules of procedure, </em>including rules of evidence (subject only to specific constitutional limitations). Virtually all of the original rules of evidence were invented by the courts, . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201cIn recent times, the just prerogative of the courts to make their own rules of procedure has been vindicated in professional opinion; and a healthy movement to relegate generally procedure to the courts has long been under way. That this prerogative of the courts includes the power to formulate and to alter the rules of evidence ought not to be doubted.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 541-542 (emphasis in original; citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">However, as authority for this proposition, the <em>Perin </em>Court relied, not on an analysis of the text of art 6, \u00a7 5, but on the 1962 pocket supplement for 1 Wig-more, Evidence (3d ed). Since <em>Perin, </em>this Court, again without any apparent consideration of the meaning of \u201cpractice and procedure\u201d as stated in art 6, \u00a7 5, has reaffirmed Perm\u2019s broad statement of our authority over all matters relating to the admission of evidence. See, e.g., <em>People v Mitchell, </em>402 Mich 506; 265 NW2d 163 (1978); <em>People v Jackson, </em>391 Mich 323; 217 NW2d 22 (1974); <em>Buscaino v Rhodes, </em>385 Mich 474; 189 NW2d 202 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">However, we now recognize that the <em>Perin </em>Court failed to consider the constitutionally required distinction between \u201cpractice and procedure\u201d and substantive law and thus overstated the reach of our rule-making authority. We will not continue mechanically to characterize all statutes that resemble \u201crules of evidence\u201d as relating solely to practice and procedure. Such an analysis merely begs the question what makes a particular \u201crule of evidence\u201d procedural as opposed to substantive in nature. We instead adopt a more thoughtful analysis that takes into account the undeniable distinction \u201cbetween <em>procedural </em>rules of evidence and evidentiary rules of substantive law . . . .\u201d <em>Golden v Baghdoian, </em>222 Mich App 220, 225; 564 NW2d 505 (1997) (emphasis in original). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>distinction is one that was not only advocated by recognized scholars contemporaneously with the development and passage of our 1963 Constitution,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but one that, as further explained below, the drafters contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">We conclude that a statutory rule of evidence violates Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5 only when \u201c \u2018no clear legislative policy reflecting considerations other than judicial dispatch of litigation can be identified ....\u2019\u201d <em>Kirby v Larson, </em>400 Mich 585, 598; 256 NW2d 400 (1977) (opinion of Williams, J.), citing 3 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), p 404;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> see also Joiner &amp; Miller, <em>Rules of practice and procedure: A study \u2018of judicial rule making, </em>55 Mich L R 623, 650-651 (1957). Therefore, \u201c[i]f a particular court rule contravenes a legislatively declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>principle of public policy, having as its basis something other than court administration . . . the [court] rule should yield.\u201d Joiner &amp; Miller, <em>supra </em>at 635. We agree with Professor Joiner that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">[m]ost rules of evidence have been made by courts. Now and then the legislature has, as a result of policy consideration over and beyond matters involving the orderly dispatch of judicial business, enacted rules of evidence. The distinction previously pointed out between policy considerations involving the orderly dispatch of judicial business on the one hand and policy considerations involving something more than that on the other hand is the distinction that must be carried through into the evidence field. <em>[Id. </em>at 650-651.][<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We conclude that this common-sense approach properly gives effect to the constitutionally required distinction between \u201cpractice and procedure\u201d and substantive law. While we acknowledge that the analytical exercise required will not always be an easy one, it certainly is not novel. In <em>People v McKenna, </em>196 Colo 367, 371-372; 585 P2d 275 (1978), the Colorado Supreme Court, applying a provision of the Colo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>rado Constitution that is substantially similar to Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> upheld that state\u2019s \u201crape shield\u201d statute in large part because it \u201crepresents far more than merely a legislative attempt to regulate the day-to-day procedural operations of the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372. See also <em>Nolan v Sea Airmotive, Inc, </em>627 P2d 1035, 1042 (Alas, 1981). To the extent that this Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>Perin </em>and its progeny suggest that all statutes affecting the admission of evidence are procedural, they are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Plaintiffs argue, and the dissent agrees, that the drafters of our 1963 Constitution manifested their intent that the Legislature not be permitted in any fashion to intrude upon this Court\u2019s power to determine \u201crules of evidence\u201d when the drafters considered and rejected the following proposed amendment of art 6, \u00a7 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">The supreme court shall by general rules establish, modify, amend and simplify the practice and procedure in all courts in the state, it being provided that where there is a conflict between supreme court rule and a statute concerning evidence or substantive law the statute shall prevail. [1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 1289.][<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Plaintiffs also direct our attention to the following comments made by Delegate Robert J. Danhof in opposition to the proposed amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Rules of evidence have historically been made by the courts over the years. They have developed through usage, through practice, through various cases, and with but very few exceptions except as relates to presumptions and privileges, the rules of evidence as to what may be introduced are and should continue to be a court function. The legislature may write statutes as they relate to the substantive law, but the rulemaking power of the court as it relates to the admission of evidence should not be limited, as this would do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">Again we have here something which shows a consistent pattern to endeavor to restrict and tie in knots the administration of justice in the operation of our supreme court. I think too often we tend to let the personalities of the court personnel interfere with our consideration of the system. If there is one thing this committee should do, it is to try to set up a good system, and then find ways by which we can staff the system by the fairest means. Every single authority in the field of administration of court decisions has held that the power of rulemaking over evidence, and so on, and practice and procedure should not be tampered with. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">By quoting only select portions of the convention debates, plaintiffs and the dissent have mischaracterized the thrust of the debates regarding the proposed amendment. The delegates opposing the amendment expressed concern that it undercut this Court\u2019s rule-making authority over practice and procedure by deeming <em>all </em>rules of evidence to be substantive law' and thus the province of the Legislature. Even the delegates opposing the amendment recognized that rules of evidence can be procedural, substantive or a combination of both. One of the amendment\u2019s primary opponents, Delegate William D. Ford, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">When we are talking about the lines between substantive law and procedural law, not all of us are as positive as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>[Delegate Ann E.] Donnelly that we know when we cross over this line from one to the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">And the danger we see in trying to create this distinction as if it were a clear cut line between the 2 is that we are opening the door for all sorts of litigation to start confusing the future rulemaking power of the court .... <em>[Id. </em>at 1291.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Another opponent, Delegate Melvin Nord, also acknowledged that there may indeed be a distinction between substantive and procedural rules of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">Now, the question I was asked by [Delegate Eugene G.] Wanger is a very tough question, that is to say, <em>should evidence be counted as procedure or not. Normally it is. Possibly there are some rules that should not be. We know that it is a difficult line between procedure and substantive in some cases. And, as a matter of fact, the same subject matter will sometimes be called substantive and sometimes procedural depending on the context. [Id. </em>at 1292 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Delegate Nord farther summarized his concerns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">The question that has never really been determined at all is how far this word \u201cprocedure\u201d goes. There we are shooting out into the dark. Now, in my opinion, if we attempt to settle this question here, then we change our minds from where we were a few days ago. A few days ago we said the judicial power shall be exclusively in the court, and now we are saying, basically, it shall be exclusively in the constitutional convention, that we are going to determine in advance everything that is procedural and everything that isn\u2019t. We are going to make up our minds now [by approving the proposed amendment] that all evidence is not procedural. [Id.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>We think it clear from a reading of the <em>entire </em>debate concerning the proposed amendment that the drafters of our 1963 Constitution believed, not that rules of evidence are always procedural, but that the proposed amendment was unwise in that it would forever have determined that evidentiary rules are always substantive. Thus, the convention debates actually support the distinction we here recognize and draw between substantive and procedural \u201crules of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Applying the substance/procedure analysis set forth above, we conclude that \u00a7 2169 is an enactment of substantive law. It reflects wide-ranging and substantial policy considerations relating to medical malpractice actions against specialists. We agree with the Court of Appeals dissent in <em>McDougall </em>that the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">reflects a careful legislative balancing of policy considerations about the importance of the medical profession to the people of Michigan, the economic viability of medical specialists, the social costs of \u201cdefensive medicine,\u201d the availability and affordability of medical care and health insurance, the allocation of risks, the costs of malpractice insurance, and manifold other factors, including, no doubt, political factors\u2014all matters well beyond the competence of the judiciary to reevaluate as justiciable issues. [218 Mich App 518 (Taylor, P.J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Clearly then, the statute does not involve the mere dispatch of judicial business.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>We also agree with the <em>McDougall </em>dissent that, because the Legislature is authorized to change a common-law cause of action or abolish it altogether, <em>O\u2019Brien v Hazelet &amp; Erdal, </em>410 Mich 1, 15; 299 NW2d 336 (1980), it necessarily has the ability to \u201ccircumscribfe] those qualified to give the requisite proofs to establish the elements of the cause of action.\u201d 218 Mich App 518 (Taylor, P.J., dissenting). The applicable standard of care is an essential element in a medical malpractice action. <em>Locke v Pachtman, </em>446 Mich 216, 222; 521 NW2d 786 (1994). Section 2169 essentially modifies that element to require that proof of malpractice \u201cemanate from sources of reliable character as defined by the Legislature.\u201d 218 Mich App 518 (Taylor, P.J., dissenting). As stated, we will not declare a statute to be violative of art 6, \u00a7 5 merely because it is drafted in terms of the admission or exclusion of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We appreciate the difficulty that attends the drawing of the line between \u201cpractice and procedure\u201d and substantive law. That the task is difficult and one that must be made on a case-by-case basis is no legitimate challenge to our constitutional duty to draw that line in a fashion that respects this Court\u2019s constitutional authority as well as that of the Legislature. The rule we adopt today recognizes the difficulty inherent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>this line-drawing task\u2014one that the drafters of the 1963 Constitution themselves acknowledged. See <em>supra </em>at 32-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Finally, despite the dissent\u2019s apparent anxiety about our supposed lack of fidelity to the protection of \u201cjudicial turf,\u201d we merely note that it is ultimately this Court that will determine in each instance where the substance/procedure line must be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We conclude that MCL 600.2169; MSA 27A.2169 is an enactment of substantive law. As such, it does not impermissibly infringe this Court\u2019s constitutional rule-making authority over \u201cpractice and procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In <em>McDougall, </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of defendant Eliuk.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In <em>Sobran, </em>the Court of Appeals relied on MRE 702 to affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition to defendant McKendrick, despite the fact that the parties never argued the application of MRE 702 and the trial court never ruled on the issue. We do not reach the propriety of that decision because it is clear that the trial court correctly granted summary disposition under \u00a7 2169. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals because it reached the correct result.</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-8\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley and Corrigan, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b333-9\">Taylor, J., concurred with Young, J., in <em>Sobran </em>only, and took no part in the decision in <em>McDougall.</em></judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\"> Dr. Robia testified that he practiced internal medicine on a limited \u201cmoonlight basis\u201d until 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-15\"> The statute was subsequently amended in 1993, resulting in changes that are not important for purposes of our decision.

The essence of the dissent\u2019s position is that, if this Court creates a rule of evidence, that rule is, ipse dixit, one encompassing only procedure. No doctrinal support for this proposition is offered. That this Court has the <em>power </em>to declare that a matter of substance is procedure is no answer to the question whether it has the constitutional <em>authority </em>to do so.

If the dissent were entirely forthcoming, it would have noted that what the authors of the commentary <em>actually </em>concluded was that \u201cthe legislative policy behind [the statute] is not clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If such policy had been clear, the authors concluded, \u201cit would raise a serious question as to the validity of [the court rule].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> We find curious the dissent\u2019s suggestion that, because many of our rules of evidence are undergirded by judicially recognized \u201cpolicy\u201d determinations, such policies are inherently procedural in nature and thus beyond the constitutional power of the Legislature to change. <em>Post </em>at 59-64. We also find it at least a debatable proposition that a court-enacted rule of evidence embodying public policy affecting broad social and commercial interests is, as the dissent would have it, immune from legislative change.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Thus, without being drawn into the dissent\u2019s invitation to decide hypothetical cases not before us, we simply observe that it is not ineluctably clear, for example, that MRE 407\u2019s exclusion of evidence of subsequent remedial measures is one having so few substantive policy implications that the Legislature has no constitutional authority to enact an alternative policy. It can hardly be argued that MRE 407 encompasses no important policies involving commerce or legal rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\"> Colo Const, art 6, \u00a7 21 provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he supreme court shall make and promulgate rules governing the administration of all courts and shall make and promulgate rules governing practice and procedure in civil and criminal cases . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\"> The amendment was offered by Delegates Ann E.

For the reasons detailed below, I would find that the statute is an impermissible legislative usurpation of the judiciary\u2019s authority and, thus, is unconstitutional. The majority, however, rather than merely reaching the opposite conclusion, has elected to redefine those barriers that have heretofore existed as the lines of demarcation between the three equal branches of our government, and, in doing so, not only to permit, but even court limitation by, the Legislature of the judiciary\u2019s role. While the effects of such action may well, given the Legislature\u2019s current composition, be pleasing to the majority of the Court today, the majority has invited a stampede over a fence created by our constitution\u2019s framers. I would not quibble with constitutional boundaries that have existed long before the impetus for the current, result-specific statutory enactment, and in looking beyond such an impetus and to those traditional borders, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">At issue in these cases is the interaction of the statute in question, MCL 600.2169; MSA 27A.2169, with MRE 702. Both concern the qualifications of an expert witness to give testimony. MRE 702 is a general rule of evidence, while \u00a7 2169 pertains only to medical and dental malpractice actions. At the outset, it is helpful to present the contents of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The original version of the statute at issue, the 1986 version, reads as follows in the relevant section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>(1) In an action alleging medical malpractice, if the defendant is a specialist, a person shall not give expert testimony on the appropriate standard of care unless the person is or was a physician licensed to practice medicine or osteopathic medicine and surgery or a dentist licensed to practice dentistry in this or another state and meets both of the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">(a) Specializes, or specialized at the time of the occurrence which is the basis for the action, in the same specialty or a related, relevant area of medicine or osteopathic medicine and surgery or dentistry as the specialist who is the defendant in the medical malpractice action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">(b) Devotes, or devoted at the time of the occurrence which is the basis for the action, a substantial portion of his or her professional time to the active clinical practice of medicine or osteopathic medicine and surgery or the active clinical practice of dentistry, or to the instruction of students in an accredited medical school, osteopathic medical school, or dental school in the same specialty or a related, relevant area of health care as the specialist who is the defendant in the medical malpractice action. [MCL 600.2169; MSA 27A.2169.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In 1993, the Legislature amended the statute, providing additional requirements for admission of expert testimony. The 1993 amendments made substantial changes, as can been seen below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">(1) In an action alleging medical malpractice, a person shall not give expert testimony on the appropriate standard of practice or care unless the person is licensed as a health professional in this state or another state and meets the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">(a) If the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is a specialist, specializes at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for the action in the same specialty as the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered. However, if the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is a specialist who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>is board certified, the expert witness must be a specialist who is board certified in that specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">(b) Subject to subdivision (c), during the year immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the claim or action, devoted a majority of his or her professional time to either or both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">(i) The active clinical practice of the same health profession in which the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is licensed and, if that party is a specialist, the active clinical practice of that specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">(ii) The instruction of students in an accredited health professional school or accredited residency or clinical research program in the same health profession in which the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is licensed and, if that party is a specialist, an accredited health professional school or accredited residency or clinical research program in the same specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">(c) If the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is a general practitioner, the expert witness, during the year immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the claim or action, devoted a majority of his or her professional time to either or both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">(i) Active clinical practice as a general practitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">(ii) Instruction of students in an accredited health professional school or accredited residency or clinical research program in the same health profession in which the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is licensed. [MCL 600.2169; MSA 27A.2169.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">As noted, this Court has long provided a court rule, MRE 702, that outlines the requirements for admissibility of expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">If the court determines that recognized scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.

[Const 1963, art 3, \u00a72.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Writing for this Court, Justice Cooley offered the following analysis of the basis of this doctrine, and reasoning to which the intervening years and decisions have had little to add:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">Our government is one whose powers have been carefully apportioned between three distinct departments, which emanate alike from the people, have their powers alike limited and defined by the constitution, are of equal dignity, and within their respective spheres of action equally independent. One makes the laws, another applies the laws in contested cases, while the third must see that the laws are executed. This division is accepted as a necessity hi all free governments, and the very apportionment of power to one department is understood to be a prohibition of its exercise by either of the others. The executive is for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>bidden to exercise judicial power by the same implication which forbids the courts to take upon themselves his duties. <em>[Sutherland v Governor, </em>29 Mich 320, 324-325 (1874).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Until today, we have found no reason to depart from this longstanding doctrine in our recent decisions. As we have noted, \u201can indispensable ingredient of the concept of coequal branches of government is that \u2018each branch must recognize and respect the limits on its own authority and the boundaries of the authority delegated to the other branches.\u2019 \u201d <em>Employees &amp; Judges of the Second Judicial Dist Court v Hillsdale Co, </em>423 Mich 705, 717; 378 NW2d 744 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">As a prelude to the analysis of the instant case, I note that, heretofore, it has been without question that the authority to determine rules of procedure in judicial matters rests exclusively with the judiciary and this Court. As we noted in <em>Perin v Peuler (On Rehearing), </em>373 Mich 531, 541-542; 130 NW2d 4 (1964), this rule-making authority can be traced from our earlier constitutions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to its present inception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">The supreme court shall by general rules establish, modify, amend and simplify the practice and procedure in all courts of this state. The distinctions between law and equity proceedings shall, as far as practicable, be abolished. The office of master in chancery is prohibited. [Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>As we made clear in Perin<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at 541, \u201c[t]he function of enacting and amending judicial rales of practice and procedure has been committed exclusively to this Court; a function with which the Legislature may not meddle or interfere save as the Court may acquiesce and adopt for retention at judicial will.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Indeed, as will be seen below, our decisions in this regard have, to date, been so consistent that the legislative analysis prepared in the course of the drafting of this statute foresaw this very problem.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">In our prior cases as well, beginning long before <em>Perin, </em>we have held that, where a statute and court rule conflict, the court rule shall control, absent the sort of acquiescence alluded to in <em>Perin. Berman v Psiharis, </em>325 Mich 528, 533; 39 NW2d 58 (1949); <em>In re Koss Estate, </em>340 Mich 185, 189-190; 65 NW2d 316 (1954).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">While such an acquiescence to a statute that intrudes upon a court rule has not been often forthcoming, I note that, on occasion, this Court has sidestepped issues such as this, and because such occasions are now offered by the defendant and the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>sent below as examples of such acquiescence, they may usefully be reviewed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In <em>People v Daniels, </em>394 Mich 524; 232 NW2d 171 (1975), a memorandum opinion, we held that a statute dealing with one situation would be given precedence over a court rule dealing with another situation, both of which concerned the availability of a personal recognizance bond, when both applied to the same individual. It is fair to say that over the course of the three paragraphs that comprise <em>Daniels, </em>this Court did not consider the constitutional question raised here today.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">More recently, in <em>People v Adair, 452 </em>Mich 473; 550 NW2d 505 (1996), we were called on to interpret our rape-shield statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We were not, however, presented with the constitutional question we face today. Indeed, while we have adopted a court rule dealing with some aspects of the rape-shield statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>have another general rule which arguably covers certain aspects included in the statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we nonetheless confined our analysis solely to the statute. While this analysis was limited to the question presented, we noted in dicta the potential conflict of MRE 403 with certain language of the rape-shield statute, which was not directly disputed in the case before us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Although we did little more than note the potential conflict that appeared on the face of the statute, it is fair to say that our opinion on this point has resulted in some disagreement and academic debate regarding how we intended to address this conflict.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Today we find the defendants arguing that our approach in <em>Adair </em>amounted to a silent acquiescence, and thus a \u201csoftening\u201d of our view of legislative enactments that intrude into court rules. While it appears that open questions may remain concerning the interaction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the rape-shield statute and our court rules,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the careful resolution of such questions would appear to require the presentation of a case where a conflict actually appears. There was no indication of this in <em>Adair, </em>and, hence, no call for us to entertain such a question. This Court has long addressed only those issues properly before it, and the defendants\u2019 attempts to view such restraint as indicative of a particular view on the merits of a question not addressed are ill-grounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">It is equally true, however, that we must be mindful of the fact that separation of powers requires not only that we dutifully guard against an encroachment on the powers granted to this Court, but also requires, with equal and compelling force, that we dutifully respect those powers granted to the other branches of government and abstain from any exercise thereof. It is this delicate balance that has led us to respect, to eveiy extent possible, the enactments of the other branches, and, where reasonably and realistically possible, to find no conflict should such an interpretation be possible. Accordingly, we have, where possible, read enactments of the Legislature that presented a potential conflict with our court rules in a fashion that would allow both provisions to exist in harmony. See <em>People v Robinson, </em>386 Mich 551; 194 NW2d 709 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>(1972), <em>People v Mateo, </em>453 Mich 203; 551 NW2d 891 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Where it can be said that there is no inherent conflict between the legislative enactment and the judiciary\u2019s rule, \u201c[w]e are not required to decide whether [the] statute is a legislative attempt to supplant the Court\u2019s authority.\u201d <em>Mateo </em>at 211. \u201cWe do not lightly presume that the Legislature intended a conflict, calling into question this Court\u2019s authority to control practice and procedure in the courts.\u201d <em>People v Dobben, </em>440 Mich 679, 697, n 22; 488 NW2d 726 (1992). Mindful of these constraints, I proceed to the cases at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\n<em>mcdougall</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">This case arrives before us in a somewhat unique fashion. While, as noted throughout this opinion, questions of conflict between statutes and court rules appear before us from time to time, the genesis of this conflict is unusual. Previously, we generally have been presented with questions of conflict where a court rule was alleged to be in conflict with some statute that existed before its enactment. On other occasions, such as <em>Berman, supra, </em>it would appear that such conflict was inadvertent in nature, with the conflict itself appearing only when the provisions actually interacted in the course of a dispute. Here, however, we find the Legislature enacted \u00a7 2169 fully mindful and very much intending that it would often compel different conclusions than the court rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>when applied to factual situations. As was noted below in dissent, and now by the majority, the legislative history available in this matter clearly indicates that the Legislature wished to limit the testimony of those it perceived as \u201cprofessional witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Without disputing the potential difficulties such witnesses might present, it is nonetheless clear that the Legislature was well aware of MRE 702 and endeavored to craft a rule that would serve as a \u201chigher bar\u201d to be cleared before an expert\u2019s testimony would be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Indeed, the very problem at issue today was also presented to the Legislature. In the report of the House Legislative Analysis Section on HB 5169, pp 2-3, issued November 20, 1985, under the section entitled \u201cArguments Against,\u201d it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The determination of the qualifications of witnesses in trial court proceedings falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts and may not be invaded by the legislature. The Michigan Court Rules already require that an expert be qualified before he or she may testify, and it is always within the court\u2019s discretion to disqualify a witness. <em>[Id. </em>at 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In such a case, given the clear intent of the Legislature, and its awareness of the conflict, our reluctance to find a conflict and desire to, as much as possible, respect the enactments of our coequal branch, must face the reality of a conflict apparent in both intent and the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The trial court ruled Dr. Robia was disqualified under \u00a7 2169, and yet also ruled, that, should \u00a7 2169 be held invalid, the very same witness, offering the same deposition testimony, in the same case, would be qualified under MRE 702. By way of the practice requirements of the statute, Dr. Robia is unqualified to testify, if it controls. The trial court found, however, that he was nonetheless qualified under MRE 702, and thus he possessed \u201crecognized scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d by virtue of his \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\u201d to be able to assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Moreover, while, at times, we have been able to find a statute to amount to no more than a restatement, in different form, of a court rule or rules, i.e., Mateo, it is important that the entire thrust of this rule is <em>exclusionary </em>in nature. Section 2169 does not offer additional means to interpret or apply MRE 702, but rather offers an entirely additional test. As can be seen in the case of Dr. Robia, a trial court could well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>find MRE 702 to be complied with, and yet \u00a7 2169 to still preclude the testimony. Rather than offering an alternate means for a court to determine a witness\u2019 competency, \u00a7 2169 in reality offers only an additional test to preclude a witness from offering testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In doing so, it impinges on the discretion of the Court under MRE 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Finally, that there is a conflict is so precisely because, as noted above, the statute was drafted to accomplish this purpose. As was noted in the dissent below,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Legislature became unsatisfied with the manner in which some courts were exercising their discretion regarding expert testimony, and enacted a statute designed to limit such discretion. In accomplishing such intent, the wording of the statute was successful, and belies the attempts by defendant to now suggest that it is but an aid to such discretion. There can be no evasion of a conflict in this case, and thus I agree with the majority on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">When confronted with a conflict between a court rule and a statute, the invariable question is which should control. As we have stated, the nearly invariable rule (until today), required by the doctrine of sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>aration of powers is that the judiciary\u2019s rule, properly enacted within its own domain, must prevail.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are not, however, in the course of such decisions, unique in addressing this issue. Our state\u2019s current constitution is of sufficiently recent vintage that there exists an extensive history regarding its enactment. Included is the precise conflict we see today, and its resolution is compelling evidence of the course we should follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">In the course of the constitutional convention, there was debate over what would become Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5. The majority view was quoted above. There was, however, an unsuccessful attempt, offered by three members of the Committee on the Judicial Branch,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that, if enacted, would have specifically approved of both the Legislature\u2019s action in enacting \u00a7 2169 and a decision in favor of its validity. The proposed language (the \u201cDonnelly/Leibrand/McAllister amendment\u201d) was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">The supreme court shall by general rules establish, modify, amend and simplify the practice and procedure in all courts in the state, <em>it being provided that where there is a conflict between supreme court rule and a statute concerning evidence or substantive law the statute shall prevail. </em>[1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 1289 (the emphasized language was not adopted in the final document).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Clearly, were such language adopted, it would have amounted to an express endorsement of the result sought by defendants. The result, however, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>debate,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> was that the proposed amendment was soundly defeated, 75-32. <em>Id., </em>p 1294. The drafters of our constitution squarely considered whether the Legislature should be allowed to intrude upon this Court\u2019s power to determine rules of evidence. They answered the question with a resounding \u201cno,\u201d and the constitution that resulted from their efforts permits no such thing. My conclusion today merely echoes their determination. In doing so, I would hold that MCL 600.2169; MSA 27A.2169 unconstitutionally invades the province of the judiciary, and thus must be declared invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">It was argued below, however, and now is accepted by the majority today, that this statute addresses a substantive, as opposed to procedural, concern, and, thus, it is within the domain of the Legislature in any event, with citation below to <em>Smith v Smith, </em>433 Mich 606; 447 NW2d 715 (1989).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> While, as noted below, that case lacked a majority opinion, there is no dispute of the basic proposition for which it was apparently cited, that the Legislature alone controls substantive law making. See note 18. The actual dispute in <em>Smith </em>centered on the interaction of two statutes: MCL 552.17a; MSA 25.97(1), as it then existed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>and the Age of Majority Act. While there was little common ground with respect to rationale, the Court was unanimous in urging the Legislature to revisit the statutes at issue.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Relevant to the question before us today, the <em>Smith </em>majority\u2019s decision resulted in a reading of the statutes that conflicted with MCR 3.209(B)(1)(b) as it then existed. Chief Justice Riley\u2019s opinion offered several rationales for why this was correct, but the primary focus rested on the view that the statutes in question, one that defined the age of majority in this state, and the other that provided for child support for minors, were substantive in nature, and thus the Legislature\u2019s determination would control. Justice Boyle\u2019s opinion did not address this issue, confining itself to statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The argument then goes, as offered both in dissent below, and by the majority today, that the statutes herein amount to substantive law determinations and are thus within the province of the Legislature. As noted, there is no dispute that, were the antecedent true, the logic of the analysis would follow.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>reaching the various positions advanced by Chief Justice Riley\u2019s <em>Smith </em>opinion, I am compelled to reject this argument because it is apparent that the necessary prerequisite for such concerns, that the rule be one of substantive law, is not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">It was offered in dissent below that because the statute herein \u201cconstitutes a substantive change in a statutory cause of action that originated from the common law, which the Legislature is authorized to effect, it takes precedence over MRE 702. <em>Smith, </em>supra.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> I disagree. While the statute at issue represented a departure in the practice of courts as it relates to medical malpractice actions, it does not represent a substantive change in the cause of action. Rather than changing, adding, or eliminating elements of a cause of action (any of which might amount to a substantive change), the statute merely imposes conditions on expert testimony. Indeed, what the statute does, as discussed above, is usurp the province of a rule of evidence. The fact that this statute may serve to make it substantially more difficult, practically speaking, to bring a medical malpractice action does nothing to alter the substance of such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">It has long been held (again, no more so as of today) that \u201c \u2018[t]he judicial function constitutionally empowers the courts to make their own rules of procedure, including rules of evidence . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Perin, </em>373 Mich 541 (emphasis deleted).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A primary theme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>both of the majority here and in the dissent below was that the Legislature is better equipped to undertake a deliberative approach to making policy decisions. While that is certainly correct (and indeed, likely beyond debate) regarding substantive determinations of law, this view fails to acknowledge that policy decisions also play a role in the evidentiary rules of this Court, and that this Court is not only the best equipped province for such rule making, but also the constitutionally recognized one. As we noted in the course of discussing due process concerns (hence the constitutional reference), \u201cPolicy, not constitutional limitations, underlies most of Michigan\u2019s evidentiary code, and the determination of that policy has been explicitly left to this Court by art 6, \u00a7 5, of the 1963 Constitution.\u201d <em>People v Allen, </em>429 Mich 558, 573, n 10; 420 NW2d 499 (1988). Accordingly, this argument falters, as where the statute addresses only a rule of evidence, by its very nature procedural, the halting of such an intrusion would take nothing away from the proper domain of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The majority, rather than examining <em>Smith, </em>seems content to merely attack <em>Perin </em>as ill-grounded.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>While the majority would chastise <em>Perin </em>for its citation of Wigmore, the majority\u2019s citation of a Court of Appeals opinion of recent vintage and identical authorship as the majority opinion is hardly more persuasive. The remainder of the authority offered for the proposition advanced is a 1957 law review article and dicta offered by Justice Williams in <em>Kirby v Larson, </em>400 Mich 585, 598; 256 NW2d 400 (1977), in a portion of his opinion that failed to gamer the allegiance of a majority of the Court. While certainly not disputing the esteem of the latter author, I fear the majority has misconstrued both Justice Williams\u2019 words and his meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">While the <em>Kirby </em>Court decided the case on very distinct grounds, Justice Williams offered a considerably broader opinion, joined only by two other justices, suggesting, inter alia, that a statute prohibiting the admission of evidence of a conviction for violation of the motor vehicle code (or similar local ordinances) in any civil action was invalid as being con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tradictory to GCR 1963, 607. In the course of this discussion, Justice Williams wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">Thus, since admissibility of a traffic ticket is an evidentiary question, the court rule supersedes the statute. As suggested in 3 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), p 404, \u201cBecause no clear legislative policy reflecting considerations other than judicial dispatch of litigation can be identified,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> section 731 should be construed simply as a statutory rule of practice, validly superseded by Rule 607 to the extent applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">[400 Mich 598.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Thus, viewing the entire text of this discussion, several things can be seen. First, of course, this discussion had its genesis in the commercial annotations offered to the court rules of the time by the authors noted. Second, while speaking of the inability to identify policy considerations other than judicial dispatch, the annotation authors themselves identified two distinct potential, albeit \u201cnot clear,\u201d policy considerations, one the majority today would likely argue could be within the legislative realm.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Third, and most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>importantly, the phrase \u201c[w]e conclude that a statutory rule of evidence violates Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5 <em>only </em>when\u201d <em>(ante </em>at 30 [emphasis added]) appears nowhere in <em>Kirby, </em>nor in the sources from which the quotation in <em>Kirby </em>was derived. Rather, the majority has taken a justification offered in plurality dicta and rearranged it so that now, says the majority, the reverse is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In <em>Kirby, </em>Justice Williams suggested that no legislative policy other than judicial dispatch could be found to support the statute, even though he himself then, in footnote 7, cited Honigman &amp; Hawkins as suggesting two such rationales. What the majority says today, however, stands that quotation on its head: \u201conly when \u2018 \u201cno clear legislative policy reflecting considerations other than judicial dispatch of litigation can be identified\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(ante </em>at 30) will we find a statute to be unconstitutional. So, if a statute and a court rule conflict, and the matter is one concerning solely judicial dispatch of litigation, then the court rule must control. But if the statute has as its rationale a policy choice regarding anything other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>judicial dispatch,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the majority holds that it reflects a decision of substantive law, rather than practice and procedure, and thus the statute prevails, the Legislature being the better policy forum.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">So we must wonder exactly how many of our court rules deal with items that might evoke considerations other than judicial dispatch, and thus be subject to alteration on the basis of those considerations, evidencing decisions of \u201csubstantive\u201d law by the Legislature. As a starting point, it is worth recalling that judicial dispatch is generally taken to be somewhat synonymous with judicial efficiency. Presuming a definition of judicial unnecessary in this context, we find that the word dispatch refers, again in this context, to the prompt or speedy transaction or disposal of matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Dispatch (di spach\u2019) <em>v.t. </em>1. to send off or away with speed, as a messenger, telegram, body of troops, etc. 2. to dismiss (a person), as after an audience. 3. to put to death; kill: <em>The spy was promptly dispatched. </em>4. to transact or dispose of (a matter) promptly or speedily. <em>\u2014v.i. </em>5. <em>Archaic, </em>to hasten; be quick. <em>\u2014n. </em>6. the sending off of a messenger, letter, etc., to a destination. 7. the act of putting to death; killing; execution. <em>8. prompt or speedy transaction, as of business. </em>9. expeditious performance; promptness, or speed: <em>Proceed with all possible dispatch. </em>10. <em>Com. </em>a. a method of effecting a speedy delivery of goods, money, etc. b. a conveyance or organization for the expeditious transmission of goods, money, etc. <em>[The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition Unabridged, </em>p 567 (emphasis added).][<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">So, then, the majority offers us a rule today that says, where matters of judicial efficiency alone are at hand, the judiciary is supreme. However, where other concerns might arise, and might implicate policy decisions that the majority has, by focusing solely on the Legislature\u2019s abilities in such regard (and ignoring the proper place of such concerns in our own regulation of judicial matters), left now solely to the Legislature, it must be \u201csubstantive,\u201d and our court rules will suffice only until the Legislature speaks, at which time, the rules must yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Thus, if this is to be the rule, we should consider exactly what of our court rules might deal solely with concerns of judicial dispatch, and thus be insulated from legislative intrusion, and which might reflect those policy considerations that the majority now finds, even within the context of regulating our own, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>until now, coequal branch of government, the judiciary incompetent to undertake. Is a rule that precludes relevant evidence on the grounds of unfair prejudice concerned solely with judicial efficiency, or might it reflect a policy judgment, best made elsewhere, that some evidence, though relevant, is likely to have an undue effect on the outcome of a trial? MRE 403. Are rules limiting the admissibility of character evidence merely rules ensuring efficiency at trial, or do they reflect a policy decision that character is not probative of conduct? MRE 404, 405. Is a rule that bans introduction of subsequent remedial measures merely a tool of judicial efficiency, or does it reflect a policy judgment that the Court will not penalize those who attempt to repair harmful situations by allowing evidence of such remedies? MRE 407.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Are rules addressing the admissibility of statements made in the course of compromise, payment of medical expenses, and plea negotiations merely tools to speedily move along the judicial forum, or do they reflect substantive policy decisions regarding the advisability of encouraging such discussions? MRE 408-410. What about a rule prohibiting discussion of the presence of liability insurance? MRE 411. Wfliat of requirements as to who may be a witness? MRE 601-607. Impeachment by evidence of conviction of a crime? MRE 609. Recall as well that the viability of the <em>Kirby </em>plurality\u2019s discussion regarding such matters is now seriously in question following the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ity\u2019s opinion. Is there a substantive policy question about when court-appointed experts are required, or how they should be compensated? MRE 706. And in MRE 803, alone, do we find literally dozens of policy judgments regarding the veracity of various items, many of which the Legislature might have an interest in addressing (i.e., public records, prior convictions, documents affecting an interest in property, vital statistics, statements made for the purposes of medical treatment . . .)?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The point of this discussion is not to invite the Legislature to discover that the majority has knocked down the fence that has separated our branches until this day, nor to invite it to graze upon those of our court rules it wishes to modify. The effect of the majority\u2019s decision, however, is to invite the Legislature to trample whatever rules of the judiciary might arguably concern something other than judicial efficiency, and the majority\u2019s decision herein offers so little to support its conclusion that the matter discussed today is substantive that it invites legislative \u201cquestions\u201d far more fanciful than the ones above.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Recall again what it is that the majority finds persuasive in holding that the instant matter is substantive. Consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">Applying the substance/procedure analysis set forth above, we conclude that \u00a7 2169 is an enactment of substantive law. It reflects wide-ranging and substantial policy considerations relating to medical malpractice actions against specialists. We agree with the Court of Appeals dissent in <em>McDougall </em>that the statute</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">\u201creflects a careful legislative balancing of policy considerations about the importance of the medical profession to the people of Michigan, the economic viability of medical spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>cialists, the social costs of \u2018defensive medicine,\u2019 the availability and affordability of medical care and health insurance, the allocation of risks, the costs of malpractice insurance, and manifold other factors, including, no doubt, political factors\u2014all matters well beyond the competence of the judiciary to reevaluate as justiciable issues. [218 Mich App 518 (Taylor, P.J., dissenting).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">Clearly then, the statute does not involve the mere dispatch of judicial business. <em>[Ante </em>at 35.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Therein, we see the key to the majority\u2019s decision, a key that flings open the door that has previously separated our branches of government. All the Legislature need do is determine some questions outside the \u201cmere dispatch of judicial business,\u201d and the Court\u2019s own regulation of its own judicial function may be cast aside. As demonstrated above, many, perhaps most, of our court rules are susceptible to questions being found under as flexible and one-sided a \u201ctest\u201d as the majority gives us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Very shortly after he authored the <em>Kirby </em>decision and dicta, Justice WmiAMS joined a unanimous Court in taking the most unusual action of addressing the legislative and executive branches sua sponte regarding another attempted legislative encroachment on the judicial branch\u2019s domain, the Open Meetings Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2 divides the powers of government among three branches and commits to each branch exclusive exercise of the functions properly belonging to it, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Constitution. This separation of powers is designed to preserve the independence of the three branches of government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">Art 6, \u00a7 1 vests the judicial power of the state exclusively in one court of justice. Section 4 of that article vests general superintending control over all courts in the state in the Supreme Court and \u00a7 5 confers upon this Court the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>power to make rules to govern the practice and procedure within the courts.

It is our opinion that 1976 PA 267 is an impermissible intrusion into the most basic day-to-day exercise of the constitutionally derived judicial powers. <em>[In re 1976 PA 267, </em>400 Mich 660, 662-663; 255 NW2d 635 (1977).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The logic, constitutional support, and underlying premise of a government of checks and balances, all these things from which this decision arose, remain true today. Less true, however, is the majority\u2019s recognition of them. One must wonder how a question such as one raised by <em>In re 1976 PA 267 </em>would be resolved under the majority\u2019s analysis today. While it would appear that the question of open versus closed deliberative processes would have a marked effect on judicial efficiency, one would be hard-pressed indeed to argue that the policy concerns underlying the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the OMA had anything at all to do with judicial dispatch. Thus, it would seem that, under the majority\u2019s rationale, <em>In re 1976 PA 267 </em>should be decided differently. And yet, consider <em>Federated Publications, Inc v Michigan State Univ Bd of Trustees, </em>460 Mich 75; 594 NW2d 491 (1999). Would the majority afford to constitutional universities more protection than a coequal branch of government? Doubtful indeed, particularly when the majority\u2019s reference to <em>In re 1976 PA 267 </em>in this recent case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>recalled. This is the schizophrenia the majority\u2019s decision today represents. What is substantive is either (1) whatever the Legislature says is substantive, or (2) whatever the majority says is substantive, with the two alternatives likely becoming opposed the next time the majority of this Court and the Legislature come to part ideological company. I would rest the decision today on firmer ground than the quicksand the majority constructs, given that it is likely to swallow up a great many of our Court\u2019s controls on our judicial branch, unless, of course, the majority is willing to engage in a cynical effort to control the shifting of such sand to its pleasure.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">It may be asked then, given the Legislature\u2019s obvious intent and deliberation on this matter, why we should not acquiesce to its wishes, as contemplated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>in <em>Perin.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>While the focus of defendant\u2019s presentations here have not been primarily directed, other than a few references at oral argument, toward this end, the question itself is nonetheless legitimate. I must conclude, however, that it should be answered in the negative.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Now and again, the Court may endeavor to \u201crebalance\u201d its scales when an ill-advised trend appears.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> No information has been presented to convince us that such dark clouds appear on the horizon. While counsel pointed to specific instances of very questionable \u201cexpert\u201d testimony, the trial court, as always, retains discretion to prohibit such testimony, and such decisions remain reviewable on appeal in the usual fashion. Indeed, in the two years since the Court of Appeals issued its decision in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>neither the judicial nor healthcare systems have demonstrated any ill effects, and, in view of the limited life span of this statute and recall of practices as they existed before its enactment, none would seem to be expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Furthermore, while the statute seems too ill-balanced to be adopted as a rule, it also can be seen, both from the instant cases and hypothetical situations, to be lacking in the relevance of its criteria to its result. Certainly, for expert witnesses to be of help to a court, they must be well-informed in their subject area, or, in common parlance, qualified. The statute\u2019s requirements, growing more stringent with the 1993 amendments, have taken this laudable goal to an extreme that would often frustrate its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Recall that, as it now exists, the statute requires a specialist for specialist \u201cmatch-up\u201d between witnesses and defendants. It would seem that under this rule, were a defendant practicing medicine outside his specialty area (which might well be a factor in the underlying claim) when malpractice was alleged, the statute would seem to require, nonetheless, a witness in his specialty, as opposed to one who specializes in the area he was practicing in. The result of the statute would seem to favor having a witness as ^qualified as the defendant in such cases. As can be seen in the facts of <em>Sobran, </em>the lines between various medical specialties are often not the most well-defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Such concerns aside, the statute fails to recognize many of the avenues by which an expert might come to have knowledge of the subject at hand, and gives undue credence to other considerations. Moreover, it limits itself to only medical and dental malpractice actions. To the extent this Court might wish to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>examine MRE 702 as it relates to qualification of experts, and the need for this has not been shown, we would also, one would expect, require cause to arbitrarily limit such considerations to only a certain type of case or class of defendants. Once again, the Court\u2019s paramount role must be that of a neutral arbiter, and defendants have offered no reason why the Court should adopt a particular rule limited solely to those similarly situated to themselves.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>F</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In view of the trial court\u2019s ruling on MRE 702, and in light of my analysis herein, it is clear that summary disposition was improperly granted in <em>McDougall. I </em>would note, however, that it is not entirely clear whether the trial court intended to rule that Dr. Robia was qualified under MRE 702, or, alternatively, intended to reserve its final ruling on that question. Thus, a remand to the trial court would appear necessary so that it might clarify its decision under MRE 702, and, if necessary, undertake further proceedings.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in that case and remand the matter to the Wayne Circuit Court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>SOBRAN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The Court of Appeals ruled in <em>Sobran </em>that Dr. Caminker was unqualified under MRE 702. This mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ter was not passed on by the trial court, or argued by the parties in the Court of Appeals. The trial court based its grant of summary disposition for defendant on \u00a7 2169. As can be seen above, a grant of summary disposition based on that statute cannot stand under my analysis. Thus, I would turn to the MRE 702 basis found by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Unlike the Court below, this Court has had the benefit of briefing and argument by the parties on the issue of Dr. Caminker\u2019s qualifications under MRE 702. Nonetheless, the trial court was never presented with the opportunity to determine whether the matter was, as construed by the Court of Appeals, a surgical malpractice case or, rather, as argued by the plaintiff, a failure-to-diagnose case. Clearly, different types of experts and different standards of care may apply in each situation. The trial court\u2019s entire analysis was further improperly constrained by \u00a7 2169. Accordingly, it would be appropriate to remand the matter to the trial court so that it might reconsider its ruling on the admissibility of Dr. Caminker\u2019s testimony under MRE 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Given that the Court of Appeals lacked the benefit of either a record on this issue or briefing by the parties, I would specifically note that the trial court should not consider itself bound by the decision of the Court of Appeals on the issue of MRE 702, and, likewise, would express no view on the merits of that issue, believing it should be decided by the trial court in the first instance. I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"Apr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>McDougall, </em>and reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Sobran, </em>remanding both cases to the trial courts for further proceedings. \u201cThat this prerogative of the courts includes the power to formulate and to alter the rules of evidence ought not to be doubted.\u201d <em>Perin </em>at 542.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> While we have, at least until today, moved cautiously and hesitantly in making these determinations, aware of the coequal dignity of our Legislature, the constitutional basis for the conclusion I reach should not be doubted. In speaking against the Donnelly/Leibrand/McAllister amendment (and thus in favor of the version adopted in our current constitution), Committee on the Judicial Branch Chairman Robert J. Danhof noted the clear distinction that the statute impermissibly crossed: \u201cThe Legislature may write statutes as they relate to the substantive law, but the rulemaking power of the court as it relates to the admission of evidence should not be limited, as this would do.\u201d 1 Official Record, <em>supra, </em>p 1289. The drafters of our current constitution declined to turn against the provisions of every constitution in our state\u2019s history and permit the Legislature to impose restraints on the judiciary\u2019s power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to determine rales of evidence. I find no reason to permit such action today. The statute, MCL 600.2169; MSA 27A.2169, is an invalid intrusion on the province of this Court, and, in glibly stating that that is not true, the majority abdicates the domain of this Court to the discretion of the Legislature. I can only hope that, at some point, likely as the ideological alignment of the Legislature and the majority of this Court diverge, we will again revisit this issue, and rebuild the historic divide between the courts and the Legislature, which the majority has carelessly toppled today.</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-6\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\"> The powers of the government shall be divided into three distinct departments; the Legislative, the Executive and the Judicial; and one department shall never exercise the powers of another, except in such cases as are expressly provided for in this constitution.

The difference between our approaches does not arise from any effort of mine to intrude upon the Legislature\u2019s domain, but rather from my refusal to allow the Legislature to intrude upon the judiciary\u2019s province. The majority\u2019s view effectively allows the Legislature to determine, at its will, what might be substantive, and thus, when it is inclined, to override a judiciary decision with its own preferences. While the majority, or at least the dissent below, would likely attack my view as \u201cantimajoritarian,\u201d its own view is deficient in failing to recognize that the branches of government are in fact coequal, by establishing what amounts to an undefined trump card for the Legislature to hold. I have no doubt the Legislature prevails when the suit to be followed is substantive.

The majority\u2019s rationale for the destruction of <em>Perin </em>is that we now realize that substantive law is the domain of the Legislature, whereas <em>Perin </em>did not. I submit that such a realization did not first occur in July 1999, or 1982, or even 1963. Indeed, as noted in the text of this opinion, that truly was beyond (and not even a subject of) debate at our last constitutional convention. What is quite novel, however, is a suggestion that none before has been aware of this. Recall the limiting words of the supposedly overbroad <em>Perin, </em>brushed over by the majority in its haste to out the spot it leaves on its effort to expose the judiciary\u2019s impartiality to the Legislature\u2019s control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201cThe judicial function constitutionally empowers the courts to make their own rules of procedure, including rules of evidence <em>(subject only to specific constitutional limitations).\u2019\u2019 [Perin </em>at 541 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">What then was the Comet speaking of in its citation of constitutional limitations, but the very prohibition of substantive lawmaking unquestionably endorsed by the delegates of our last constitutional convention (and recognized by this Court and many others long before)? And yet today we see the majority reveling in this limitation as though it is both a basis for its decision and a revelation to the rest of the world, that somehow strayed from the path of light. There is a tendency among those who walk under a standard espousing such views to attribute every past decision with which they disagree to a failure to share their enlightenment, and, equally, a zeal evidenced to, with much dispatch, overrule all such prior decisions as simply wrong. The debate is not so simple, nor those who came before us so unenlightened, as we are led to believe by the majority herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> Honigman &amp; Hawkins suggest that two possible policies underlie the rule, one that such convictions are not credible evidence or are unduly prejudicial, and the other that the policy is to encourage guilty pleas in traffic courts. However, since, as drafted, the statute relates only to the admissibility of evidence, a subject clearly more within the rule-making competence of the courts, the rule should supersede the statute where the two conflict. 3 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan'Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), p 404.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\"> Nor is it difficult to think of other policy considerations that might foster such a statute. For example, the practice of most of our state\u2019s police agencies is that, generally speaking, following a motor vehicle accident, the party at fault is cited for some motor vehicle violation, either one explicitly apparent (i.e., failing to yield) or one more general, on what might almost amount to a res ipsa loquitur theory (i.e., violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>basic speed law). Such citations have many pmposes: sanctioning the at-fault driver, giving the Secretary of State, by means of the point system, a means to track drivers who repeatedly cause problems, raising revenue for local municipalities, and, ultimately, increasing the insurance rates of drivers at fault (which can be justified as the highest cost drivers paying the highest rates or derided as a double penalty for such drivers, in view of the fact the accident itself might have already affected such rates). Any one of these justifications might prompt the Legislature to desire to enter the field of evidentiary rules and preclude evidence of such citations from civil cases, lest officers be concerned with civil consequences and defer issuing citations in marginal situations. The majority, while purporting to derive authority from the <em>Kirby </em>dicta, ignores the fact that the question addressed by such dicta would be decided differently under the majority\u2019s decision today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b355-5\"> Yet again, I must reiterate, that it is here, and exactly here, that the majority\u2019s analysis unravels and I must disagree. I do not suggest for a moment that the Legislature\u2019s powers fail it in matters of substantive law, nor that this Court\u2019s powers extend so far. What I dispute, however, is the myopic suggestion that \u201csubstantive\u201d law includes any regulation of court practice and procedure related to matters other than judicial efficiency. Such a view subordinates the judiciary to the regulation of the Legislature in the conduct of its judicial fimction. Under the majority\u2019s view, the Legislature would appear free to control any aspect of the judicial function it wishes, save perhaps the scheduling of dockets. To the extent this might not be so, it will be not because of adherence to the test articulated by the majority, but rather, as the majority admits in its conclusion, that this Court will be the final arbitrator of such issues, and thus will remain able to one day, in the face of a legislative enactment less to its liking, undo what has been done today. While such a view might comfort those concerned with the majority\u2019s action today, it shows little respect for either our constitutional structure or the supposed finality of this Court\u2019s decisions, the latter aspect, it seems, being increasingly endangered in its own right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b355-6\"> The majority, in discussing policy considerations as being best left to the Legislature, ignores our own holding in <em>Allen, supra, </em>that policy con-' siderations underlie most of the evidentiary code and that such determinations are constitutionally left (yet again, until today) to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\"> For a definition concurrent with the time Justice Williams authored <em>Kirby, </em>see <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged, </em>p 653, \u201cdispatch ... 3a: to dispose of rapidly or efficiently (as a piece of business) : execute quickly</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b357-5\"> I will depart from the general format of this section, which is to offer an outline of those questions that the Legislature may now choose, at its whim, to discuss in terms of \u201cpolicy\u201d and \u201csubstantive law,\u201d and alter our court rules to note that MRE 407 appears to be an excellent example of how policy considerations have properly come into play in the course of the Court regulating the judicial function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> likewise, the majority\u2019s approving reference to the contention of the dissent below that the Legislature, being empowered to create or eliminate a cause of action, is certainly free to modify such action as it sees fit, including enacting the limitations herein. It is true only to the extent such modifications are permitted by our constitution. Were the Legislature to modify a cause of action, such as medical malpractice, in such a way as to be obviously violative of equal protection (for example, by recognizing a claim only in claimants of a particular gender), we would have no difficulty saying such a modification was constitutionally void. This contention from the dissent below, accepted by the majority, is meaningless to a question whether the action of the Legislature is constitutionally permissible, and supports the majority\u2019s position only to the extent that one has already decided (or presumed) that the Legislature\u2019s action is constitutional. Considering that it is that latter question that is before us, it is of no help to say that \u201cthe Legislature could do this (if only it constitutionally can)\u2019\u2019? My difficulty with the predicate causes me to disagree with the contention as it is offered herein, and the contention\u2019s requirement of the antecedent of constitutionality requires that it be discarded from the debate in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> Indeed, that might not be asked only by those who disagree with my view, but equally by those who would prefer to reach the result of the majority without creating the breeches in the wall of separation between our branches of government the majority\u2019s effort leaves behind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\"> It could also be argued that by adopting MCR 2.112(L), the Court silently deferred to the statute. This rule adopts the affidavit of merit required by MCL 600.2912d-600.2912e; MSA 27A.2912(4)-27A.2912(5). That section does incorporate a reference to \u00a7 2169, requiring the affidavit to be signed by an expert reasonably believed to meet the qualifications of \u00a7 2169. The court rule, however, reflects only a reference to the affidavit of merit as required by that section, along with addressing service of the affidavit. To the extent the court rule references sections 2912d and 2912e, it would, on its face, appear to be an acquiescence, with modifications, of those subsections. To the extent those subsections themselves reference \u00a7 2169, it would be a strained reading indeed to consider that to amount to a constitutional analysis, thoughtful deliberation, and agreement with \u00a7 2169. Rather it would seem appropriate to read the rule as an endorsement of the concept of an affidavit of merit, and a requirement for same, and require that the expert offering the affidavit be qualified as envisioned by this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\"> Indeed, our adoption of MCR 2.112(L), discussed in note 32, could be seen as a measure to require clearly defined, and at least arguably meritorious, positions to be stated by parties before extensive litigation being undertaken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\"> I must pause once again, as the majority, in its haste to impugn, has lost track of the context. It is suggested that the above reflects some sort of dissatisfaction with the Legislature\u2019s determination, in ignorance of the extensive record underlying the Legislature\u2019s choice. <em>Ante </em>at 35, n 19. This is not offered as a criticism of the Legislature\u2019s efforts, but rather as analysis, required under <em>Perin </em>(which I would heed rather than vanquish) of whether this Court, under its rule-making authority (which I obviously view to encompass the constitutional range of \u201cpractice and procedure,\u201d rather than the majority\u2019s newly created span of \u201cjudicial dispatch\u201d) should acquiesce to the Legislature\u2019s determination. In this case, I would not, on the basis of my analysis of the interworkings of such a framework, rather than some anecdotal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In regard to the presence of such evidence, I can only raise an eyebrow at the majority\u2019s citation of the legislative record, which would seem to be something of a doctrinal departure in citing a source which those in the majority usually view with considerable disdain. See, e.g., <em>Hagerman v Gencorp Automotive, </em>457 Mich 720, 761, n 14; 579 NW2d 347 (1998) (Taylor, J., dissenting). While I certainly acknowledge the presence of such a history, I suggest that this Court should not, on the basis of what is offered therein, be persuaded to acquiesce in the rule the Legislature established. Whether such history was (obviously) or should have been (a matter for academics, not the Court) sufficient to move the Legislature is not the question. Rather, the question is whether the Legislature, regardless of how great the motivation, may intrude on the constitutional province of the judiciary. In answering the <em>Perin </em>question of acquiescence, I must examine the Legislature\u2019s motivations, but in answering the former question of constitutional intrusion, I, in contrast to the majority, would not consider the merits of such motivations at all, reviewing them only as much as is necessary to determine whether the intent to overrun a constitutional boundary was present. The barrier established in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5, does not, anywhere on its face or in its import, include an exception for \u201cgood intentions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\"> I note also that the trial court\u2019s granting of summary disposition was based on its refusal to allow plaintiff additional time to produce another expert witness following its exclusion of Dr. Robia. On remand, if the trial court found that it had not yet ruled on the admissibility of Dr. Robia\u2019s testimony under MRE 702, it would be free to consider the matter in light of the criteria under MRE 702, taking <em>note </em>of any of the various arguments offered by defendants and plaintiff regarding his qualifications that it might find helpful to this decision. Likewise, the plaintiff should be free, on remand, to offer an alternative expert whose qualifications might be subject to less question than are Dr. Robia\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\"> Both the cases we consider today present us with the 1986 version of the statute. It naturally follows, however, that my analysis herein must apply with equal force to this statute as it currently exists after the 1993 amendments. Given that the amendments resulted in an even more restrictive, and therefore intrusive, version of the statute, there is no doubt that such a statute is also a constitutionally impermissible intrusion into this Court\u2019s powers, and thus should be invalid as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b367-6\"> The point of this dissent is not, as the majority suggests, much ado about \u201cturf.\u201d Rather, it is necessary to point out what is both a monumental redrawing of the lines that separate our branches of government and a zealous effort to advance a particular philosophy. I must wonder at what must be the underlying precept of such views, that all who have come before were in error, and fidelity to our constitution begins anew today. I have no problem with the latter pledge (and, like all, I would hope, welcome it), but would suggest adherence thereto requires both an understanding and respect for how our constitution has been viewed before. In the place of it, however, it seems we are destined to find but disregard for the previous efforts of this institution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
