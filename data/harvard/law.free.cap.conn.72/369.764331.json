The court overruled said claim, and held that the appellants were not entitled to any deduction from the market value of said stock; and that if they were entitled to a deduction the assessors Avere right in deducting the assessed and not the market value of the real estate.

Section 3836 of tlie General Statutes is hereby amended to read as follows: Shares of the capital stock of any bank, national banking association, trust, insurance, turnpike, bridge, or plank road company, owned by any resident of this State, shall be set in his list. at its market value, in the town in which he may reside; but so much of the capital of any such company as may be invested in real estate, on which it is assessed and pays a tax, shall be deducted from the market value of its stock in its returns to the assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Section 3837. The cashiers or secretaries of all corporations, whose stock is liable to taxation, shall, on or before the twelfth day of October, annually, inform the assessors of each town of the names of the stockholders residing therein, and the amount of stock owned by each, as exhibited by the books of said corporations, on the first day of October, so far as the residence of such stockholders shall be known to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>cashiers or secretaries, and its market value during the month of September next preceding; and any such cashier or secretary, who shall neglect to furnish such information to the assessors of any town where said stock is liable to be taxed, shall forfeit $50.00 to such town; but putting a letter into the post-office containing such information, postage paid, addressed to the assessors of any town where such owner resides, shall be a compliance with the provisions of this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b384-8\">Hameksley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az0\">The statute requires the secretary of the Hartford Trust Company, in his return to the assessors, to state the market value of the company\u2019s stock during the preceding month of September, and to deduct so much of its capital as may be invested in real estate on which it is assessed and pays a tax. The evident purpose of this language is to secure a statement by the secretary of the value of the stock owned by the shareholders, and also of any real estate owned by the company in which it has invested capital on which it is assessed and pays a tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The capital indicated is that on which it is assessed and pays a tax; <em>i. e. </em>the assessed value of the real estate. The statute contemplates a statement of the taxable value of the stock\u2014the property owned by the shareholders, and of the taxable value of the land\u2014the property owned by the company; and requires the secretary to deduct in certain proportion the latter from the former. This purpose is expressed with sufficient clearness. There is, however, no distinction in the law between the assessed and actual value of real estate. If assessors violate the statute, courts may, for certain purposes, receive evidence of such violation, but they cannot ignore the fact that the legislature and the law treat, for purposes of taxation, the assessed and the actual value of property as the same. <em>White </em>v. <em>Portland, </em>63 Conn. 18, 22; <em>Randell </em>v. Bridgeport, ibid. 321, 323; <em>Greenwoods Co. </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>65 id. 461, 463. See also General Statutes, \u00a7 3857. Our tax laws require property to be assessed at its actual value, and a statute referring to value of land in connection with taxation, cannot be construed as meaning a value in excess of the assessed value, unless the language used demands such construction. The amount of S175,000 is that portion of the capital of the trust company on which it is assessed and pays a tax; if an additional portion of its capital has in fact been invested in land, the company pays no tax on such additional portion, and it is not within the operation of the statute. The court below did not err in holding that it was the assessed value of the real estate which the secretary was required to deduct from the value of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Applying this ruling to the facts found, it appears that the plaintiffs have not been aggrieved by the action of the board of relief. It is not therefore necessary to the disposition of this case to consider the further ruling of the trial court, that the. plaintiffs were not entitled to any deduction from the market value of their stock, and we do not pass upon that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Upon the trial it appeared that a portion of the real estate for which the Trust Company was taxed, was held under a lease for 999 years ; the owner of the fee reserving an annual rent of $402 and the lessee being bound to pay taxes on the land. The defendant claimed that the company\u2019s interest in said land was not real estate, and therefore its value could not be considered in determining the amount of capital invested in real estate. Undoubtedly the interest of the company is properly classed as a chattel real; but nevertheless the capital represented by the leasehold is invested in real estate within the meaning of the statute, and should be included in the secretary\u2019s return.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The ruling of the court on the question of evidence is immaterial in view of the conclusion reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">\u25a0 Chase\u2019s Appeal presents the same questions we have already discussed, and must be controlled by the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>There is no error in the judgment of the Superior Court in either of the above-entitled appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
