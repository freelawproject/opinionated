J., Torrance, Baldwin, Hamersley and Hall, Js,</judges>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b169-11\">Under General Statutes, \u00a7 3318, as amended by Chap. 88 of the Public Acts of 1893, a wife whose husband neglects to support her may bring an action against him and seeure an order of court requiring him to contribute a reasonable sum towards her maintenance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b169-12\">If the relief particularly demanded in the complaint is a gross sum hy way of an allowance or alimony, and not an order for periodical payments according to the plaintiff\u2019s needs, as contemplated by the statute, the defect is purely formal and can be taken advantage of only by demurrer. Nor is it necessary that the complaint should expressly count upon the statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b169-13\">The husband\u2019s property may be attached in such action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b169-14\">An error of the court caused by overlooking a statute to which neither party adverted, is nevertheless the subject of review on appeal.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b169-15\">Argued June 1st</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ATY\">decided August 1st, 1899.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-16\">Suit hy a married woman to compel her husband, who had deserted her, to provide her and their minor child with suitable support, brought to the Superior Court in New London County and tried to the- court, <em>Robinson, </em>-X, upon the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the substituted complaint; the court sustained the demurrerand rendered judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed for alleged errors in the rulings of the court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AeX\">\n<em>Error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-17\">The original complaint alleged a desertion, five months after marriage, and a neglect to provide the plaintiff with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>necessaries of life, though, the defendant is worth $50,000. The claims for relief were for $20,000 damages, and, by way of equitable relief, an order compelling him to make due provision for her support. The writ was one of attachment. An attachment was made, and a bond for $9,200 substituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">Afterwards a substituted complaint was filed, containing new matter, and with these additional allegations: A child has been born since the desertion; the defendant has given notice by newspaper advertisement warning all persons not to trust the plaintiff; she has no means or credit, and is in poor health, and unable to support herself and her child; the defendant has an income of $5,000 a year; since she brought the suit he has conveyed away all his property to avoid legal process and prevent it from being applied to the support of his wife or child, and with like purpose has left the State for parts unknown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-7\">The claims were for equitable relief as follows: (1) that a provision for her maintenance, adequate for her support and that of the child, be made, of not less than a third of his property ; (2) that such fund be placed in trust for said purpose; and (3) for any other relief that might seem proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-8\">To this substitute complaint the defendant demurred, on the ground that, it not being one for a divorce with alimony, no cause of action was disclosed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-9\"><em>Solomon Lucas </em>and <em>Gardiner Greene, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-10\"><em>William H.

And Avhen such complaint is brought by the selectmen or wife, the court or any judge thereof, in vacation, may require the defendant to become bound with sufficient surety to such town or wife to abide such judgment as may be rendered on said complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">This statute is a remedial one, and to be liberally construed. The \u201c substitute complaint \u201d comes within its terms, and the plaintiff was entitled to an order directing a reasonable contribution towards her support and that of her infant child.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">That she described the relief she claimed as equitable, if a defect, was purely a formal one, to be taken advantage of only by a demurrer to the claims. <em>Norwalk </em>v. Ireland, 68 Conn. 1, 5. The same considerations meet the point pressed by the defendant, that the relief particularly sought is a gross sum by way of a settlement, or alimony, and not an order for payments from time to time according to the plaintiff\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Nor was it necessary that her complaint should count particularly on the statute. <em>Griswold </em>v. Gallup, 22 Conn. 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">\u201cAttachments may be granted upon all complaints containing a money demand against the estate of the defendant.\u201d General Statutes, \u00a7 898. The wife, being authorized to sue, Avas authorized to attach. She procured an attachment, and it was dissolved, two years before her \u201csubstitute complaint\u201d was filed, by the substitution of a bond, under General Statutes, \u00a7 929. The condition of such a bond is to pay the judgment that may be recovered, to an amount not exceeding that of the bond nor the interest of the defendant in the estate attached. General Statutes, \u00a7 933. While the bond iioav in question was given to get rid of the plaintiff\u2019s attachment, it is directed to the same end, so far as she is concerned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>as one required by order of court under the Act of 1893. The plaintiff therefore had both a good cause of action and security for its due enforcement, at the time when judgment was rendered against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">It is urged that the Act of 1893 was not brought to the attention of the court below, nor in any way relied upon by the plaintiff. It was, however, the law of the land, which the parties and the court were conclusively presumed' to know. Errors arising from an absence of actual knowledge in such a case are always the subject of review. <em>Fourth National Bank </em>v. Francklyn, 120 U. S. 747, 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The view which we have taken of the statutory remedy makes it unnecessary to inquire whether any could be afforded under the principles of modern equity jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">There is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
