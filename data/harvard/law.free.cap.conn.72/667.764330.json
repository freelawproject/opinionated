On demurrer to the complaint it was <em>held </em>that an allegation that the town knew or had notice of the defect was not essential, since it was open to the plaintiff to establish his case by showing that the defects were of long standing, and that the town\u2019s ignorance thereof was due to its own failure to exercise a reasonable supervision of its highways.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b680-6\">The complaint in the present case specified several distinct defects in the highway and alleged that they caused the injury <em>Held, </em>upon demurrer, that this description of the cause of the injury was sufficiently definite and precise.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b680-7\">The written notice required by statute (Public Acts of 1895, Chap. 172) to be given to a town, prescribes that it shall contain a \u201cgeneral description\u201d of the injury, of its cause and of the time and place of its occurrence. <em>Held </em>that the object of the statute was to afford sufficient information to enable the town authorities to properly investigate the claim ; and that a statement which was reasonably definite in the required particulars was sufficient, notwithstanding its use of other words descriptive of the accident.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b680-8\">A notice describing an injury to the wife only, is no.t ambiguous or ineffective because signed by her husband also.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b680-9\">Witnesses experienced in the building and repair of highways who examined a highway upon the day of an accident, or when, as appears from other testimony, it was in the same condition, may state whether in their opinion it was then reasonably safe for public travel.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b680-10\">Argued March 6th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AO8\">decided April 4th, 1900.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-11\">Action to recover damages for personal injuries claimed to have been caused by a defective highway, brought to the Superior Court in Litchfield County where a demurrer to the complaint was overruled <em>(George W.

The defendant demurred to the complaint, upon the grounds that it contained no allegation that the town or its selectmen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>had notice or knowledge of the alleged defects; that it did not properly allege the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, and that the statutory notice was insufficient. The court overruled the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-6\">Upon the trial to the jury the plaintiff called as a witness one Holcomb, who, having testified that he had traveled over the highway in question frequently for a number of years, that he had had experience in repairing roads and had repaired this road, and had examined it the day after the accident, and having described its condition at that time, was asked the following question: \u201cWhat would you say</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-7\">as to whether the highway was reasonably safe for public travel at this point at this time? \u201d To this question the defendant objected, upon the ground that the witness was not qualified, and that it was not proper to permit his opinion to go to the jury. The court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-8\">The plaintiff introduced as a witness one Cochrane, who, having testified that he was an experienced road-builder, and as selectman had had charge of the building of the roads of the defendant town, and had examined the highway in question when, as it appeared from other testimony offered by the plaintiff, it was in the same condition as at the time of the accident, was asked whether at the time the witness saw the highway in March after the accident it was in a condition that was reasonably safe for public travel. To this question the defendant objected, upon the ground that the question was indefinite as to form, that the witness, not having seen the road before or at the time of the accident, should hot be permitted to give his opinion as to its condition at the time of the accident, and that such opinion was immaterial and inadmissible. The court overruled the objection and permitted the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-9\">The plaintiff called as a witness Dr. Skiff, who, as a physician, treated the plaintiff after the aeeident. Having testified to the examination he had made and having described the plaintiff\u2019s condition and his treatment of her, he was asked whether, if Mrs. Dean had been tipped from the sleigh, strik<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ing upon a rock upon her left side with sufficient force to dislocate her hip, that injury would be such as would produce the condition he then found her in. To this question the defendant objected, upon the ground that it contained elements that did not bear on this case. The court overruled the objection and admitted the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-6\">The defendant objected to the introduction in evidence of the notice to the selectmen, upon substantially the same grounds as stated in the demurrer, and because it was not a notice of the injury concerning which the plaintiff had offered evidence. The court overruled said objections and admitted said notice in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-7\">The rulings of the court upon the demurrer and upon these questions of evidence, are the reasons of appeal assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b683-8\"><em>Leonard J. Nickerson </em>and <em>Arthur D. Warner, </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b683-9\"><em>Donald T. Warner </em>and <em>J.

The location of the highway, the amount of travel over it, the nature and cause of the alleged defect, the length of time it has existed, the knowledge of the town of the defect, and its opportunity, power and means to repair or remove it so as to avert the accident, and the supervision exercised by the town to ascertain the condition of its roads\u2014 are subjects the consideration of one -or more of which is usually necessary in order to determine the ultimate question of negligence. <em>Landolt </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>37 Conn. 615; <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>48 id. 460; <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>50 id. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">The defendant\u2019s demurrer to the complaint in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>action is not properly framed to raise the questions of whether, under the practice in this State, an averment that it was the duty of the town to keep the highway in question in repair and that the alleged defect was caused by its failure to perform that duty, is a sufficient allegation of negligence, or whether the complaint should state all the facts necessary to clearly show the negligence of the town; or whether, if the latter be the rule, it has been complied with in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The claim of the first ground of demurrer is, that the complaint is insufficient because it fails to allege that the town or its selectmen had \u201c any notice or knowledge \u201d of the alleged defects in the highway. The allegations of the complaint are that the town was bound to keep this highway in repair, and that the dangerous defects described existed on the day of the accident \u201c and for a long time prior thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Negligence of a town in failing to repair a dangerous defect in a highway, of the existence of which it had no knowledge, may be shown by proof of the continuance of the defect for a long period of time, and that such ignorance of its existence was due to the failure of the town to exercise a reasonable supervision of its roads. <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>30 Conn. 118; <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>40 id. 456; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Guilford, </em>55 id. 351; <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>70 id. 115, 124. Since it did not appear from the language of the complaint, that in order to show that the town was negligent the plaintiff would be required to prove that it had knowledge or notice of the alleged defects, the complaint was not insufficient because of the absence of such allegation of knowledge. A plaintiff is not required to allege a fact which he may not be required to prove in order to establish a good cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The complaint contains a sufficient description of the defects in the highway, and of the cause of the injury. It alleges, in effect, that the highway was dangerously defective at a certain definitely described point, by reason of a gully therein extending about eighty feet in either direction from said point and caused by a stream of water running along the highway, which deposited stones and other ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>structions therein, and that the highway was also defective <em>\u201c </em>at said point and place by reason of large stones, rocks and boulders projecting into the same,\u201d and that by reason of the defects thus described the plaintiff\u2019s sleigh was overturned at said described point.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">A complaint which alleges in one count several distinct defects in a highway as contributing to cause the injury complained of, is not demurrable upon the ground that it contains no proper allegation of the cause of the injury or of the particular defect which caused it. Several acts of negligence may be alleged in the same count as the causes of one injury, and the plaintiff may recover upon proof of all or of any of them. <em>Carstesen </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>67 Conn. 428, 436; <em>Ashborn </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>70 id. 551, 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The remaining grounds of demurrer relate to the sufficiency of the notice. It is claimed to be defective by reason of being too indefinite, as not containing \u201c a definite and intelligible statement of any distinct cause of the injury,\u201d and as not containing \u201c a statement of any defect in the highway which caused the sleigh ... to overturn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The time and place of the accident and of the location of the defects in the highway are definitely described in the notice, and we think it contains a sufficient description of the injury and the cause thereof to meet the requirements of the statute and serve the purpose of such a notice\u2014that of giving sufficient information to enable the town authorities to properly investigate the claim. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>New London, </em>63 Conn. 267, 272; <em>Rowell </em>v. <em>Stamford Street R. Co., </em>64 id. 376; <em>Budd </em>v. <em>Meriden Electric R. Co., </em>69 id. 272, 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Section 2673 of the General Statutes required a written notice of the injury \u201c and the nature and cause thereof, and of the time and place of its occurrence.\u201d Chapter 172 of the Public Acts of 1895, p. 534, which was the law in force at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, provides for a written notice of the injury, \u201c and a <em>general description </em>of the same, and the cause thereof, and of the time and place of its occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">The statement in the notice, that the highway was defect-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ire at the described point by reason of a gully therein caused by a stream of water running over it, and by reason of stones and rocks at the described point, that the sleigh was overturned by running upon a stone, or into a hole, and that Mrs. Dean was thrown upon her back and head upon a rock, and her left hip dislocated, and her back and head injured,\u2014 is a sufficient general description of the injury and the cause of it, notwithstanding the use of the other words in the notice descriptive of the injury and its cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">As the notice manifestly purports to contain only a description of an injury sustained by Mrs. Dean, it is not rendered ambiguous or ineffective because her husband signed it with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The trial court properly overruled the demurrer and admitted the notice in evidence as descriptive of the injury proved at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">The rulings of the court admitting the testimony of the witness Holcomb, and admitting the testimony of the witness Cochrane, after evidence had been offered showing that when the latter examined the road it was in the same condition as at the time of the accident, are clearly sustained by <em>Taylor </em>v. Monroe, 48 Conn. 36, 45, <em>Sydleman </em>v. Beckwith, ibid. 12, <em>Ryan </em>v. Bristol, 63 id. 26, and other decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The objection to the testimony of Dr. Skiff is not pursued in the defendant\u2019s brief. We discover no error in the ruling of the court permitting the question which was asked this witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
