This obligation arises whenever the wrong-doer knows or could have ascertained upon due inquiry what amount was justly due.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b716-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Through, the defendant\u2019s negligence a break in its reservoir wall occurred which caused a washout of the plaintiff\u2019s roadbed.

The necessary repairs cost $3,313.49, and that this would be their reasonable cost could and ought to have been known by the defendant at the time of the injury. Before the repairs were completed, $456.75 was necessarily paid out by the plaintiff for the transportation of passengers and mails around the break in the railroad, but the defendant had no means of ascertaining that such expenses would or did amount to that sum until the filing of the bill of particulars in the action. In this bill these two items of damage were separately stated and particularized. The defendant always denied any liability whatever to the plaintiff. The damages awarded were for these two sums aggregating $3,770.24, together with, and as part of the damage done, a sum for delay since the plaintiff repaired its roadway, equal to the interest upon the cost of the repairs ($3,313.49) from the periods when the plaintiff was put to said cost, and for delay since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>the filing of the bill of particulars a sum equal to the interest upon $156.75. Interest was computed at six per cent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b717-6\"><em>Edwin B. Gager, </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b717-7\"><em>George B. Watrous, </em>with whom was <em>Barry G. Bay, </em>for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b717-8\">Baldwin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">There is no right to interest on a disputed demand, unless by virtue of a contract, expressed or implied, or of a statute. In computing damages, however, in actions of tort, there may in certain cases be allowed a sum equal to what would be interest at the legal rate on the amount of compensation to which the plaintiff is found to be entitled, computed from the date when the loss was suffered. This is done because the defendant ought in justice to have made compensation immediately after occasioning the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">There is certainly an obligation to make payment, a breach of which places him in default, whenever he has knowledge or means of knowledge as to what amount is justly and reasonably due. In the case at bar the defendant had, from the first, the means of ascertaining what the repairs of the plaintiff\u2019s roadway would cost. He who wrongfully destroys the property of another is bound to make good the loss which he has occasioned, and the sufferer is under no duty to inform him, unasked, precisely what that loss is. If it be the natural consequence of the injurious act, and as in this case its amount could reasonably be ascertained by due inquiry and investigation, then, whatever may be true under other circumstances, the wrong-doer who neglects to ascertain it ought in fairness, if it becomes necessary to sue for compensation, to be made to pay not only what was thus originally due, but also damages for his delay in not paying it without judicial compulsion. <em>Parrott </em>v. <em>Housatonic R. Co., </em>47 Conn. 575; <em>Regan </em>v. <em>New York &amp; N. E. R. Co., </em>60 id. 124, 142; <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>70 id. 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">There is nothing in the facts specially found to indicate error in the conclusion of the trial court, that the cost of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>repairs to the plaintiff\u2019s roadway was a sum definitely ascertainable at the time of the injury. It was obvious that the bank washed out must be at once replaced, and. the track relaid. Any civil engineer or railroad builder could have readily stated the approximate cost, and th\u00e9re is no claim that the precise outlay could not have been learned on inquiry from the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">As it is found that the cost of transferring passengers and mails around the break was not a sum definitely ascertainable until stated by the bill of particulars, the defendant was not in default for not paying it previously. For its delay in payment after that date, however, damages in the nature of interest were properly allowed. <em>New Haven Steam Saw Mill Co. </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 72 Conn. 276, 287; <em>Tilghman </em>v. Proctor, 125 U. S. 136, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The appellee suggests that it is enough to support this judgment if there was a discretionary power to make the allowances in question. One of the.defendant\u2019s claims of law in the Superior Court, however, which was overruled, seems to present the question squarely as one of right. We think the finding fairly imports that the judgment rests in this respect on a conclusion of law that the plaintiff was, under the circumstances of the case, absolutely entitled to these allowances ; and that conclusion we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">There is nothing in the claim that the plaintiff presented an entire demand, and that as part of its outlay was of such a character that its amount could only be ascertained after it might choose to state it, no allowance in the nature of interest could be made for the delay in paying the rest. While the defendant\u2019s negligence worked a single injury, this was the cause of certain distinct and separable expenditures, and those of each kind could be properly dealt with by themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
