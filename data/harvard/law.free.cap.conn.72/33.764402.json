Upon an application by the plaintiff for a finding that public convenience and necessity required the construction of the railway authorized by its charter, it was <em>held </em>that the Southington terminus was sufficiently located and described, and that the plaintiff\u2019s right to build the road as an entirety was not dependent upon its effecting the connection referred to in its charter.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b45-11\">If an applicant has no legal right to construct the parallol road, the trial judge has no jurisdiction to pass upon the question of public con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>venience and necessity; and the existence of this right may be challenged by motion of the respondent to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b46-6\">Argued May 4th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AG-\">decided June 1st, 1899.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-7\">Application for a finding that public convenience and necessity required the construction of an electric railway between Plainville and Southington parallel to the steam railroad of the respondents, made to the <em>Son.

An amendment to its charter passed in 1893 (Special Acts of 1893, p. 774) also authorizes it to build and operate its electric railroad between certain specified towns.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-9\">Section 8 authorizes such railway between the towns of New Britain and Plainville, and describes the location and termini of the road. Section 9 authorizes such railway between Plainville and Southington, and describes the location and termini of the road. The description is as follows: \u201cErom a point in East Main street in the village of Plain-ville, . . . over and along Whiting street to, over, and through Main street in the town of Southington, to a convenient point in said town, where connections can be made with the Southington and Plantsville electric railroad.\u201d By \u00a7 13 the plaintiff is authorized, \u201cin any of the towns or villages above named, to connect its road with any other electric or horse railway operated in any of said villages or towns.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-10\">At the time the charter amendment became operative, and until 1898, the Southington and Plantsville Tramway Company operated an electric railroad between the villages of Southington and Plantsville, commonly known as the Southington and Plantsville Electric Railroad, and its terminus in Southington was in Centre street at a point about four rods from the corner of Main street. Early in 1898 the Southington and Plantsville Tramway Company removed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>tracks and fixtures from the highways, and abandoned its railroad. Later, and during the year 1898, the Meriden, Southington and Compounce Tramway Company, acting under its charter provisions, built and has since operated an electric railway between the villages of Southington and Plantsville, having a terminus in Southington at or near the junction of Centre and Main streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-6\">The proposed street railway will parallel the steam railroad of the appellants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-7\">The trial court found the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s application to be true, and adjudged that public convenience and necessity required the construction of the street railway as designated in the application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-8\">At the hearing the New York, New Haven <em>&amp; </em>Hartford Railroad Company claimed \u201c that the franchises granted to the applicant for a railway over the route described in the application had failed, since it has become impossible to build a railway from Plainville to Southington to connect with the Southington and Plantsville Electric Railroad named in the charter of the applicant, and that no judge of the Superior Court could have jurisdiction to hear or act upon this application of the Central Railway and Electric Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-9\">This claim was raised upon demurrer and motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, and the action of the court in overruling this claim and in taking jurisdiction of the question of public convenience and necessity upon the state of facts as found, is the only error assigned in the appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-10\"><em>Edward E. </em>Rollins, for the appellants (respondents).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-11\"><em>Frank L.

Co, </em>v. <em>Central Ry. &amp; Elec. Co., </em>69 Conn. 47, 54; <em>In re Shelton St. Ry. Co., </em>ibid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>626, 681. For this reason the defendant was a necessary party to the plaintiff\u2019s application for a judicial finding, and as such entitled to raise all questions involved in the adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The trial judge had no power to make the finding asked, if in fact no parallel road was authorized; the legal right to construct such a road is a condition precedent to his action; it must he found; error in such a finding may be error in deciding a jurisdictional question, and reviewable upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The claim urged by the plaintiff in argument, that the question stated in the record could not properly be raised upon the trial, nor upon this appeal, is unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">It is true, as claimed by the defendant, that the plaintiff has no authority to build this portion of its railway except as an entirety between the termini fixed by its charter, and that it has no right to build except upon the route described in the charter. But the trial court has found that the plaintiff intends to build the whole road and upon the prescribed route. There is no difficulty in ascertaining the charter location; the Southington terminus is a point in Main street described with sufficient certainty for the purpose of indicating a terminus. The position of the then existing Southington and Plantsville Electric Railway is used to indicate the position of the plaintiff\u2019s terminus in Main street. Connections between the two roads might or might not take place; under \u00a7 13 of its charter the plaintiff has the power, but it is not charged with the duty, of making such connection. These positions are not changed by an abandonment of the Plants-ville railway, and there is nothing to prevent the plaintiff from now building its road in its entirety upon the route described in its charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The defendant\u2019s real contention seems to be, not that the plaintiff is unable or unwilling to construct its road between the prescribed termini, but that the inducing motive of the .egislature, in authorizing a railroad from Plainville to Southington, was to connect Plantsville with Plainville by means of the Southington and Plantsville Electric Railway, and as the accomplishment of the purpose intended has been pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>vented by the act of that road, a condition of the grant to the plaintiff to build from Plainville to Southington has failed and the grant has become void. Certainly the charter does not require the completion of such a connection, and there can therefore be no duty unperformed, and the alleged forfeiture must result from a privilege lost. We fail to see how such a controlling motive and unexpressed condition can be evolved from the language used in describing the location. A grant of this hind should undoubtedly be strictly construed ; yet it should be construed,\u2014not amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
