J., Torrance, Baldwin, Hamersley and Hall, Js.</judges>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b250-10\">The defendant, an attorney at law, placed a writ against <em>A </em>in the hands of the plaintiff, a deputy-sheriff, and directed him to attach certain specific property, although the attorney knew that the title to such property was in dispute and that the attachment would probably be contested, and had already received money from his client to use, if necessary, in defending the validity of the contemplated seizure. <em>Held </em>that upon these facts the law would imply a promise upon the party of the attorney to personally indemnify the officer for any loss he might sustain by attaching the property in question.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AK7\">While making the attachment the officer was informed that the property belonged to R, the brother of <em>A, </em>and was shown a bill of sale to R, not from <em>A, </em>but from other persons. <em>Held </em>that the failure of the officer\u2014who acted throughout in entire good faith\u2014to inform the attorney of the names of the vendors in the bill of sale, did not preclude his recovery.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"A8z\">Argued June 21st</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3us\">decided August 1st, 1899.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-12\">Action by a deputy-sheriff to recover the amount of a judgment against him for a wrongful attachment directed by the defendant, brought to the Court of Common Pleas in New Haven County and tried to the court, <em>Studley, J.; </em>facts found and judgment rendered for the plaintiff, and appeal by the defendant for alleged errors in the rulings of the court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AdV\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The complaint contained two counts: the first, for indemnity for the amount paid by plaintiff to satisfy a judgment against him for having attached certain goods at the direction of the defendant; and the second, for his fees as an officer in the service of process.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-6\">The court found the following facts: On December 10th, 1897, the Roma Military Band of New Haven caused their counsel, Paul Russo, the defendant in this action, an attorney at law, to issue a writ of attachment in favor of said Band and against one Fioravanta Riccardelli, and the said attorney placed the said writ in the hands of William E. Higgins, the present plaintiff, a deputy-sheriff for the county of New Haven, with instructions to serve the said writ and attach certain goods as the property of the said Fioravanta Riecardelli.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-7\">The said Russo gave the plaintiff to understand that there had been some fraudulent transfer of the property proposed to be attached, which he, Russo, knew all about, and he instructed the plaintiff to make the attachment at a certain time when the said Fioravanta Riccardelli would be in his store, and to take with him and place in charge of the said property as keeper, one Bruno, who was in the employ of the said Russo, and also to suggest to the parties that they substitute a bond for the attachment, or replevy the goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-8\">The said Russo did not instruct the plaintiff to make an investigation in regard to the supposed fraudulent transfer, or to satisfy himself in regard to the ownership of the property before making an attachment. The plaintiff did not know the said Roma Military Band, or any of the members thereof. He received all.of his instructions from the said Russo, and the latter did not refer him to said Band for any purpose whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-9\">On said day the plaintiff, in company with the said Bruno, went to said store and attached the said property as directed, and placed the said Bruno in charge thereof as keeper. When he arrived at said store he found the said Fioravanta and his brother Orlando and others present, and was informed that the property did not belong to the said Fioravanta, but did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>belong to Ms said brother Orlando, and was shown a bill of sale of the property from certain other persons to said Orlando.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-6\">The said Higgins left the said Bruno in charge of the property and went to the said Russo and reported that he had attached the goods and that they had shown Mm a bill of sale. The said Russo replied that he expected that, and that he, Russo, could hold the property. Higgins told him. that he thought they would contest the matter, but did not tell him who appeared to be the grantors in the said bill of sale. The said Russo told him to go back and tell the parties that they had better give a bond, or replevy the goods, or he, Russo, would have the goods removed from the store; and the plaintiff did so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-7\">On said December 10th, after the said attachment had been made, Mr. Pond, counsel for said Orlando, wrote to the plaintiff informing him of the said Orlando\u2019s claim, and that if the property was not returned suit would be brought against him, and the plaintiff called upon the said Pond and requested the latter to confer with Russo, and informed the said Russo of the information he had received from Mr. Pond. The said Pond called up the said Russo by telephone, and told him that the property did not belong to the person against whom the writ ran; that if he would call upon him, Pond, he would show Mm a bill of sale and tell Mm what his claims were. The said Russo did not learn that the said bill of sale was not from the said Fioravanta, until the same was put in evidence upon the trial in the case of <em>Orlando Riccardelli </em>v. <em>Higgins.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-8\">When said writ was issued by said Russo, the said Roma Military Band by its agent executed and delivered to him an instrument by which they agreed,_in substance, that the sum of $90, on deposit in the so-called Italian Bank of said Russo, might be used in the prosecution of said attachment and for the payment of any loss that the plaintiff as such officer might sustain from having attached said goods, and promised to pay such damage from other sources if said sum should prove insufficient. The said Russo retained this document in his possession. He informed the plaintiff that he had it, but did not offer to deliver it to the plaintiff, nor did the latter demand it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The said Orlando Riccardelli brought suit for trespass against the present plaintiff for taking the said goods on said attachment, and recovered judgment, and the plaintiff paid on execution in said action the sum of $219.88 on July 14th, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-6\">The said Russo, with the knowledge of the plaintiff, appeared with associate counsel to defend the said action of Orlando Riccardelli against this plaintiff, and the said cause was thereupon tried, and the plaintiff appeared as a witness therein, and said Russo drew out $30 of the said sum of $90 deposited hi his said bank as aforesaid, and used the same to pay himself and associate counsel for services rendered in defending the said action. The said Russo did not consult the plaintiff about the withdrawal and appropriation of the said $30. He afterwards offered to turn over to the plaintiff the balance remaining of said $90', and to make some mutual arrangement to settle the balance of said judgment. The plaintiff did not accept the proposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-7\">After the said judgment had been rendered, Russo advised the plaintiff to sell the attached property to a customer procured by him, the said Russo, and Higgins sold said property to said customer, and eventually received therefor the sum of $65.70. The judgment for the plaintiff was upon the first count, and the court did not consider said sum of $65.70, nor the officer\u2019s fees of $54.14 named'in the answer to the second count.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-8\"><em>Levi </em>A. Blydenburgh, for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-9\"><em>William B. Stoddard </em>and <em>Robert O. </em>Stoddard, for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b253-10\">Hall, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_Y\">The trial court rendered judgment against the defendant for the amount which the plaintiff had been required to pay to satisfy a judgment against him for having, as a deputy-sheriff, attached certain goods under a writ placed in his hands for service by the defendant as an attorney at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>This judgment is claimed to be erroneous upon three grounds: first, that the defendant, being an attorney at law, and known by the plaintiff, to have been acting as such, did .not, by delivering to him as an officer a writ of attachment with directions to take particular goods as the property of the debtor, become thereby liable to reimburse him for loss sustained because the goods so attached were the property of another; second, that upon the facts found there was no promise to indemnify the officer; third, that by his misconduct or negligence in failing to give to the attorney certain information which the officer had gained concerning the title to the goods attached, he forfeited his right to be reimbursed for the amount so paid by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In the case of <em>Heath </em>v. Bates, 49 Conn. 342, 345, this court said: \u201c The rule seems a reasonable one, and the only reasonable one, that an attorney placing a writ in an officer\u2019s hands for service, is to be regarded as personally requesting the service and as personally liable for it, unless he expressly informs him that he will not be personally liable, or there are circumstances which make it clear that that was the understanding of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In the case at bar the attorney knew before employing the officer that the good's, afterwards attached as the property of the defendant named in the writ, were claimed by his brother, who subsequently proved his title to them. He expected that the question of the ownership of the property taken would be contested, and had received from his clients a sum to be used to enforce their claim and to reimburse the officer for any loss he might sustain by attaching these goods. The officer was not referred to the attorney\u2019s clients, nor did he know them. He received all his instructions from the defendant, and was by him expressly directed to take this particular property and to hold it. Under the circumstances the attorney is justly regarded as having personally requested the services rendered, and as having personally directed the plaintiff to take the property attached. He is therefore personally liable for the consequences of his acts, one of which is the legal inference from these facts of a promise to reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>burse the officer for any loss suffered by having taken the property of the wrong person.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u201c The law, however, implies a promise of indemnity, on the part of the creditor, where he directs the officer to make a levy on any particular property.\u201d 1 Sw. Dig. * 542. \u201cWhere one employs another to do acts not unlawful in their nature, or on the face of them, for the purpose of asserting a right, the law implies a promise of indemnity. Where a creditor in an execution directs the officer to levy it on certain property shown to him, claiming it to belong to the debtor, if the property should, prove to belong to some other person, and the officer should be subjected to pay for it in an action brought against him by the owner, he would have a claim of indemnity against the creditor.\u201d 1 Sw. Dig. *414; <em>Stoyel </em>v. <em>Cady, </em>4 Day, 222, 226; <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>6 Conn. 421, 426; <em>Marcy </em>v. <em>Crawford,, </em>16 id. 549, 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The failure of the officer to inform the defendant of the names of the grantors in the bill of sale shown him, does not affect the plaintiff\u2019s right of action nor the defendant\u2019s liability. The officer attempted to conceal nothing. It was reasonable for him to suppose that the defendant knew the grounds upon which the debtor\u2019s brother claimed title to the goods attached. The defendant could have learned by whom the bill of sale was given by inquiring of the vendee\u2019s attorney, Mr. Pond, or of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">It was not error to render judgment for the full amount paid by the plaintiff upon the execution against him. The defendant does not appear to have claimed, either in his answer or upon the trial, that he should be credited with the $65.70, the avails of the sale of the attached goods made by plaintiff upon his advice. That sum does not greatly exceed the amount admitted by defendant\u2019s answer to be due the plaintiff as officer\u2019s fees, which amount was not included in the plaintiff\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
