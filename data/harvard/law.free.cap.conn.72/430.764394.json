If the record only shows a service in this State upon one member Of a non-resident partnership, which was then indebted to the defendant and had goods of his in its possession, it falls far short of what is required, and the cause should he erased from the docket upon motion of the defendant who appears solely to challenge the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b442-9\">In the absence of personal service upon the defendant, or his voluntary appearance, the only source of the jurisdiction of a court rests in the power of the State to deal with property or property rights over which it has control; that is, which can he appropriated by legal process if the plaintiff proves his case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b442-10\">A plea to the jurisdiction is unnecessary if the reeord fails to show whatever is essential to confer it.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b442-11\">Argued October 31st</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AvN\">decided November 28th, 1899.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-12\">Action of contract on a writ which contained a process of foreign attachment, brought to the Court of Common Pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>in New London County and tried to the court, <em>Studley, J., </em>upon motion to erase the cause from the docket owing to the lack of jurisdiction; the court held that its want of jurisdiction appeared upon the face of the record and thereupon granted the motion, and the plaintiff appealed for alleged errors in the rulings of the court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Aex\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-6\">It appeared from the writ and complaint that the plaintiff was a Connecticut corporation, and that the defendants and garnishees were all residents of New York City.

It is not to be presumed that this was intended either to lessen or add to the rights of the attaching creditor. A sufficient reason for it is to be found in the endeavor of the authors of the Revision of 1875, with the sanction of the General Assembly, to strike out of the statute book all unnecessary verbiage and repetition, and condense every expression which they thought susceptible of it. Preface to the Revision of 1875, xii.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">But even without aid from the history of our legislation on this subject, it is sufficiently apparent that the intent of the General Statutes is only to afford a remedy for the sequestration in this State of property here found or debts contracted by an agent residing here. It would be absurd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>to suppose that the General Assembly meant that whenever a non-resident had an agent transacting business for him in this State, all debts due to such non-resident from any party, wherever the latter might reside or by whomsoever the debt might have been contracted, should be subject to collection in our courts. In proceedings against one not belonging here the only source of their jurisdiction, in the absence of personal service on or voluntary appearance by the defendant, is to be found in the power of the State to deal with property or property rights over which it has control. The <em>res </em>must be in such a situation or condition that it can be appropriated by legal process if the plaintiff proves his case. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Farmers' &amp; Citizens' Bank, </em>25 Conn. 452, 454. Courts do not sit to render judgments which they are powerless to enforce. <em>Clarke's </em>Appeal, 70 Conn. 195, 209. Those authorized by the statute in question are in form <em>in personam, </em>but in substance and effect they are <em>in rem. Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>95 U. S. 714, 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">To give the Court of Common Pleas a right to entertain this action, it was therefore necessary that from the writ and complaint, or the officer\u2019s return, it should appear that the non-resident garnishees bad an <em>agent </em>engaged in the transaction of business for them in this State, on whom personal service was made, at a time when lie had in his hands, as such agent, goods of the defendants, or when his principals were indebted to them by reason of an obligation contracted by him in their behalf. See <em>St. Clair </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>108 U. S. 350, 359. All that is disclosed upon the record as to these points is, that a copy of the process was left in service in this State by a proper officer with one of four members of a New York partnership which then was indebted to the defendants and had goods of theirs in its possession. This falls far short of what is required, whether by the general principles of private international law, or by the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in respect to the taking of property without due process of law. <em>Easterly </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>35 Conn. 273, 278. We may fairly assume that this copartner stood in the position of a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>agent of the firm for the transaction of its business; but, without adverting to the fact that the service was made upon him only as one of the garnishees, there is nothing whatever to show that any part of the copartnership business was ever transacted in Connecticut, or that any goods of the defendants were ever held by him here.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">It was therefore competent for the defendants, after entering a special appearance for the purpose of objection to the assumption of jurisdiction, to move that the cause be erased from the docket; and the court was right in granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Error is assigned because the demurrer to the plea in abatement was overruled. The plea was unnecessary, since it was for the plaintiff to see that the record disclosed whatever was indispensable to give jurisdiction; but as the demurrer was overruled by agreement, this action could in no event be made a ground of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
