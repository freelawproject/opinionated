On the 28th day of' September, 1896, the defendant made, signed and published a paper writing, concerning the plaintiff, of which Exhibit A <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> hereto annexed is a copy. 2. On said day the defendant exhibited said paper writing to Henry T. Dayton of Water-town, Conn., by whom the same was read, and requested said Dayton to issue a search-warrant thereon to search the dwelling-house, and buildings or barns of the plaintiff, and to arrest the body of the plaintiff. 3. On said day the defendant made oath,' before said Dayton, to the truth of the allegations in said paper writing contained. 4. On said day in compliance with said request said Dayton made, issued and signed a certificate of said oath, and another paper writing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>a copy of which is hereto annexed and marked Exhibit C <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>. 5. On said day said paper writing signed by the defendant, and said certificate of oath and said other paper writing signed by said Dayton, being all on the same paper, were, by the defendant, exhibited and shown to one Henry G-. Scott of said Watertown and to one Frank 0. Peck of said Watertown, who read the same. 6. The defendant, on said day, placed said entire paper, with the words shown in said exhibits, in the hands of said Scott, and requested said Scott and said Peck to proceed with him to search the dwelling-house, buildings and barns of the plaintiff situated in the town of Bethlehem. 7. In pursuance of said request on said day the defendant, with said Scott and said Peck, proceeded to the premises of the plaintiff in the town of Bethlehem, and said Scott did then and there in the presence of the plaintiff, the defendant and said Peck, read the words contained in said exhibits, and the defendant, with said Scott and said Peck, did then and there, with force and arms, unlawfully and against the wish of the plaintiff, enter upon and search the dwelling-house, buildings and barns of the plaintiff. 8. The plaintiff was then unwell and said search did greatly disturb his mind and body, and his sickness was thereby increased and augmented. 9. The words described in paragraph 1 of tins complaint, concerning the plaintiff, were false. 10. The acts of the defendant described in paragraphs 1-7 of this com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>plaint were malicious. 11.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4-\">The court charged the jury that the warrant, which was made a part of the complaint, did not furnish any justification for the acts complained of. This was correct. The warrant had never been returned. The officer omitted to return it by the direction of the defendant. For this reason the acts done became a trespass <em>ab initio. Dehm </em>v. <em>Hinman, </em>56 Conn. 320, 322; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>25 id. 568; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Pond, </em>45 id. 386; <em>Toby </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>9 id. 216 ; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Marvin, </em>59 Vt. 437; <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>6 Gray, <em>238; </em>Buller\u2019s Nisi Prius, 23. \u201c If a sheriff have not returned a writ which ought to have been returned, he becomes, although this be only a nonfeasance, a trespasser <em>ab initio, </em>as to everything which has been done under the writ.\u201d 6 Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, <em>Trespass, B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">The warrant being void for this reason, there is no occasion to discuss whether or not it was void for the reason that it was not signed by the justice to whom the complaint was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Tire complaint alleged that the libelous writing had been published to Henry G. Scott and Frank O. Peck, citizens of Watertown. On the trial it appeared that Scott was a deputy-sheriff and Peck a constable, and that they had the warrant for service. Thereupon the defendant claimed and asked the court to rule that as to these persons the complaint and warrant was a privileged communication. The court refused so to rule, on the ground that the defendant could not avail .himself of a privileged communication, as it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>not pleaded. This was error. <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Morning News Co., </em>67 Conn. 504, 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">For the purpose of showing that he had reasonable cause for making the complaint, the defendant testified that before he made it he had been told by one Patterson that he, Patterson, was in company with Anderson when Anderson stole the things named in the complaint. He then sought to show by the testimony of other persons that they had lost articles of property, and that Patterson had told them that he had been in company with Anderson when Anderson had stolen such articles. Upon objection this evidence was rejected by the court. This was correct. The evidence would have raised issues not proper in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The plaintiff introduced Wallace Hayes as a witness, who testified that he asked the said Patterson \u201cwhy he made those statements to Cowles (the defendant) about John Anderson, and that Patterson replied that he made them because Cowles offered $10.\u201d This evidence was objected to, but the court admitted it. The testimony was apparently, offered to repel the defendant\u2019s claim that he had acted in good faith in making the complaint, and to show that he had no reason to believe the statements of Patterson to be true. The plaintiff sought to show that Patterson made the statements about Anderson to obtain the $10, rather than because the statements were true. In such case the defendant could not have relied upon them when he made the complaint. Granting that to show Patterson\u2019s motive his own declarations were the best evidence, still there was no evidence tending to show that the defendant was aware that Patterson was acting from such motive; and without bringing the knowledge of Patterson\u2019s motive home to the defendant, his good faith in making the complaint could not be affected. We think this testimony of Mr. Hayes was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">There is error, and a new trial must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
