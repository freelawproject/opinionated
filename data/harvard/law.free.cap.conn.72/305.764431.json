They become admissible only after a sufficient statement has been made of the facts upon which they are based, or after the witness has been shown to have had such personal observation of the testator as to enable him to form a reasonably correct conclusion.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b317-12\">What constitutes testamentary capacity is a question of law, and therefore it is not error to exclude the answer of a non-expert witness, that he does not think the testator was capable of making a will. The common and proper form of inquiry in these cases is: Was or was not the testator in your opinion a person of sound mind?</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b317-13\">Bor the purpose of illustrating the testator\u2019s mental condition it is not unusual nor improper to ask a duly qualified witness whether in his opinion the testator possessed sufficient understanding to transact the ordinary business incident to the management of his property and household affairs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b317-14\">The answer of a witness, if relevant and material to the issue, and claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>by the examiner, ought not to be stricken out on motion of the opposing counsel, merely because it is irresponsive to the question. The error, however, is harmless, if the answer thus excluded is afterwards repeated and admitted in response to a diff erent question.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AuL\">The statements of a testator to his attorney, not made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, and offered as evidence tending to show his mental capacity, cannot be regarded as confidential and privileged communications.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-6\">The rule which forbids an attorney from testifying in respect to matters communicated to him in professional confidence, tends to prevent a full disclosure of the truth in court, and should therefore be somewhat strictly construed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-7\">If this rule is invoked to exclude certain evidence, the burden is upon the objecting party to show that the communication objected to was in fact privileged.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-8\">An assignment of error which asserts merely that the trial court erred in its charge as to the burden of proof, or as to some other general topic, without further reference or specification, is insufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-9\">The trial court may well refuse to charge in the language of a request, however accurate in its statement of the law, which assumes as. facts matters that are in dispute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-10\">There is no specific rule of law that requires a trial court in charging the jury to qualify or explain a general statement -which is in itself correct and unobjectionable. In a given case such omission may - furnish ground for a new trial because it is apparent that in consequence thereof the jury were misled; while in another case the qualification or explanation may be plainly unnecessary for the guidance of the jury. Each case must depend in this respect upon its own peculiar circumstances.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-11\">'In the present case the court charged the jury that mere physical weakness and disease, old age, eccentricities, blunted pjerceptions, weakening judgment and failing mind and memory, were not necessarily inconsistent with testamentary capacity. <em>Held </em>that inasmuch as it appeared from other portions of the charge that the jury were not misled by this statement into supposing that evidence of these physical and mental conditions was of no significance or importance in passing upon the question of testamentary capacity, the appellant had no just cause of complaint upon this ground.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-12\">The case of <em>Hiehmond\u2019s </em>Appeal, 59 Conn. 226, limited and distinguished.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b318-13\">Argued June 22d</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0j\">decided October 5th, 1899.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-14\">Appeal from a decree of the Court of Probate for the district of New Haven approving a certain instrument as the last will of Caroline Warner of New Haven, deceased, taken to the Superior Court in New Haven County and tried to the jury before Slmmway, <em>J.; </em>verdict and judgment sustaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the will, and appeal by the contestant for alleged errors in the rulings and charge of the court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AGqo\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">There was evidence to show that the testatrix died in 1898 at {lie age of 79 years, leaving an estate of about $14,500.

Upon objection the question was excluded and the appellant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-7\">Charles H. Webster, a witness for the appellant, having testified that for six months prior to April, 1887, he had lived in the same house with the testatrix and saw her frequently every day, was asked if she had sufficient mind to intelligently dispose of her property. Upon objection of the appellee this question was excluded, and the appellant excepted to the ruling of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-8\">The further examination of this witness by the appellant was as follows: <em>UQ \u25a0 </em>Do you think she was of sound and disposing mind at that time ? <em>A. </em>Well, her mind was weak.\u201d Upon motion of the appellee this answer was stricken out as not responsive. The appellant excepted. \u201c <em>Q. </em>You may state what her condition was during the time you lived there. <em>A. </em>Well, this time, as I say, her mind was weak.\u201d This witness further said upon direct and cross-examination: \u201cI cannot say about her mind . : . Her mind was weak at the time we went there.\u201d When asked if he thought her mind, was unsound, the witness said in substance that he could not say as to the soundness of her mind further than that her mind was weak.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-9\">In the deposition of Dorcas Webster, wife of the last witness, the following question was asked by the appellant: \u201c Do you think, during the time you lived in the house there with her, she was capable of transacting business ? \u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>witness answered, \u201c I don\u2019t think she was capable of making a will.\u201d The question having been repeated, she answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by transacting business.\u201d These two questions and answers were excluded upon objection, and the appellant excepted. The following answers of this deponent were read: \u201c She was capable of paying her grocery bill; but as for doing legal business, I don\u2019t think she was. I don\u2019t think she could go on and do business, make a will or anything like that. ... I don\u2019t know as I think she was of unsound mind, any way.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">Margaret Newton, a witness for the appellant, who had testified that she was acquainted with the testatrix and had visited her and conversed with her frequently, was asked upon direct examination whether she thought that the testatrix during the last ten years of her life was able to transact business. Upon objection this question was excluded, upon the ground that the opinion of the witness as to the ability of the testatrix to transact business generally was immaterial, but the court ruled that after the witness had stated her knowledge of the testatrix and her opportunities of observing her, she might state whether or not in her opinion she was of sound and disposing mind. The same witness upon direct examination subsequently testified: \u201c Her mind was not as it was once, and she was not able to do as she did once\u2014transact business or much of anything else;\u201d and upon cross-examination, \u201c I shouldn\u2019t call her mind strong enough to transact business alone, from what I knew of her.\u201d Judge Bishop, a witness for the appellee, having testified to his acquaintance for many years with the testatrix, his means of observation and frequent conversations with her, was asked: \u201c Do you recollect any of the conversations had with her at that time, any of the subjects you talked about ? \u201d The witness answered: \u201c She would talk about what her share was under the law, ... in substance, it was she wanted to know how much there was in the estate, how much she was likely to get out of it, and the details of the settlements of the estates, and we would talk those matters over. . . . My recollection of it is that I went to the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>bate court, saw Mr. Burgess afterwards, . . . told lier the amount there was in the estate as appeared by inventory, and told her what Mr. Burgess had said about it, also what the judge of probate had said, . . . and what her distributive share would be after the final settlement of the estate. That was the substance of our talk. . . . Later on, the account of Sherman Warner was filed, and I submitted that report to her, and on that I remember she objected very strenuously to Mr. Burgess\u2019 fees, and gave me instructions to ask that those fees be reduced, and in pursuance of that instruction I did go before the probate court upon that question.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">\u25a0 The appellant objected to this testimony, upon the ground that the witness was the attorney of the testatrix, and was testifying to the confidential communications made to him by his client. The court admitted the evidence, and the appellant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">The appellant requested the court to charge the jury as follows: \u201c 1. If the jury shall find that it is more probable than not that decedent, at the time of the execution of the will, did not sufficiently appreciate and comprehend her relations to the appellant and the beneficiaries under said will, the character and consequences of the provisions of said will and the nature, extent, and effect of the business which she was transacting, their verdict should be for the appellant. 2. It is admitted that Norris W. Mix was in the habit of transacting the decedent\u2019s business, and stood in confidential relations with her, and that said Mix and his sister, Mrs. Potter, brought and accompanied the decedent to the house of the daughter of Mr. Mix, where the will was executed; that Mr. Mix procured the services of the attorney who drafted the will and the witnesses to the will; that under these circumstances the burden of proof is upon the appellees, who are benefited by the provisions in favor of Mr. Mix and Mrs. Potter, to show that decedent was not unduly influenced by them in the making of these provisions. . . . Under these circumstances the burden of proof is upon Mr. Mix to show that decedent was not unduly influenced by him, in so far as the will operates in his favor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The court did not charge as requested in the second request, but charged, in part, upon the subject of the burden of proof, that before the will should be approved as a valid will it should appear to the jury that the statutory formalities, of its execution had been complied with, and that testatrix was at the time of sound and disposing mind and memory; that the burden of proving the testamentary capacity of the testatrix rested upon the proponents of the will; that the law did not require that this fact should be proven with absolute certainty; that at the end there might perhaps exist in the mind of the jurors nothing further than a strong probability that the fact was so; that the rule for determining whether the fact of tes tamentary capacity had been proven, was that the proponents of the will must prove the fact by a fair preponderance of evidence ; that is, that \u201c more or more satisfactory evidence must be produced in favor of the existence of that fact than is produced against it; \u201d that if there should be an uncertainty in the minds of the jnry, so that they could not say upon which side of that issue the evidence preponderated, then \u201c the issue should be found against the party upon whom rested the burden of proving it,\u201d but that \u201cif the evidence preponderated one way or the other, the issue should be found as the evidence preponderated; \u201d that although the burden of proof rested upon the proponents of the will on the issue of the capacity of the testatrix to make a will, yet that the jury should not find that issue in favor of the contestant, \u201cunless the evidence of the contestant overcame that given by the proponent in rebuttal, and was evenly balanced in the mind of the jury with all the evidence of the proponent, including the evidence of the subscribing witnesses by which the proponents had made out a <em>-prima fade </em>case in the first instance; \u201d that the burden of proving that undue influence had been exercised upon the mind of the testatrix was upon the contestant; that the existence of undue influence was not often susceptible of direct pro'of, but was generally proved by \u201c the facts and circumstances surrounding the testator, preceding, pending, and following the making of the will,\u201d and that as bearing upon that ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tion the jury might consider \u201c the testatrix\u2019s family relations, her condition of health, her relations to the persons claimed to have influenced her, her dependence upon and subjection to the control of such persons, and the opportunity of the latter to wield such influence,\u201d and the provisions of the will; that while from such facts and others of a like nature undue influence might be inferred without direct proof, \u201c yet such inference was not to be drawn unfairly or unreasonably,\u201d that \u201c the facts and circumstances ought to be of such a nature as to lead justly and reasonably to the inference that such undue influence existed and was exercised upon the testatrix so that' her mind and will were affected by it, and that she was led thereby to make a different will from what she would have made if it had not existed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">The court also said: \u201c But this burden upon the question of undue influence may be shifted or discharged whenever the business relations existing between the testatrix and tire persons specially benefited by the will, or having drawn the will, or having been shown to have any part in procuring it to be drawn, is such as denotes special confidence, and gives to the party so benefited a controlling influence with the testatrix. . . . If the evidence discloses to you that his (Norris B. Mix\u2019s) relations.to the testatrix were of especial confidence and trust, and that he has been benefited by his act, then ... it is incumbent upon the proponents of the will to show that he acted fairly, and that he took no advantage of his position to induce or to procure the making of the will, or any part of it, in his favor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-7\">In defining undue influence, the court said in its charge : \u201cHer free agency and independence must be overcome, and she must by some domination or control exercised over her mind have been constrained to do what was against her will, and what she was unable to refuse and too weak to- resist. Mere kindness of treatment of a testatrix by a legatee would not, nor would moderate and reasonable solicitation, entreaty, or persuasion, though yielded to, if done intelligently, without restraint, and from a sense of duty, vitiate a will in other respects valid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Upon the question of testamentary capacity the court charged the jury, in part, that it was sufficient if the testatrix had such a mind and memory as would enable her to recollect and understand \u201c the nature and condition of her property, the persons who were or should be the natural objects of her bounty, and her relations to them, the manner in which she wished to distribute it among or withhold it from them, and the scope and bearing of the provisions of the will she was making.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">The court further used the following language: \u201c Mere physical weakness or disease, eccentricities, blunted perceptions, weakening judgment, failing memory or mind are not necessarily inconsistent with testamentary capacity. One\u2019s memory may be failing, and yet his mind not be <em>unsound; </em>one\u2019s mental powers may be weakening, and still sufficient capacity remain to make a will. Now the evidence which has been offered before you as to the mental condition of the testatrix at the time the will was made, and both before and after, has been given to aid you in placing before your minds a mental picture of the testatrix at the time the will was made; and if the evidence shows that the testatrix was physically and mentally weak, that her mind or memory was impaired, that it was less than it may have been at some former period of her life, that she was odd, and that she was peculiar or eccentric, or that she may have said that she feared that she might go to the poorhouse, or that she may have had an incorrect belief as to the wrongs that may have been inflicted upon her, it does not necessarily follow that she had not testamentary capacity. You should not, and you doubtless will not, confound oddities and eccentricities and peculiarities with incapacity; oddities, peculiarities, and eccentricities are one thing: incapacity is the question which you are to pass upon, and say whether the testatrix was incapable in the meaning of the law of making a will. Nor should you mistake a mind that is only weakened for one that is lost.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-7\">The rulings of the court in excluding the questions aforesaid asked the witnesses Mix, Mr. and Mrs. Webster, and Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>garet Newton, and in excluding and striking out their answers as aforesaid, in admitting the testimony of Judge Bishop, and in refusing to charge as above requested, were assigned as reasons of appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AgG\">The 13th and 14th reasons of appeal were in the following form: \u201c 13. The court erred in his charge to the jury as to the burden of proof. 14. The court erred in his charge to the jury as to the amount of preponderance of evidence necessary to establish a will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-7\">Other reasons of appeal alleged error as to parts of the charge above set forth, regarding the preponderance of the evidence, the definition of undue influence, and the failure of the court to instruct the jury that disease, eccentricities and other failings or peculiarities named by the court as not inconsistent with testamentary capacity in the testatrix, were facts which should be considered by the jury as evidence bearing upon the question whether the testatrix possessed testamentary capacity.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-8\"><em>Henry G. Newton </em>and <em>E. P. Arvine, </em>for the appellant (contestant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-9\"><em>William H Williams </em>and <em>Isaac Wolfe, for </em>the appellee (executor).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b326-10\">Hall, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aaa\">The question asked the witness Mix, on cross-examination, if he had not heard Mr. Webb testify to certain facts in the Court of Probate, without correcting him, was properly excluded. It does not appear that Mr. Mix was present when the last will was prepared, nor that he had testified to what occurred at that time. The facts implied in the question did not therefore contradict his testimony. Nor would Mr. Mix have been called upon to correct a witness in the Court of Probate who, he may have thought, was testifying incorrectly. Such inquiries should not be permitted when their evident purpose is to intimate that some other witness has testified differently from the one under examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The rulings of the court excluding certain questions asked the witnesses Mr. and Mrs. Webster and Mrs. Newton, and excluding or striking out their answers, do not furnish sufficient grounds for granting a new trial: first, because if such rulings were erroneous the errors seem to have been corrected by afterwards permitting these witnesses to fully answer the questions which had been excluded; and second, because the record does not so clearly state either the grounds upon which the questions and answers were excluded, or upon which they were objected to, that we can say with certainty that the rulings were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The inquiries excluded called for answers from non-expert witnesses in the nature of opinion evidence, concerning the mental condition of the testatrix. The mere opinions of such witnesses are never received. They are admissible only after a sufficient statement of the particular facts upon which they are based, or after the witness has been shown to have sufficient means and opportunities of personal observation to enable him to form a reasonably correct conclusion. They are received rather as statements of impressions or conclusions in the nature of facts of which the witness has knowledge, than as opinions. Their reception is rendered necessary because of the difficulty of so detailing and so reproducing the numerous particular facts upon which they are founded as to produce upon the triers the impression received by the witness, or to enable them to draw a fair inference from such facts. The value of such a statement when given by a candid and impartial witness, depends largely upon his intelligence and upon his opportunities and habits of observation. 1 Greenl. on Ev. \u00a7 440 and note; <em>Cavendish </em>v. Troy, 41 Vt. 99 ; <em>Conn. Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>111 U. S. 612, 619 ; <em>Sydleman </em>v. <em>Beckwith, </em>43 Conn. 9; <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>63 id. 26; <em>Kimberly's Appeal, </em>68 id. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The record before us does not assume to give the examination of these witnesses in full. If the trial court excluded these questions because the witnesses had not been shown to have had sufficient opportunities of observation to qualify them to express an opinion or conclusion upon the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the inquiries, we cannot, from the testimony as set forth in the finding, hold that such decision was erroneous. , When in trials involving the question of testamentary capacity it is desired that a witness who has testified to sufficient facts should also give his opinion as to the mental condition of the testator, a common and proper form of inquiry is, \u201c Was or was not the testator in your opinion a person of sound mind?\u201d For the purpose of showing the extent of mental impairment it is not unusual nor improper to ask a duly qualified witness whether in his opinion the testator possessed sufficient understanding to be able to transact the ordinary business matters incident to the management of his household affairs and property. <em>Keithley </em>v. <em>Stafford, </em>126 Ill. 607, 520. The mental power required to attend to such ordinary affairs may be regarded as so much a matter of common knowledge and experience as to be a fair standard of comparison readily understood by both witness and jury, by which to illustrate the degree of intelligence of one whose mental condition is the subject of investigation. It has been held to be proper to permit a witness to compare the mental power of the testator to that of \u201c an average child of seven or eight years.\u201d <em>Richmond's Appeal, </em>59 Conn. 226, 242. A witness may of course always testify to the fact, when such fact is within his personal knowledge, that the testator\u2019s mental state was such that he was or was not able to transact business, or to do any other particular act which would indicate the condition of his mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">It is not error to refuse t\u00f3 allow a non-expert witness to state his opinion whether a testator was capable of making a will. <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Kirk, </em>3 Dev. 355, 358; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>32 Mo. 328; <em>White </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>10 Mich. 155, 159; <em>Fairchild </em>v. <em>Bascomb, </em>35 Vt. 398, 414; <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>121 Ill. 376, 386. What constitutes testamentary capacity is a question of law which witnesses and jurors are not ordinarily competent to answer correctly. Their views upon that question would probably differ from each other as well as from the rule laid down by our law upon that subject. Various tests of the capacity essential to enable one to make a valid will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>have been adopted even by the courts. It was formerly held that imbecility of mind not amounting to idiocy or lunacy would not incapacitate one from making a will. <em>Blanchard </em>v. Nestle, 3 Denio, 37; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Lispenard, </em>26 Wend. 255. Som e courts have held the mental ability to execute a valid deed or contract to be the proper measure of testamentary capacity. <em>Stewart </em>v. Elliott, 2 Mackey, 307; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>17 Ala. 84. Others, that the possession of sufficient mind and memory for the transaction of ordinary business is the true test of capacity to make a valid will. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>66 Me. 286. In this State one may make a valid will though mentally incapable of transacting business generally. The test which we apply is the ability of the testator at the time of the execution of the will to understand the nature and elements of the particular transaction of making a will in which he is engaged, and it is a part of the duty of the court in charging the jury, to instruct them as to the elements of the act of intelligently disposing of one\u2019s property by will, which the testator should have been capable of comprehending. <em>St. Leger's </em>Appeal, 34 Conn. 434, 448. It was not error to exclude the answer of the witness Mrs. Webster, that she did not think the testatrix capable of making a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The fact that the testatrix\u2019s mind was weak, testified to by Charles PI. Webster, in answer to the question of appellant\u2019s counsel, was material and relevant to the issue, and having been claimed by counsel examining the witness, the answer should not have been stricken out upon motion of the opposing counsel, merely because it was irresponsive. Such an order of the court, however, furnishes no ground for complaint when, as in this case, counsel is permitted to put another question to which the excluded answer is responsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">There was no error in the ruling of the court admitting the testimony of Judge Bishop concerning his conversations with the testatrix. The burden rested upon the appellant to show that the conversations occurred while the testatrix was consulting the witness professionally as an employed attorney. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>59 Cal. 655. At the time of the objection no preliminary examination seems to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>made for the purpose of proving that fact, nor has that fact been found by the court. The only facts found in connection with the ruling are, that the witness had testified to his acquaintance with the testatrix for many years, to having had frequent opportunities of observing her and frequent conversations with her. That the facts which appear elsewhere in the record with reference to his having acted as her attorney, were known to the court when the objection was made, cannot be assumed. Even those facts fail to show that these conversations occurred while the testatrix was consulting Judge Bishop as her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">But the rule which forbids an attorney from disclosing as a witness matters communicated to him in professional confidence, should be strictly construed as tending to prevent a full disclosure of the truth in court, and we think that the testimony admitted does not amount to a disclosure by the witness of a confidential and privileged communication made to him as an attorney, by his client, even if we assume the existence of the relation of attorney and client between them at the time of the conversations in question. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>12 Pick. 89, 98; <em>Gower </em>v. Emery, 18 Me. 79. The testimony was, in substance, merely that she talked to him about the settlement of an estate; that she wished him to ascertain for her how much she was likely to receive from it, which he did, and that she directed him to appear before the Court of Probate to procure the reduction of certain fees to which she objected. Such a request by a client to his attorney, made for the purpose of obtaining information for the former\u2019s benefit, upon a matter of fact, and not for the purpose of asking the attorney\u2019s advice, ought not to be regarded as a privileged communication. Weeks on Attorneys (2d ed.), p. 328. An attorney may properly be required to testify by whom he is employed and in what capacity. <em>Satterlee </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>36 Cal. 489; <em>Gower </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>18 Me. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The appellant has no reason to complain of the failure of the court to charge the jury in the language of the first request. The court correctly defined testamentary capacity, and charged that the burden of proving that the testatrix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>possessed such capacity at the time of the execution of the will rested upon the proponents of the will. The court further charged that in case there should be \u201can uncertainty in the minds of the jury so that they could not say upon which side of that issue the evidence preponderated, their verdict should be against the party upon whom rested the burden of proving it.\u201d This was more favorable to the appellant than the instruction asked for, which was, in effect, that the appellant was entitled to a verdict if the evidence showed a want of testamentary capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The court properly refused to charge in the language of the second request. The record discloses no admission by the appellee of the facts stated in the request. It was incumbent upon the appellant to prove the asserted confidential relations. <em>Richmonds </em>Appeal, 59 Conn. 226. The court rightly left it to the jury to decide whether the claimed relations of confidence and trust existed between the testatrix and Mr. Mix, and correctly instructed them that if the evidence disclosed the existence of such relations it became \u201c incumbent upon the proponents of the will to show that he (Mix) acted fairly, and that he took no advantage of his position to induce or to procure the making of the will, or any part of it, in his favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The language of the charge defining undue influence was approved by this court in the case of <em>Dale's </em>Appeal, 57 Conn. 127, 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The 13th and 14th reasons of appeal present no questions for our consideration. Clearly it was not intended by these assignments of error to say that parts of the charge manifestly favorable to the appellants, were erroneous; as, for example, that the.burden of proving testamentary capacity rested upon the appellee, and that it should be proved by a fair preponderance of evidence. The purport of these reasons of appeal is that there was error in something which the court said in its charge upon these subjects. They fail to comply with the rule. Practice Book, p. 258, Rule XIV, \u00a7 1; <em>Simmonds </em>v. Holmes, 61 Conn. 1, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">In <em>Richmond's </em>Appeal, supra, p. 245, the trial judge in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>charge to the jury made use of this language : \u201c Mere physical weakness or disease, old age, eccentricities, blunted perceptions, weakening judgment, failing memory or mind, are not necessarily inconsistent with testamentary capacity. One\u2019s memory may be failing and yet his mind not be unsound. One\u2019s mental powers may be weakening, and still sufficient testamentary capacity remain to make a will.\u201d In granting a new trial upon an appeal, this court said concerning that part of the charge : \u201cThis is undoubtedly true, but such facts are admissible in evidence upon the question of capacity, and it was mainly by proof of their existence that the appellants sought to establish the want of such capacity. The court therefore in charging as it did, and in entirely failing to make reference in any portion of the charge to the significance of such facts as evidence, would seem rather, in effect, to have withdrawn them from under the eyes of the jury, and from their consideration of them as such evidence, and thereby may, and we fear must, have misled the jury, to the injury of the appellants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The appellant claims that the court made the same mistake in the case at bar. A distinction may he drawn between this case and <em>Richmond's Appeal. </em>In this case the court did not entirely fail to refer to the evidence of a weakened mind, etc.; on the contrary, it directly refers to the evidence of these facts in connection with the other evidence indicating the mental condition of the testatrix, as proper to be considered by the jury in passing on the question of testamentary capacity, which was accurately defined by the court. All the evidence hearing on the question of capacity was unqualifiedly submitted to the jury for their consideration. The court may properly submit the evidence in such manner as to intimate an opinion in respect to its weight, as undoubtedly was done in this case, so long as it does not exceed the limits of its powers by a practical withdrawal of competent evidence from consideration by the jury. <em>Kimberly's </em>Appeal, 68 Conn. 428, 441; <em>First Baptist Church </em>v. Rouse, 21 id. 160, 167; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rome, </em>64 id. 329, 337-339; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>65 id. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In <em>Richmond\u2019s Appeal </em>there was a total absence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>reference to the evidence on which the appellant relied; there was error in the admission of testimony and error hr other parts of the charge, which were mainly relied on for obtaining a new trial. Indeed the error in not commenting on testimony of a weakened mind, etc., is hardly specified in the reasons of appeal, and but slightly referred to in briefs of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">It would be difficult, however, to distinguish the two cases, if the portion of the opinion above quoted is treated as establishing a rule of law. We think it should not be so treated. The failure to caution the jury in respect to the weight of evidence is <em>errorper se </em>in the case of the admission of the testimony of an accomplice; but ordinarily the propriety of comment on testimony depends on the circumstances of each case. It is not true that a failure to comment on the weight of evidence of a weakened mind, etc., in connection with a statement that such facts, if proved, do not necessarily establish testamentary incapacity, must always be treated as error. The circumstances of a case may be such that a total failure to comment may seem to be equivalent to a withdrawal of the evidence, and so mislead the jury to the injury of a party, as we thought in <em>Richmond?s Appeal; </em>but the circumstances may be such that a slight reference to such testimony is not equivalent to its withdrawal, but is simply a proper exercise of the discretion of the judge in intimating his opinion as to the weight of evidence, as is the case at bar. The question is always largely one of fact\u2014does the charge of the court, in view of all the circumstances, pass beyond the limit of proper comment so as to submit the testimony unfairly or practically invade the province of the jury in passing on the weight of evidence? If so, a new trial may be granted. The charge of the court below does not call for a new trial for such reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
