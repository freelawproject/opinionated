We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Parks has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See United States v. Parks, </em>Nos. CR-99-30; CA-01-15-5 (N.D.W.Va. July 15, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We deny Park\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
