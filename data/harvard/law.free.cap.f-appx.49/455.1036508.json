(Aspen) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of Appellee\u2019s, Larson <em>&amp; </em>Taylor, motion for summary judgment. Because Larson &amp; Taylor\u2019s actions were not the proximate cause of injury to ConMed and Aspen, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">This legal malpractice action stems from an underlying patent case reported as <em>Megadyne Medical Products, Inc. v. Aspen Laboratories, Inc., </em>864 F.Supp. 1099 (D.Utah 1994). Aspen manufactures and sells medical instruments to the health care industry. In 1991, Aspen, a subsidiary of ConMed, was sued by Megadyne Medical Products, Inc. (Megadyne) in the district court in Salt Lake City, Utah for infringement of Megadyne\u2019s patent on an electrosurgical blade.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Larson <em>&amp; </em>Taylor represented Aspen in the Utah patent infringement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">At the close of Megadyne\u2019s case in chief in the Utah action, Larson &amp; Taylor moved for a directed verdict pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) on the issue of patent infringement. However, Larson <em>&amp; </em>Taylor did not move at that time for a directed verdict on the issue of invalidity of the patent. At the close of all the evidence, Larson <em>&amp; </em>Taylor did not make or renew any motion for directed verdict. The jury returned a verdict for Megadyne in the amount of $1.92 per unit, finding that the '807 patent was not invalid, that Aspen\u2019s surgical blade infringed upon the '807 patent, and that the infringement was willful.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">After the jury\u2019s verdict, Larson &amp; Taylor made a rule 50(b) motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of the patent\u2019s invalidity. Specifically, Larson <em>&amp; </em>Taylor argued that the proper con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>struction of the patent claim was an issue for the judge and not for the jury. The Utah district court denied the motion, stating that Aspen\u2019s failure to raise the issue of the patent\u2019s validity in any prior motion for directed verdict made the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict untimely under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b). <em>Megadyne Med. Prods., </em>864 F.Supp. at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Larson <em>&amp; </em>Taylor also moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of patent infringement and willful infringement. However, because they had not renewed the motion for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence, as generally required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), the district court denied this motion as well. The district court held that by failing to renew their motion for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence, Aspen forfeited its opportunity to so challenge the factual premise of the adverse jury verdict on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>Megadyne Med. Prods., </em>864 F.Supp. at 1106.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Aspen appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeal only concerned the Utah court\u2019s denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as it pertained to the infringement issue. Aspen did not challenge the Utah court\u2019s denial of the judgment notwithstanding the verdict motion with respect to the invalidity of the '807 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">On April 4, 1995, the Federal Circuit entered a judgment affirming the lower court without opinion pursuant to Fed. Civ. R. 36 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ConMed and Aspen filed a petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing <em>en banc </em>that was denied by the Federal Circuit on May 1, 1995. ConMed and Aspen paid the judgment of the Utah district court in the amount of $2,275,866.34 on June 20, 1995 and did not seek certiorari in the Supreme Court. They stated they would pursue further relief by way of re-examination by the Patent and Trademark Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">In February of 1998, ConMed and Aspen filed this legal malpractice action against Larson &amp; Taylor, alleging that Larson &amp; Taylor attorneys breached the applicable standard of care during trial in the Utah action by failing to move properly for a directed verdict and failing to renew that motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. ConMed and Aspen further alleged that this error caused direct harm to them because the Federal Circuit would have reversed the jury\u2019s decision and decided in their favor but for Larson &amp; Taylor\u2019s failure to make these motions properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">After full discovery, both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the district court. The district court concluded that to prevail on their malpractice claim, ConMed and Aspen were required to show that the Federal Circuit would have found in their favor if Larson &amp; Taylor had made the appropriate motions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>After reviewing the proceedings in the Utah district court action and upon oral argument by the parties, the district court held that even if the defendants had made a timely Rule 50 motion at the close of all the evidence, the outcome of the appeal in the Federal Circuit would not have changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The district court held that sufficient evidence existed to support the verdict in the Utah district court action and that the Utah jury\u2019s construction of the patent claim was sustainable in law. Because ConMed and Aspen thus failed to establish causation and resulting damages, the district court granted summary judgment for Larson &amp; Taylor. ConMed and Aspen appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See <em>Myers v. Finkle, </em>950 F.2d 165, 167 (4th Cir.1991). A moving party is entitled to summary judgment if there is no genuine issue as to material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">To prevail in a legal malpractice action under Virginia law, a plaintiff must prove that an attorney-client relationship existed which gave rise to a duty and the neglect or breach of that duty by the attorney proximately caused the client\u2019s damage. See <em>Gregory v. Hawkins, </em>251 Va. 471, 468 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1996). In order to prevail on the causation element, a plaintiff must show that the appellate court would have reversed and entered judgment in the plaintiffs favor but for the attorney\u2019s error. See <em>Goldstein v. Kaestner, </em>243 Va. 169, 413 S.E.2d 347, 349 (1992) (holding the appropriate standard of review in a malpractice action where a timely appeal is not filed).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, in order for ConMed and Aspen to prevail, they must demonstrate that but for Larson <em>&amp; </em>Taylor\u2019s alleged negligence, the Federal Circuit would have found in Aspen\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">Because the nature of this malpractice action requires that we review the Utah district court\u2019s denial of ConMed and Aspen\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict assuming the motion had been properly made and review the denial from the perspective of the Federal Circuit, we must first determine the standard under which the Federal Circuit would review the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">As we have previously held, \u201cthe rules governing appellate review of patent cases are no different than in other types of civil litigation.\u201d <em>Tights, Inc. v. Acme-McCrary Corp., </em>541 F.2d 1047, 1055 (4th Cir.1976). Thus, in determining whether the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted, we must evaluate the evidence adduced at trial in the light most favorable to the verdict winner; the court will not attempt either to weigh the evidence or pass on credibility; and the court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the jury. See <em>Brown v. McGraw-Edison Co., </em>736 F.2d 609, 612-13 (10th Cir.1984); <em>Richardson v. Suzuki Motor Co., </em>868 F.2d 1226, 1235 (Fed.Cir.1989). In the case of patent infringement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>a jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence; that is, \u201cif there is evidence upon which a reasonable jury could have found infringement.\u201d <em>Ultradent Prods., Inc. v. Life-Like Cosmetics, Inc., </em>127 F.8d 1065, 1070 (Fed.Cir.1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Federal Circuit precedent provides that in order for an appellant to prevail in such an infringement appeal, as here, the appellant must show that the jury\u2019s finding is not supported by substantial evidence or that the jury\u2019s finding was made in relation to claim interpretation that cannot be sustained in law. See <em>Senmed, Inc. v. Richard-Alien Med. Indus., </em>888 F.2d 815, 817 (Fed.Cir.1989).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ConMed and Aspen argue that the jury\u2019s finding in the Utah district court was made in relation to claim interpretation that cannot be sustained in law and that if Larson <em>&amp; </em>Taylor had properly moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the Federal Circuit would have properly construed these patent claims and reversed the Utah district court. (ConMed and Aspen brief at 2) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">ConMed and Aspen assert that the district court committed a fundamental error by failing to construe the '807 patent claims as a matter of law prior to concluding that substantial evidence supported the Utah jury\u2019s finding of infringement. Con-Med and Aspen further contend that Federal Circuit precedent obligates the court to construe the patent claims as a matter of law and that the district court\u2019s failure to do so, consistent with their position, as ConMed and Aspen believe the Federal Circuit should have, constitutes reversible error. ConMed and Aspen\u2019s argument is based on their belief that when the '807 patent is properly construed, the undisputed evidence shows either that the '807 patent is invalid or that the Aspen blade does not infringe upon the '807 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">In asserting that it is the court\u2019s duty to construe the patent claim at issue first, ConMed and Aspen rely on the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967 (Fed.Cir.1995), aff'd. 517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996). Indeed, <em>Mark-man </em>mandates that \u201cin a case tried to a jury, the court has the power and obligation to construe as a matter of law the meaning of language used in the patent claim.\u201d <em>Markman, </em>52 F.3d at 979. However, at the time the Federal Circuit reviewed the Utah district court\u2019s denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in this case, the <em>Markman </em>decision had <em>not been </em>decided. Therefore, in order to determine whether the Federal Circuit would have reversed the Utah court\u2019s denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict had it been made properly, we must first address whether it was appropriate under Federal Circuit law at the time of the appeal for the issue of patent claim construction to be submitted to the jury. If submitting the issue to the jury was appropriate and substantial evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s verdict and claim construction, the jury\u2019s verdict must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">As the <em>Markman </em>decision itself points out, prior to <em>Markman </em>\u201cthe opinions of ... [the Federal Circuit] contained some inconsistent statements as to whether and to what extent claim construction is a legal or factual issue, or a mixed issue.\u201d <em>Mark-man, </em>52 F.3d at 976. Although some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>cases state that claim construction was a matter of law for the court to decide,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a number of other cases stated that claim construction may contain underlying issues with relation to facts which must be submitted to a jury under proper instructions. See, e.g., <em>Tol-O-Matic, Inc. v. Proma Produkt-Und Mktg., </em>945 F.2d 1546, 1552 (Fed.Cir.1991); <em>Palumbo v. Don-Joy Co., </em>762 F.2d 969, 974 (Fed.Cir.1985); <em>McGill Inc. v. John Zink Co., </em>736 F.2d 666, 671-72 (Fed.Cir.1984). Regardless of whether <em>Markman </em>held that these cases were erroneous in their analysis of the patent claim construction issue, prior to <em>Markman </em>they were still good law in the Federal Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The <em>McGill, Palumbo, </em>and <em>Tol-O-Matic </em>decisions all found that claim construction could contain factual issues which should be resolved by the jury. In the present case, a factual dispute with regard to the patent claim construction is precisely what the district court found existed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Upon reviewing the trial record of the Utah action, the district court found \u201csubstantial material fact issues in dispute with the claim construction.\u201d Thus, under Federal Circuit case law prior to <em>Markman, </em>it was not at all inappropriate for the Utah district court to submit the issue of patent claim construction to the jury under proper instructions. Nor was it inappropriate or inconsistent with applicable law for the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals or the district court in the case at hand to rely on the jury\u2019s claim construction of the patent under the instructions of the court and uphold its verdict. As such, we are of opinion that the district court did not err in failing to construe the patent claims favorably to ConMed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">After reviewing the evidence that the jury received, the district court stated, \u201cthis Court cannot find that the jury\u2019s verdict was not supported by substantial evidence, or that the jury\u2019s finding of the claim interpretation cannot be sustained in law.\u201d As a result, the district court decided that even if Larson and Taylor had made a timely Rule 50 motion, the outcome of the appeal would not have been different. Upon our own review of the record, we agree with the district court that the jury received and reviewed conflicting evidence with respect to patent claim construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">We also agree that the jury\u2019s claim interpretation is sustainable in law and that its verdict is supported by substantial evidence. At the time the appeal was taken, Federal Circuit case law allowed for claim construction to be left for the jury in cases where infringement of a patent hinges on the interpretation of the claim. <em>See Tol-O-Matic v. Proma Produkt-Und Mktg., </em>945 F.2d 1546, 1552 (Fed.Cir.1991). Thus, because the jury\u2019s claim interpretation was sustainable in law and its verdict is supported by substantial evidence, we are of opinion that Larson &amp; Taylor\u2019s actions did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>not cause damage to the ConMed or Aspen.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">We also note that, with respect to Con-Med\u2019s and Aspen\u2019s argument regarding the validity of the '807 patent, Aspen did not appeal the Utah district court\u2019s denial of judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of invalidity. As such, the Federal Circuit would not have considered the invalidity issue. The district court, therefore, in the case at hand, did not have to consider the invalidity issue in its review of the record from the Federal Circuit\u2019s perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">In this mixed up case of attempting an hypothetical review of the decisions of a Utah district court and a sister circuit, not even on direct appeal, but by collateral attack on a judgment which has been paid by means of a suit for malpractice, the following facts or conclusions or arguments, however the same may be phrased, in our opinion, also tend to support the judgment of the district court in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">First, the success of the plaintiffs in this case depends to a large extent on a favorable construction of Federal Circuit Local Rule 36, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">The court may enter a judgment of affirmance without opinion, citing this rule, when it determines that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">(a) the judgment, decision or order of the trial court appealed from is based on findings that are not clearly erroneous;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">(b) the evidence in support of a jury verdict is sufficient;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">(c) summary judgment, directed verdict, or judgment on the pleadings is supported by the record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">(d) the decision of an administrative agency warrants affirmance under the standard of review in the statute authorizing the petition for review; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-15\">(e) a judgment or decision has been entered without an error of law and an opinion would have no precedential value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">It is at once apparent that the judgment of the Federal Circuit might have been based on part (a) of the Rule, or part (b) of the Rule, or part (e) of the Rule, any or all of them. Instead, to arrive at the result sought to be obtained by ConMed and Aspen, the judgment of the Federal Circuit must have been based on the failure of Larson and Taylor to renew the motion for a directed verdict at the close of all of the evidence, a procedural failure which is not mentioned in Rule 36 but which might have been mentioned in a non-precedential order or opinion otherwise. See <em>Hamilton v. Brown, </em>39 F.3d 1574, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1994). While we do not decide the basis on which the Federal Circuit based its opinion, the supposition that it was based on the claimed negligence of the attorneys is not proven by the entry of judgment under its Rule 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">The complaint of ConMed and Aspen is that a proper construction of the claims of the '807 patent at issue in this case would have shown that there was no liability unless on a claim interpretation that cannot be sustained in law under <em>Senmed, </em>888 F.2d at 817. But the claims of the '807 patent were before the jury as well as the court. The jury\u2019s application of the facts of the case to the claims of the patent could be only under the instructions of the court, whatever the construction of <em>Mark-man </em>might be. The Utah district court, having received requests for instructions, prepared instructions in writing, apparently 67 in number, and took them up one at a time with the attorneys in some 64 pages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>of transcript. As the instructions were given to the jury, there were no objections. Of the 67 instructions, only nos. 18, 19, 24, 29, 30, 32 and 33 are included in the record on appeal in this case. The claims of patent '807 are presumed to be valid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282. See also <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. The University of Illinois Foundation, et al, </em>402 U.S. 313, 335, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971). The instructions included in the record on appeal are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No complaint is made in the brief of ConMed and Aspen about those instrue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>tions. We have examined those instrue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>tions and, in all events, are of opinion they do not relate to a claim interpretation that cannot be sustained in law under <em>Senmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AA-\">The other matter coming to the attention of the jury which might have contained a claim interpretation that cannot be sustained in law was the form of special verdict, which is also set out in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It was not objected to. We have examined that verdict and find nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>it relating to a claim interpretation that cannot be sustained in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We also add that, whatever the extent of the rule of the <em>Markman </em>case, we are of opinion that the record in this case does not show a violation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">On cross appeal, Larson and Taylor argue that ConMed\u2019s legal malpractice claims are barred by the Virginia statute of limitations. We will not consider this argument because we have affirmed the district court\u2019s decision on the grounds stated in the body of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-12\">. Megadyne\u2019s founder procured the patent in 1988. The patent was recorded as Patent No. 4,785,807 (the '807 patent).

WHAT THAT HYPOTHETICAL PERSON KNOWS, UNDERSTANDS OR IS FAMILIAR WITH IN THAT TECHNICAL AREA IS MEASURED AS OF THE TIME THAT THE INVENTION WAS MADE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF4\">INSTRUCTION NO. 19</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">THERE ARE TWO WAYS IN WHICH A PATENT CLAIM MAY BE INFRINGED. FIRST, A CLAIM MAY BE \"LITERALLY\u201d INFRINGED. SECOND, A CLAIM MAY BE INFRINGED UNDER WHAT IS CALLED THE \"DOCTRINE OF EQUIVALENTS.\u201d THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PATENT RIGHT ARE DEFINED BY THE CLAIMS OF THE PATENT.
