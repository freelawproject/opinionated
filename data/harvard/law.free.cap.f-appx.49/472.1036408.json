We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Delise has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See United States v. Delise, </em>No. CR-99-16 (E.D. Va. filed May 17, 2002; entered May 24, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-19\"> Because Delise has previously filed her first \u00a7 2255 motion, we conclude there was no error in the court's not providing notice under <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644, 649-50 (4th Cir.2002), of its intent to construe the motion as one under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
