McEvily asserts that the statute is ambiguous and therefore uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>stitutional. We lack jurisdiction to consider McEvily\u2019s petition, and so must dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The All Writs Act vests all statutorily created federal courts, including this court, with authority to issue \u201call writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (2000). However, McEvily\u2019s petition fails to implicate the independent basis for our jurisdiction necessary to proceed under the All Writs Act. <em>See In re Chambers Develop. Co., </em>148 F.3d 214, 223 n. 6 (3d Cir.1998) (stating that the All Writs Act requires that \u201cthe case may at some future time come within the court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction\u201d). McEvily\u2019s petition fails to allege any active case or controversy. Accordingly, although we grant McEvily\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, we dismiss his petition. We dispense with oral argument because' the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"ApE\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
