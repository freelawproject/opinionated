Keith Neely seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying his motions filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) and Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. Neely has also filed a motion for a certificate of appealability. As to Neely\u2019s \u00a7 2255 and Rule 33 motions, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Neely\u2019s Rule 33 motion and dismiss his appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Neely, </em>Nos. CR-92-78-R; CA-99-742 (W.D.Va. Feb. 21, 2002). Because Neely has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, we deny a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
