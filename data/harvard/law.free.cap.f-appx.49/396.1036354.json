(\u201cRed Storm\u201d). Lo-mas sued Red Storm seeking benefits due under an individual retention/severance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging violations of both the common law and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461 (\u201cERISA\u201d). The district court concluded that the Agreement was part of Red Storm\u2019s Retention and Severance Program (the \u201cRSP\u201d), and it awarded summary judgment in favor of Red Storm on the basis that Lomas did not exhaust the remedies provided in the RSP and failed to show that resort to the internal grievance procedure would have been futile. <em>See Lomas v. Red Storm Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>No. 5:01-CV-237-BO(2), Order (E.D.N.C. Aug. 14, 2001) (the \u201cOrder\u201d). As explained below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Lomas was initially employed in 1997 by Red Storm, a video game publisher, as its Vice President of Product Development. He first worked in the United Kingdom and in 1998 he transferred to North Carolina.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition to serving as Vice President of Product Development, Lomas was the Secretary of Red Storm\u2019s Board of Directors. On June 4, 1999, Red Storm established the RSP, which provides discretionary severance benefits to its employees in the event that their employment is terminated. On June 6, 1999, Red Storm and Lomas executed the Agreement, which provides Lomas with specific severance benefits in the event of termination. In 2000, Red Storm engaged in negotiations with another software company, Ubi Soft, regarding a possible acquisition and merger. On June 14, 2000, Red Storm amended its Agreement with Lomas to provide him greater protection in the event a corporate merger between Red Storm and Ubi Soft was consummated. The amendment authorized Lomas to receive severance benefits not only if he was terminated, but also in the event he resigned for \u201cgood reason\u201d during a specified period surrounding a change in the control of Red Storm.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">In September of 2000, Red Storm was acquired by Ubi Soft, and it was subsequently merged with one of Ubi Soft\u2019s subsidiaries, Ubi Soft Newco 1. Lomas alleges that, following the merger, he experienced a diminution in status. For example, he was no longer involved in the strategy and direction of Red Storm, he was removed as Secretary of its Board of Directors, and while other staff members received pay increases, he did not. On October 29, 2000, Lomas sent an e-mail to his then supervisor, Christine Burgess, outlining his concerns regarding these changes in his status. In a subsequent conversation between Ms. Burgess and Lomas, on November 10, 2000, Ms. Burgess agreed that Lomas\u2019s role with Red Storm had been reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Soon thereafter Lomas spoke with Red Storm\u2019s lawyer and, on December 15, 2000, the lawyer provided Lomas with a proposed severance package, as well as a separate consulting agreement. The proposal would have given Lomas benefits that were significantly reduced from those available to him under the Agreement. Lomas rejected the proposed severance package and resigned from Red Storm in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>January of 2001. He alleges that, in the weeks leading up to his resignation, both he and his attorney requested that Red Storm pay the severance benefits due him under the Agreement. In response, Lo-mas was advised by Red Storm\u2019s lawyer and its Financial Controller that he would not be paid in accordance with the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Lomas filed his complaint against Red Storm on February 22, 2001, in the Wake County, North Carolina, Superior Court, alleging a common law breach of contract and a violation of ERISA. Red Storm then removed the case to the Eastern District of North Carolina, asserting that Lo-mas\u2019s claims were governed by ERISA. On April 19, 2001, Red Storm moved to dismiss Lomas\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust the RSP\u2019s remedies, supporting its motion with a copy of Red Storm\u2019s RSP, Lomas\u2019s resignation letter, and several affidavits. In response to the motion to dismiss, Lomas also submitted various supporting documents to the court, including his own affidavit and his e-mail of October 29, 2000, to Ms. Burgess.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In its Order of August 14, 2001, the district court observed that Red Storm had failed to denominate the procedural rule under which its motion was filed. However, because the parties had presented it with materials outside the pleading in connection with the motion to dismiss, the court converted the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Order at 2. The court then determined that the RSP was governed by ERISA and that the Agreement constituted part of the RSP. Accordingly, it granted summary judgment in favor of Red Storm because Lo-mas had failed to exhaust the remedies provided to him in the RSP. <em>Id. </em>at 4. Lomas filed a timely notice of appeal, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">This Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment, applying the same legal standards used by the district court and viewing the facts and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon v. Alpha of Va., </em>48 F.3d 922, 928 (4th Cir.1995). Summary judgment is not appropriate unless there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). However, the ultimate issue of whether an employee benefit plan is governed by ERISA is a mixed question of fact and law. <em>See Custer v. Pan Am. Life Ins. Co., </em>12 F.3d 410, 416 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">In order to determine whether Red Storm was entitled to summary judgment in this case, it is necessary for us to first examine in some detail the provisions of both the RSP and the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">On June 4, 1999, Red Storm established the RSP, which provides discretionary benefits to Red Storm employees in the event such employees are terminated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>The RSP is plainly regulated by ERISA because it is an \u201cemployee benefit plan\u201d established by an \u201cemployer engaged in commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(a)(1). The RSP allows the Program Administrator, \u201cin its sole discretion,\u201d to award a severance allowance to an employee. RSP at \u00a7 3. Additionally, the RSP permits Red Storm to \u201camend or terminate\u201d it at any time, and it also provides that, except to the extent preempted by ERISA, it is to be \u201cconstrued in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9. Finally, the RSP contains an internal grievance procedure, pursuant to the requirements of ERISA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133. This procedure provides that, when a claimant is unsatisfied with the decision of the Program Administrator regarding a claim for benefits under the RSP, he \u201cmay appeal the decision ... by filing a written request with the Program Administrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7. Within sixty days of the filing of the written request, the \u201cclaimant shall receive written notice of the Program Administrator\u2019s final decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The Agreement recites, in its introductory paragraph, that it is made \u201cpursuant to the terms and conditions\u201d of the RSP, and it specifies the severance benefits' due Lo-mas in the event he resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d or if he is terminated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Agreement at \u00b6 5. In addition, the Agreement states that it \u201csupersedes all prior agreements and understandings\u201d and provides that \u201cno change, modification, [or] termination [will be] binding upon any party ... unless reduced to writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4, 5. In contrast to the RSP, which may be terminated by Red Storm at any time, the Agreement provides that it \u201cshall remain in effect for the duration of the Employee\u2019s employment with the Company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 1. The choice of law provision in the Agreement makes no mention of ERISA preemption, and it mandates that the Agreement be construed in accordance with North Carolina law. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8. Finally, the Agreement provides that, in the event Lomas is entitled to benefits thereunder, he will \u201cnot be entitled to benefits under any other severance plan, policy or arrangement of the Company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The principal issue in this case is whether the Agreement is governed by ERISA, either of its own accord or by virtue of its connection to the RSP. As explained below, we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact on both of these points. Specifically, it is unclear whether the Agreement, on its own, constitutes an \u201cemployee benefit plan\u201d within ERISA; and it is similarly unclear whether the Agreement is governed by ERISA as part of the RSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">First, the fact that the Agreement addresses the issue of severance benefits is, standing alone and absent some connection to the RSP, insufficient to bring it under the umbrella of ERISA. In <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987), the Supreme Court explained the types of employee benefit arrangements that trigger ERISA preemption. It pointed to the ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>press language of ERISA, which calls for the preemption of any state law that \u201crelated] to any employee benefit <em>plan.\u201d Id. </em>at 8, 107 S.Ct. 2211 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a)) (emphasis in original). The Court made clear that ERISA regulates employee benefit plans, not simply employee benefits. The Court determined that a benefit \u201cplan\u201d is one that \u201crequires an ongoing administrative program to meet the employer\u2019s obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 107 S.Ct. 2211. The Court went on to conclude that an arrangement requiring a \u201cone-time, lump-sum payment triggered by a single event,\u201d particularly one that might never occur, is not a \u201cplan\u201d regulated by ERISA. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 107 S.Ct. 2211. In so concluding, the Court emphasized that such a payment \u201crequires no administrative scheme whatsoever.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, if a benefit plan does not require an administrative scheme in order for an employer to fulfill its obligations thereunder, it appears not to be governed by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In our assessment of this case, we are impressed by and find persuasive the decision of one of our sister circuits. In <em>Kulinski v. Medtronic Bio-Medicus, Inc., </em>21 F.3d 254 (8th Cir.1994), the Eighth Circuit had occasion to assess whether a similar agreement was governed by ERISA. In so doing, it determined that the terms of that agreement did not fall within ERISA\u2019s regulatory scope because \u201conce a ... takeover occurred and [the employee] resigned his employment ... there was nothing for the company to decide, no discretion for it to exercise, and nothing for it to do but write a check.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">A straightforward application of the <em>Fort Halifax </em>and <em>Kulinski </em>standards to the Agreement between Red Storm and Lomas indicates that it is not inherently governed by ERISA. The Agreement provides Lomas with severance benefits if he is terminated, or if he has \u201cgood reason\u201d to end his employment in the three-month period prior to a change of control, or in the eighteen-month period following a change of control. The term \u201cgood reason\u201d is defined in the Agreement, <em>see supra </em>note 4, thus leaving Red Storm with no discretion to determine either (a) whether Lomas was entitled to severance benefits, or (b) the amount of benefits he was to receive. Therefore, the Agreement, on its face, is similar to the one in <em>Kulinski; </em>it does not require an administrative scheme and it does not appear to be an employee benefit plan as defined by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">We are similarly unconvinced, on this record, that the Agreement is part of the RSP. As we have pointed out, it is undisputed that the RSP is an employee benefit plan regulated by ERISA. Therefore, if the Agreement is part of the RSP, it too is governed by ERISA. As a result, and as the district court properly recognized, Lo-mas\u2019s state law contract claim would be preempted. Unless resort to the internal grievance procedure would be futile, the court would be required, pursuant to ERISA, to dismiss Lomas\u2019s ERISA claim for failure to exhaust the remedies provided by the RSP. <em>Makar v. Health Care Corp. of the Mid-Atlantic (Carefirst), </em>872 F.2d 80, 82 (4th Cir.1989) (\u201c[A]n ERISA claimant generally is required to exhaust the remedies provided by the employee benefit plan in which he participates as a prerequisite to an ERISA action for denial of benefits under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">In concluding that the Agreement constituted part of the RSP, the district court relied exclusively on the Agreement\u2019s introductory paragraph, which recites that it was \u201cmade and entered into ... pursuant to the terms and conditions of the [RSP].\u201d However, this introductory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>recitation, when read in context with the balance of the Agreement and the RSP, is hardly dispositive of the ERISA question. For example, the Agreement, executed after the RSP was created, specifically supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between Lomas and Red Storm on the issue of severance benefits. Agreement at \u00b6 4. This provision could well signify that the Agreement supersedes the RSP. Supporting this contention, the Agreement provides that Lomas\u2019s entitlement to benefits thereunder would foreclose his right to receive benefits under any other severance plan. Id at \u00b6 10. In addition, the Agreement provides that it \u201cshall remain in effect for the duration of the Employee\u2019s employment with the Company.\u201d Id at \u00b6 1. On the other hand, the RSP makes clear that Red Storm can unilaterally terminate the RSP at any time. RSP at \u00a7 8. Collectively, these provisions of the Agreement cast further doubt on the district court\u2019s conclusion that, as a contractual matter, the Agreement is part of the RSP. In addition, any ambiguity concerning whether the Agreement constitutes part of the RSP would probably be construed against Red Storm, as the Agreement\u2019s drafter. See <em>Doe v. Group Hospitalization &amp; Med Servs., </em>3 F.3d 80, 89 (4th Cir.1993). Thus, Red Storm was not entitled to summary judgment based solely on the introductory paragraph of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Red Storm\u2019s contention that the Agreement cannot be read as separate and distinct from the RSP is likewise unpersuasive. The RSP, while available to all employees of Red Storm, does not purport to be the exclusive means through which those employees may receive severance benefits; indeed, our review of the RSP indicates that participation in it, and an employee\u2019s obligation to follow the internal grievance procedure provided therein, are triggered by the employee\u2019s decision to become a claimant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the Agreement provides a distinct mechanism for triggering Red Storm\u2019s benefits obligation to Lomas (either termination by Red Storm or Lo-mas\u2019s written notice of resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d), it is not clear that the benefits provided for under the Agreement merely supplement those provided by the RSP. Indeed, as discussed above, if Lomas is entitled to benefits under the Agreement, he is foreclosed from accepting benefits under any other severance agreement, presumably including the RSP. Agreement at \u00b6 10 (\u201c[I]f the Employee is entitled to benefits under this Agreement, the Employee shall not be entitled to benefits under any other severance plan, policy, or arrangement of the Company or its affiliates.\u201d). In light of this foreclosure provision, the Agreement may well provide Lomas with a separate and independent basis for receiving severance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Although the district court properly converted Red Storm\u2019s motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment, to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u201cmatters outside the pleading,\u201d the court failed to provide \u201call parties [a] reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion,\u201d as required by Rule 12(b). Because of the apparent ambiguities in the RSP and in the Agreement, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Agreement is a part of the RSP and thus governed by ERISA. The Agreement is governed by North Carolina law and, under applicable North Carolina legal principles, where \u201cthe terms of a written contract or other instrument are susceptible of more than one interpretation, or an ambiguity arises, ... parol or extrinsic evidence may be introduced to show what was in the minds of the parties at the time of making the contract.\u201d <em>Root v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>272 N.C. 580, 587, 158 S.E.2d 829 (1968) (internal quotation omitted). In this instance, parol evidence may well assist the parties and the court on the question of whether the Agreement was intended to be part of the RSP. As a result, the parties should be accorded an opportunity to conduct any relevant discovery, and they should be permitted to present to the court any materials pertinent to the issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we vacate the Order granting summary judgment and we remand for such other and further proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">.
