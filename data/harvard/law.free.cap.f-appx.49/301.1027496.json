Montgomery\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Montgomery opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Montgomery filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages \u201cin a eight or nine digit figure exceeding multiples of tens of thousands of dollars.\u201d The Court of Federal Claims dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-7\">Plaintiff, a pro se claimant, is suing here to recover for damages allegedly suffered in connection with what he describes as \u201ccivil rights violations,\u201d specifically: Ms segregation in prison based on race, the garnishment of his wages, and the loss of a word processor and other items of personal property. Plaintiff additionally complains of the procedure, purportedly imposed by the Clerk of the Seventh Circuit, requiring payment of $500 before a federal court may hear any challenge to plamtiff s criminal conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-8\">Assuming the truth of plaintiffs allegations, we nonetheless find that the mjuries he describes are not ones for which this court may provide redress. This court is a court of limited jurisdiction, restricted by its jurisdictional grant (set forth at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (1994)) to those actions that assert a right to the payment of money pursuant to the terms of the Constitution, a statute, regulation, or a contract. <em>Eastport Steamship Corp. v. United States, </em>178 Ct.Cl. 599, 372 F.2d 1002 (Ct.Cl.1967). Plaintiffs unspecified claim for damages does not fit within this jurisdictional grant. Accordmgly, the remedy plaintiff seeks is not available in this forum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">Summary affirmance of a case is appropriate \u201cwhen the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists\u201d. <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir.1994). Montgomery\u2019s complaint lists causes of action arising oMy from alleged torts and alleged civil rights violations. The Court of Federal claims lacks jurisdiction over tort claims. <em>See Shearin v. United States, </em>992 F.2d 1195, 1197 (Fed.Cir.1993); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1). Further, the Court of Federal Claims does not have jurisdiction over civil rights claims brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the United States Constitution. <em>See LeBlanc v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed.Cir.1995); <em>Osborn v. United States, </em>47 Fed.Cl. 224, 232 (Fed.Cl.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">The Court of Federal Claims correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction. We conclude that no substantial question regarding the outcome of this appeal exists; therefore, summary affirmance is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b876-16\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b876-17\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion for summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-18\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
