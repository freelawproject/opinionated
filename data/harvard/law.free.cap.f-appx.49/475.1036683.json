We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Muldrow v. City of Florence, </em>No. CA-01-3701-0-18-BD (D.S.C. July 15, 2002). Muldrow\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
