Collins seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his petition for a \u201cwrit of audita querela\u201d filed under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (2000), which the district court properly construed as a successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 motion solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the motion states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Collins has not made the requisite showing. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>Nos. CR-87-338-HAR; CA-02-969-CCB (DMd. Apr. 15, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\"> We conclude that notice under <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644 (4th Cir.2002), was not required because this was not Collins' first \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
