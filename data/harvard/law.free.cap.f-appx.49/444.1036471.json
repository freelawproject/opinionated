We have reviewed the administrative record and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Shewatsega failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution as necessary to qualify for relief from deportation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994); <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992); <em>Matter of Kojoory, </em>12 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 215 (BIA 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-18\">Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-29\"> We note that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) effective April 1, 1997. Because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is still applicable here under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
