(Kimco) petition for permission to appeal an order certified for immediate appeal by the Court of Federal Claims. The United States has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">Kimco sued the United States for recovery of certain common area maintenance charges pursuant to a lease and for certain tax payments. The United States counterclaimed for reimbursement of certain taxes paid to plaintiffs. The Court of Federal Claims decided the issues primarily in the United States\u2019 favor. The Court of Federal Claims directed the parties to file a stipulation regarding damages, which apparently the parties were unable to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">Kimco\u2019s previous attempts to appeal the Court of Federal Claims decision were dismissed by this court on June 27, 2002 as premature because there was no entry of final judgment. Thereafter, Kimco sought and obtained a certification, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(2), that the order involved controlling questions of law and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. The trial court stated that the controlling questions of law were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-19\">1. Whether this Court correctly applied applicable law in determining the extent to which the Postal Service is responsible for \u201cCommon Area Maintenance Charges\u201d under the subject lease, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-20\">2. Whether this Court correctly applied applicable law in determining that the Postal Service is not responsible for a share of property taxes under the subject lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-21\">This court must exercise its own discretion whether it will grant permission to appeal an interlocutory order certified by a trial court. <em>See In re Convertible Rowing Exerciser Patent Litigation, </em>903 F.2d 822 (Fed.Cir.1990); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(2) (\u201cthe Federal Circuit may, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order\u201d). We determine that granting the petition is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b874-24\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b874-25\">The petition for permission to appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
