On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on the felon in possession of a firearm count. Farmer argues that under North Carolina law he was permitted to possess a firearm at his residence, pursuant to the North Carolina Felony Firearms Act, N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 14-415.1(a) (1993 &amp; Supp.1999), and therefore the Government did not prove that he was in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-22\">The North Carolina Felony Firearms Act provides for \u201cthe right of any person to have possession of a firearm within his home or on his lawful place of business.\u201d N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14.415.1(a). Farmer claims that, because he was permitted to possess the handgun in his home under North Carolina law, he was not a convicted felon within the meaning of \u00a7 922(g). Farmer\u2019s claim is foreclosed, however, by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Caron v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 308, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-23\">In <em>Caron, </em>the Supreme Court adopted an \u201call or nothing approach,\u201d holding that if the state places any restrictions on the felon\u2019s ability to possess a firearm, then his previous conviction falls within the definition of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) (2000) on which a \u00a7 922 conviction may be based. <em>See id. </em>at 314-15, 118 S.Ct. at 2011-12. The Court upheld Caron\u2019s conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm, even though Caron\u2019s firearm possession was legal under Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Here, the North Carolina Felony Firearms Act prohibits convicted felons whose civil rights have been otherwise restored from possessing handguns outside of their home or lawful place of business. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-415.1(a). This restriction, similar to that at issue in <em>Caron, </em>is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">We therefore affirm the judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
