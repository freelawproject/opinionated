He argues that the district court abused its discretion by: (1) refusing to grant him a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility and (2) upwardly departing from the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">In light of the evidence in the record regarding Delossantos\u2019 post-plea criminal activity, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied him points for acceptance of responsibility. Delossantos\u2019 post-plea conduct was entirely inconsistent with the acceptance of responsibility and outweighed any evidence supporting the reduction. <em>See United States v. Cano-Guel </em>167 F.3d 900, 906 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">A district court may depart from a guideline sentencing range when it finds that \u201cthere exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b). This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision to depart for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hefferon, </em>314 F.3d 211, 227 (5th Cir.2002). If the district court provides acceptable reasons for the departure and the degree of the departure is reasonable, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>Hefferon, </em>314 F.3d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">In this case, the district court provided acceptable reasons in support of his decision to upwardly depart, namely, Delossantos\u2019 post-plea criminal activity, which demonstrated a high likelihood of recidivism. Additionally, although the district court added approximately seven years and six months to Delossantos\u2019 three-year and ten-month guideline sentence, we are unable to conclude that the departure was unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lara, </em>975 F.2d 1120, 1126 (5th Cir.1992) (affirming sentence seven times greater than guideline maximum); <em>United States v. Roberson, </em>872 F.2d 597, 606 (5th Cir.1989) (three times); <em>United States v. Juarez-Ortega, </em>866 F.2d 747 (5th Cir.1989) (more than four times). Moreover, Delossantos\u2019 eleven-year and four-month sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum of 30 years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
