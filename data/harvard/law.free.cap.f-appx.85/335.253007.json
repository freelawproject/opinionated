The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal as waived.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The plea agreement specifically included a waiver of Watson\u2019s right to appeal his sentence. A waiver of appeal provision in a valid plea agreement is enforceable if it resulted from a knowing and intelligent decision to forgo an appeal. <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 731 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Wiggins, 905 </em>F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). This court reviews de novo the validity of a waiver. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402-03 (4th Cir. 2000). We conclude that Watson knowingly agreed to the waiver. Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-17\"> Counsel for Watson initially responded by conceding the merit of the Government\u2019s position. The court ordered counsel to verify that Watson agreed to drop his appeal. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 42. Watson did not consent to the dismissal, and counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
