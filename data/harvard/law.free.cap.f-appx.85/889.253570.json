Dotson, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-23\">Parties in a civil action where the United States is not a party, are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). However, a court may extend the appeals period for fourteen days upon a party\u2019s timely motion to reopen the appeal period. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-24\">The district court\u2019s order reopening the time for Dotson to file a notice of appeal was entered on the docket on July 7, 2003, affording Dotson until July 21, 2003, to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). However, Dotson\u2019s notice of appeal was dated August 20, 2003, and filed on August 21, 2003. Because Dotson failed to file a timely notice of appeal within the extended fourteen-day appeal period, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
