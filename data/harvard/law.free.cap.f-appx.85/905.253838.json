They contend that the district court erred by failing to follow our mandate in <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>Nos. 96-4369, 96-4459, 2001 WL 1019343, 18 Fed.Appx. 85 (4th Cir. Sept. 6, 2001) (unpublished), cer<em>t. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1117, 122 S.Ct. 929, 151 L.Ed.2d 891 (2002). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">In vacating Gibson\u2019s and Blue\u2019s sentences and remanding for resentencing, we relied on the panel decision in <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>261 F.3d 397 (4th Cir. 2001), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002), in holding that their mandatory life sentences violated the rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We found that the statutory maximum to which Gibson and Blue were subject on the conspiracy count and to which Blue was subject on the possession-with-intent-to-distribute count was thirty years, taking into account their qualifying prior felony convictions. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West Supp.2003). We instructed the district court to resentence Gibson and Blue consistent with <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5Gl.l(a), 5G1.2(d), and <em>United States v. White, </em>238 F.3d 537 (4th Cir.2001). <em>See Gibson, </em>2001 WL 1019343, at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">After our decision in <em>Gibson </em>but before resentencing, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002), and reversed the panel decision on which we relied in <em>Gibson. </em>Applying the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cotton, </em>the district court resentenced Gibson and Blue to <em>life </em>imprisonment on the conspiracy, count and resentenced Blue to a concurrent term of life imprisonment on the possession-with-intent-to-distribute count. We find that the district court properly declined to follow our mandate in <em>Gibson </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Cotton. See United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999) (discussing law of the case doctrine and exceptions thereto).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Contrary to Gibson\u2019s and Blue\u2019s assertion on appeal, the Supreme Court\u2019s plain error analysis in <em>Cotton </em>applies to them. Neither Gibson nor Blue made an Apprendi-type argument at trial or during the original sentencing proceedings. <em>See Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 633 n. 3 (noting that evidence of drug quantity was overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted where defendants objected to drug quantity used to establish base offense level but did not argue that conspiracy involved less than threshold amount to trigger enhanced penalty); <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 406-07 (4th Cir.) (discussing objections that sufficiently preserve <em>Apprendi </em>claim for review), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 2099, 155 L.Ed.2d 1083 (2003). Finally, our review of the record leads us to conclude that, although drug quantity was not charged in the indictment or submitted to the jury, the imposition of life sentences did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings because the evidence of drug quantity in these cases was overwhelming and essentially uncontroyerted. <em>See Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 632-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the' district court\u2019s judgments. We grant Gibson\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief, but upon consideration of the claims asserted therein, we find them to be without merit. We deny Appellants\u2019 motion to hold this appeal in abeyance and deny as moot their motion to correct factual misstatements in the record. We also deny Gibson\u2019s motion to correct factual misstatements in the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>ord. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
