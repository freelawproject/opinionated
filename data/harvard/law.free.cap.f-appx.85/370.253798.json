Ricks, a former military prisoner, challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of his civil action raised under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). He contends that the district court wrongly concluded that his challenge to the extension of his prison stay by 59 days violated <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) and that the court erred in its alternative ruling that the complaint was filed outside the two-year limitations period. He has not established that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his suit as frivolous. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-21\">Ricks also contends that the district court improperly imposed against him a $150 filing fee pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(f), despite the fact that Ricks was no longer a prisoner. He has not established that the district court abused its discretion in imposing costs. <em>See Moore v. McDonald, </em>30 F.3d 616, 621 (5th Cir.1994). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
