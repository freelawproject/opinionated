Gonzalez\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although concluding that such allegations lacked merit, counsel asserted claims that the district court abused its discretion in denying Gonzalez\u2019s motion for downward departure and committed plain error by not dismissing the indictment. Gonzalez has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. We affirm Gonzalez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-25\">Gonzalez contends the district court abused its discretion when it denied his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>motion for downward departure. A district court\u2019s decision not to depart below the guidelines range is not reviewable unless the court mistakenly believed that it lacked authority to depart. <em>United States v. </em>Carr, 271 F.3d 172, 176-77 (4th Cir. 2001). Here, the district court recognized that it had the authority to depart, but chose to exercise its discretion against any such departure. The court\u2019s decision therefore is not subject to our review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Gonzalez\u2019s second argument is that the district court committed plain error when it failed to dismiss the indictment. Before we may correct a trial error to which there was no contemporaneous objection, three factors must be shown: (1) there was error, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631-32, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). We may exercise our discretion to correct the error when all three factors are met and when the error \u201c \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). We conclude that the district court did not err. Moreover, Gonzalez\u2019s guilty plea waived any antecedent non-jurisdictional errors. <em>See Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Gonzalez\u2019s conviction and sentence. The court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
