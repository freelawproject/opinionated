Ovando-Candelo argues that the district, court should not have held him accountable for the heroin that was found on a vessel because the district court should have taken into consideration the lack of evidence to show that he was aware of the heroin on the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-26\">The factual basis for Ovando-Candelo\u2019s guilty plea stated that, if called, one of Ovando-Candelo\u2019s co-conspirators, who, with Ovando-Candelo, was present when the heroin changed hands, would have testified that the seized quantity of heroin was delivered as a show of good faith, that more drugs remained on the vessel, and that, at the co-conspirator\u2019s direction, agents found approximately 3.2 additional kilograms of heroin on the vessel. Because the offense level is determined by the quantity of drugs involved in the offense, Ovando-Candelo has not shown that the district court clearly erred in including the heroin found on the vessel in the offense conduct. <em>See United States v. Schorovsky, </em>202 F.3d 727, 729 (5th Cir.2000); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 831 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Ovando-Candelo also argues that the district court clearly erred in denying a downward adjustment for his being a minor participant because he had a limited role in the offense, was not aware of the total amount of drugs, and was not the purchaser of the drugs. The district court\u2019s refusal to grant Ovando-Candelo a two level reduction for being a minor participant was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d 276, 296 (5th Cir.2001). The large quantity of heroin that Ovando-Candelo was transporting strongly supports the denial of a reduction for being a minor participant. <em>See United States v. Rojas, </em>868 F.2d 1409, 1409-10 (5th Cir.1989). Furthermore, the district court was not required to accept Ovando-Candelo\u2019s account of his role in the drug trafficking scheme. <em>See United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
