Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">Butler first contends that the district court erred in admitting evidence concerning a piece of crack cocaine found in the car of a police informant immediately after a controlled buy. Butler argues that the evidence was irrelevant. \u25a0\u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. The evidence, while not determinative; made it more probable that Butler sold crack cocaine to the informant, and we therefore conclude that the district court did not err in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">Next, Butler disputes the district court\u2019s calculation of drug quantity at sentencing. The district court\u2019s factual findings will be upheld absent clear error. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (2000); <em>United States v. Lamarr, </em>75 F.3d 964, 972 (4th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s, finding was based on the trial testimony. Butler argues that this testimony was unreliable, but that credibility determination was for the jury to make. Butler has not made \u201can affirmative showing the information is inaccurate.\u201d <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990). We conclude that the district court did not clearly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">Finally, Butler asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on the Government\u2019s violation of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(b) (2000). Violations of the Jencks Act constitute harmless error where no prejudice results to the defense. <em>United States v. Schell, </em>775 F.2d 559, 567 (4th Cir.1985). We find that the Jencks material was duplicative of other information provided to the defense, and that Butler is unable to show prejudice. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Snow, </em>537 F.2d 1166, 1168 (4th Cir.1976). Accordingly, the district court did hot err in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-16\">We therefore affirm Butler\u2019s convictions and sentence. We deny Butler\u2019s motion for leave to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
