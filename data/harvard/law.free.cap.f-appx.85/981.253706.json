Her sole argument on appeal is that the district court used the wrong standard under Mississippi law to determine causation. McDonald does not challenge on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>peal the district court\u2019s conclusion that she waived any medical malpractice claims other than her allegation that she was not given an opportunity to make an informed consent to the medical procedure, and she also did not challenge the court\u2019s finding that she failed to establish causation. These claims are therefore deemed abandoned. <em>See Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Capece, </em>141 F.3d 188, 193 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Although the district court did not specifically state that it was applying the \u201cobjective causation\u201d test used under Mississippi law for medical malpractice claims, the court used the proper standard and concluded that McDonald\" had presented no evidence to show that a reasonable person would have withheld consent if informed of the risks involved in the procedure. <em>See Phillips v. Hull, </em>516 So.2d 488, 493 (Miss.1987). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1027-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
