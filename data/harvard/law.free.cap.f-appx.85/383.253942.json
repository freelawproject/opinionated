He contends that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) of his involvement in a marijuana-trafficking operation in 2002, while he was a fugitive. Shoupe\u2019s defense was that he lacked the intent to join the charged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the evidence of Shoupe\u2019s subsequent conduct. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>70 F.3d 818, 831 (5th Cir.1995). The evidence was admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) because Shoupe asserted a defense of a lack of intent, and the other-acts evidence was admitted for the limited purpose of showing that Shoupe had the intent to conspire to possess and distribute marijuana. <em>See United States v. Broussard, </em>80 F.3d 1025, 1040 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir.1978) <em>(en </em>banc). The probative value of the contested evidence was relevant to Shoupe\u2019s intent and was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, especially in light of the district court\u2019s instruction that the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>dence could be considered only with regard to Shoupe\u2019s intent or state of mind. <em>See Broussard, </em>80 F.3d at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
