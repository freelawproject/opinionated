Williams contends that he was convicted on insufficient evidence because there was no evidence to corroborate his confession. Williams further contends that because the evidence was insufficient to convict him, the evidence was also insufficient to support the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Because Williams moved for a judgment of acquittal in the district court, we review the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether, considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>226 F.3d 340, 343 (5th Cir.2000). The extrinsic evidence, which included the testimony of several surveillance officers, was sufficient to corroborate Williams\u2019s confession, and the evidence as a whole supports his convictions. <em>See United States v. Garth, </em>773 F.2d 1469, 1479 (5th Cir.1985). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Williams\u2019s supervised release based on his convictions for aiding and abetting. <em>See United States v. McCormick, </em>54 F.3d 214, 219 (5th Cir. 1995). Accordingly, Williams\u2019s convictions and the revocation of his supervised release are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
