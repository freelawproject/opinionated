Without requesting or receiving wages, the plaintiff performed services to assist her mother, Sally Decker, who was employed by the Travis County Health <em>&amp; </em>Human Services Department. The plaintiff provided no objective indicia of an employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-19\">Travis County filed a motion for summary judgment. Pursuant to Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the district coral; found that Travis County was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. We affirm the decision of the district court as there was no evidence that the plaintiff should be considered an employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The FLSA ought to be interpreted broadly, but it was \u201cnot intended to stamp all persons as employees, who, without any express or implied compensation agreement, might work for their own advantage on the premises of another.\u201d <em>Walling v.
