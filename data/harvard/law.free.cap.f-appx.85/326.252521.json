Because the immigration judge\u2019s hardship determination is discretionary in nature, we find that we lack jurisdiction to consider this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 (2000); <em>Mendez-Moranchel v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 176, 179 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Okpa v. U.S. INS, </em>266 F.3d 313, 317 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-24\">Opesanmi also contends that the Board\u2019s decision to adopt and affirm the immigration judge\u2019s decision on the reasoning of the immigration judge violated his right to due process of law. As Opesanmi fails to establish that he was prejudiced by the Board\u2019s decision to affirm on the reasoning of the immigration judge, <em>see Rusu v. U.S. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324-25 (4th Cir.2002), we find that he is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-25\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
