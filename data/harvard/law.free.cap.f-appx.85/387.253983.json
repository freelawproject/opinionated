Unger, Mississippi state prisoner # 68203, and finding him liable for damages to Unger in the amount of $5000. Blanchard also appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his postjudgment motions to alter or amend the judgment, for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict, for stay of enforcement of the judgment and alternatively, for his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-22\">Viewing all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of Unger, the non-moving party, and giving deference to the jury\u2019s credibility findings, there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that unreasonable force was used, without provocation, by Officer Blanchard and that the use of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>force resulted in an injury to Unger. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Blanchard\u2019s motion for a judgment as a matter of law nor did it abuse its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 149, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <em>Streber v. Hunter, </em>221 F.3d 701, 736 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">As discussed below, the district court did not err in denying Blanchard\u2019s post-judgment motion to amend the judgment or in refusing to stay the judgment in Unger\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The prevailing defendants/appellees, Wackenhut, Sparkman, Williams, and Smith, argue that the district court erred in denying their motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs because the district court dismissed the claims against them as frivolous. They contend that the district court erred in failing to amend the judgment to offset the attorney\u2019s fees and costs due to them against the judgment rendered in Unger\u2019s favor against Blanchard.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Although the district court dismissed as frivolous the claims against these defendants prior to the jury\u2019s verdict, its ruling on the prevailing defendants\u2019 motion implied that it did not believe that the facts of the case warranted an award to the prevailing defendants. The record also indicated that the claims against these defendants were not totally vexatious and without any foundation. Therefore, the prevailing defendants failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978); <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 14, 101 S.Ct. 173, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">This determination renders moot the motion of Blanchard and the prevailing defendants seeking to amend the judgment to offset the attorney\u2019s fees award against the judgment rendered in Unger\u2019s favor and against Blanchard. Blanchard has failed to make any argument or to cite any authority to support his claim that he should not have been taxed the costs of the proceeding. Thus, this claim is deemed abandoned. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment on the jury verdict in favor of Unger and against Blanchard and the orders denying the defendants\u2019 postjudgment motions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
