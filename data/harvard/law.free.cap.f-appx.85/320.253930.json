We construe Grandison\u2019s appeal as a request for authorization under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000) to file a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. We deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Because the district court was without jurisdiction to enter its order, we vacate the order of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-27\">Grandison and three others were convicted of conspiracy to violate civil rights, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241, and witness tampering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512. The \u201ccharges grew out of the brutal murders of two motel employees, one of whom ... was in a position to identify Grandison as someone who visited the motel in early November 1982. The testimony ... was significant to establish Grandison\u2019s guilt in a federal narcotics case ... for which trial was pending on ... the date of the murders.\u201d <em>United States v. Grandison, </em>780 F.2d 425, 428 (4th Cir.1985). Grandison was sentenced to life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>in prison for conspiracy and ten years for witness tampering. The sentences run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In his Rule 35(a) motion, Grandison claims that his life sentence violates the rule of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment did not charge that the conspiracy resulted in death and the judge, rather than the jury, found the causal connection between the violation of civil rights and death that is required under \u00a7 241 to impose a life sentence. Grandison argues that this <em>Apprendi </em>violation requires resentencing and imposition of a sentence not to exceed ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Grandison first argues that his Rule 35(a) motion is not an attempt to collaterally attack his sentence, because motions brought under Rule 35(a) are \u201cmade in the original case ... a[s] part of the appellate process from [the] original conviction rather than a collateral attack on [the] sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Landrum, </em>93 F.3d 122, 125 (4th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Shillingford, </em>586 F.2d 372, 375 (5th Cir.1978)). However, <em>Landrum </em>dealt only with a situation where the prisoner had not yet filed a motion under \u00a7 2255. We do not believe its rationale applies here, where Grandison\u2019s direct appeal has already concluded and two \u00a7 2255 motions have also been denied. Instead, the motion Grandison filed in the district court is best characterized as attempt to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Section 2244 requires that prisoners seek authorization with the circuit court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) (2000). Without such authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to hear the claims. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200 (4th Cir.2003). Because the district court lacked jurisdiction over the claim, we will construe Grandison\u2019s appeal as a motion for authorization, pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)(3), to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208. We may authorize the filing of a successive \u00a7 2255 motion only if the prisoner makes a prima facie showing that his claim relies on either the existence of a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court or newly discovered evidence that would prove by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder could have found the individual guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 If 8 (2000). Because we have previously held that <em>Apprendi </em>claims cannot be raised during collateral review, <em>see United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139 (4th Cir. 2001), and because Grandison does not allege the existence of newly discovered evidence, Grandison fails to meet the standard required for authorization under \u00a7 2244. We thus deny Grandison the authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion and deny his motion for appointment of counsel. We also vacate the order of the district court and remand with instructions <em>to </em>dismiss the <em>motion. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED; AUTHORIZATION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
