U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 operates upon Government motion at the time of original sentencing. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>964 F.2d 454, 461 (5th Cir.1992). The Government has filed no such motion, and Harris is not authorized under the Guidelines to bring such a motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">Harris argues that he has provided substantial assistance to the Government and that the Government\u2019s refusal to file a downward departure motion pursuant to Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 35(b) is unconstitutionally motivated. Harris\u2019 arguments are vague and are not the \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d of unconstitutional motivation that is required before the district court can consider a defendant\u2019s Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 35(b) motion. <em>See United States v. Sneed, </em>63 F.3d 381, 389 n. 6 (5th Cir.1995). Because Harris failed to make a substantial showing of unconstitutional motivation, the district court was without authority to consider Harris\u2019 Rule 35(b) motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">Additionally, Harris has failed to brief whether the district court erred when it failed to hold the evidentiary hearing that he requested and when it did not grant relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, both of which were cited in his district court pleadings. This court \u201cwill not raise and discuss legal issues that [Harris] has failed to assert.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Harris has abandoned these issues on appeal because he has not addressed these issues. <em>E.g., Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">Harris has thus filed an appeal from a denial of an unauthorized motion that the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Although the district court denied the motion on the merits, we may affirm on the alternative basis that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Harris\u2019 motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1039-21\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
