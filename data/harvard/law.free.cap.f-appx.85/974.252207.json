Camara had sought asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>Torture. To the extent that Camara attempts to challenge the Board\u2019s January 28, 2003 order affirming the decision of the immigration judge without opinion, Camara\u2019s failure to timely petition for review from that decision deprives us of jurisdiction to review such claims. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Camara alleges to this court, as he did in his motion to reconsider, that the Board\u2019s retroactive application of procedural streamlining procedures to his appeal violated his rights. We rejected that argument in <em>Khattak v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 833, 157 L.Ed.2d 699 (2003). Camara also disputes the Board\u2019s decision denying relief on his motion to reconsider. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order of May 28, 2003, and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
