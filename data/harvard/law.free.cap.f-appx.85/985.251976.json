(Alstom), claiming Alstom improperly refused to rehire him after he recovered from work-related injuries. Thereafter, Castillo failed both to conduct discovery in accordance with the scheduling order and to communicate with opposing counsel or the court. As a result, Alstom filed an unopposed motion to strike. The district court granted Alstom\u2019s motion and dismissed this action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-22\">Castillo can not receive relief from that judgment unless he shows that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his action. <em>E.g., SEC v. First Houston Capital Resources Fund, Inc., </em>979 F.2d 380, 381-82 (5th Cir.1992). Castillo has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-23\">A review of the record reflects that he engaged in \u201cdelay or contumacious conduct\u201d and that the district court determined that lesser sanctions were inappropriate. <em>See McNeal v. Papasan, </em>842 F.2d 787, 790 (5th Cir.1988). Moreover, the breadth of Castillo\u2019s failures to comply with the discovery order and to communicate with either opposing counsel or the district court supports that court\u2019s determination that these failures were intentional and not the result of mere inadvertence. Such intentional delay is an aggravating factor supporting a decision to dismiss an action. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-24\">United States Court of Appeals, <em>AFFIRMED</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1031-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
