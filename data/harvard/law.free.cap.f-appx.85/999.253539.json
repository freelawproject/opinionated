Alternatively, the district court determined that Montanya was barred from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) by the three-strikes provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Montanya is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-23\">Montanya has not made a meritorious challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of IFP and has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal with respect to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). Montanya\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-24\">Montanya has previously accumulated two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Montanya v. Easley, </em>No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>01-50086, 260 F.3d 622, 2001 WL 650378 (5th Cir. May 25, 2001). The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint in this case for failure to state a claim and this court\u2019s dismissal of Montanya\u2019s appeal each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Montanya may no longer proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">MOTION TO PROCEED <em>IN FORMA PAUPERIS </em>DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) SANCTIONS IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1045-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
