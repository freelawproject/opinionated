Button, now federal prisoner # 05458-051, was sentenced for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and four years\u2019 supervised release. At the time Button was arrested and charged with that conspiracy offense, he had been serving an undischarged term of imprisonment for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Button\u2019s sentence for the conspiracy offense (hereinafter referred to as \u201csecond sentence\u201d) was imposed to run concurrently with his sentence for the firearm offense (hereinafter referred to as \u201cfirst sentence\u201d). He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his federal habeas corpus petition, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, seeking credit on his second sentence for time he spent serving his first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-23\">On appeal, Button argues that he is entitled to credit on his second sentence for the time he had already served on his first sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) because: (1) a \u201cconcurrent\u201d sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) is not simply concurrent with the remainder of the defendant\u2019s undischarged sentence but is retroactively concurrent with the full term of the undischarged sentence; and (2) when imposing his second sentence, the district court intended to grant him the credit he now seeks. Examination of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) and the accompanying Application Note reveals that Button\u2019s first argument lacks merit. Furthermore, the record contradicts the factual basis of Button\u2019s second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-24\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1042-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
