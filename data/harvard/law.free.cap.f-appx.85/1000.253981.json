Milan was sentenced to 80 months in prison and three years of supervised release. He now appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-22\">Garcia argues that the district court erred in attributing to him criminal history points for a 1990 Texas conviction of burglary of a building, 1993 Georgia convictions of possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and a 1993 Georgia conviction of theft by receiving. He maintains that the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) information offered in support of these convictions lacked sufficient indicia of reliability and that he presented \u201ccompetent rebuttal evidence\u201d to contradict that information. The prior convictions challenged by Milan were in fact supported by sufficient indicia of reliability, especially after the Probation Office stated that it had matched Milan\u2019s aliases, date of birth, and FBI number to such convictions. <em>See United States v. Fitzgerald, </em>89 F.3d 218, 223 (5th Cir.1996); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3, p.s. Because a review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>Milan\u2019s sentencing transcript reflects that he did <em>not </em>present rebuttal evidence, he has not demonstrated that the PSR information was \u201c\u2018materially untrue, inaccurate, or unreliable.\u2019 \u201d <em>See United States v. Floyd, </em>343 F.3d 363, 372 (5th Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">The district court\u2019s written judgment contained a supervised-release condition prohibiting Milan from possessing \u201cany ... dangerous weapon,\u201d whereas at sentencing the court merely ordered that he not possess a \u201cfirearm\u201d or \u201cdestructive device.\u201d Milan contends that the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement supersedes the written condition and that the written condition thus should be stricken. Milan\u2019s argument is precluded by a recent published decision, <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 937-38 (5th Cir.2003). His assertion that the panel in <em>Torres-Aguilar </em>failed to acknowledge a contrary unpublished decision is meritless, as unpublished decisions issued or or after January 1, 1996, remain non-binding in this circuit. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Milan argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional on its face under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), in that the aggravated-felony \u201celement\u201d of the offense need not be submitted to the factfinder for proof. As Milan concedes, his contention regarding <em>Apprendi </em>is foreclosed by the caselaw of this court and by <em>Apprendi </em>itself. <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (noting that the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, expressly declined to overrule the controlling <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 </em>U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)). Milan raises this issue to preserve it for review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">Milan\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1046-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
