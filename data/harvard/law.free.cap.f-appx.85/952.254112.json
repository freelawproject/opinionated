The district court sentenced Hoffman to a total imprisonment term of 384 months and a five-year term of supervised release. Hoffman contends on appeal that the district court erred in failing to compel the Government to move for a substantial assistance departure, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (2002). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-22\">A sentencing court may determine whether the government has \u201cbargained away its \u00a7 5K1.1 discretion,\u201d and if so, determine whether the defendant has rendered substantial assistance under the plea agreement. <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir.2000). This court held in <em>Snow, </em>however, that any waiver of the government\u2019s discretion must be explicit, not implied, in the language of the agreement. <em>Id, </em>When the Government does not promise a substantial assistance motion in return for the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance, the defendant may compel the government to move for a substantial assistance departure only if he makes a substantial threshold showing that the government\u2019s decision was based on an unconstitutional motive or was unrelated to a legitimate government end. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Because Hoffman did not object at sentencing to the Government\u2019s failure to move for a substantial assistance departure, Hoffman\u2019s claim is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (providing standard for plain error review).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>Because the Government specifically-stated in the plea agreement that the determination regarding whether Hoffman provided substantial assistance was within its sole discretion, we conclude that the Government did not explicitly waive its discretion to determine substantial assistance and therefore, did not breach the plea agreement by failing to move for a substantial assistance departure. Further, there was no evidence (and Hoffman does not argue) that the Government\u2019s decision not to move for a substantial assistance departure was based on an unconstitutional motive or was unrelated to a legitimate government end. Therefore, the district court did not err in failing to compel the Government to move for a substantial assistance departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Hoffman\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
