The district court sentenced him to 140 months in prison and a five-year term of supervised release. Barlow now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-20\">Barlow contends that the district court erred by converting seized cash into a drug equivalent for sentencing purposes. He argues that the district court was required to make an explicit finding that the amount of drugs seized did not reflect the scale of his offense before making this conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-22\">Barlow has shown no legal error with respect to the district court\u2019s findings. The court satisfied the requirement that it make a finding on every controverted matter when it rejected Barlow\u2019s objections and found that the presentence report\u2019s inclusion of the conversion was correct. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>29 F.3d 953, 958 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-23\">Barlow further contends that the district court erred in finding that the disputed funds were drug-related, given Barlow\u2019s presentation of evidence to support his argument that these funds came from an insurance settlement. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the money was drug-related is plausible and thus is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>114 F.3d 520, 527 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Puig-Infante, </em>19 F.3d 929, 942 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-24\">Barlow has shown no error by the district court. Accordingly, Barlow\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
