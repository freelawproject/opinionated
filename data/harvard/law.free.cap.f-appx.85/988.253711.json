On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court denied summary judgment for Federal Insurance Company (\u201cFederal\u201d), the insurance company, and granted summary judgment in favor of Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. (\u201cHome Depot\u201d), the insured. The district court held that Federal breached its duty to defend Home Depot in personal injury litigation brought by a Home Depot customer. As explained below and largely for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned memorandum opinion and order, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-21\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-22\">The facts in this matter are essentially undisputed. We, therefore, adopt the district court\u2019s recitation of the salient facts and restate them in abbreviated form here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-23\">Home Depot\u2019s action for declaratory judgment has its genesis in an accident that occurred when Kathleen T. Rogers (\u201cMrs.Rogers\u201d) was severely injured by the fall of a rug display cabinet inside a Home Depot home improvement store in Plano, Texas. The display cabinet, which tipped over on Mrs. Rogers while she was shopping in that store, contained decorative rugs manufactured by Beaulieu, L.L.C. (\u201cBeaulieu\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-24\">Several months later, Mrs. Rogers and her husband William E. Rogers (collectively \u201cthe Rogerses\u201d) filed suit against Home Depot and Beaulieu in Texas state court (the <em>\u201cRogers </em>litigation\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They alleged that Home Depot and Beaulieu were negligent because they:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-25\">1. Were aware that the top-heavy design and its location made an accident a virtual certainty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>2. Allowed a dangerous condition to exist on Home Depot\u2019s premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-5\">3. Failed to adequately secure the display in place by bolting it to the floor or wall;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-6\">4. Failed to warn customers that the display was likely to tip over; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-7\">5. Collectively they either designed, manufactured, sold, distributed, assembled, installed or maintained an inherently dangerous product in their premises as a part of their \u25a0business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">More than a year before the accident in question, Beaulieu and Home Depot had entered into a Vendor Buying Agreement (\u2018VBA\u201d) under which Beaulieu rugs would be sold by Home Depot at its retail stores. The VBA required, <em>inter alia, </em>that Beau-lieu carry a general liability insurance policy naming Home Depot as an additional insured. At the time of the accident, Beaulieu was covered under a general liability policy issued by Federal (the \u201cPolicy\u201d). The Policy contained a Vendor Endorsement which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-9\">Any Vendor is an insured, but only with respect to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the distribution or sale of your [Beaulieu\u2019s] products in the regular course of that vendor\u2019s business and only if products/completed operations coverage is provided under this contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">The Policy also contained a Vendor Exclusion provision, which stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-11\">No vendor is an insured with respect to ... any failure to make such inspections, adjustments, tests, or servicing as the vendor has agreed to make or normally undertakes to make in the usual course of business, in- connection with the distribution or sale of your [Beaulieu\u2019s] products. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">In addition, appended to the Policy was a Liability Insurance Endorsement that included a provision entitled \u201cWho is Insured,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which specified, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axq\">Under Who is Insured, the following provision is added:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-15\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-16\">Any person designated below is an insured but only with respect to liability arising out of your [Beaulieu\u2019s] operations or premises owned or rented to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-17\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-18\">Designated Person Or Organization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-19\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-20\">AS' REQUIRED BY WRITTEN CONTRACT</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-22\">In a June 2001 letter, Home Depot demanded that Federal defend it in the <em>Rogers </em>litigation. Federal never responded to this demand; in March 2002, Home Depot filed the instant suit in district court seeking a judgment declaring Home Depot\u2019s entitlement to defense and indemnification from Federal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-23\">In August 2002, the Rogerses entered into a confidential settlement agreement under which Home Depot and Beaulieu agreed to pay the Rogerses for a complete release and for the voluntary dismissal of their claims with prejudice. Just days before the settlement was signed, Federal executed a written agreement that it would not contend in this case that the amount paid by Home Dept to the Rogerses (1) was excessive, unreasonable, unwarranted, improvident, voluntary or unnecessary, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>(2) did not constitute damages that Home Depot would be entitled to recover from Federal in the event that Home Depot established Federal\u2019s coverage liability under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">In the district court, Home Depot maintained \u2014 as it does on appeal \u2014 that Federal breached its duty to defend Home Depot in the <em>Rogers </em>litigation. Home Depot sought indemnification for the settlement amount that it paid in the <em>Rogers </em>litigation plus its costs, including attorney\u2019s fees, that it incurred in the <em>Rogers </em>litigation and in the instant action. Federal counters that the Policy does not cover Home Depot\u2019s exposure to the claims asserted by the Rogerses in state court; and that, as coverage of Home Depot for the Rogerses\u2019 claims does not exist, Federal had no duty to defend or indemnify Home Depot in the <em>Rogers </em>litigation. The district court granted summary judgment to Home Depot, rejecting Federal\u2019s contentions, and Federal timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">Our review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Home Depot is <em>de novo</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As a district court\u2019s interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law, we exercise <em>de novo </em>review over that determination as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">B. The Eight Corners Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">The parties acknowledge that we must apply the substantive law of Texas in this diversity case. In Texas, the duty of an insurer to furnish a legal defense is analyzed under the \u201ceight corners\u201d or \u201ccomplaint allegation\u201d rule: \u201cAn insurer\u2019s duty to defend is determined by the allegations in the pleadings and the language of the insurance policy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The parties do not dispute the contents of the documents we examine here in applying the eight corners rule: The Rogerses\u2019 state court complaint<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the Policy say what they say. Rather, the litigants contest the legal effect of the words contained in those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">Neither do the parties quarrel substantially about the basic principles that govern our application of the eight corners rule. \u201cAn insurer bears the burden of proving that the allegations contained in the underlying plaintiffs petition are excluded from coverage and any doubt is resolved in favor of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To satisfy this burden, Federal must prove that <em>none </em>of the claims asserted by the Rogerses against Home Depot potentially falls within coverage of the Policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When we analyze the underlying pleading, we focus on the factual allegations that show the origin of the damages, rather than the legal theories alleged.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe duty to defend does not depend on what the facts are, or what might be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>finally by the trier of the facts. It depends only on what the facts are alleged to be.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If the policy under examination provides coverage for <em>any </em>claim asserted in the underlying pleading, the insurer\u2019s duty to defend extends to the entire action.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">C. The Vendor Exclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Federal does not contest that Home Depot is a \u201cvendor\u201d as that term is used in the Policy. Instead, Federal\u2019s first line of defense is that the facts alleged in the Rogerses\u2019 First Amended Petition implicated the Vendor Exclusion provision and, therefore, alleged only conduct that was excluded under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">The Vendor Exclusion provision of the Policy, quoted above,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> precludes coverage for \u201cinspections\u201d that Home Depot \u201chas agreed to conduct or normally undertakes to make in the usual course of business.\u201d Federal directs our attention to those factual allegations in the Rogerses\u2019 First Amended Petition which state that Home Depot failed to make inspections, tests, or adjustments to make their store safe. By focusing on these allegations, Federal insists that it owes no duty to defend because Home Depot is obligated by Texas premises liability law to make reasonable inspections.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">To start, we agree with the district court\u2019s legal analysis that Federal has failed to proffer any evidence that Home Depot ever \u201cagreed to make or normally undertakes to make in the usual course of business\u201d inspections vis-a-vis the rug display cabinet or similar installations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Vendor Exclusion is silent about inspections that may be compelled by law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Furthermore, Federal\u2019s approach would have us ignore other factual allegations in the Rogerses\u2019 complaint. For example, the Rogerses also alleged that (1) the display cabinet was top-heavy by design; (2) Home Depot failed properly to secure the display cabinet to the floor or wall; and (3) Home Depot failed to warn customers of the display cabinet\u2019s dangers. Independently, these other allegations - which have nothing to do with \u201cinspections, adjustments, tests or servicing\u201d - have the potential of giving rise to claims that the Vendor Exclusion simply cannot be read to preclude. And, because Federal must defend Home Depot against the <em>entire </em>action if any one or more of the Rogerses\u2019 claims are covered, Federal\u2019s appeal to the law of premises liability is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-18\">D. The \u201cProduct\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">Federal\u2019s second defensive position is that Home Depot is not entitled to coverage under the Policy unless the Rogerses\u2019 damages arose from the distribution or sale of Beaulieu\u2019s \u201cproducts.\u201d And, advances Federal, because the display cabinet was neither manufactured by Beaulieu nor offered for sale by Home Depot, the cabinet could not be a Beaulieu \u201cproduct,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>and Federal owes no duty to defend Home Depot in the <em>Rogers </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">The Policy defines \u201cproduct\u201d to include \u201cany goods or products ... manufactured, sold, handled, distributed or disposed of by\u201d Beaulieu. The \u201cproducts\u201d in question here are the <em>rugs </em>\u201cmanufactured\u201d by Beaulieu, not the <em>cabinet </em>in which they were displayed. Yet Federal would have us analyze whether the <em>display cabinet </em>qualifies as a \u201cproduct.\u201d This classic red herring only confuses the issue. The question is simply whether Mrs. Rogers\u2019 bodily injury \u201car[ose] out of the distribution or sale\u201d of the <em>rugs. </em>We have ruled that, when used in an insurance policy, the words \u201carising out of\u2019 are \u201cbroad, general, and comprehensive terms effecting broad coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, we understand these words to mean \u201coriginating from,\u201d \u201chaving its origin in,\u201d \u201cgrowing out of\u2019 or \u201cflowing from.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It would be inconsistent, to say the least, to read the Policy to say that Mrs. Rogers\u2019 injury did not originate from or flow from Home Depot\u2019s sale of the Beaulieu rugs.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Rogerses\u2019 damages may not have arisen out of the sale or distribution of the display cabinet, but they certainly did arise out of Mrs. Rogers\u2019 shopping for Beaulieu\u2019s rugs at Home Depot\u2019s store, in which those rugs were displayed for sale in that cabinet. Federal\u2019s contention on this point approaches frivolousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">E. Distinct Coverage Under The Liability Insurance Endorsement</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">Federal\u2019s third point on appeal challenges the district court\u2019s alternative holding that the Liability Insurance Endorsement extended coverage to Home Depot, separate and apart from the Vendor Endorsement in the Policy.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Because we hold that the Vendor Endorsement requires Federal to defend Home Depot in the <em>Rogers </em>litigation, we need not reach this alternate basis for holding Federal responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Home Depot and its denial of Federal\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1034-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
