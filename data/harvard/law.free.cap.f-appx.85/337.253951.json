Coulter was sentenced to 365 months incarceration, 5 years of supervised release, and a $200 special assessment. Coulter\u2019s attorney has filed a timely appeal under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court erred in denying the Government\u2019s motion for Coulter to receive a downward departure for substantial assistance under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-23\">The district court considered the Government\u2019s motion but found Coulter\u2019s cooperation did not warrant the departure. There are no grounds to conclude the district court was unaware of its authority to grant the departure, and consequently, this issue is not subject to appellate review. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 876 (4th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>975 F.2d 1028, 1035 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-24\">Accordingly, we affirm Coulter\u2019s conviction and sentence. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests such a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
