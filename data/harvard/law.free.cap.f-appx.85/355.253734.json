He argues that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the testimony of eight Government witnesses in light of the fact that the prosecutor failed to comply with discovery provisions contained in Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 16. He further argues that the cumulative effect of the alleged errors warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-23\">Our review of the record discloses no errors that warrant reversal. <em>See United States v. Doucette, </em>979 F.2d 1042, 1044-45 (5th Cir.1992). Because Mateo has shown no error, his cumulative-error contention is without merit. <em>See United States v. Neal, </em>27 F.3d 1035, 1052 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, Mateo\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
