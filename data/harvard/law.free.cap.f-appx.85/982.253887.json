Desta argues that the BIA erred in determining that she had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution or that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if she were returned to Ethiopia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-20\">This court will-uphold the factual findings that an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal if those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir. 1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). The BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>record does not compel a contrary conclusion as to either Desta\u2019s INA claims or her CAT claim. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Desta\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1028-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
