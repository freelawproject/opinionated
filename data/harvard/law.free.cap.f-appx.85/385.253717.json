Leave to appeal IFP is GRANTED. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">Because Tibbs\u2019s prison trust fund account statement shows that his average monthly deposits and his average monthly balance for the six-month period preceding the filing of his notice of appeal were zero, no initial partial filing fee is required. The agency having custody of Tibbs is ORDERED to forward funds from his prison trust fund account to the clerk of the district court on a regular basis as provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1) and (2), until the full filing fee of $105 is paid. The clerk of this court is DIRECTED to send a copy of this order to the agency having custody of Tibbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-21\">However, it is clear from Tibbs\u2019s submissions that he complains only of a disagreement with his medical treatment. A 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim will not lie for alleged lack of medical treatment where the dispute is over the type or quality of treatment rendered. <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Consequently, Tibbs\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-23\">IFP GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
