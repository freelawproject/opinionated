He argues that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level increase in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) based on his prior aggravated assault conviction. He argues that the Sentencing Commission intended that the 16-level increase should be applied only to those crimes of violence that are also aggravated felonies under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Under the plain language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) and its comments, a 16-level increase applies if the defendant has a prior conviction for a crime of violence, which expressly includes an aggravated assault. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) and comment. (n.l(B)(ii)(II)). Neither U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) nor the comment refers to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) or provides that a crime of violence must also be an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Accordingly, the district court did not err in imposing the 16-level increase based on Alvarez\u2019s prior aggravated assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-23\">Alvarez argues that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum sentence for the offense of illegal reentry into the United States as charged in the indictment in view of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He acknowledges that the argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but seeks to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90. This court must therefore follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
