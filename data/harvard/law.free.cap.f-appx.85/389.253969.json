Wu argues that the immigration judge erred in finding that he was not credible. He contends that the Board of Immigration Appeals should not have deferred to the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Wu argues that this court should reverse the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order because he suffered past persecution on account of his imputed political opinion. Furthermore, Wu argues that the immigration judge erred in denying him relief pursuant to Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. Wu declares that it is more likely than not that he will suffer torture at the hands of government authorities upon his removal to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">The immigration judge\u2019s determination that Wu was not credible is \u201ca reasonable interpretation of the record and therefore supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cWithout credible evidence, the BIA had no basis upon which to grant asylum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Wu has not made the necessary showing to obtain relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002). Wu\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
