He contends that the district court erred by adjusting his offense level by 16 levels for commission of a crime of violence based on a 1999 Illinois conviction of residential burglary. He argues that his burglary conviction was not an aggravated felony for sentencing purposes and, for the first time on appeal, that the Sentencing Commission did not intend for the crime-of-violence adjustment to apply to offenses that are not also aggravated felonies. He also contends for the first time on appeal that the \u201cfelony\u201d and <em>\u201caggravated </em>felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-22\">The district court did not err by adhering to a literal interpretation of the language of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll,2(b)(l)(A), which provides for a 16-level adjustment for commission of a crime of violence. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>terpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is subject to ordinary rules of statutory construction, and if the guideline\u2019s language is unambiguous, our inquiry begins and ends with an analysis of the plain meaning of that language. <em>United States v. Carbajal, </em>290 F.3d 277, 283 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 934, 123 S.Ct. 34, 154 L.Ed.2d 235 (2002). The only exception to this rule is when a clear contrary legislative intention is shown, an exception that applies only in \u201crare and exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See Ardestani v. INS, </em>502 U.S. 129, 135-36, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991). Martinez has not established that the commentary to and history of the amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 establish that the Commission did not intend that some offenses that do not qualify as \u201caggravated felonies\u201d within the meaning of the guideline nonetheless warrant the guideline\u2019s top offense-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Martinez\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>contention is foreclosed by the caselaw of this court. <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Martinez concedes that his contention is foreclosed, but he raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-16\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that (his opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
