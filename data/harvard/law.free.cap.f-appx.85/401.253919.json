In addition to the federal charges for possessing a weapon, Dabbs was charged in state court with aggravated assault based on the same incident. The state charges were dismissed. Dabbs argues that the district court erroneously granted the government\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence of that dismissal, contending that this exclusion violated his rights to confrontation and denied him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-25\">The primary interest secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine his accusers. <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974). \u201c[T]he Confrontation clause guarantees the defendant \u2018an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.
