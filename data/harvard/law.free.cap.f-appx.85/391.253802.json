The summary judgment evidence reflects that Catoe mistakenly identified Deckard as the person who sold him crack cocaine during an undercover investigation. There is no genuine issue whether Catoe knew the identification. There is no genuine issue whether Catoe knew the identification was erroneous or whether Catoe acted with reckless disregard for the truth. <em>See Freeman v. County of Bexar, </em>210 F.3d 550, 553 (5th Cir.2000). Catoe\u2019s identification of Deckard as the perpetrator, although mistaken, was not objectively unreasonable based upon information available to Catoe at the time he made the identification. <em>See Wren v. Towe, </em>130 F.3d 1154, 1158 (5th Cir. 1997). The dismissal of Deckard\u2019s false-arrest claim is affirmed. Because there is no reason to believe that Catoe\u2019s actions were malicious, the dismissal of the malicious-prosecution claim is also affirmed. <em>See Goodson v. City of Corpus Christy </em>202 F.3d 730, 739 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
