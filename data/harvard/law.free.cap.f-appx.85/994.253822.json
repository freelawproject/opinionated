The IJ denied Pineda-Barientos\u2019 applications for asylum, withholding of deportation, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">Pineda-Barientos contends that he made a prima facie showing of eligibility for asylum. He asserts that the IJ violated his right to due process by excluding the testimony of his expert witness and his father. He argues that the BIA improperly used the summary affirmance procedure and did not independently state a correct ground for affirmance or determine that the IJ\u2019s errors were \u201charmless or nonmaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision in this case. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and findings for substantial evidence. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">Pineda-Barientos did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Adebisi v. INS, </em>952 F.2d 910, 912 (5th Cir.1992). His fear of persecution arose from a personal dispute and did not provide sufficient grounds for a grant of asylum. <em>See Adebisi, </em>952 F.2d at 913. Pineda-Barientos did not make the showing required to establish eligibility for asylum, and thus, he has not met the more stringent standard necessary to establish eligibility for withholding of deportation. <em>See id. </em>Because Pineda-Barientos did not establish that he would likely be tortured if returned to Guatemala, he has not shown eligibility for relief under the CAT. <em>See Bah v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 348, 351-52 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-15\">We review Pineda-Barientos\u2019 due process claims <em>de novo. Alwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). Pineda-Barientos has not shown that the exclusion of testimony from his expert and his father resulted in substantial prejudice. <em>See id. </em>He has not shown why the testimony was necessary, nor has he explained how exclusion of the testimony caused him harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-16\">The BIA\u2019s use of the summary affirmance procedure did not deprive this court of a basis for judicial review and did not violate due process. <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003). The inclusion of further explanation or reasoning by a Board Member in a summary affirmance is explicitly prohibited by regulation. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii) &amp; (in) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-17\">Pineda-Barientos\u2019 petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1041-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
