We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). Hailu next disputes the IJ\u2019s finding that Hailu failed to qualify for the relief of cancellation of removal because he did not establish that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his mother, who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D) (2000). Again, we find that we are without jurisdiction to review this discretionary decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">We accordingly dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
