Although he argues that the application of the career criminal provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 violated the terms of his plea agreement with the government, the district court\u2019s ruling that the plea bargain precluded only government motions for enhancements is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>48 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.1995). Furthermore, Dedrick\u2019s argument that the district court erred in calculating the relevant amount of cocaine base is barred by his waiver of the right to direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 729-30 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal as to Dedrick\u2019s sentencing issue and AFFIRM his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-24\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
