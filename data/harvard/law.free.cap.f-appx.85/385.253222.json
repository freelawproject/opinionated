The IJ determined that Veloquio is deportable because she is an immigrant without a valid entry document, and that Alejandro also is deportable because he was admitted into the United States on the basis of his relationship to his mother, who claims United States citizenship. Because Alejandro\u2019s petition is contingent upon his mother\u2019s citizenship claim, the petitions have been consolidated for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-22\">The record reflects that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning Veloquio\u2019s claim that she is a United States citizen. Accordingly, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(5) (West 1994),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it is ORDERED that the clerk shall transfer the consolidated petitions to the United States district court for the district where Veloquio has her residence for a hearing <em>de novo </em>on her claim that she is a United States citizen. <em>See Agosto v.
