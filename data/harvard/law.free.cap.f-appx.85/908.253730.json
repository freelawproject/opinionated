The district court imposed concurrent sentences of eighty-seven months on each count of bank robbery and armed bank robbery, a consecutive seven-year sentence on the first \u00a7 924(c) count, and twenty-five-year sentences on the remaining four \u00a7 924(c) counts, to run consecutively to each other and the other counts of conviction, for a total imprisonment of 1871 months. Gary maintains on appeal that the district court erred in admitting latent fingerprint identification evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The district court\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 139, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997); <em>United States v. Powers, </em>59 F.3d 1460, 1470-71 (4th Cir.1995). In <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>324 F.3d 261 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 220, 157 L.Ed.2d 159 (2003), we noted that fingerprint evidence has ably withstood the test of time and found such evidence to be reliable and properly admissible, at least at a general level. <em>Id. </em>at 269 (noting that while standards for matches may differ, all testers use the same technique). Furthermore, we stated that \u201ca trial judge need not expend scarce judicial resources reexamining a familiar form of expertise every time opinion evidence is offered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268. We concluded that fingerprint analysis is one of those forms of evidence where the reliability of the science and its general acceptance is apparent without a full reexamination of the science. <em>Id. </em>at 268-69. In light of <em>Crisp\u2019s </em>recent approval of the methodology used by the forensics expert in this case, and Gary\u2019s failure to provide any persuasive evidence of the expert\u2019s lack of qualifications, we find no abuse of discretion in admitting the expert\u2019s testimony concerning the latent fingerprint identification evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">Although Gary has not raised a multiplicity claim on appeal, the judgment makes clear that the district court convicted Gary of both bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and armed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d), for each of the five robberies he was charged with committing. On these ten counts, the court sentenced Gary to serve concurrent sentences of 87 months, respectively. This court may exercise its discretionary remedial power to correct the district court if it committed plain error. <em>United States v. Childress, </em>26 F.3d 498, 502 (4th Cir.1994). Four conditions must be met before this court will notice plain error: (1) there must be error; (2) it must be plain under current law; (3) it must affect substantial rights, typically meaning the defendant is prejudiced by the error in that it affected the outcome of the proceedings; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">It is well established that section 2113(a) is a lesser-included offense of \u00a7 2113(d). <em>United States v. Whitley, </em>759 F.2d 327, 331 (4th Cir.1985) (en banc) (citing <em>Prince v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370 (1957)). In fact, this court has long recognized that \u00a7 2113 defines a primary offense of bank robbery in \u00a7 2113(a), and both mitigated and aggravated forms of that crime in subsections (b) and (d). <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>465 F.2d 361, 363 (4th Cir.1972); <em>see also United States v. Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. 544, 547, 96 S.Ct. 1023, 47 L.Ed.2d 222 (1976) (recognizing \u201cmerger\u201d of convictions under \u00a7 2113(a) and \u00a7 2113(d) for same robbery). We find that Gary\u2019s convictions under both \u00a7 2113(a) and \u00a7 2113(d) are multiplicitous and that the court committed plain error in imposing concurrent sentences for the lesser included offenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>bank robbery. <em>See Shelton, </em>465 F.2d at 363 (vacating duplicitous sentences even though imposed to run concurrently); <em>see also United States v. Burns, </em>990 F.2d 1426, 1438 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that the remedy for multiplicitous convictions and sentences is to vacate the duplicative counts of conviction and attendant sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the five convictions and sentences for the lesser included offense of bank robbery, affirm the remaining convictions and sentences, and remand to the district court to enter judgment in accordance with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
