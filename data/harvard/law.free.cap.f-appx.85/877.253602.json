R.Civ.P. 60(b). The district court properly construed the Rule 60(b) motion as a successive action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). Rather than seek authorization from this court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, Salas appealed the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 337-39, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Salas has not made the requisite showing. Neither has Salas presented grounds to merit authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(a), 2255 118. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"AFPi\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
