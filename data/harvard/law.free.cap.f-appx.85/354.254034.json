They argue that the summary-affirmance procedure employed by the BIA violates due process; however, this court has rejected such argument. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-28\">They also argue that the decision denying them asylum was not supported by substantial evidence. However, they have not presented evidence which compels a determination that they have a well-founded fear of persecution based on Kong\u2019s Chinese ancestry or their political opposition to Communism. Nor have the couple presented facts suggesting that the alleged problems they suffered in the past, <em>ie, </em>the \u201cextraction\u201d of money, were related to Kong\u2019s Chinese ancestry or their oppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>sition to Communism. Because the petitioners have not met their burden of showing that the denial of asylum was not supported by substantial evidence, their petition is DENIED. <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The Respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance of the BIA\u2019s decision and its various motions regarding briefing are DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">PETITION DENIED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
