They request review of the decision of the Board of. Immigration Appeals (BIA), which affirmed the decision of the immigration judge (IJ) to deny their application for asylum, withholding of deportation, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Because the BIA employed the streamlined review process of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7), we review, the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-19\">The IJ based his decision to deny relief on his explicit findings that Di was not credible. We do not \u201creview decisions turning purely on the immigration judge\u2019s assessment of the alien petitioner\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In light of the IJ\u2019s explanation of the credibility determination, that determination was \u201ca reasonable interpretation of the record,\u201d and the evidence does not compel the conclusion urged by Di and Liu. <em>See id. </em>at 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-20\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-21\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
