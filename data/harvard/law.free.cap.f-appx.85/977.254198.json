The district court granted FedEx\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and Everett appeals this judgment. This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Threadgill v. Prudential Sec. Group, Inc., </em>145 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Everett first argues that the district court erred in determining that the \u201csliding scale\u201d standard of review did not apply to her claim. Everett has not shown that FedEx had a conflict of interest such that the sliding scale standard should apply. <em>See Vega v. Nat. Life Ins. Sews., Inc., </em>188 F.3d 287, 296 (5th Cir.1999) <em>(em banc). </em>She thus has not shown that the district court erred in declining to apply this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Everett next argues that the district court erred in rejecting her argument that FedEx legally erred when it applied the wrong definition of \u201csignificant objective findings\u201d to analyze her claim of disability. Everett has not established that there are inconsistencies between the definitions of that term found in the benefits plan and the summary plan description at issue in this case. <em>See Wise v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., </em>986 F.2d 929, 939 (5th Cir.1993). She thus has not shown that the district court erred in rejecting this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">Everett\u2019s final contention is that the district court erred in determining that FedEx had not abused its discretion in determining that she was not totally disabled and'rejecting her claim for continued benefits. The record contains substantial evidence to support FedEx\u2019s rejection of her claim. <em>See Meditrust Fin. Sews. Corp. v. Sterling Chems. Inc., </em>168 F.3d 211, 213-15 (5th Cir.1999). ..Accordingly, Everett has not shown that the district court erred in rejecting this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">Everett has not shown that the district court erred in granting FedEx\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing her suit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
