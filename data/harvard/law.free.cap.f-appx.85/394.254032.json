He filed a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the Southern District of Texas. The district court dismissed it as untimely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Richardson now moves for a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-24\">Richardson argues that: (1) the one-year limitations period for filing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition should have been tolled from the time that he deposited each of his two state habeas applications into the prison mailing system because the federal prison mailbox rule applies to his state habeas filings; and (2) he is entitled to equitable tolling of the one-year statute of limitations period for the days between the dismissal or denial of his state habeas applications and his actual receipt of notice of those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-25\">To obtain a COA, a petitioner must make a substantial showing of the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). When a district court has dismissed a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claims, \u201ca COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Richardson has not shown that it is debatable whether the district court\u2019s determination was correct. First, the prison mailbox rule does not apply to the filing date of a state habeas application. <em>Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.1999). Second, the state\u2019s delays of ten and thirteen days in transmitting the notices of the court\u2019s actions on Richardson\u2019s state habeas applications were not sufficiently \u201crare and exceptional\u201d such that equitable tolling is justified. <em>Phillips v. Donnelly, </em>216 F.3d 508, 511 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding that a four-month delay is exceptional); <em>see also Fisher v. Johnson, </em>174 F.3d 710, 714 (5th Cir.1999) (concluding that a delay of \u201cseveral months\u201d is exceptional).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Accordingly, Richardson\u2019s motion for COA is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-28\">. Richardson's petition was untimely by four days.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
