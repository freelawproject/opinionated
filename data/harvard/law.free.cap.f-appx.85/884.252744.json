Baker, a Virginia inmate, appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (2000). Baker has provided this court with evidence not submitted to the district court showing that he had pursued administrative remedies prior to filing his \u00a7 1983 action. Because Baker may amend his complaint to cure the defect identified by the district court, the dismissal order is not final and thus is not subject to appellate review. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-22\">We therefore dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
