Singh claims the BIA erred in determining that he had not established past persecution based on his religion and political opinions or a well-founded fear of future persecution. (He makes no contention under the CAT and has therefore waived that issue on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993).)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">This court will uphold the factual findings that an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal if those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). The BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">\n<em>DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
