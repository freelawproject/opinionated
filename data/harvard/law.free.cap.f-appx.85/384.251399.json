The district court\u2019s refusal to issue the writ is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Denson, </em>603 F.2d 1143, 1146 (5th Cir.1979) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-22\">\u201c[Mjandamus is not available to review the discretionary acts of officials.\u201d <em>Giddings v. Chandler, </em>979 F.2d 1104, 1108 (5th Cir.1992). A U.S. Attorney exercises absolute discretion regarding whether to initiate a criminal prosecution. <em>United States v. Cowan, </em>524 F.2d 504, 507-08 (5th Cir.1975); <em>United States v. Cox, </em>342 F.2d 167, 171 (5th Cir.1965) (en banc). The court may not interfere with the free exercise of that discretionary power. <em>Cox, </em>342 F.2d at 171. Similarly, the Attorney General has the discretion to decline to commence deportation proceedings, which discretion is not subject to judicial interference. <em>See Alvidres-Reyes v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 199, 205 (5th Cir.1999). Moreover, even assuming federal officials owed a duty to prosecute or to initiate criminal proceedings, that duty was not owed to Ganesan, and he lacks standing to challenge the officials\u2019 alleged failure to act. <em>See Giddings, </em>979 F.2d at 1110. Dismissal of the petition was proper, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
