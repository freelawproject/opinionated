We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-23\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R'App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.

Naragon asserts he received the district court\u2019s order on August 7, 2003. He filed a motion to reopen the appeal period on August 19, 2003, one day beyond the period in which he could move to reopen. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6), (c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Because Naragon failed to file a timely notice of appeal and failed to timely move for reopening of the appeal period, we-dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
