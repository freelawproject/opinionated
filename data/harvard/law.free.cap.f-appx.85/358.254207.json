Martinez wishes to be placed in \u201csuperseg[regation] protective custody\u201d pending a disposition of his civil rights claims by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Martinez\u2019s civil rights claims against the TDCJ-ID Connally Unit personnel have been dismissed by the Western District of Texas for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, <em>see Martinez v. Ambriz, </em>No. SA-03-CA-319-EP, 2003 WL 21305472 (W-D.Tex. May 21, 2003), and, although his claims against the TDCJ-ID Smith Unit personnel are still pending before the Northern District, Martinez is no longer housed at the Smith Unit and, thus, he is in no danger from the personnel or inmates at the Smith Unit. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Martinez\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. <em>See White v. Carlucci </em>862 F.2d 1209, 1211 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Women\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. Bell, 248 </em>F.3d 411, 419 n. 15 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Martinez\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, and his motion to this court for appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212, 213 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
