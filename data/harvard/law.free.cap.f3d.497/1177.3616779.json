On appeal, Taber argues that the district court erroneously applied a two-level adjustment to his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4, for his use of a minor in the commission of the offenses. Contrary to Taber\u2019s argument, we hold that the district court correctly applied the adjustment because Ta-ber committed three affirmative acts to involve the minor in the offense. Thus, for the reasons discussed more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">The basic facts are undisputed. On September 8, 2006, Gateswood Sports, Inc. (\u201cGateswood\u201d), a federal firearms licensee, was burglarized and suffered a loss of six firearms and a small amount of cash. Officers determined that a minor was a suspect in the burglary. During an interview with the officers, the minor admitted that he committed the burglary at Gateswood and that Taber was with him during the burglary. According to the minor, Taber pushed out a window-mounted air conditioner and the minor, with Taber\u2019s assistance, entered Gateswood through the window. The minor placed six firearms and cash into a backpack and exited Gateswood through the same window. As the minor and Taber were leaving Gateswood, they observed police in the area, so they hid the backpack in nearby bushes. The minor and Taber later retrieved the backpack and drove to the house of Robert Shaffer, who was a friend of the minor. The serial numbers were obliterated from the firearms at Shaffer\u2019s house. The minor and Taber each kept one of the firearms and the remaining firearms were left at Shaffer\u2019s house. Thereafter, the minor and Shaffer traded one of the firearms to a third party in exchange for marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-12\">The officers later arrested and interviewed Taber. According to Taber, the minor had told Taber that he knew of a place where they could steal firearms and of individuals who would buy the firearms from them. Taber drove himself and the minor to Gateswood. The minor surveyed the area and then informed Taber that they could accomplish the theft at that time. Taber next observed the minor entering Gateswood through a window \u201conce the air conditioner unit was pushed through.\u201d Taber confirmed that he and the minor drove the firearms to Shaffer\u2019s house, but he denied that he obliterated the serial numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-13\">At sentencing, the district court assigned a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). In addition to increases in the offense level for specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>offense characteristics, the court included a two-level enhancement for Taber\u2019s use of a minor in committing the offenses, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4. Taber\u2019s total adjusted offense level was 27 and his criminal history category was IV, thereby resulting in a guideline range of 100 to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">\u25a0 Taber objected to the \u00a7 3B1.4 enhancement. In overruling Taber\u2019s objection, the district court found that Taber had engaged in affirmative acts to involve the minor, namely: \u201c[1] actually driving to Gateswood Sports, driving both of them there, [2] the act of actually, I believe, pushing the air conditioning unit through the window so that [the minor] could enter the store and [3] then acting as a lookout while [the minor] was in the store.\u201d The court thus found that Taber\u2019s affirmative acts to involve the minor were sufficient to support the application of the \u00a7 3B1.4 enhancement. The court thereafter imposed a low-end sentence of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">On appeal, Taber argues that the district court erred in applying the \u00a7 3B1.4 enhancement to his offense level for two reasons, specifically, that the enhancement is not applicable where: (1) the defendant did not commit any of the acts required by Application Note 1 of \u00a7 3B1.4; and (2) the minor was more culpable than the adult defendant. Taber asserts that the language of \u00a7 3B1.4, along with the definition of \u201cuse or attempted use,\u201d as defined in Application Note 1, requires the defendant to do more than participate as an equal partner in jointly undertaken activity with the minor. He maintains that the three acts that the district court' found established the requisite conduct on Taber\u2019s part were not the type of \u201cdirectional\u201d acts that the guideline enhancement requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. McClain, </em>252 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-10\">Section 3B1.4 falls under Part B of Chapter Three of the sentencing guidelines. In Part B, entitled \u201cRole in the Offense,\u201d the guidelines indicate that adjustments set forth in that part are \u201cbased upon the role the defendant played in committing the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. Chapter Three, Part B, Introductory Commentary. Pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.4,. a defendant\u2019s offense level must be increased by two levels \u201cif [he] used or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense or assist in avoiding detection of, or apprehension for, the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4. The commentary to \u00a7 3B1.4 provides that \u201c \u2018[u]sed or attempted to use\u2019 includes directing, commanding, encouraging, intimidating, counseling, training, procuring, recruiting, or soliciting.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4, comment, (n.l); <em>see also Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (\u201c[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or .explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-11\">As both parties concede, <em>McClain </em>is our sole published authority in which a district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3B1.4 was directly at issue. <em>See McClain, </em>252 F.3d at 1284. In <em>McClain, </em>two codefendants were convicted of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>which they committed by recruiting minors to cash counterfeit checks at various banks. <em>Id. </em>at 1281-83. Both defendants received a two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.4 for using a minor to commit their offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1283. McClain argued on appeal that the enhancement was not applicable to him because his codefen-dant actually solicited the minor for the crime, while McClain merely worked with his codefendant in the overall scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 1284. Thus, at issue in <em>McClain </em>was \u201cwhether section 3B1.4 appliefd] to the jointly undertaken criminal activity of co-conspirators,\u201d but not whether mere partnering with a minor was sufficient for the \u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment because it was undisputed that McClain\u2019s co-conspirator had recruited a minor. <em>Id. </em>at 1287, 1287 n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">In analyzing whether the district court correctly applied \u00a7 3B1.4 in McClain\u2019s case, we first looked to the statute enabling \u00a7 3B1.4, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-5\">SEC. 140008. SOLICITATION OF MINOR TO COMMIT CRIME</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEy\">(a) Directive to Sentencing Commission\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-6\">(1) The United States Sentencing Commission shall promulgate guidelines or amend existing guidelines to provide that a defendant ... who has been convicted of an offense shall receive an appropriate sentence enhancement if the defendant involved a minor in the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-7\">(2) The Commission shall provide that the guideline enhancement ... shall apply for any offense in relation to which the defendant has solicited, procured, recruited, counseled, encouraged, trained, directed, commanded, intimidated, or otherwise used or attempted to use any person less than 18 years of age with the intent that the minor would commit a Federal offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\"><em>McClain, </em>252 F.3d at 1284-85 (quoting Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-322, \u00a7 140008(a), 108 Stat. 1796, 2033). We held that \u00a7 3B1.4 was \u201capplicable to participants in a jointly undertaken criminal enterprise in which use of a minor was reasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>McClain, </em>252 F.3d at 1288. Therefore, we affirmed the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3B1.4 in McClain\u2019s case because, given McClain\u2019s participation and leadership role in the overall counterfeit check-cashing scheme, it was reasonably foreseeable to McClain that one of his co-conspirators would recruit a minor for use in the scheme. <em>Id. </em>Because we did not have the opportunity to discuss the definition and scope of the terms \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cattempted to use\u201d as they are employed in \u00a7 3B1.4, it remains an open question in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-10\">However, our sister circuits provide persuasive authority on the question, all holding that a \u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment applies only where the defendant takes some affirmative act to involve the minor in the criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Molina, </em>469 F.3d 408, 415 (5th Cir.2006) (indicating that the minor\u2019s mere presence during unlawful activity was not sufficient to warrant a \u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment); <em>United States v. Pojilenko, </em>416 F.3d 243, 247 (3d Cir.2005) (agreeing that \u201csome affirmative act is necessary beyond mere partnership in order to implicate \u00a7 3B1.4\u201d); <em>United States v. Paine, </em>407 F.3d 958, 965 (8th Cir.2005) (concluding that the language of \u00a7 3B1.4, Application Note 1 \u201crequires the defendant to affirmatively involve or incorporate a minor into the commission of the offense\u201d); <em>United States v. Suitor, </em>253 F.3d 1206, 1210 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that \u00a7 3B1.4 is applicable only where the evidence demonstrates more than the defendant\u2019s involvement in a conspiracy with a minor); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>241 F.3d 1114, 1120 (9th Cir.2001) (reasoning that a defendant must act affirmatively to involve a minor in the crime to warrant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>\u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment, as opposed to merely acting as the minor\u2019s partner); <em>United States v. Ramsey, </em>237 F.3d 853, 860 (7th Cir.2001) (requiring that the defendant \u201ctake affirmative acts to involve the minor in the commission of the offense\u201d); <em>United States v. Butler, </em>207 F.3d 839, 848 (6th Cir.2000) (determining that a defendant \u201cmust do more than simply participate in a crime with a minor\u201d to warrant a \u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment). We join our sister circuits and. hold that a \u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment is warranted only where the defendant takes some affirmative step to involve a minor in the commission of the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">Despite the circuits\u2019 agreement that there must be some affirmative act to involve the minor, there is a split over what type of \u201caffirmative act\u201d will warrant the adjustment. <em>Compare Ramsey, </em>237 F.3d at 859 (holding that the \u201caffirmative act\u201d requirement can be met when the defendant is a mere partner with the minor), <em>with Pojilenko, </em>416 F.3d at 247 (concluding that mere partnership is insufficient), <em>Parker, </em>241 F.3d at 1120 (holding that a defendant\u2019s participation in an armed bank robbery with a minor does not warrant the adjustment), <em>and Butler, </em>207 F.3d 839, 848-49 (requiring more than equal partnership with the minor in committing the offense). However, we need not address this split here because, contrary to Taber\u2019s argument on appeal, the district court found that Taber committed three affirmative acts to involve the minor in the criminal activity and, pursuant to the language of \u00a7 3B1.4, Application Note 1 and the relevant case law, those acts were sufficient to warrant the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">Specifically, the district court determined that Taber had affirmatively involved the minor in three ways: (1) driving himself and the minor to the robbery location; (2) pushing in the air-conditioning unit at Gateswood, which allowed the minor to enter the building through the hole in the window; and (3) acting as a look-out while the minor was inside Gateswood. Taber admits on appeal that he does not challenge the district court\u2019s particular factual findings. According to \u00a7 3B1.4, Application Note 1, the terms \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cattempted to use\u201d include \u201cencouraging.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4, comment, (n.l). The term \u201cencourage\u201d is defined as, \u201c[t]o instigate; to incite to action; to embolden; to help.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 568 (8th ed.2004). Under that definition, and our requirement that the defendant take some affirmative act to , involve the minor, Ta-ber\u2019s three acts did encourage and help the minor to commit the crime of stealing the firearms. There is nothing in the case law or the sentencing guidelines to suggest that, where, as here, the minor devised the criminal scheme at the outset, the adult defendant\u2019s conduct cannot warrant a \u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment. Thus, even though the record indicates that the minor invited Taber to participate in the theft of the firearms, Taber\u2019s subsequent affirmative acts involved the minor in the offense, such that the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">For the foregoing reasons, Taber\u2019s sentence is <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">. Under the guidelines, an offense level of 27 and a criminal history category of IV yields a guideline range of 100-125 months\u2019 imprisonment. (See Nov. 1, 2005, Guidelines Manual at Sentencing Table). However, because the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for Taber\u2019s convictions on counts 1 through 3 was 120 months' imprisonment, Taber's guideline range became 100 to 120 months. <em>(See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
