The defendant, however, still refused, when the plaintiff said to him, \u201c If you get any work from any one reading these books would you not be willing then to pay for your advertisement ? \u201d That the defendant has no recollection of ever signing but one of the contracts for $265 for the Pennsylvania Company\u2019s book, and he only agreed for one page of advertisement in said book, and he believes and avers that if there is in existence a second contract for a second page that he was misled and misinformed. Defendant, becoming tired of the plaintiff\u2019s importunities, signed two agreements, one for the Pennsylvania Company\u2019s books and one for the Penn Mutual Company\u2019s books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\">Defendant further avers that he positively refused to sign the contracts aforesaid until the said plaintiff, as deponent believes, falsely and fraudulently verbally represented to him, this defendant, that he would not collect said contract notes unless said advertisements should bring deponent sufficient work to net him in profit as much or more than their respective amounts; upon which verbal representations he affixed his signatures, relying upon the same as part of the contract then and there consummated. The advertisements have utterly failed to bring any work or to produce any profit to this deponent, he never having obtained any benefit therefrom ; in fact the defendant is informed and believes that these books were never distributed to the public as agreed upon, and furthermore the defendant avers that the said books are not up to the standard which the plaintiff agreed they should be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">It is true that the said defendant did make an estimate for certain woodwork in a house at Southport, Conn., the specifications of which were brought to him by an architect, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>defendant did not know who the owner of the house was, the plan not having the name on, as is customary. After making the estimate defendant was notified that the said house was owned by said plantiff\u2019s wife, and that he might possibly have trouble in securing payment. Defendant therefore did not deem it advisable to proceed with the work. He is informed that others who made estimates and did work on said property have had great difficulty in recovering payment. Defendant believes that the whole plan was one calculated to deceive, and that the plaintiff, by false promises and assertions, induced him to subscribe to books which were to be the means by which plaintiff or his family were to have work done at the expense of said defendant; that the defendant owes the plaintiff nothing ; all of which he avers is true and will be able to prove on the trial of the cause before a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was entry of judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-6\"><em>Edward S. </em>Sayres, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM49\">No principle has been better settled by a long line of decisions than that parol evidence is admissible to show a verbal contemporaneous agreement which induced the execution of a written agreement, though it may have the effect of varying or changing the terms of the written contract.

Mutual Life Insurance Company\u2019s building in the city of Philadelphia. For these advertisements the defendant agreed to pay a sum aggregating $765. In addition to the advertisement the defendant was to receive twenty copies of the book describing and illustrating the Pennsylvania Company\u2019s building and ten copies of the book descriptive and illustrative of the Penn. Mutual Life Insurance Company\u2019s building. The amount of these several contracts, as was stipulated therein, was to be paid in trade. Each of the contracts contains this clause: \u201c It is agreed that the whole agreement between the parties is contained in this contract.\u201d Upon the back of each, in order to make the terms more specific and preservative of defendant\u2019s rights, he made these indorsements: \u201c The within named amount is only available as a credit and is to be deducted from my price for work other than I have estimated on or contracted for prior to the date hereof. In the event of the contract for the said work not being awarded me, I am to be absolutely acquitted of any charge for the advertising herein provided.\u201d An opportunity to do work not contracted for before the date of these agreements and for an amount greater than the entire amount stipulated to be paid by them was offered to the defendant, which he accepted, but subsequently refused to perform, for reasons not very definitely explained by him in his affidavit of defense. Upon his failure to do the work, a suit was brought for the amount of the aggregate of the several contracts. The statement was full and specific. The defendant filed two several affidavits of defense in which he alleged great importunity on the part of the plaintiff in securing the contracts and a contemporaneous oral agreement, made at their signing, which he alleged was the inducement to his signing them, that he was not to pay the amount therein stipulated, \u201c unless said advertisements should bring deponent sufficient work to net him in profits as much or more than their respective amounts.\u201d He also alleged an agreement as to quality and as to the distribution of the books and averred that the books were not up to the standard nor was the distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>made as agreed upon. Upon the hearing upon a rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered for want of'a sufficient affidavit of defense, the court below made the rule absolute and entered judgment for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim, with interest. From this judgment the defendant appeals to this court and alleged as erroneous the entering of the judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, for the reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">1st. That there was a contemporaneous oral agreement made at the time of the signing of the contract notes which must be considered a part of the written agreement, as it was this oral agreement which induced defendant to sign the notes, which fact only a jury can determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">2d. That the affidavit of defense alleges that the books were not up to the standard and that they were never distributed, which fact only a jury can determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">8d. That the supplemental affidavit of defense avers that the plaintiff falsely and fraudulently verbally represented to the defendant that he would not collect said contract notes, unless the advertisement inured to defendant\u2019s benefit, which fact only a jury can determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The alleged oral agreement, even if defendant were able to bring his proof up to the measure required by the late authorities in Pennsylvania, is so indefinite that it ought not to be allowed to prevail against the express terms of the written contracts which provide that the whole agreement between the parties is therein contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Within what time was it stipulated that said advertisements should bring defendant sufficient work to net him in profits as much or more than the respective amounts of the contracts ? There is no time fixed in the affidavit and it would be unreasonable to require the plaintiff to wait an indefinite time before that question could be determined. The affidavit in this respect lacks the clearness and precision which is required to establish a contemporaneous oral agreement which induced the execution of a written contract to vary, change or reform the instrument. See Thomas et al., v. Loose et al., 114 Pa. 35. This disposes of the first and third specifications of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">As to the second, it is sufficient to say that nothing whatever is said in the written agreement as to the quality of the books <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>nor is it alleged in the affidavit that any representations were made -to the defendant as to quality nor that any agreement was made as to distribution. The defendant is alleged to have received twenty of the books descriptive of the Pennsylvania Company\u2019s building- and ten boobs descriptive of the Penn. Mutual Life Insurance Company\u2019s building, and this he does not deny.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">We are of opinion that the affidavits of defense taken together were insufficient and that the judgment was properly entered for the plaintiff by the court below. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
