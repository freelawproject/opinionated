He also solicited orders which were subsequently mailed or delivered by him to his employers and filled from Westmoreland county by the company, but not delivered through him. Held that by reason of the fact that the sale was not complete as between vendor and vendee by the act of such employee, he could not be held guilty of selling liquor without a license.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b503-10\">\n<em>Contract\u2014Sale of liquor in adjoining county\u2014Completion of sale.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b503-11\">The question of liability for violation of the act of June 9, 1891, P. L. 267, in selling liquor without a license must find its solution in the application of principles governing the sale of any other article of trade. A license in Westmoreland county will only protect a vendor of liquor in sales fully perfected in that county, but the mere taking of orders in Fayette county, by an employee of a Westmoreland County brewery, which must be accepted and filled by the company from Westmoreland does not connect the agent with that part of the transaction nor render him liable for the penalty.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b503-12\">Argued March 17 and 18, 1896.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEy\">Appeal No. 13, Marob T., 1896, by Fred.

Under these facts, .we instruct y.ou to find the defendant, Fred. Munk, guilty in manner and form as he stands indicted, -and-to find and return the facts of the case-as agreed upon by counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">A verdict was returned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">\u201cWe,[the jury in.the above case, find the defendant, Fred. .Munk, guilty in manner and form as he .stands indicted, and we find the facts in the ease to be as.follows: The defendant, Fred Munk, has, been employed by the Mt. Pleasant Brewing Co. of Mt. Pleasant, licensed as brewers in Westmoreland Co., .Pa., to make collections for them in Fayette county and return empty beer kegs, in ..pursuance of'which he has within the past two years made such collections in Fayette county and returned empty beer kegs to. said brewing company. While making such collections the defendant did solicit and receive orders for beer in Fayette county, some of which orders he sent by mail-and others topk in person to the said brewing company, who sent the beer :to the parties, after which the defendant went around and collected the money for said beer; said beer was delivered bjr the said brewing company by their own drivers on their own Wagons, pr by wagons and drivers hired by them from other parties ifi Fayette county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">A motion for a new trial, was overruled and this defendant sentenced under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The special findings of fact furnish the only data from which the case must be decided; whatever facts do. not appear therein must be taken not to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u2022 The defendant is connected with the sales only in soliciting -the orders and receiving the money from the purchasers for his employers. The owner of. the beer could accept or reject the order as submitted through Munk; the orders were accepted by the owners, who \u201csent the beer to the parties.\u201d \u201c Said beer was delivered by the said brewing company by their own drivers, on their own,wagons, or by wagons and drivers'hired by th.em from other parties, in Fayette county.\u201d Fred Munk is np.t in any way connected with the delivery of the beer, and from the agreed-upon facts may not have known of when, how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>or where it was delivered. This is vital to the case, and while this question has been before the Supreme Court of this state in as varied forms as the ingenuity of the trade can devise, its solution is to be had in the application of principles governing the sale of any other article of trade. The special findings of fact are not complete as to Munk, though they would be much more serious if applied to the owner of. the beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Because of the absence of several material items in the transaction, from the time the order was given until the beer was received in Fayette county, we are obliged to hold that the court erred in directing the jury to convict the defendant, and this after a careful examination of Commonwealth v. Fleming, 130 Pa. 138; Commonwealth v. Holstine, 132 Pa. 357; Commonwealth v. Hess, 148 Pa. 98; Commonwealth v. Ginader, 148 Pa. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The license of the Mt. Pleasant Brewing Company would only protect Munk in sales that were fully perfected in Westmoreland county, and while the actual delivery of the beer may have been made in Fayette county, the conceded facts do not in any way connect this defendant with that part of. the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The crucial test of \u201c when the sale was complete between the vendor and vendee \u201d is to be applied to cases of this kind, but it must be borne in mind that every part of such transactions will be severely scrutinized, as in the cases noted there seems to have been an almost studied effort to avoid a penal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The specifications of error are sustained and the judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
