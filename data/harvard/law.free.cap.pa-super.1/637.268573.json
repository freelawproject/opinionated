L. 257. The petition, bond and justification of sureties complied with the terms of the act under the rules of court. A remonstrance was filed, supported by affidavits by residents of the county, against the granting of the license applied for, and assigned the same reasons assigned in Doberneek\u2019s Appeal, 1 Super. Ct. 99, with the additional reasons (1) that Indiana county is a prohibition county. (2) That the brewery during the former period of its operation was so conducted as to cause disorder, confusion and drunkenness in the town, that the former licensee, Frank M. Doberneck, was during said period assisted in the operation of the brewery and in the sale and delivery of beer therefrom by his brother, George L. Doberneck, the present applicant; and the conduct of the said George L. Doberneck in connection with the operation of said brewery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>showed his incapacity to manage such business according to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-5\">The petitioner moved to strike the remonstrance and affidavits from the file.

The right is reserved to file a more extended written opinion.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, (1) refusing to strike remonstrances from the files; (2-5) refusing the order to grant a brewer\u2019s license, as prayed for, not approving the bond and not granting the license.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b662-8\"><em>J.

There having been a judicial hearing and the license having been refused for a legal reason, the appellate court will not discuss the correctness of the result reached by the court below: Doberneck\u2019s Appeal, 1 Super. Ct. 99; Gemas\u2019s Appeal, 169 Pa. 43.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3M7\">May 19, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b662-10\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">In Jos. Kohnle Brewing Co.\u2019s Appeal, 1 Super. Ct. 99, we held, following our own construction of the act creating this court in Colwyn v. Tarbotton, 1 Super. Ct. 179, that our jurisdiction on an appeal from an order of the court of quarter sessions revoking a license is the same as, and no greater than, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>exercisable by the Supreme Court upon certiorari prior to the act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 158. The same is true of an appeal from an order refusing a license. Many recent cases decided by the Supreme Court define that jurisdiction. It is unnecessary to cite them.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Where the record shows that .the license was refused after a judicial hearing, the appellate court will presume, in the absence of anything on the record to the contrary, that the court below performed its duty according to law, and will not review the case upon its merits; but where the court sets forth on the record as part of its decree the reasons for its action, the appellate court has authority to look into the case for the purpose of ascertaining whether the reasons thus assigned are legal reasons. Gemas\u2019s License, 169 Pa. 43, and Doberneck\u2019s Appeal, 1 Super. Ct. 99, are cases where this revisory jurisdiction has been exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">These, and like cases, simply decide that an abuse of the discretionary power of the quarter sessions affirmatively appearing on the face of the record might have been corrected upon certiorari prior to the act of 1889 (P. L. 158), and may now be corrected on appeal. But if the reasons assigned by the court below are legal reasons, the appellate court will not assume that the court below acted arbitrarily or that the reasons assigned had no existence in fact. In the present case the learned judge below has assigned as one of his reasons for refusing the license that the applicant is not a fit person to be licensed as a brewer. He says in his opinion that he reached this conclusion from what was submitted to the court on the hearing, and from personal observation. We must assume the correctness of this conclusion. We cannot retry the case on its merits, or substitute our judgment and discretion upon the evidence for those of the tribunal established by law. The record showing that the license was refused for a legal reason, after a judicial hearing, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
