The petition recited the will and disclosed that testator died seized of lands, portions of which were devised to certain of his children. The residue of the lands were devised to his son James and his wife Bridget, with remainder over. That there were no debts of the testator remaining charged on said lands. That by his will the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>testator bequeathed to bis son James personal estate in the manner following: \u201c To my son James I give and bequeath the sum of Five Hundred Dollars and the rest and residue of my personal property absolutely, after payment of expenses,\u201d being those of his last illness, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">That a codicil to said will provided as follows: \u201c That the Five Hundred Dollars I have heretofore willed to my son James be changed and paid to my granddaughter Mary, child of my daughter Kate, deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">That the executor has refused to pay the said legacy to the petitioner and has filed an account showing no personal assets remaining after payment Of the expenses mentioned in said will, and of administration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-7\">Respondents, James, Bridget, John and Thomas Law, filed answers denying\" that the legacy was charged on the land; no answer was made by any of the other respondents. The petitioner then moved that a decree for a petition be taken pro confesso as against the respondents, who failed to appear and answer as required by law; he also moved that an order as against the respondents, who had answered the case, be set down on petition and answer. The case came up for hearing on petition and answer before Searle, P. J., specially presiding, who filed an opinion and decree dismissing the petition. Fhe opinion, after reciting the provisions of the will, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-8\">The only question raised by these proceedings is whether this legacy given to Mary Dugan is a charge upon any of the real estate devised by the will of John Law, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\">The general rule is \u201c the personal estate is not only the primary, but prima facie the exclusive fund for the payment of legacies,\u201d and \u201c the intention of the testator to create a charge on real estate is to be carried out whenever it is discoverable from anything contained in the will, but there must be something on the face of the instrument from which it can be inferred: \u201d Duvall\u2019s Estate, 146 Pa. 176, quoting Okeson\u2019s Appeal, 59 Pa. 100. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-10\">From the will attached to the petition, and a part of the same, it appears that the testator in the first place provides for the payment of his funeral expenses and expenses of his last sickness. He then in the 1st, 2d, 3d and 4th items gave cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tain real estate, specifically described, to certain of his children. The 5th item or clause is as follows: \u201c To my son George, 1 give and bequeath absolutely the sum of one hundred dollars, or land to the value of one hundred dollars, whichever he may elect to take; and if he takes the money, the same to be payable within one year from my death and to remain a charge upon the land until paid; if he elects to take in land, the same sba.11 be selected by my executors and set apart as soon after my death as he (George) shall desire.\u201d The 6th clause is as follows: \u201c To my son James I give and bequeath the sum of five hundred dollars and the rest and residue of my personal property absolutely, after payment of expenses first above mentioned. And I also give and bequeath to my son James and his wife Bridget, for the term of their natural lives, and the natural life of either of them, the entire use, rents, income and profits of the rest and residue of my real estate after above allotments.\u201d The 7th clause provides for the distribution of this remainder after the termination of the life estates of James and Bridget. The 8th clause appoints Charles B. Q\u2019Neill and James Law executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">Subsequently a codicil was added to this will as follows: \u201c This my codicil, made the 4th day of August A. D. 1886. That the five hundred dollars I have heretofore willed to my son James be changed and paid to my granddaughter Mary, child of my daughter Kate, deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">The Mary mentioned in this codicil is the Mary Dugan, petitioner, in this case, by her guardian, Michael Dugan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">By writing into the 6th clause of the original will (the one in which this $500 legacy is given to James) this codicil, or changing it as directed by the codicil, it would read: 6th, \u201c To my granddaughter Mary, child of my daughter Kate deceased, I give and bequeath the sum of five hundred dollars, and to my son James the rest and residue of my personal property absolutely, after payment of expenses first above mentioned. And I also,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">There is no express charge of this legacy upon real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-9\">It has been held by the Supreme Court that a blending of real and personal estate in a residuary clause is sufficient evidence of an intent to charge such real estate with the payment of general legacies by implication: Davis\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 348, and cases cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>It was claimed by the learned counsel for the petitioner that in this case there was such a blending of real and personal estate as made this' legacy chargeable upon the residuary real \u25a0estate. But while the will creates a residue of personalty and also a residue of real estate, they are not blended. The personal residue is given absolutely to testator\u2019s son J ames. The residue of the real estate is distributed amongst the children and grandchildren of the testator who shall be living at the \u2022death of his son James and James\u2019s wife Bridget, a life estate in the same having been given to said James and Bridget.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">In Van Vliet\u2019s Appeal, 102 Pa. 574, the testator divided his real estate between his two sons, giving to each a specific tract, and directed each to pay certain legacies; he then bequeathed to the same sons the entire personalty. It was held not a blending of real and personal estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">Mary Dugan takes the same position as regards this legacy, .as James Law would have occupied had the codicil not been made, and the codicil creates by implication or otherwise no \u2022charge upon real estate which did not exist in the original will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">The language of the 6th clause of the will\u2014\u201c To my son James I give and bequeath the sum of five hundred dollars .and the rest and residue of my personal property absolutely, after payment of expenses first above mentioned,\u201d naturally leads to the conclusion that the testator intended the five hundred dollars to be paid from the personalty, and that James only took that personal property which remained after the payment of the legacy and expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\">This construction is consistent with the fact that in the preceding clause of his will testator gives to his son George a legacy of one hundred dollars, and evidences his intention that the same shall be a charge upon real estate by expressly so declaring, and also with the law that the personal estate is prima facie the exclusive fund for the payment of legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\">I am unable to discover in this will any intention to make this legacy a charge upon the real estate either by construction of the language of the same or by a blending of real and personal estate in a residuary clause. The order of sale of real estate to pay said legacy requested in the petition is therefore refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>Errors </em>assigned, were (1-2) dismissing petition; (3) not making a decree pro confesso against the devisees who failed to answer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-5\"><em>H. </em>Wilson, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak8\">The devise to James Law and wife was a residuary devise; and there is such blending pf personal and real estate in the residuary clause of the will as to make the legacy to Mary Dugan a charge on the land embraced in this clause: McGlaughlin\u2019s Exr. v. McGlaughlin\u2019s Admr., 24 Pa. 20; Riley\u2019s App., 34 Pa. 291; Clery\u2019s App., 35 Pa. 54.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-6\"><em>F. P. </em>Kimble, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Api\">As a general rule, \u201c the personal estate is not only the primary, but prima facie the exclusive fund for the payment of legacies, and this cannot be repelled by showing that the testator had no personal estate when the will was executed, and must have intended that the legacies should come out of real estate: Aldrich v. Cooper, 2 W. &amp; T. Lead. Cases in Eq. 346; Haddock\u2019s Estate, 18 W. N. C. 243; Okeson\u2019s App., 59 Pa. 100; Duvall\u2019s Est., 146 Pa. 176.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-7\">The words, following the designated legacy, clearly indicate the personal fund as the one from which the legacy is to come, and there being no other disposition of the personal estate mentioned in the will, the intention of the testator is obvious: Penny\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 323. There was no blending of personal and real estate: Van Vliet\u2019s App., 102 Pa. 574; Cable\u2019s App., 91 Pa. 327; Penny\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 323.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AF_\">February 20, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A_i\">Wickham, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">John Law, the testator, in and by the first four clauses of his last will and testament, gave portions of his real estate, particularly described, to certain of his children. The fifth and sixth clauses are as follows: 5th, \u201c To my son George I give and bequeath, absolutely, the sum of one hundred dollars, or land to the value of one hundred dollars, whichever he may elect to take, and, if he takes the money, the same to be payable within one year from my death and to remain a charge upon the land until paid; if he elects to take in land the same shall be selected by my executors as soon after my death as he, (George) shall desire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>6th, \u201c To my son James I give and bequeath the sum of five hundred dollars and the rest and residue of my personal property, absolutely, after payment of expenses first above mentioned. And I also give and bequeath to my son James and his wife Bridget, for the term of their natural lives, and the natural life of either of them, the entire use, rents, income and profits of the rest and residue of my real estate after above allotments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">A disposition of this residuary real estate, to take distributive effect after the death of James and Bridget, is made by the seventh clause of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">By a codicil, the legacy of $500, originally bequeathed to James is given to Mary Dugan. The language of the codicil is as follows: \u201c This my codicil, made the 4th day of August 1886. That the five hundred dollars I have heretofore willed to my son James, be changed and paid to my grand daughter Mary, child of my daughter Kate, deceased. \u201d The will contains nothing further to throw light on the testator\u2019s intention respecting this legacy, or to indicate the rank that should be accorded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">We fail to find anything in the will tending to support the appellant\u2019s contention that the legacy is charged on real estate. Certainly there is no express charge and, as the learned judge of the court below has well pointed out, no blending of the residuary real and personal estates to create a charge by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The position taken by the appellant in his third assignment of error, that a decree pro confesso should have been entered against the parties, who failed to answer the citation, is entirely untenable. Even if none of the parties cited had appeared, it would still be the duty of the court to examine the petition, whereof the will is a part, and to give such judgment as the law, applicable to the matters therein contained, will warrant: 3 Rhone\u2019s O. C. Practice,270.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">A petition which, on its face, shows that the relief prayed for cannot legally be granted, really needs no answer, save that contained in the decree dismissing it, although, following the maxim \u201c Abundans cautela non nocet, \u201d it is always well to put one in.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">All the assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed atr the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
