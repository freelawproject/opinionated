Glading, 21 Pa. 50; Meason v. Kaine, 63 Pa. 335. The terms of the contract must be clear and certain, and capable of ascertainment from the instrument itself: Ballou v. March, 133 Pa. 64; Hammer v. McEldowney, 46 Pa. 334; Soles v. Hickman, 20 Pa. 180. The terms of sale cannot be enforced and the defense set up does not amount to a payment: Sands v. Arthur, 84 Pa. 479; Loughery v. Dobson, 5 W. N. C. 535.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-5\">We entirely agree with appellee that the statute of frauds does not prevent a recovery of damages for the breach of a verbal contract for the sale of lands. The measure of damages, however, is not the value of the land, but the expenses incurred on the faith of the contract by the innocent party: Sands, Herdic 6 Co. v. Arthur, 84'Pa. 479; Moore v.

It does go to the extent, in some cases, of relieving a party to such an agreement from specific performance, but he is, nevertheless, liable in damages for his breach of contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-8\">The act does not prevent a recovery of damages for the breach of a verbal contract for the sale of lands: Bell v.

O\u2019Brien, the defendant in the court below, and appellee here. It was agreed between the parties that Eustace &amp; Co. should select and purchase, at a proper valuation, one of these houses, and that one third of the cost of roofing should be applied to the purchase money. This agreement was evidenced by the following memorandum :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201c February 10th, 1893.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">\u201cM.E. O\u2019Brien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201c Estimate for roofing 30 houses, Harmony and Reed Streets, at $17 per house, \u00a7\u2022 in cash and the balance to be due bills, paid in trade house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\u201c Eustace &amp; Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">Two thirds of the entire price of the roofing were paid in cash and two due bills given for the other one third. These due bills are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">\u201c Philadelphia, Mch. 11th, 1893.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">\u201c Balance due Eustace &amp; Co. one hundred and sixty-five dollars, to be paid in trade house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">\u201c$165.00. M. E. O\u2019Brien.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">\u201cPhiladelphia, July 20th, 1893.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-13\">\u201c Balance due Eustace &amp; Co. for roofing 9 houses, 34th and Wharton Street, to be paid in trade house, seventy-three and 60/100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-14\">\u201c $73.60 M. E. O\u2019Brien.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">The above memorandum and due bills contain all that was put in writing respecting the contract for the sale of the house. The appellee, in his affidavit of defense, avers that he is \u201c ready and at all times has been, to comply with his part of said agreement, and is ready and willing to sell and deliver any of said houses now in his possession, to said Eustace &amp; Co., or their assignee, as they may select, upon payment of the difference between the amount of said due bills and the value of the house selected.\u201d The houses, he alleges, range in price from $1,350 to $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-16\">It seems almost like an affectation of learning to cite authorities to prove that the contract of sale is subject to the operation of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries and is not enforceable by either party. It is silent as to price and terms\u2014a fatal defect: Soles v. Hickman, 20 Pa. <em>180; </em>Greenlee v. Greenlee, 22 Pa. 225. It is also fatally defective for not containing a description of the property to be conveyed: Ferguson v. Staver, 33 Pa. 411; Troup v. Troup, 87 Pa. 149; Mellon v. Davison, 123 Pa. 298. Indeed, it is clear that the parties themselves had no idea which one of the thirty houses Eustace &amp; Co. might eventually choose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>All the essentials of this contract lie in parol and the case is strikingly similar to that of Sands et al. v. Arthur, 84 Pa. 479. There the plaintiff sued for wages which were to be applied to the purchase money of a certain lot of ground, the whole agreement resting in parol. The defendants tendered a deed and offered to perform their part of the contract. Nevertheless, it was held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The doctrine recognized and enforced in that case governs the one in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">If the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to perform his assignor\u2019s part of the contract resulted in any injury to the defendant which the law recognizes, the nature and amount of the damage should have been specifically set forth in the affidavit of defense. As nothing of this sort is alleged or even suggested, it must be presumed not to exist. It follows that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">It is now ordered that the record in this case be remitted to the court below, and the said court is directed to enter judgment against the defendant for such sum as to right and justice may belong, unless other legal or equitable cause be shown why judgment should not be so entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
