That the premises occupied wbre of a yearly value of over $10.00. That the said Hazel paid something over $15.00 for the rent for the first year partly in cash and partly in repairs and services.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\">Isaac Frain testified as to conversations had by him with Hazel touching payment of rent, also as to his receipts and book entries\u2014the receipts and book having been burnt up. The court rejected from consideration the evidence as to the conversations, but refused to strike out the other testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">The court thereupon found the following conclusion of law :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-8\">Having found as- a fact that Jacob Hazel took possession of the premises of Lewis Zimmerman in the spring of 1889, and that said premises were of a yearly value of over $10.00 and that Jacob Hazel occupied the same continuously for over one year, that he was to pay therefor $15.00 rent for the first year, and that he paid over $10.00 rent in cash, repairs and services in making the repairs, then, under the law, as clearly held, he acquired a settlement in Walker township thereby, and the order of removal should be affirmed. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-9\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, (1-6) error in not finding facts as requested by defendant; (7) error in the conclusion of law, reciting same; (8) rejecting the evidence of one Isaac Frain ; (9-10) in affirming and not reversing the order of removal taken out by the order of the overseers of Spring township.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-10\"><em>David S. </em>Fortney, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae-\">To acquire a settlement by leasing, under the act of 1886, P.

Poor Dist. of Rose, 98 Pa. 636.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-5\">The objection to Frain\u2019s testimony should have been sustained; no rule is clearer than that the declarations of a party in his own behalf are not evidence: Clever v.

Frain\u2019s testimony was admissible under the ruling in Hester v. Commonwealth, 85 Pa. 139; Zell v. Commonwealth, 94 Pa. 258.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AafH\">March 19, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b409-7\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">To reverse this decree we must declare that the learned judge below erred in deciding as he did as to the credibility of the witnesses, and the weight of the testimony. But the act .which authorized a writ of error, and which regulates' our jurisdiction on appeal, does not contemplate a review of the conclusions of the court as to these matters. Exceptions are confined to \u201cany decisions of the court upon any point of evidence or of law.\u201d Act of March 16, 1868, P. L. 46. \u201c A point of evidence cannot, by any latitude of construction, be considered to mean whether the entire testimony makes out a case or proves the facts. It means, evidently, whether a witness offered is competent, or whether evidence offered is competent or relevant as. tending to prove any fact material to the issue. A point of law is a question of law applicable to the facts as they may be found by the court, which the party may propose in the shape of a written point and require an answer Lower Augusta v. Selinsgrove, 64 Pa. 166. This construction has been uniformly followed in like cases: Wayne Township v. Jersey Shore, 81* Pa. 264; Laporte v. Hillsgrove, 95 Pa. 269; Warsaw v. Knox, 107 Pa. 301; Montoursville v. Fairfield, 112 Pa. 99; Overseers of Taylor v. Shenango, 114 Pa. 394; Cambria v. Madison, 138 Pa. 109; Kittanning v. Madison, 146 Pa. 108. We have carefully examined the depositions and are of opinion that there was competent and sufficient evidence, if believed, to sustain the findings of fact; and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>is all that is necessary to be said concerning the first six assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">These findings of fact clearly warranted the conclusion of law, which is the subject of the seventh assignment of error, and the decree entered pursuant thereto. To acquire a settlement by leasing under clause III. sect. 9 of the act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 539, the lease need not be in writing and the rent need not be paid in money; it may be paid in the equivalent of money, labor or other services: Beaver v. Hartley, 11 Pa. 254; Laporte v. Hillsgrove, 95 Pa. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The reasons assigned by the learned judge below amply justify his refusal to strike out the testimony of Isaac Frain as to the receipt for rent and the entries in Hazel\u2019s book, both of which had been destroyed by fire. It is not clear that the testimony as to the declarations of Hazel was not competent upon the principle recognized in Hester v. Commonwealth, 85 Pa. 139; Zell v. Commonwealth, 94 Pa. 258; but as this testimony was not taken into consideration by the court, it is unnecessary to discuss or decide the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The assignments of error are overruled, and the proceedings and decree are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
