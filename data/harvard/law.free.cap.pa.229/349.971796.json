James Hunter died in 1902, leaving a will by which he devised his share of the land to his widow, Mary A. Hunter, the plaintiff. The controversy arose out of the construction of the will of John Galloway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">The facts are stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court, and in the report of Hunter v.

This for the purpose of showing how John Galloway himself regarded these two locations and how he designated them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-9\">This is objected to as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and an attempt to make a devise different from the will itself, and is an attempt to introduce a matter that has been heretofore ruled by the Superior Court as being incompetent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-10\">The Court: We think this evidence tends to show a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>position or declaration of testator as to the disposition made of the estate and it is inadmissible, and we therefore refuse the offer and grant an exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">Defendant offers to prove by the witness on the stand that on one occasion when John Galloway had pointed out the old coal bank near the chestnut tree, he, the witness, called John Galloway\u2019s attention to the fact that there were other openings down near the run, and that thereupon John Galloway told the witness that those openings along the run he called coal holes and that he thought anybody ought to know the difference between a coal bank and coal holes. This for the purpose of showing how John Galloway regarded these two locations on his farm and designated the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">This is objected to as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial to the matter in issue, as the witness has already testified that John Galloway called the place in the flat coal holes, and that anything additional that was said in regard to the matter is immaterial and of no use or assistance to the court. His reasons for calling them this name is immaterial, and it is an attempt to elicit testimony the effect of which will be to explain the will and give effect to a different will from that which the testator actually made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">The Court: The matter contained in the offer has been substantially testified to by the witness.

It was divided by a public road running through it from north to south, and the present controversy grows out of the following testamentary disposition of it made by Galloway in his will, executed May 23, 1879: \u201cI will and bequeath unto my nephew, James Hunter, all that portion of my farm, lying West of the road running through my farm from South to North except that portion which lies along the Brush Run all south of the old coal bank in the fiat. I will and bequeath to my nephew, William Hunter, all that portion of my farm, lying East of the road before mentioned, together with that portion lying South of the old coal bank before mentioned.\u201d James Hunter is dead, and by his will, admitted to probate in June, 1902, his interest in the farm devised to him by his uncle passed to his widow, Mary A. Hunter, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>tiff in this action. Her contention is that, at the time John Galloway executed his will and when he died, the old coal bank was on the flat or level land along Brush Run, and that she, as the devisee of her husband, is entitled to all that portion of the farm which lies north of that coal bank and west of the public road. The defendant, on the other hand, contends that at the time the will was executed there was no coal bank in the flat land near Brush Run, that the only coal bank on the farm was on the slope of a hill about a thousand feet north of Brush Run, and that he is entitled, as the devisee of his uncle, to all the land south of the coal bank on the slope of the hill and west of the public road. The case was submitted to the jury under instructions that if they found from the evidence that there was an old coal bank in the flat along Brush Run, the plaintiff\u2019s contention should prevail, and from the judgment on the verdict returned in her favor we have this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The language of the testator in devising his farm to his two nephews is entirely free from ambiguity, and his intention as to how it was to be divided between them cannot be misunderstood. James was to take all west of the public road except that portion lying along Brush Run, south of an old coal bank in the flat. He was to take all north of that coal bank and west of the road. William, in addition to getting all east of the road, was to have all west of it, south of the old coal bank. The portion west of the road excepted from the devise to James and given to William was said by the testator to lie along Brush Run and to be south of the old coal bank in the flat or level land. If there was a coal bank some distance further north on the side of a hill, the intervening space consisting of more than seven acres, it does not answer to \u201cthe\" old coal bank in the flat\u201d which the testator had in mind when he executed his will. The case of the plaintiff depended upon her ability to show that, at the time the will of her husband\u2019s uncle was executed, there was an old coal bank in the flat which the testator designated as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the point from which James was to take all the land to the north, and William all to the south. The whole situation was summed up in the following closing words of the general charge of the learned trial judge to the jury: \u201cIf you find there was an old coal bank in the flat, your verdict undoubtedly ought to be in favor of the plaintiff. If there was no old coal bank in the flat, then the plaintiff\u2019s contention falls and your verdict ought to be in favor of defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Parol testimony was admissible in this case only for the purpose of showing the existence in the flat of the monument of title fixed by the testator himself. It was not competent to show his alleged declarations fixing a different point as the dividing line, for such testimony would have raised a doubt as to his intention, which does not appear upon the face of the will. His intention as there expressed could not be clearer. It matters not that there might have been other coal banks on other portions of the farm \u2014 one, perhaps, on the hill above the flat\u2014 for the testator had himself declared that the bank in the \u201cflat\u201d should be the dividing line between the lands, and if the plaintiff showed that a coal bank was there, her case was made out. There was no other question of fact for the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">If the excluded offers which are the subjects of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth assignments of error had been allowed, the defendant might have established a will different from Galloway\u2019s written one. This, of course, could not have been permitted. In a prior ejectment between these same parties, involving the same land, in which, however, the present defendant was the plaintiff, the trial judge permitted him to prove declarations of the testator as to how he had divided the farm between his nephews, and, in holding that this was error, the Superior Court, in reversing the judgment for the plaintiff, properly said what we now adopt in dismissing the first five assignments: \u201cWhen the subject-matter of the devise contained in the will of John Galloway came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>to be ascertained there was, under the existing conditions of the testator\u2019s property, but one question to be determined: the location of the old coal bank in the flat. If there was a coal bank in the flat, the wprds which the testator had set down in his will there fixed the location of the line between the lands of James Hunter and William Hunter. If, on the other hand, there was no coal bank in the flat, then the description could only apply to the coal bank in the side of the hill. It was not competent to show by declarations of the testator made at the execution of his will, or subsequently, that he intended the devise to include something that was excluded by the terms of the will as executed. 'The modern doctrine is, that where a subject exists which satisfies the terms of the will, and to which they are perfectly applicable, there is no latent ambiguity. Evidence is only admitted dehors the will, from necessity, to explain that which would otherwise have had no operation.\u2019 This language was used by Justice Rogers in Wusthoff v. Dracourt, 3 Watts, 240, decided in 1834,- and has been recognized as authority to the present time. The testimony, admitted against the objection of the defendant, described a different line from that in the will. It was only because it did, that it was offered. The very difference, however, shows the error of the admission. The testator\u2019s line, represented by the will, gives to William Hunter all the land south of the old coal bank in the flat.' The line proposed to be established by the parol evidence, as the line intended by the testator, ran from a tree up to the coal bank on the hillside. Thus to give effect to the testimony was to change the will of the testator, and make his oral declarations his will, instead of what he had executed and published according to the forms of law, as his will. That this testimony ought not to have been admitted is clearly established by authority: Best v. Hammond, 55 Pa. 409; Apple v. Byers, 98 Pa. 479; Willard\u2019s App., 68 Pa. 327; Hancock\u2019s App., 112 Pa. 532; Woelpper\u2019s App., 126 Pa. 562; Myers v. Myers, 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 511. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>sixth and seventh specifications of error are sustained:\u201d Hunter v. Hunter, 37 Pa. Superior Ct. 311. The remaining six assignments complain of errors in a portion of the charge and in answers to points. We can discover no error in them, and the judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
