Noticing that Incashola\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and his breath smelled of alcohol, Officer Vollin administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test and Incashola scored six points, indicating alcohol impairment. Incashola was arrested and transported for a breath test. The breath test, conducted on an Intoxilyzer, indicated a blood alcohol concentration of. 129. Officer Vollin\u2019s records check reflected that Incashola had three prior convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">\u00b64 The State subsequently charged Incashola with the felony offense of operating a motor vehicle with an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more. Counsel was appointed for Incashola, he pled not guilty to the charge and a trial date was set.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">\u00b65 Incashola moved to suppress portions of both the videotape taken after his arrest and the interview form on the basis that the evidence therein was obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The District Court granted the motion and, on motion of the State, rescheduled the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u00b66 Prior to the trial date, Incashola filed a motion <em>in limine </em>contending that the breath test analysis also was inadmissible because the State could not lay a proper foundation under the Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM). He argued that, because no proper field certification was performed on the Intoxilyzer following his breath test, an inference was created under \u00a7 23.4.213(l)(i), ARM, that the Intoxilyzer was not in proper working order at the time of his breath test. The State opposed Incashola\u2019s motion, arguing that no such inference was created under subsection (l)(i) and, in any event, the field certification of the Intoxilyzer performed on April 29,1997, was considered valid for 7 days thereafter under \u00a7 23.4.213(l)(j), ARM. As a consequence, according to the State, the necessary foundation for admission of the breath test results was established. The District Court granted Incashola\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>effectively suppressing the breath test evidence. The State appealed pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-103(2)(e), MCA, which permits an appeal by the State from any court order the substantive effect of which results in suppressing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b67 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in suppressing breath test evidence based on its interpretation of an administrative rule?</p>\n<p id=\"APQ\">\u00b68  Montana closely regulates nearly all aspects of breath, blood and urine analysis procedures used to determine the alcohol concentration in a person charged with an alcohol-related driving offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 23.4.201 through 23.4.225, ARM. A defendant charged with driving under the influence of alcohol is entitled to the procedural safeguards contained in the ARM, and where the State fails to lay a proper foundation for breath test evidence by complying with those procedural safeguards, the results of the breath test analysis are inadmissible. <em>State v. Woods </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 124, 947 P.2d 62, 63 (citations omitted). In this case, the District Court excluded the breath test evidence based on its conclusion that the State could not lay the foundation required by \u00a7 23.4.213, ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b69  Whether evidence is relevant and admissible is within the broad discretion of the district court and we will not overturn the court\u2019s decision absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Woods, </em>947 P.2d at 63 (citation omitted). Where, as here, a discretionary ruling is based on a conclusion of law, we review that conclusion to determine whether the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>See State v. Pendergrass </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 129, 131, 932 P.2d 1056, 1057 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b610 Section 23.4.213, ARM, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Field Certification </em>(1) Breath analysis instruments shall be field certified for accuracy at least once every seven (7) days ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">(b) A field certification is valid when the results of the approved ethyl alcohol solution test is at target value plus or minus one hundredth (.01) grams per two hundred and ten liters....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">(i) A proper field certification prior to any subject test and a proper field certification following a subject test shall create the inference that the breath analysis instrument was in proper working order at the time of the subject test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">(j) A breath analysis instrument\u2019s field certification shall be considered valid for seven (7) days forward from the date of a proper field certification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">While the District Court did not provide a rationale for concluding that the State could not lay the necessary foundation for admission of the breath test results under \u00a7 23.4.213, ARM, it appears that the court determined that \u00a7 23.4.213(l)(i), ARM, created a conclusive negative inference in this case; that is, that the absence of a proper field certification following Incashola\u2019s breath test established that the Intoxilyzer was not in proper working order at the time of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"AsV\">\u00b611  We generally apply the same principles in construing administrative rules as are applicable to our interpretation of statutes. <em>Bean v. State Bd. of Labor Appeals </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 253, 257, 891 P.2d 516, 518-19 (citation omitted). The proper interpretation is first to be determined according to the language therein. <em>Bean, </em>270 Mont. at 257, 891 P.2d at 519. We simply ascertain and declare what is in terms or substance contained in the rule, neither inserting what has been omitted or omitting what has been inserted. Where several provisions or particulars are at issue, we are obligated to construe them to give effect to all, if possible. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\u00b612  We look, then, to the language contained in \u00a7 23.4.213, ARM, and the facts of this case to determine whether the District Court erred in implicitly determining that subsection (l)(i) rendered the breath test results inadmissible for lack of foundation. Section 23.4.213(l)(i), ARM, provides that a proper field certification both before and after the breath test at issue creates an inference that the testing instrument was in proper working order at the time of the test. The language is clear and unambiguous in creating an inference in favor of the instrument being in proper working order under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>specified circumstances. Equally clear in this case is that a proper field certification of the Intoxilyzer occurred on April 29,1997, but that the certification effort on May 4, two days after Incashola\u2019s breath test, established that the Intoxilyzer was not working properly. Therefore, no proper field certification occurred after Incashola\u2019s test and, as a result, no inference was created under \u00a7 23.4.213(l)(i), ARM, that the Intoxilyzer was in proper working order.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b613 At the same time, however, nothing in \u00a7 23.4.213(l)(i), ARM, creates a negative inference \u2014 much less the conclusive negative inference apparently ascribed to it by the District Court \u2014 that, absent a proper field certification both before and after the breath test at issue, the instrument was <em>not </em>in proper working order. To read such a provision into the rule is to ignore the language actually contained therein and to insert language omitted from the rule in derogation of our obligation to refrain from doing so. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b614  Moreover, the District Court\u2019s implicit determination that the absence of a proper field certification after Incashola\u2019s breath test rendered the breath test results inadmissible ignores the intended effect of the inference created under \u00a7 23.4.213(l)(i), ARM, when proper field certifications do occur both before and after the breath test at issue. An \u201cinference\u201d is \u201ca deduction which the trier of fact may make from the evidence.\u201d Section 26-1-501, MCA. Thus, it is clear that the inference created by \u00a7 23.4.213(l)(i), ARM, is to be utilized by a trier of fact \u2014 at the appropriate stage in the proceedings \u2014 in determining whether the testing instrument was in proper working order. In other words, if the evidence establishes that proper field certifications were conducted both before and after the breath test at issue, the trier of fact must infer that the Intoxilyzer was in proper working order. Absent such evidence, no inference is created under \u00a7 23.4.213(l)(i), ARM, that the instrument either was or was not in proper working order.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u00b6 15  In any event, however, an inference is a deduction to be made from the evidence and nothing more. Consequently, even if the evidence established proper field certifications before and after the breath test at issue, other evidence could be introduced in an effort to undermine the persuasiveness of the proper field certification evidence and the inference to be drawn therefrom and to establish that the testing instrument was not in proper working order. Likewise, absent evidence of a proper post-breath test field certification, other evidence can be introduced in an effort to prove to the trier of fact that the testing instrument was operating properly at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>breath test at issue. By its terms, then, \u00a7 23.4.213(l)(i), ARM, is not a foundational requirement for the admissibility of breath test results.</p>\n<p id=\"Agv\">\u00b616  Furthermore, to conclude that subsection (l)(i) is a foundational requirement for admissibility would judicially nullify subsection (l)(j) of \u00a7 23.4.213, ARM, which provides that a field certification is to be considered valid for 7 days forward from the date of the test. When, as here, several provisions of a statute or rule are at issue, we are obligated to construe them to give effect to all of the provisions if possible. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. Read together, the two subsections at issue here are not a model of clarity. Having determined above that subsection (l)(i) relates to the later evidentiary stage of the proceeding, however, we conclude here that \u00a7 23.4.213(l)(j), ARM, is a foundational requirement for admissibility of breath test results. A proper field certification of the testing instrument performed within 7 days before the test at issue constitutes an adequate foundation for admissibility of the breath test results; the absence of such a proper field certification renders the breath test results inadmissible for lack of foundation. Here, the record establishes that a proper field certification was conducted on April 29, 1997, less than 7 days prior to Incashola\u2019s breath test on May 2, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b617  Incashola argues, however, that subsection (l)(i) of \u00a7 23.4.213, ARM, is a more specific provision than subsection (l)(j). From that premise, he contends that \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA, which provides that when a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the particular provision controls, and our cases thereunder, require us to conclude that the District Court\u2019s interpretation of subsection (l)(i) is correct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">\u00b618 We determined above that subsection (l)(i) is an evidentiary stage provision, while subsection (l)(j) is a foundational requirement for admissibility. As a result, the two provisions are not a general and particular provision relating to the same matter, but are provisions relating to different stages of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">\u00b619 We conclude that the District Court erred in interpreting \u00a7 23.4.213, ARM, and we further conclude that the State laid the necessary foundation for the admission of the breath test results in this case. As discussed, both parties are free to offer other evidence at trial with regard to whether the Intoxilyzer was in proper working order on the date of Incashola\u2019s breath test. We hold that the District Court abused its discretion in granting Incashola\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u00b620 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
