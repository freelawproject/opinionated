We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">\u00b62 On August 25,1997, Liberty filed in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court a Petition for Hearing naming the State Fund as the respondent. In its petition, Liberty alleged that it was the workers\u2019 compensation carrier for Brand S Lumber (Brand S). According to Liberty, Brand S subcontracted with McNeilly Line Logging (McNeilly) for McNeilly to provide Brand S with logs. On November 25, 1994, the State Fund wrote to Brand S stating that McNeilly had applied for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>coverage with the State Fund and that \u201cwe will also notify you if cancellation procedures are initiated for any reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\">\u00b63 Liberty\u2019s petition also alleged that on September 25, 1995, McNeilly\u2019s employee, Durwood Park (Park), was injured. Brand S and Liberty then discovered that McNeilly was without workers\u2019 compensation insurance. As a result, Liberty began paying benefits to Park pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-405, MCA. Basically, this statute requires that an employer (in this case Brand S) who contracts with an independent contractor (McNeilly) is liable for payment of benefits to the employees of the independent contractor (Park) if the independent contractor has not properly complied with the coverage requirements of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b64 Liberty alleged that prior to Park\u2019s injury the State Fund never notified Brand S that it (the State Fund) did not provide coverage for McNeilly. Liberty also alleged that State Fund\u2019s letter of November 25, 1994, was provided to Brand S for its guidance in its business transactions and that the statement in the letter referred to above was a false statement or, alternatively, made without the reasonable exercise of care or competence in obtaining or communicating this information. Liberty\u2019s petition claimed that State Fund provided the information in its letter to Brand S for its benefit and guidance; that State Fund knew or was charged with knowing that Brand S intended to rely on that information; and that State Fund failed to observe a duty of care to Brand S in supplying information for use in commercial transactions. Finally, Liberty alleged that it demanded that State Fund accept liability and reimburse Liberty for money paid to Park and that State Fund refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b65 In response to Liberty\u2019s petition, State Fund moved to dismiss on the ground that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide Liberty\u2019s cause of action because it sounded in tort. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court agreed and dismissed Liberty\u2019s petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b66 The sole issue on appeal is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear and determine Liberty\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u00b67  When deciding a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a trial court must determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>complaint states facts that, if true, would vest the court with subject matter jurisdiction. This conclusion is a question of law. <em>Poteat v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 117, 119, 918 P.2d 677, 679 (citations omitted). Our review of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law is plenary; we simply determine whether its legal conclusions are correct. <em>Heath v. Montana Municipal Ins. Authority, </em>1998 MT 111, \u00b6 9, 288 Mont. 463, \u00b6 9, 959 P.2d 480, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>Loss v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 80, 81, 936 P.2d 313, 314).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b68 Liberty contends that the allegations in its petition state a claim under the holding in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating Service v. HKM Assoc. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 494, 878 P.2d 248 (adopting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 (1977) (information negligently supplied for the guidance of others)) and Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 551 (1977) (liability for non-disclosure). Furthermore, Liberty concedes that \u201c[ujndeniably [its] theory \u2018sounds in tort.\u2019 \u201d Notwithstanding, Liberty maintains that the underlying subject matter of its dispute with the State Fund is the State Fund\u2019s alleged liability for the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and that, accordingly, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court has subject matter jurisdiction of its cause of action. We agree that Liberty\u2019s cause of action sounds in tort; we disagree, however, with Liberty\u2019s conclusion that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court has jurisdiction of this cause nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b69 The jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is set forth in \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, (1995), which, in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">Petition to workers\u2019 compensation judge. A claimant or an insurer who has a dispute concerning <em>any benefits under chapter 71 of this title </em>may petition the workers\u2019 compensation judge for a determination of the dispute after satisfying dispute resolution requirements otherwise provided in this chapter [at \u00a7 39-71-2401, MCA], [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u00b610  Even though the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court has broad jurisdictional powers over disputes under the Act, <em>see State ex rel. Uninsured Emp. Fund v. Hunt </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 514, 518-19, 625 P.2d 539, 541-42, and <em>Wunderlich v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 404, 411, 892 P.2d 563, 567-68, we have never gone so far as to interpret the court\u2019s jurisdiction to encompass common law tort actions. In this regard, we agree with the rationale articulated by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court in dismissing Liberty\u2019s petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>While the jurisdiction of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Court] extends to any matter relating to benefits, including claims between insurers to determine which of them is liable to a claimant, <em>Belton v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co, </em>202 Mont. 384, 658 P.2d 405 (1983), no decision of which [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court] is aware has ever held or even suggested that [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court] has jurisdiction over tort actions, even though the tort action might result in a judgment requiring another party to pay, as damages, the amount which an insurer has paid to a claimant under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">\u00b611  The jurisdictional parameters of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court are defined by statute as interpreted, from time to time, by the decisions of this Court. Section 39-71-2905, MCA, restricts the jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to disputes concerning \u201cany benefits under chapter 71\u201d of Title 39. Our role is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained in a statute and not to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. Clearly, the plain language of this statute does not empower the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to hear or decide common law tort actions. Indeed, jurisdiction over \u201call civil matters and cases at law and in equity\u201d \u2014 including actions sounding in tort \u2014 resides in this State\u2019s courts of general jurisdiction, the district courts. Art. VII, Sec. 4, Mont. Const. Notwithstanding how Liberty may choose to arbitrarily characterize its claims against State Fund, its cause of action is substantively one for damages based upon tort theories of recovery and is not a dispute over benefits payable under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b6 12 We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly determined that, as matter of law, it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Liberty\u2019s cause of action. Accordingly, the court\u2019s dismissal of Liberty\u2019s petition is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b503-5\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, GRAY, HUNT and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
