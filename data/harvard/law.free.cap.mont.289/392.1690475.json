We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court had jurisdiction to sentence LaPier for a felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">\u00b63 LaPier was charged in the District Court with the offenses of partner or family member assault and violation of an order of protection. The State of Montana (State) alleged that both charges were third offenses and, therefore, felonies pursuant to statutory enhancement provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">\u00b64 A jury found LaPier not guilty of assault, but guilty of violating an order of protection. The District Court ordered a presentence investigation report, which was prepared by adult parole and probation officer John J. Riley (Riley), and held a sentencing hearing. Riley testified that LaPier had two prior convictions for the offense of violating a protective order \u2014 one in the justice court and one in the police court. LaPier challenged the existence of the justice court conviction and the conviction was established via a certified copy of the judgment in that case. Riley recommended that LaPier be sentenced to the maximum term of imprisonment available for the offense but he did not offer a recommendation on further sentencing in the event the District Court determined LaPier to be a persistent felony offender. LaPier also made a lengthy statement, at the end of the sentencing hearing, that he believed he was wrongfully convicted and should not be sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tenced to a term of incarceration in addition to the time already served in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b65 The District Court determined that LaPier was guilty of the felony offense of violation of a protective order. It fined him $2,000, sentenced him to a two-year term of imprisonment at the Montana State Prison and added a five-year term for persistent felony offender, to run consecutively to the sentence imposed for the underlying offense. LaPier also was credited for time served. The District Court entered judgment accordingly and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b66 Did the District Court have jurisdiction to sentence LaPier for the felony offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b67 Based on the information in the presentence investigation report and Riley\u2019s testimony at the sentencing hearing, the District Court determined that LaPier was guilty of the felony offense of violation of a protective order because it was his third such offense. The court sentenced LaPier accordingly and LaPier contends that the court lacked jurisdiction to do so because one of the prior convictions was constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u00b68  Whether a prior conviction can be used to enhance a criminal sentence is a question of law. <em>State v. Hansen </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 321, 323, 903 P.2d 194, 195. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Hansen, </em>273 Mont. at 323, 903 P.2d at 195 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\u00b69  Before turning to the issue raised by LaPier, we address a threshold issue raised by the State, namely, whether this case is properly before us. The State contends that, because LaPier did not raise the issue of whether his police court conviction was constitutionally infirm in the District Court, he may not raise it for the first time on appeal. This contention is without merit. Notwithstanding the general rule that this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal <em>(see Day v. Payne </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 273, 276, 929 P.2d 864, 866 (citation omitted)), certain jurisdictional issues constitute an exception to that general rule. Lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a nonwaivable defect which may be raised at any stage of the proceedings. <em>See, e.g., State v. Moorman </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 330, 336, 928 P.2d 145, 148 (citation omitted); \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA. Thus, we turn to the issue raised by LaPier of whether the District Court had jurisdiction to sentence him for the felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">\u00b6 10  The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>accused the fundamental right to the assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Okland </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 10, 14, 941 P.2d 431, 433 (citations omitted). The fundamental right extends only to cases in which a sentence of imprisonment is actually imposed. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 14, 941 P.2d at 433 (citations omitted). Moreover, an accused may waive the right to counsel, but a waiver requires a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a known right. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 14, 941 P.2d at 433 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b611  It has long been established in Montana that a constitutionally infirm conviction cannot be used to support an enhanced punishment. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 15, 941 P.2d at 434 <em>(citing Lewis v. State </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 460, 463, 457 P.2d 765, 766). A rebuttable presumption of regularity attaches to prior convictions during a collateral attack, however, and \u201ca defendant who challenges the validity of his prior conviction during a collateral attack has the burden of producing direct evidence of its invalidity.\u201d <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 18, 941 P.2d at 436. If the defendant comes forward with such direct evidence, the burden shifts to the State to \u201cproduce direct evidence and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior conviction was not entered in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 18, 941 P.2d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b6 12  Here, LaPier contends that his police court conviction of violating an order of protection was constitutionally infirm because he was not represented by counsel and did not waive the right to counsel. He concedes that a rebuttable presumption of regularity attaches to that conviction under <em>Okland. </em>He asserts, however, that he produced direct evidence of the constitutional infirmity during his cross-examination of Riley at the sentencing hearing and that the State did not meet its burden thereafter of proving that the prior conviction was not entered in violation of his rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b613 The judgment in LaPier\u2019s police court case reflected that he was sentenced to a term of six months in the county jail, thus triggering his right to assistance of counsel \u2014 absent a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right \u2014 as discussed above. The evidence of constitutional infirmity in his police court conviction on which LaPier relies is the following exchange regarding the judgment in that case between his counsel and Riley at the sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">Q. Is there anything that shows a waiver of rights to an attorney or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">A. No, sir, not on this document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u00b6 14 According to LaPier, the absence of a waiver of right to counsel on the face of the judgment is direct evidence that the police court conviction was invalid for lack of a waiver. LaPier misreads our cases on the presumption of regularity and the direct evidence necessary to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b615 In <em>Okland, </em>we clarified that the presumption of regularity which attaches to prior convictions during a collateral attack attaches even in the absence of a transcript or record. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 18, 941 P.2d at 436. Here, the absence of a waiver of the right to counsel on the face of the judgment in the police court proceeding is merely the absence of part of the record and, under <em>Okland, </em>the rebuttable presumption of regularity attaches notwithstanding such an absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b616 Nor is the \u201cabsence of a waiver\u201d evidence on which LaPier relies the direct evidence we have held sufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity. In <em>Okland, </em>the defendant\u2019s evidence regarding the city court conviction being collaterally attacked established that he could not afford an attorney; that he requested \u2014 but was not provided \u2014 an attorney; that he was convicted without the assistance of counsel; and that he was imprisoned for his uncounseled conviction. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 19, 941 P.2d at 436-37. We held that the evidence was direct evidence of constitutional infirmity in the earlier proceeding sufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 19-20, 941 P.2d at 437. Similarly, in <em>State v. Jenni </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 21, 25, 938 P.2d 1318, 1320-21, the defendant submitted an affidavit stating that, in two earlier driving under the influence cases injustice court, he was neither represented by counsel nor informed that counsel would be appointed if he could not afford one; that he was convicted without the assistance of counsel; and that he was actually imprisoned as a result of his uncounseled convictions. Again, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s direct evidence of a constitutional infirmity in the earlier proceedings rebutted the presumption of regularity. <em>Jenni, </em>283 Mont. at 25, 938 P.2d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b6 17  In the case presently before us, LaPier submitted no affidavit containing direct evidence of a constitutional infirmity in his police court proceeding. Nor did he advance such testimony, or address the alleged constitutional infirmity in that proceeding, during his oral statement at the sentencing hearing. The exchange between his counsel and Riley at the sentencing hearing simply does not consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>tute direct evidence of a constitutional infirmity in the police court conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b618 Finally, we observe that, while the arguments presented are different, this case is substantially similar to <em>State v. Perry </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 34, 938 P.2d 1325. There, the defendant contended that waiver of the right to counsel cannot be presumed from a silent record, and we reiterated our <em>Okland </em>determination that a presumption of regularity attaches to prior convictions during a collateral attack even in the absence of a transcript or record. <em>Perry, </em>283 Mont. at 36-37, 938 P.2d at 1327 (citation omitted). Here, while LaPier argues that the absence of a record waiver of the right to counsel is direct evidence of a constitutional infirmity, his argument boils down to a contention that a record silent with regard to a waiver of the right to counsel renders a prior conviction invalid. The law clearly is otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b619  We conclude that LaPier failed to present any direct evidence to establish that his constitutional rights were violated in the police court proceeding. Thus, we further conclude that he failed to rebut the presumption of regularity and, for that reason, the State had no further burden of proof regarding the regularity of the conviction in that proceeding. We hold, accordingly, that the District Court had jurisdiction to sentence LaPier for the felony offense of violating an order of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
