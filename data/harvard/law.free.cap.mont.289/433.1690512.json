Did the District Court err in permitting Nick Burwell and Katie Crepeau to testify for the State?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err in permitting Nick Burwell to refresh his memory while testifying?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-17\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court err in denying Hayworth\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-19\">\u00b68 6. Did the District Court err in denying Hayworth the opportunity to call attorneys Toni Marra and Scott Albers as rebuttal witnesses?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b69 On the afternoon of August 12,1995, Hayworth met up with Robert Bradford and Brian Kunesh, the victims in this case. Bradford was attempting to locate some car stereo equipment, and asked if Hayworth knew where he could find some car speakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b610 Shortly after his encounter with Bradford and Kunesh, Hayworth gave an acquaintance of his, Nick Burwell, a ride to the trailer park where co-defendant Lloyd Maier resided. Burwell told Hayworth that someone named Tray had made death threats against Hayworth. Burwell and Hayworth then visited with Maier in his trailer and engaged in a conversation, the precise content of which is disputed by the various witnesses in this case. At some point during their conversation, however, it is clear that Maier learned of the threats made against Hayworth by Tray.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b611 Shortly thereafter, Burwell asked Hayworth for a ride to the home of his friend, Shadow Mogensen. Before the three departed for Mogensen\u2019s, Maier loaded his SKS assault rifle and Burwell placed it in Hayworth\u2019s vehicle. With Hayworth behind the wheel, the three drove to Mogensen\u2019s home. When they arrived, Hayworth went into the house to use the telephone, and Mogensen came out to the vehicle to speak with Maier. At some point, after everyone had entered the house, Mogensen asked Burwell, Hayworth, and Maier to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b612 As they pulled away from Mogensen\u2019s house, Hayworth was driving and Maier was in the van\u2019s front passenger seat. Shortly thereafter, they passed Bradford and Kunesh\u2019s vehicle approaching from the opposite direction. Burwell testified that he heard Hayworth say to Maier, \u201cThere\u2019s Bradford, do you want to get him?\u201d and that Maier responded affirmatively. Hayworth then sped up, made a U-turn and pulled up next to the car driven by Bradford. One witness testified that Hayworth was driving so quickly that the van fishtailed as it approached Bradford\u2019s vehicle. Once Hayworth had stopped the van, Maier fired several shots at the vehicle, injuring both Bradford and Kunesh.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b613 On August 15,1995, Great Falls police questioned Maier about the incident. Maier related his version of the events which had transpired on August 12,1995, and told police that Hayworth could verify his story. Maier then left the police station, and returned later that afternoon with Hayworth. Police placed Maier and Hayworth in separate rooms for questioning. Hayworth was first questioned by Officer Richard Hollis, who testified that he advised Hayworth of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Miranda </em>rights and that Hayworth indicated he understood those rights and was willing to answer questions. Hayworth, in contrast, testified that Hollis did not explain his <em>Miranda </em>rights, but simply presented him with a form and instructed him to sign it prior to questioning. The State did not produce a written waiver in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b614 During his interview with Officer Hollis, Hayworth indicated that Burwell had fired the shots which injured Bradford and Kunesh. After Officer Hollis finished questioning Hayworth, he left the room and spoke with Officer Steffens who had just finished questioning Maier. Officer Hollis then proceeded to interview Maier, while Officer Steffens began questioning Hayworth. Officer Steffens did not advise Hayworth of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and did not ask Officer Hollis whether had already Mirandized Hayworth. Confronted with inconsistencies between his and Maier\u2019s version of events, Hayworth altered his explanation of events and told Officer Steffens that Maier had in fact fired the shots which injured Bradford and Kunesh. After Hayworth had confessed his involvement in the events of August 12, 1995, to Officer Steffens, Officer Hollis returned to interview Hayworth again. Officer Hollis did not give Hayworth a full <em>Miranda </em>warning, but instead advised him that he was still under his rights. When Officer Hollis finished his questioning, he arrested Hayworth on an outstanding warrant for a probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b615 By way of an information filed in the Eighth Judicial District Court on August 16,1995, Hayworth was charged with two counts of attempted deliberate homicide by accountability, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-103(1), 45-2-302(3), and 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA (1993). Hayworth was tried before a jury on March 19-22, 1996, and found guilty of both counts. On June 25,1996, the District Court sentenced Hayworth to sixty years in Montana State Prison on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently. Hayworth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\u00b616  Did the District Court err in denying Hayworth\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of his confession?</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">\u00b617 Prior to trial, Hayworth filed a motion to suppress evidence of the \u201cconfession and/or admission,\u201d (hereinafter confession) he made during questioning by Officers Hollis and Steffens, on the grounds that it was given involuntarily. Following a suppression hearing, the District Court denied Hayworth\u2019s motion in a March 19,1996, order. Looking to the totality of the circumstances, the court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Hayworth \u201cwas given his <em>Miranda </em>rights and understood them, and that he made a knowing waiver thereof before giving his confession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADg\">\u00b618 On appeal, Hayworth argues the court erred in finding he had been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and erred in finding he knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived those rights before giving his confession. Hayworth asserts the State failed to introduce evidence of the particular <em>Miranda </em>rights given, and failed to introduce a written waiver demonstrating Hayworth\u2019s decision to waive those rights. Moreover, Hayworth argues the State failed to rebut his assertion that \u201che was enticed before he made any incriminating statement to Detective Steffens.\u201d In conclusion, Hayworth argues the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of his confession \u201cbecause it resulted from a custodial interrogation where he was not properly Mirandized and the State failed to rebut testimony of involuntariness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b619 In response, the State first argues that, because Hayworth voluntarily appeared at the police station, he was not in custody at the time of his interrogation, and law enforcement officers were thus under no obligation to advise him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Even assuming Hayworth was in custody, however, the State argues the District Court properly looked to the totality of the circumstances before finding that Hayworth had been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and agreed to waive them before making a voluntary confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b620  We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Siegal </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 250, 257, 934 P.2d 176, 180 (citing <em>State v. Williams </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 459, 462, 904 P.2d 1019, 1021; State <em>v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 188, 860 P.2d 89, 94). We have recognized that \u201cwhen a defendant raises the question of voluntariness, the State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the confession or admission was voluntarily obtained.\u201d <em>State v. Mayes </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 358, 376, 825 P.2d 1196, 1208; \u00a7 46-13-301(2), MCA. The question of whether a defendant has given a voluntary confession \u201cis largely a factual determination that is within the discretion of the district court.\u201d State <em>v. Grey </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 206, 209, 907 P.2d 951, 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b621  We have held that, in making that factual determination, the district court \u201cmust take into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d State <em>v. Loh </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 460, 475, 914 P.2d 592, 601. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Among the factors which the court must consider when evaluating the totality of the circumstances are the defendant\u2019s age and level of education, the interrogation technique used, whether the defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system and police interrogation, the defendant\u2019s background and experience, and the defendant\u2019s demeanor, coherence, articulateness, and capacity to make full use of his faculties. <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 475-76, 914 P.2d at 601-02; <em>State v. Hermes </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 446, 450, 904 P.2d 587, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b622 In the present case, the District Court looked to the totality of the circumstances surrounding Hayworth\u2019s confession, and found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">Defendant Marty Hayworth is approximately thirty-three (33) years old. He understands English and is of average intelligence. He has had numerous prior contacts with the criminal justice system, and has been given Miranda warnings on prior occasions. The Court finds that the police officers\u2019 testimony was credible and that the Defendant\u2019s was not. Accordingly, the Court believes that Defendant was given his Miranda rights and understood them, and that he made a knowing waiver thereof before giving his confession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b623 At the suppression hearing, Hayworth testified that Officer Hollis gave him a form and told him to sign it so the officers could speak to him, but asserted he was not given an opportunity to read it. Moreover, when asked if law enforcement officers explained his rights to him, Hayworth responded, \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\u00b624 Although Hayworth argues he was not informed of his rights, we conclude otherwise and hold the record contains substantial evidence which supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Hayworth \u201cwas given his <em>Miranda </em>rights and understood them.\u201d For example, at the suppression hearing Officer Hollis testified that he did in fact advise Hayworth of his <em>Miranda </em>rights when \u201che came in the office and the interview started.\u201d Also, Officer Hollis testified that Hayworth appeared to understand those warnings, and was able to respond appropriately to his questions. Although Hayworth asserted he had not slept for a prolonged period of time and was under the influence of drugs at the time of the questioning, Officers Hollis, Steffens, and Jim Wells all testified that Hayworth did not appear to be tired or under the influence of drugs. Furthermore, as the District Court found, the record indicates that Hayworth was thirty-three years, old at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>time, of average intelligence, and had had numerous prior contacts with the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b625 Based on the foregoing, and having considered the totality of the circumstances surrounding Hayworth\u2019s confession, we conclude that substantial evidence exists to support the District Court\u2019s finding that the State met its burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that Hayworth made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b626  Did the District Court err in denying Hayworth\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of a discussion between Hayworth and co-defendant Lloyd Maier?</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\u00b627 On the first day of his March 19,1996, trial, Hayworth filed a motion in limine asking that the court issue an order prohibiting the State \u201cfrom referring to any and all of Defendant\u2019s prior acts, including drug activity.\u201d More specifically, defense counsel clarified prior to jury selection that she would object to any attempts by the State to introduce evidence of statements allegedly made by Hayworth on the day of the crime regarding his intent to kill a man known as Big Rich, and one known as Tray. Hayworth argued that any evidence of his intent to kill either Big Rich or Tray was not part of the <em>res gestae </em>and, therefore, was inadmissible. The State, in contrast, argued that any such statements were admissible as part of the <em>res gestae. </em>After hearing argument by the parties, the District Court ruled from the bench, ordering that it would \u201cdeny the motion in limine\u201d and \u201callow the State to introduce this evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">\u00b628  As with any evidentiary ruling, we review the district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Gollehon </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 293, 301, 864 P.2d 1257, 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">\u00b629 On appeal, Hayworth argues it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to deny his motion in limine and admit \u201cevidence regarding any potential plan to kill Tray or Big Rich Rustvold, that may have been discussed at Maier\u2019s trailer earlier on the day that Bradford and Kunesh were shot.\u201d Hayworth first argues evidence that he discussed killing anyone other than the victims in this case was not relevant, and was thus inadmissible. Even if relevant, Hayworth asserts, such evidence \u201cwas extremely prejudicial and minutely probative and therefore, should have been excluded at trial.\u201d Hayworth also argues any evidence that he discussed killing Tray or Big Rich was wholly independent of, and unrelated to the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>charged, and as such, was not part of the <em>res gestae. </em>Finally, Hayworth asserts for the first time on appeal that any evidence regarding a plan to kill Big Rich was not properly corroborated and, therefore, was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b630 The State, in response, asserts that \u201c[ejvidence of Hayworth\u2019s and Maier\u2019s discussions about killing Tray, Rustvold, and Bradford immediately prior to the loading of the weapon and traveling to Shadow Mogensen\u2019s house was properly admitted as part of the <em>res gestae.\u201d </em>The State argues the challenged evidence was relevant as well as probative, and \u201cwas clearly part and parcel of the same criminal offense with which [Hayworth] was charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b631  We have held that \u201cthe State is entitled to present the entire <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime charged, including matters closely related to the offense and explanatory of the crime.\u201d <em>State v. Monaco </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 221, 226, 921 P.2d 863, 866. Under the concept of <em>corpus delicti, </em>\u201c[ejvidence of acts which are inextricably or inseparably linked with the crime charged is admissible without regard to the rules governing\u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Romero </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 431, 438, 730 P.2d 1157, 1162. Additionally, we have recognized that \u201cadmissibility is predicated on the jury\u2019s right to hear what transgressed immediately prior and subsequent to the commission of the offense charged, so that they may evaluate the evidence in the context in which the criminal act occurred.\u201d <em>State v. Moore </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 241, 246, 836 P.2d 604, 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b632  In <em>State v. Wing </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 215, 224, 870 P.2d 1368, 1374, we recognized that \u201c[tjhe concepts embraced by the term <em>res gestae </em>are included within the codification of that common law doctrine ... referred to as the \u2018transaction\u2019 rule.\u201d We clarified that \u201c[w]hether an act is referred to as part of the <em>res gestae </em>or as part of the \u2018transaction,\u2019 that act is evidence which is part of the same litigated event.\u201d <em>Wing, </em>264 Mont. at 224, 870 P.2d at 1374. It is well established \u201cthat evidence which tends to explain circumstances surrounding the charged offense is relevant, probative and competent.\u201d <em>Wing, </em>264 Mont. at 225, 870 P.2d at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b633 Although Hayworth argues otherwise, we conclude evidence of a discussion between Hayworth and Maier in which the two discussed a plan to kill Tray or Big Rich is clearly a part of the <em>res gestae </em>and <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime charged. The record indicates that the discussion at issue took place just prior to the time Hayworth and his companions drove into town with a loaded assault rifle. The State was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>entitled to explain the circumstances surrounding the charged offense by introducing evidence of that conversation. It was not error for the District Court to allow the State to introduce evidence of \u201cwhat transgressed immediately prior ... to the commission of the offense,\u201d so that the jury could \u201cevaluate the evidence in the context in which the criminal act occurred.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>254 Mont. at 246, 836 P.2d at 607. Based on the foregoing, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting, as part of the <em>res gestae </em>or <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime charged, evidence of a discussion between Hayworth and Maier in which the two discussed a plan to kill Tray and Big Rich.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b634  Did the District Court err in permitting Nick Burwell and Katie Crepeau to testify for the State?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u00b635 At trial, Hayworth objected to the State calling Nick Burwell and Katie Crepeau as witnesses on the grounds that the State had failed to provide him with formal written notice of its intent to do so. The District Court overruled Hayworth\u2019s objections, and permitted both witnesses to testify. On appeal, Hayworth asserts the State\u2019s failure to provide him with formal written notice of its intent to call Crepeau and Burwell as witnesses caused him \u201cgreat[] prejudice.\u201d The State, in response, asserts \u201c[tjhere was no surprise, no prejudice to the defense, and no abuse of discretion\u201d by the District Court in permitting the two witnesses to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u00b636  We review the district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Liddell </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 180, 190, 685 P.2d 918,924.</p>\n<p id=\"Aig\">\u00b637 The record indeed indicates that the State failed to provide Hayworth with formal written notice of its intent to call Crepeau as a witness. Hayworth objected to the State\u2019s initial attempts to call Crepeau to the stand on the second day of trial. The State conceded that, although it had served Hayworth\u2019s co-defendant with notice of its endorsement of Crepeau, it had failed to similarly provide Hayworth with formal notice of its intent to call her as a witness. The prosecutor indicated that she had, however, \u201cpersonally talked to the defense and given them these people and told them who we were calling.\u201d In contrast, Hayworth\u2019s counsel maintained that she \u201cnever knew about Katie Crepeau.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">\u00b638 By way of resolution, the District Court suggested that the State call Crepeau \u201cat a different time,\u201d thereby giving Hayworth\u2019s counsel the opportunity to interview the witness. Hayworth voiced no objection to the remedy proposed by the court, and indeed inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>viewed Crepeau before the State called her to testify. After having an opportunity to interview her, Hayworth did not object when the State called Crepeau to the stand. We additionally note that, although Hayworth asserts he did not learn of Crepeau\u2019s existence until the second day of trial, the State\u2019s affidavit in support of its motion for leave to file the information in this case identified Crepeau and described her involvement in the events of August 12, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b639 In light of the foregoing, we conclude the State\u2019s failure to provide Hayworth with formal written notice of its intent to call Crepeau as a witness did not prejudice the defendant, and conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Crepeau to testify on behalf of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b640 At trial, Hayworth similarly objected to the State calling Burwell as a witness \u201cbecause, again, he was not formally endorsed as a witness in this case.\u201d In response, the prosecutor argued that Hayworth had known for months that Burwell was going to testify and had in fact interviewed Burwell in anticipation of trial. Moreover, the prosecutor represented to the court that she had \u201cpersonally discussed the fact that [Burwell] was going to be a witness in this matter\u201d with Hayworth\u2019s defense counsel. Thus, although the prosecutor conceded the State had failed to provide Hayworth with formal written notice of its intent to call Burwell as a witness, she argued the State\u2019s intent to call him was not \u201cin any way any type of a surprise\u201d to Hayworth\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b641 As demonstrated by the following exchange between Hayworth\u2019s counsel and the presiding judge, the record indicates Hayworth was not prejudiced by the court\u2019s decision to allow Burwell\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">Q: [The court]: Are you telling me that Mr. Albers didn\u2019t interview this guy in anticipation of trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">A: [Hayworth\u2019s counsel]: I\u2019m saying we\u2019ve \u2014 I guess I can\u2019t say why he interviewed him. I suspect he knew he was a possible witness in this case. But we\u2019ve never got any formal notice that he was going to be called.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">Q: I understand. So the objection is you didn\u2019t receive a formal written notice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">Q: Are you claiming prejudice if he testifies now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">A: We would claim prejudice in light \u2014 I think we have a right to stand by the rules of procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Q: I understand that. I\u2019m not obj ecting to your making \u2014 I\u2019m not quarreling with your making the objection.

Burwell acknowledged giving the statement, and agreed that looking at that statement would enable him to better remember what happened on the day of the crime. The prosecutor then asked Burwell to read to himself a portion of the transcript from the taped statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">\u00b645 Hayworth objected to the prosecutor \u201cshowing the statement before she asks questions,\u201d asserting that \u201cthe proper method is to ask questions [and] then show it to him.\u201d The court noted that Hayworth had \u201calready been asked a question,\u201d and accordingly overruled Hayworth\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">\u00b646 On appeal, Hayworth argues the District Court erred in permitting Burwell to refresh his recollection at all, and erred in permitting the State to introduce portions of Burwell\u2019s statement into evidence. Review of the record indicates that Hayworth failed to specifically raise either of these objections at trial. Because he failed to properly preserve these precise objections at trial, Hayworth is precluded from now raising them for the first time on appeal. <em>See, e.g., State v. Swoboda </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 479, 481, 918 P.2d 296, 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">\u00b647 Did the District Court err in denying Hayworth\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u00b648 Hayworth orally moved for a directed verdict at the close of the State\u2019s case, asserting the State had failed to demonstrate that he \u201cpurposely and knowingly turned that car around with the intent of facilitating the shooting of Mr. Bradford and Kunesh.\u201d Hayworth asserted that, because the State\u2019s case rested almost entirely upon the uncorroborated \u201ctestimony of codefendants or coconspirators,\u201d he was entitled to a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b649 The State opposed Hayworth\u2019s motion, instead arguing there was ample \u201cevidence before the jury to substantiate the elements of the crime\u201d charged. The court agreed, and denied Hayworth\u2019s motion on the grounds that there was \u201csufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b650  A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for a directed verdict lies within its sound discretion and will not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>State v. Keating </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 463, 476-78, 949 P.2d 251, 260, 54 St. Rep. 1250, 1255. It is well established that \u201cwe review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a directed verdict to determine whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Keating, </em>285 Mont. 477, 949 P.2d at 260, (quoting <em>State v. Romannose </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 84, 88, 931 P.2d 1304, 1307).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b651 On appeal, Hayworth argues the primary evidence connecting him to the commission of the crimes charged is that of his own confession, as well as that contained in Burwell\u2019s \u201caccomplice\u201d testimony. Alleging the State failed to introduce evidence which corroborated either his own confession or Burwell\u2019s testimony, Hayworth contends there was insufficient evidence to go to the jury and asserts the court thus erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u00b652  With respect to the State\u2019s ability to rely upon evidence of Hayworth\u2019s confession, \u00a7 46-16-215, MCA, provides that \u201c[b]efore an extrajudicial confession of the defendant to the crime charged may be admitted into evidence, the prosecution shall introduce independent evidence tending to establish the commission of the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZO\">\u00b653 We have held that the plain language of \u00a7 46-16-215, MCA, \u201crequires only that the prosecution present independent evidence tending to establish that the crime was committed, not that the defendant committed it.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 236, 244-45, 924 P.2d 1304, 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u00b654 Here, review of the record indicates the State clearly presented independent evidence which established the elements of the crime charged. For example, before the State introduced evidence of Hayworth\u2019s statements, the victims testified and described the events which transpired on August 12,1995. Furthermore, the State introduced evidence that police had found rifle casings on the street and that the victims\u2019 vehicle had several bullet holes in it. Finally, Crepeau testified that she witnessed Hayworth drive down the street, make a U-turn and pull up alongside the victims\u2019 car just before shots were fired. In light of the foregoing, we conclude the State provided evidence which corroborated Hayworth\u2019s statements to police, and hold it was not error for the court to admit those statements into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b655  As noted above, Hayworth additionally asserts the State failed to present evidence to corroborate Burwell\u2019s testimony, and that his conviction should thus be overturned. Hayworth characterizes Burwell as an accomplice, contending that \u201c[i]f Defendant is legally accountable for Maier\u2019s actions, then so is Burwell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b656 Section 46-16-213, MCA, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">A person may not be found guilty of an offense on the testimony of one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense ... unless the testimony is corroborated by other evidence that in itself and without the aid of the testimony of the one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u00b657 In <em>State v. Kaczmarek </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 456, 795 P.2d 439, we explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">\u201cTo be sufficient, corroborating evidence must show more than that a crime was in fact committed or the circumstances of its commission. It must raise more than a suspicion of the defendant\u2019s involvement in, or opportunity to commit, the crime charged. But corroborative evidence need not be sufficient, by itself, to support a defendant\u2019s conviction or even to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case against him. <em>Corroborating evidence may be circumstantial and may come from the defendant and his </em>witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\"><em>State v. Kemp </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 383, 387, 597 P.2d 96, 99. (Emphasis added.) (Citations omitted.) Corroborating testimony is viewed in a light most favorable to the State. The corroborating evidence need only <em>tend to connect </em>the defendant with the crime charged and need not extend to every fact to which the accomplice testifies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Thus, corroborating evidence is not insufficient merely because it is circumstantial, disputed, or possibly consistent with innocent conduct; it is the jury\u2019s duty to resolve such factual questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKF\"><em>Kaczmarek, </em>243 Mont, at 459-60, 795 P.2d at 441-42 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b658 In the present case, whether Burwell was, as Hayworth asserts, an accomplice to the crimes charged, is, at best, questionable. Even assuming Burwell was an accomplice, however, we conclude the State presented ample evidence which corroborates his testimony. For example, Bradford, one of the victims in this case, identified Hayworth as the driver of the van and testified that Hayworth initially slowed down as he approached Bradford and Kunesh\u2019s vehicle, but then came \u201cflying around\u201d and cut them off just before shots were fired. Moreover, Crepeau corroborated Burwell\u2019s testimony regarding the speed and intentional manner in which Hayworth drove to reach and cut off Bradford\u2019s vehicle. Having reviewed the record, we conclude the State provided evidence which corroborated Burwell\u2019s testimony. \u00b659 Based on the foregoing, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hayworth\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">ISSUE 6</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b660 Did the District Court err in denying Hayworth the opportunity to call attorneys Toni Marra and Scott Albers as rebuttal witnesses?</p>\n<p id=\"AUq\">\u00b661  At the close of the second day of trial, Hayworth informed the court that he intended to call co-defendant Maier\u2019s attorney, Toni Marra, as a rebuttal witness for the limited purpose of rebutting certain portions of Detective Hollis\u2019s testimony. Hayworth also informed the court that he intended to call Scott Albers, formerly Hayworth\u2019s and Mogensen\u2019s attorney, as a witness to rebut portions of Nick Burwell\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u00b662 After reviewing a transcript of Officer Hollis\u2019s and Burwell\u2019s testimonies, the court determined that there were \u201csome issues that would be proper for impeachment.\u201d After conferring with her client, Marra indicated Maier would allow her to testify if the court would make a prior ruling restricting the scope of Hayworth's questioning. The court refused to \u201cmake that prior ruling,\u201d so Maier asserted his attorney-client privilege and the court refused to allow Marra to testify. \u00b663 The court and counsel engaged in a similar discussion with respect to Hayworth\u2019s attempts to call Mogensen\u2019s former attorney, Scott Albers, as a witness. Mogensen did not waive her attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>ney-client privilege, so the court similarly refused to allow Albers to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b664 On appeal, Hayworth argues the court erred in denying what he characterizes as Marra\u2019s motion for a protective order limiting the scope of Hayworth\u2019s questioning. Hayworth also agues the \u201cspecific rebuttal testimony\u201d he wished to elicit from Marra \u201cwas not attorney-client privilege because the conversation\u201d he wanted to ask her about \u201coccurred in the presence of third parties.\u201d Hayworth argues he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s refusal to issue a protective order, and he was thereby \u201cdenied the opportunity to present crucial testimony which greatly prejudiced him and deprived [him] of the right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b665 Having reviewed the record, we conclude Hayworth\u2019s arguments are without merit. Whether Marra actually moved for a protective order is not at all clear. Even assuming she did, we hold it was not error for the court to refuse to \u201cmake a prior ruling\u201d limiting the scope of Hayworth\u2019s questioning. Although Hayworth asserts the statements about which he intended to ask Marra occurred in the presence of third parties, Maier asserted his attorney-client privilege to protect, not what Marra may have heard during the interview with the police officer, but rather what privileged information she may have revealed on cross-examination. We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hayworth the opportunity to call Maier\u2019s attorney as a rebuttal witness in light of the fact that Maier refused to waive his attorney-client privilege. We similarly hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit Scott Albers to testify in light of the fact that Mogensen never waived her attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b666 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-7\">JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
