(Bonnie) and Joe W. (Joe) to M.J.W. Joe appeals, contending that certain of the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and that the District Court incorrectly interpreted the law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Amq\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in terminating Joe\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">\u00b63 The Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department), formerly the Department of Family Services, became involved with Bonnie prior to M.J.W.\u2019s birth due to concern about Bonnie\u2019s parenting capabilities. M.J.W. was born on September 9, 1992, and lived with Bonnie for most of the first eighteen months of her life. Throughout that period, Joe saw M.J.W. only intermittently. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>though Joe and Bonnie lived together for short periods before and after M. J.W.\u2019s birth, they never married.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b64 The Department removed M.J.W. from Bonnie\u2019s care on several occasions prior to February 25, 1994. Joe had physical custody of M.J.W. briefly, but she was removed by the Department when Joe went on a rafting trip leaving M.J.W. in the care of a fifteen-year-old babysitter. The Department subsequently returned M.J.W. to Bonnie\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b65 M.J.W. was placed in foster care again on February 25,1994, at age eighteen months, when Bonnie was jailed as a result of her third conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol and for resisting arrest, driving without a valid driver\u2019s license, and child endangerment. The Department petitioned for temporary investigative authority and protective services for M.J.W. shortly thereafter. The District Court granted the petition and vested specific rights in the Department, including the right to require Joe and Bonnie to attend individual counseling. The court also ordered M.J.W.\u2019s parents to comply with the order or appear on March 16, 1994, to show cause why they had not done so. Neither parent complied with the order or appeared at the show cause hearing. The Department moved for temporary legal custody of M.J.W. for six months and for approval of proposed treatment plans for Bonnie and Joe. The District Court granted that motion on July 27,1995, and ordered the parents to complete the goals listed in their treatment plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b66 The Department moved to terminate the parental rights of both Bonnie and Joe on September 12,1996, alleging alternative statutory grounds. The District Court appointed counsel for both parents and an evidentiary hearing on the motion was held on April 10, 1997. Thereafter, the District Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law and order terminating the parental rights of both parents and requiring the Department to establish a plan for permanent placement of M.J.W. Joe appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b67 In a termination of parental rights case, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Matter of W.Z. </em>(1997), [285 Mont. 16], 946 P.2d 125, 128 (citations omitted). Findings of fact are clearly erroneous \u201c \u2018if they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehends the effect of the evidence, or this Court\u2019s review of the record convinces it that a mistake has been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Marriage of Nevin </em>(1997), 284 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>468, 472, 945 P.2d 58, 61 (citation omitted). As a general rule, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct; however, we review conclusions involving the exercise of discretion, such as a determination that a child has been abused or neglected, under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Matter of B.C. </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 423, 426, 942 P.2d 106, 108 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in terminating Joe\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b69 A number of statutory bases exist for a court\u2019s termination of parental rights in Montana. In terminating Joe\u2019s parental rights in the present case, the District Court concluded that termination was appropriate under \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-609(l)(b), 41-3-609(l)(c), 41-3-609(l)(d), 41-3-410(1), and 41-3-410(2), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b610 Joe argues that the District Court erred in terminating his parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(c), MCA (1995), because its findings relating to his abuse and neglect of M.J.W. were based on an inadmissible hearsay report and, therefore, the threshold determination for termination under that statute \u2014 namely, that M.J.W. was an adjudicated youth in need of care \u2014 is lacking. The Department responds that the youth in need of car e designation was made at an earlier stage of the proceedings and, in that regard, directs our attention to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that M.J.W. \u201cwas properly designated by prior Order of this Court as a Youth in Need of Care as that term is defined by section 41-3-102(17) M.C.A.\u201d Therefore, according to the Department, the foundational determination was present and the District Court correctly terminated Joe\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(c), MCA (1995). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">\u00b611  A district court may terminate the parent-child legal relationship under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(c), MCA (1995), upon finding that the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care, the parent has not complied with an appropriate court-approved treatment plan or the treatment plan was unsuccessful, and the conduct or condition of the parent rendering him unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Thus, the threshold requirement for termination under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(c), MCA (1995), is the youth in need of care adjudication. Absent such an adjudication, parental rights cannot be terminated pursuant to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u00b612  Here, the record does not support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it previously had designated M.J.W. a youth in need of care. In its order granting the Department\u2019s petition for temporary investigative authority and protective services, the District Court found that \u201cthere is probable cause to believe that [M.J.W.] is abused or neglected or in danger of being abused or neglected....\u201d Clearly, a \u201cprobable cause\u201d finding does not constitute a finding that M.J.W. was abused or neglected. The District Court also found that M.J.W. was removed from her mother\u2019s home because she was in immediate or apparent danger of harm. This finding arguably is sufficient to meet the definition of child abuse or neglect contained in \u00a7 41-3-102(5), MCA (1995). It is not sufficient, however, to constitute an adjudication that M.J.W. was a youth in need of care. That adjudication can be made only after the adjudicatory hearing mandated by \u00a7 41-3-404, MCA (1995). No such hearing was held prior to the District Court\u2019s March 9, 1994, order for protective services. Indeed, that order clearly reflects that it was based solely on the Department\u2019s petition and accompanying report.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b613 The only other substantive District Court order of record prior to the Department\u2019s petition to terminate parental rights was entered on July 27,1995. In that order, the District Court awarded temporary legal custody of M.J.W. to the Department, approved treatment plans for Joe and Bonnie and ordered them to complete the goals in their treatment plans. Nothing in that order addresses abuse or neglect or adjudicates M.J.W. a youth in need of care. Moreover, as was the case with the District Court\u2019s March 9,1994, order, the statutorily required adjudicatory hearing prior to a youth in need of care designation was not held before the July 27,1995, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b6 14 The record before us is devoid of an order adjudicating M.J.W. a youth in need of care. As a result, we hold that the District Court erred in concluding it previously had designated M.J.W. a youth in need of care and in terminating Joe\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(c), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b615 As set forth above, however, the District Court terminated Joe\u2019s parental rights on five different statutory grounds. In this regard, the Department contends that termination was proper under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(b), MCA (1995), which permits a district court to terminate parental rights upon a finding that the parent abandoned the child as defined in \u00a7 41-3-102(7)(e), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u00b616  To terminate the parent-child legal relationship, a district court must determine that one of the criteria in \u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA, exists. <em>Matter of D.H. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 521, 526, 872 P.2d 803, 806. Section 41-3-609(1)(b), MCA (1995), provides that a finding of abandonment, as defined in \u00a7 41-3-102(7)(e), MCA (1995), is a criterion for terminating the parent-child legal relationship. Under \u00a7 41-3-102(7)(e), MCA (1995), abandonment occurs when the parent or other person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">abandons the child by leaving the child under circumstances that make reasonable the belief that the parent or other person does not intend to resume care of the child in the future or willfully surrenders physical custody for a period of 6 months and during that period does not manifest to the child and the person having physical custody of the child a firm intention to resume physical custody or to make permanent legal arrangements for the care of the child....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzA\">\u00b617 The District Court addressed abandonment in its Finding of Fact No. 5 and specifically found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">During the approximately eighteen months between the child\u2019s birth and her long term foster care placement, the natural father had intermittent contact with the child and her mother on a basis sufficient to make a general assessment concerning the care being given the child. Since her placement in foster care on February 25, 1994 the child has had minimal contact with [Joe] as specified in Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 2, as well as further contact neither authorized nor approved by the Department. The father has neglected to take advantage of opportunities to visit his child during the past three years and at present [M.J.W.] identifies him as one of several transient father figures. [Joe\u2019s] failure to parent his daughter for any extended period of time, including his failure to visit her regularly while in foster care, made reasonable the belief by the Department that he does not intend to resume care of the child in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXU\">Joe challenges only the first sentence of the finding, contending that it was based solely on the testimony of Nancy Smith, a social worker who did not have personal knowledge of his relationship with M.J.W. prior to February 25, 1994, when M.J.W. was again placed in foster care. Because the findings pertinent to abandonment relate to the three-year period beginning February 25,1994, however, we need not address whether the challenged portion of the finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u00b618  Joe does not challenge the District Court\u2019s specific findings or conclusion relating to abandonment. It is well settled that a district court\u2019s decision is presumed correct. <em>In re Marriage of Clyatt </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 119, 122, 882 P.2d 503, 505 (citation omitted). It is equally well settled that an appellant bears the burden of establishing error by the trial court. <em>See, e.g., Small v. Good </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 159, 163, 943 P.2d <em>1258, 1260; Rieman v. Anderson </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 139, 147, 935 P.2d 1122, 1127. Joe having failed to challenge the District Court\u2019s abandonment determinations and, as a consequence, necessarily having failed to meet his burden of proving error, we hold that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact regarding abandonment are not clearly erroneous and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Joe abandoned M.J.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b619  Finally, Joe correctly contends that a determination that he abused or neglected M.J.W. is required before the District Court can terminate his parental rights. Section 41-3-602, MCA, states that \u201c[t]he termination of the parent-child legal relationship provided for in this part is to be used in those situations when there is a determination that a child is abused or neglected, as defined in 41-3-102.\u201d <em>See also In re A.E. </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 56, 61-62, 840 P.2d 572, 576. Joe is incorrect in contending, however, that no such abuse or neglect determination was made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b620 Section 41-3-102(2), MCA (1995), defines \u201cabused or neglected\u201d as \u201cthe state or condition of a child who has suffered child abuse or neglect.\u201d Section 41-3-102(5)(a), MCA (1995), then defines \u201cchild abuse or neglect,\u201d in part, as harm to a child\u2019s health or welfare. Finally, \u201charm to a child\u2019s welfare\u201d is the harm which occurs when one of the statutory circumstances set forth in \u00a7 41-3-102(7), MCA (1995), exists. One of those statutory circumstances is abandonment. Section 41-2-102(7)(e), MCA (1995). As discussed above, the District Court found that Joe had abandoned M.J.W. Pursuant to the referenced statutes, therefore, the District Court implicitly made a determination of abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u00b621 We have not previously held that abandonment falls within the definition of \u201cabuse or neglect;\u201d however, we have implicitly recognized that it does. In <em>Matter of D.H., </em>264 Mont. at 525-26, 872 P.2d at 806, for example, the district court made an abuse and neglect determination based on a finding that the mother had abandoned her children. The mother challenged the abuse and neglect determination and we limited our analysis to whether the district court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>discretion in determining the mother had abandoned her children. <em>Matter of D.H., </em>264 Mont. at 525-26, 872 P.2d at 806. After reviewing the record, we concluded that the district court had not abused its discretion in determining that the mother had abandoned her children and that they were abused and neglected. <em>Matter of D.H., </em>264 Mont. at 527, 872 P.2d at 807. While we did not specifically address the statutory requirement for a determination of abuse or neglect in <em>Matter of D.H., </em>our conclusion implicitly recognized that abandonment was the legal equivalent of abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b622 Here, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s determination that Joe abandoned M.J.W. satisfies the \u00a7 41-3-602, MCA, requirement of a determination that the child has been abused or neglected as defined in \u00a7 41-3-102, MCA. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err in terminating Joe\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-601(l)(b), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b263-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART, REGNIER and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
