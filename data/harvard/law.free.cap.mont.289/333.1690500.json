For the reasons stated below, we affirm. The sole dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in terminating M.M.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">\u00b62 A.W-M. was born on March 30, 1996, to M.M., her biological mother, and M.W., her biological father. In April 1996, the Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) received \u201cfour referrals with concerns as to [M.M.\u2019s] ability to care for her infant daughter [A.W-M.] or to provide her with a home.\u201d During the week of July 8,1996, the Department received two more referrals \u201calleging [M.M.] was leaving [A.W-M.] for days at a time with caretakers while she was out partying.\u201d On July 12,1996, A. W-M. was placed in foster care for a brief period.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">\u00b63 On July 23,1996, the Department filed a petition with the Eighth Judicial District Court for temporary investigative authority and protective services. On July 31, 1996, the court issued an order for protective services, and appointed a guardian ad litem for A.W-M. The court held a show cause hearing on September 5, 1996, during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>which both M.M. and M.W. agreed to participate in a court-ordered treatment plan. On September 23, 1996, the court issued an order granting the Department\u2019s petition for temporary investigative authority for a ninety-day period, and ordering that M.M. and M.W. complete a treatment plan designed to \u201c[pjreserve, if possible, the parent child relationship between [A. W-M.] and her parents.\u201d Among the treatment plan\u2019s requirements were that M.M. provide her daughter with \u201ca safe and stable home,\u201d undergo a psychological assessment, complete a chemical dependency evaluation and follow any \u201crecommendations thereof,\u201d and complete parenting classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b64 In November 1996, A.W-M. was again placed in foster care because M.M. \u201chad not followed through at all with the treatment plan and the hospital was concerned about her chemical dependency issues.\u201d M.M. failed to attend a December 19,1996, review hearing, and the District Court ordered that the Department have temporary investigative authority for an additional ninety-day period, and ordered that M.M. \u201ccontinue working on her treatment plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b65 On February 25,1997, roughly one month after M.M. appeared at a second status hearing, the Department filed a petition for temporary legal custody. Among the allegations set forth in the Department\u2019s supporting affidavit were that M.M. had failed to meet even a single objective of her September 1996 treatment plan. More specifically, the Department asserted that, although M.M. had \u201ccompleted a chemical dependency evaluation\u201d and had begun the recommended intensive outpatient treatment, she received \u201ca disciplinary discharge because she did not show up for two appointments\u201d and because she had \u201ca urinalysis that was positive for marijuana.\u201d The Department also alleged that M.M. had failed to secure stable or permanent living arrangements, failed to attend counseling, and had not undergone a psychological evaluation as ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b66 On March 6,1997, the court issued an order granting the Department temporary legal custody over A.W-M. The court held an adjudicatory hearing on June 5,1997, at which M.M. failed to appear, and granted the Department legal custody for a six-month period. The court additionally ordered that M.M. \u201cmust make every effort to successfully complete\u201d her treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b67 On July 15,1997, the Department filed its petition for permanent legal custody and termination of parental rights. Citing \u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA, the Department sought to terminate M.M.\u2019s parental rights for failure to comply with or successfully complete her treatment plan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>and on the grounds that the conduct or condition rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The court held a hearing on September 16,1997, and on October 23,1997, entered an order terminating M.M.\u2019s parental rights. It is from the District Court\u2019s order terminating her parental rights that M.M. presently appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly and whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>In re K.F.L. and N.L. </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 102, 104, 910 P.2d 241, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b69  In <em>In re D.H. and F.H. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 521, 524, 872 P.2d 803, 805, we clarified the standard of review for cases involving a youth in need of care and termination of parental rights. The appropriate standard of review to be applied to purely factual findings in a termination of parental rights proceeding is the clearly erroneous standard as set forth in <em>Interstate Production Credit Association v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287. We review conclusions of law in a termination proceeding to determine if those conclusions are correct. <em>In re D.H. and </em>F.H., 264 Mont. at 525, 872 P.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u00b610 This Court has recognized that \u201ca natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>In re R.B., Jr. </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 99, 103, 703 P.2d 846, 848. Accordingly, prior to terminating an individual\u2019s parental rights, the district court must adequately address each applicable statutory requirement. <em>In re R.B., Jr., </em>211 Mont. at 103, 703 P.2d at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in terminating M.M.\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">\u00b612 M.M. advances two arguments on appeal, the first of which is that the District Court erred in finding A. W-M. was a youth in need of care. M.M. asserts there was no evidence indicating A.W-M. was abused or neglected at the time ofher removal from M.M.\u2019s careinNovember 1996. At the hearing on the Department\u2019s petition to terminate M.M.\u2019s parental rights, social worker Brennan Swanberg explained that the Department had placed A. W-M. in foster-care on November 6,1996, because the child had bronchitis and because she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>been left with an inappropriate caregiver. On appeal, M.M. argues the Department presented no evidence to suggest that A.W-M.\u2019s bronchitis was due to abuse or neglect, and similarly asserts the Department failed to present any evidence to suggest that the caregiver with whom M.M. left her daughter was inappropriate. Moreover, M.M. disputes the Department\u2019s assertion that she failed to return for her child when expected by the caregiver. In light of the foregoing, M.M. argues the Department failed to present clear and convincing evidence that A.W-M. was in danger of being neglected or abused while in her care. Because the Department failed to demonstrate that A.W-M. was a youth in need of care, M.M. argues, \u201cthe child should not have been removed and the action should have been terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVq\">\u00b6 13  In its order terminating M.M.\u2019s parental rights, the District Court found that A.W-M. \u201cis a youth in need of care within the meaning [of] \u00a7 41-3-201, MCA (1995), and her best interests will be served by declaring her a youth in need of care under the laws of the State of Montana.\u201d The court additionally concluded that A.W-M. had previously been \u201cadjudicated a youth in need of care and remains as such.\u201d We will not disturb a decision by the district court terminating parental rights \u201cunless there is a mistake of law or a finding of fact not supported by substantial credible evidence that would amount to a clear abuse of discretion. <em>In re S.P. </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 190, 194, 786 P.2d 642, 644 (quoting <em>In re R.A.D. </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 143, 148, 753 P.2d 862, 865).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b614  The record in the present case contains substantial credible evidence to support the District Court\u2019s determination that A.W-M. was a youth in need of care. For example, the record indicates that when A.W-M. was only three months old, M.M. left her in the care of a known sex offender. Department social worker Brennan Swanberg testified that, when A. W-M. was seven months old and sick with bronchitis, M.M. left her with a babysitter. Swanberg explained that when M.M. failed to return for her daughter at the predetermined time, the babysitter took A.W-M. to the emergency room for treatment. Swanberg stated that, although M.M. eventually arrived at the hospital, doctors would not release A. W-M. into her care because she \u201cappeared to be high.\u201d The record additionally indicates that M.M. made few efforts to complete the requirements of her treatment plan, tested positive for the use of marijuana, and left A.W-M. with caregivers for indefinite periods of time on more than one occasion. Under these circumstances, we hold the District Court did not err in finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>A. W-M. was a youth in need of care. Moreover, although M.M. argues on appeal that \u201cthe child should not have been removed\u201d from her care and placed in a foster home in November 1996, we note that M.M. did not object to her removal at that time and did not object to the court\u2019s order granting the Department investigative authority and protective services.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b615 Having held that the District Court did not err in finding that A. W-M. was a youth in need of care, we turn next to M.M.\u2019s argument that the court erred in concluding she could not be expected to complete her treatment objectives in the foreseeable future, and thus erred in terminating her parental rights. In its order terminating M.M.\u2019s parental rights, the District Court indeed concluded that M.M. \u201cdid not comply with\u201d her treatment plan, and determined that those \u201cportions of the treatment plan that were attempted were not successful.\u201d The court additionally concluded that the conduct or condition rendering M.M. unfit to parent her child \u201cis unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b6 16 On appeal, M.M. concedes \u201cit is clear that [she] did not complete her treatment plan,\u201d but asserts the Department failed to demonstrate that a treatment plan was actually necessary. Moreover, M.M. argues the Department presented no evidence to contradict her assertion that she was not chemically dependent, and similarly presented no evidence that she was an unfit parent. M.M. accordingly argues the court erred in concluding that the conduct or condition rendering her unfit to parent A.W-M. \u201cis unlikely to change within a reasonable time,\u201d and thereby erred in terminating her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b617  Having reviewed the record, we conclude there is ample evidence which supports the court\u2019s determination that the conduct or condition rendering M.M. unfit was \u201cunlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d Despite M.M.\u2019s assertions to the contrary, the record contains substantial evidence indicating she was chemically dependent. For example, Gateway Recovery conducted a chemical dependency evaluation and recommended that M.M. undergo intensive outpatient chemical dependency treatment. Moreover, M.M. was subsequently discharged from treatment due in part to the fact that her urine tested positive on one occasion for the presence of marijuana. Also indicative of M.M.\u2019s inability to effectively parent her child is evidence that she had been unable to secure stable housing or employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ment, had failed to attend court-ordered counseling, and had visited only sporadically with her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b6 18 When asked at the termination hearing why she had not completed court-ordered intensive outpatient chemical dependency treatment, M.M. replied that she \u201c[j]ust didn\u2019t care at the time.\u201d M.M. stated that she did not complete the counseling requirement contained in her treatment plan because she believed such counseling had nothing to with her daughter. When asked why the court should give her more time to complete her treatment plan, M.M. explained, \u201cI don\u2019t think they should. I messed up, and I know I did, and I don\u2019t think they should.\u201d Although M.M. testified that she would not relinquish her parental rights to A.W-M., she simultaneously agreed that she was unwilling to do what the court ordered her to do in order to get her daughter back.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b619 In light of the foregoing, we conclude the record contains substantial evidence supporting the court\u2019s determination that M.M. was \u201cunfit, unwilling, or unable to provide adequate parental care,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he conduct or condition of [M.M] rendering [her] unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d We thus hold the court did not err in concluding M.M. could not be expected to complete an appropriate treatment plan in the foreseeable future, and in thereby terminating M.M.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-6\">JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, LEAPHART and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
