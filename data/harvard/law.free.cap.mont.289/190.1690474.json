For the reasons stated below, we affirm. The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in terminating J. A.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">\u00b62 J.A. and L.W. married in 1986, and are the natural parents of E.W., C.W., and A.W., the three minor children involved in the present matter. Their first child, E.W., was born on November 22, 1988. The Department of Public Health and Human Services, formerly the Department of Family Services, first began providing services to J.A. in June 1989 when E.W. was seven months old. On September 1, 1989, J.A. and the Department entered into a service treatment agreement designed to help J.A. provide proper care for her son. On October 15, 1990, the Department filed a petition for temporary investigative authority and emergency protective services. The court issued an order for emergency protective services, and appointed a guardian ad litem for E.W. At the October 30,1990, show cause hearing, the parties in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>formed the court they had reached an agreement, and the Department entered into a service treatment plan with J.A. and L.W. The District Court issued an order granting the Department temporary investigative authority over E.W. for the six-month period due to expire on January 30, 1991. The parties subsequently agreed to terminate supervision, and on January 14,1991, the District Court terminated the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b63 J.A. and L.W. had their second child, C.W., on August 4, 1991. Their third child, A.W., was born nearly a year later, on July 1,1992. J.A. and L.W. divorced in 1993, and J.A. married T.A. on July 17,1994. The record indicates there were numerous referrals during this period of time, and the Department thus continued its involvement with J.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b64 On July 14,1994, the Department filed a second petition in response to a referral of physical, emotional, and medical neglect, this time seeking temporary investigative authority and protective services for E W, C.W., and A.W. T.A. subsequently left the state, thereby violating the conditions of his probation, and J.A. was evicted from her apartment in August 1994. The children were placed in foster care on August 19,1994, where they have since remained. On August 30, 1994, the District Court entered an order granting the Department\u2019s petition for temporary investigative authority and protective services for a six-month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b65 On September 28,1994, J.A. entered into a court ordered contract and treatment plan designed to \u201creunite the family by helping [J.A.] learn appropriate parenting skills and how to provide a safe environment for the children.\u201d On February 22,1995, the Department filed a petition seeking temporary custody for an additional six-month period, on the grounds that J.A. had failed to fulfill her obligations under the September 1994 treatment plan. The court granted the Department\u2019s petition on March 14, 1995, providing the Department with another six-month period of temporary custody, and ordering that J.A. \u201csuccessfully complete her treatment plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b66 Six months later, the Department again petitioned the court to extend its temporary custody over E.W., C.W., and A.W. for an additional six months and asked for a revised treatment plan. In support of its September 11,1995, petition, the Department cited to J.A.\u2019s continuing failure to complete the requirements of her existing treatment plan. The parties agreed to another six-month period of temporary custody, and on September 20,1995, the District Court entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>an order continuing the Department\u2019s temporary custody until March 1996. The District Court appointed counsel for J.A., and the parties negotiated a revised contract and treatment plan, approved by the court on January 10, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b67 On April 19,1996, the Department filed a petition to terminate J.A.\u2019s parental rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Arguing J.A. had failed to comply with the requirements of her January 1996 treatment plan, the Department sought to terminate J.A.\u2019s parental rights on the stated grounds \u201cthat the treatment plan has not been successful and the mother\u2019s conduct or condition rendering her unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b68 In May 1996, the District Court conducted a five-day hearing on the petition to terminate parental rights. On June 3,1997, the court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order, terminating J.A.\u2019s parental rights to E.W., C.W., and A.W. It is from the District Court\u2019s order terminating her parental rights that J.A. presently appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b69  We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly and whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>In re K.F.L. and N.L. </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 102, 104, 910 P.2d 241, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"A8_\">\u00b610  In <em>In re D.H. and F.H. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 521, 524, 872 P.2d 803, 805, we clarified the standard of review for cases involving a youth in need of care and termination of parental rights. The appropriate standard of review to be applied to purely factual findings in a termination of parental rights proceeding is the clearly erroneous standard as set forth in <em>Interstate Production Credit Association v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287. In <em>DeSaye, </em>we explained that, pursuant to the clearly erroneous standard of review,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVL\">[flirst, the Court will review the record to see if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. Second, if the findings are sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ported by substantial evidence we will determine if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence. Third, if substantial evidence exists and the effect of the evidence has not been misapprehended the Court may still find that \u201c[A] finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves the Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>U[nited] S[tates] v. U.S. Gypsum Co. </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 364, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><em>DeSaye, </em>250 Mont. at 323, 820 P.2d at 1287 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b611 We review conclusions of law in a termination proceeding to determine if those conclusions are correct. <em>In re D.H. and F.H., </em>264 Mont. at 525, 872 P.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b6 12  This court has recognized that \u201ca natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>In re R.B., Jr. </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 99, 103, 703 P.2d 846, 848. Accordingly, prior to terminating an individual\u2019s parental rights, the district court must adequately address each applicable statutory requirement. <em>In re R.B., Jr., </em>217 Mont. at 103, 703 P.2d at 848. Moreover, \u201cthe party seeking termination must present clear and convincing evidence to the district court that the prerequisite statutory criteria for termination have been <em>met.\u201d In re J.L., D.L., and A.G. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 284, 288, 922 P.2d 459, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u00b613 In the context of parental rights termination cases, we have defined clear and convincing evidence as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">simply a requirement that a preponderance of the evidence be definite, clear, and convincing, or that a particular issue must be clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence or by a clear preponderance of the proof. This requirement does not call for unanswerable or conclusive evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-9\"><em>In re J.L., D.L., and A.G., 277 </em>Mont. at 289, 922 P.2d at 462 (quoting <em>In re Interest of S.M.Q. </em>(Kan. 1990), 796 P.2d 543, 545).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u00b614  We presume that the district court\u2019s decision is correct and will not disturb it on appeal unless there is a mistake of law or a finding of fact not supported by substantial evidence that would amount to a clear abuse of discretion. <em>In re J.R. and S.D. </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 434, 440-41, 833 P.2d 1063, 1067; <em>In re J.J.C.H. and C.M.H. </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 158, 162, 827 P.2d 812, 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">\u00b6 15 Did the District Court err in terminating J. A.\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u00b616 The Department petitioned to terminate J.A. parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(c), MCA (1995) (since renumbered \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(e), MCA), which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">(c) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\u00b617 Relying on \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(c), MCA (1995), the Department sought to terminate J.A.\u2019s parental rights due to her alleged failure to comply with the January 1996 treatment plan, and on the grounds \u201cthat the treatment plan has not been successful and the mother\u2019s conduct or condition rendering her unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\u00b618  In its June 3,1997, order terminating J.A.\u2019s parental rights, the District Court concluded that \u201c[a]ll of her treatment plans have met with mixed results, but [J.A.] cannot parent these children in the near or distant future.\u201d The court also concluded the termination of J.A.\u2019s parental rights was warranted because it was \u201cnot in the interests of these children\u2019s physical, mental and emotional needs to place them on hold any longer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">\u00b619 On appeal, J.A. argues the court erred in so concluding, and generally asserts that, because the Department failed to meet its burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence in support of its petition for termination, the court\u2019s findings of fact are thus clearly erroneous, and its conclusions of law incorrect. More specifically, J.A. argues the court improperly disregarded testimony by a number of professionals who opposed the termination of her parental rights and instead \u201csupported the return of the children.\u201d J.A. asserts the evidence of record, including testimony by all three professionals integrally involved in the case, demonstrates that she complied with the January 1996 treatment plan, and that the treatment plan was successful. Based on the foregoing, J.A. argues the evidence of record demonstrates \u201cby clear and convincing proof that [J.A.] is a competent mother,\u201d and as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>serts the court erred in concluding J.A. is unfit to parent her children and in terminating her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b620 In support of her argument that the 1996 treatment plan was successful, J.A. relies in part upon the testimony of counselor Barbara Boik, who explained that, were J.A. to \u201chave a good support system in line and get the help that she needed,\u201d Boik \u201cwould really like to see the children with her.\u201d J.A. also points generally to testimony by Eleanor Truitt, a licensed clinical social worker, who explained that she believed J.A. could, with proper help, parent her children, and that the children should thus \u201cbe able to return to their mother.\u201d J.A. also relies upon the opinion of case aid Joyce VanderVoort who testified that because J.A. had made a concerted effort to improve her parenting skills, she was deserving of a chance to \u201cuse the skills.\u201d Moreover, J.A. notes that clinical psychologist Dr. McElhinny, although called as a witness by the Department, conceded that the opinions expressed by Boik, Truitt, and VanderVoort regarding the placement of the children would be important. Finally, J.A. points to similar testimony by clinical social worker Suzy Saltiel who stated that she \u201cwould like to see these children with their mother.\u201d Pointing to testimony by the foregoing individuals, J.A. argues that all of the professionals who \u201cwere integral to the treatment plan\u201d believed she had successfully completed the plan and supported the return of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b621 The Department, in response, points to contrasting testimony by a number of witnesses who expressed their ongoing concerns about J.A.\u2019s ability to parent her children, and who concluded that the treatment plan had been unsuccessful. For example, the Department notes that Meg Babits, the children\u2019s guardian ad litem, expressly testified that, in her opinion, \u201c[t]he treatment plan has not been successful.\u201d The Department also relies upon testimony by social worker Elizabeth Hoyt-Leonard, who explained that she did not think the January 1996 treatment plan had been effective. The Department additionally points to testimony by Steven Ware, a member of J.A.\u2019s treatment team, who explained that he continued to have concerns about J.A. neglecting her children and not being able to look out for their emotional well-being. The Department also relies upon the opinion of Ellen Berglund, the children\u2019s trained therapeutic foster mother, who testified that she thought J.A. was unable to change and had neglected to remedy the circumstances that led to the removal of her children. Finally, the Department notes that Dr. James Feist, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>children\u2019s pediatrician for nearly six years, testified that the children were \u201chigh needs\u201d children, and that J.A. did not have the ability to \u201crespond to their needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b622  As demonstrated by the parties\u2019 respective arguments, the record contains conflicting evidence and testimony with regard to the success or failure of J.A.\u2019s 1996 treatment plan. Under these circumstances, it is not our function on appeal to reweigh the conflicting evidence of record, substitute our \u201cevaluation of the evidence for that of the trial court, or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses.\" In <em>re </em>J.L., 277 Mont. at 290, 922 P.2d at 462 (quoting <em>In re Interest of S.M.Q. </em>(Kan. 1990), 796 P.2d at 545.) That there exists conflicting evidence of record \u201cdoes not automatically preclude a finding that clear and convincing evidence to support a given position exists.\u201d <em>In re J.L., </em>277 Mont. at 290, 922 P.2d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b623 In its order terminating J.A.\u2019s parental rights, the District Court recognized that the record contained conflicting evidence regarding J.A.\u2019s ability to parent her children, as well as the success or failure of her January 1996 treatment plan. The court made 284 findings of fact, many of which chronicled conflicting testimony by various witnesses regarding the implementation and success of the treatment plan at issue. For example, the court recounted testimony by Babits and Hoyt-Leonard, each of whom believed that the 1996 treatment plan had not been effective or successful. The court did acknowledge, however, that there existed conflicting testimony by a number of individuals. For example, the court recognized in its findings of fact that Boik believed \u201cthe children would be better off with their mother, so long as she had a support system around her.\u201d The court also acknowledged that Truitt \u201cwas of the opinion that [J.A.] could parent her children with help\u201d and that \u201c[s]he favored a return of the children to [J.A.], so long as [J.A.] received parenting aid, and respite day care.\u201d Finally, the court noted that VanderVoort thought J.A. deserved a chance to use her newly acquired skills and parent her children with support from the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b624 Thus, although J.A. argues the District Court failed to give proper consideration to testimony by Boik, Truitt, and VanderVoort, review of the District Court\u2019s lengthy findings of fact indicates otherwise. The court clearly considered the testimony of each witness before concluding that all of J.A.\u2019s treatment plans, including the 1996 treatment plan, had \u201cmet with mixed results, but [J. A.] cannot parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>these children in the near or distant future.\u201d After considering all of the evidence before it, the court concluded that J.A.,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">the mother of these three children, by proof beyond all doubt, will never be a competent mother. She has been given every service available by the department. Although it is true, the department should have stepped in much sooner, given her services and then terminated her rights if she could not improve, the fact still remains that she will never be able to parent these three children adequately, given the intensive parenting they require and her level of parenting skills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b625 Review of the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law indicates it did not, as J.A. suggests, \u201cignore[] the recommendation of the three primary professionals who were integral to and a part of the treatment plan.\u201d Instead, the court evaluated all pertinent evidence and testimony before effectively concluding J. A.\u2019s treatment plan had been unsuccessful, and ordering the termination of J. A.\u2019s parental rights. Having reviewed the record and the District Court\u2019s order, we conclude the court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, and are not clearly erroneous. We hold the court did not err in concluding that J. A.\u2019s treatment plan had met with only \u201cmixed results\u201d and was thus unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b626  As noted above, J.A. also argues that the evidence of record demonstrates she complied with the January 1996 treatment plan, and suggests the court thus erred in concluding she was unfit to parent her three children. Pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(c), MCA (1995), a court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding that a court-approved treatment plan has been unsuccessful <em>or </em>has not been complied with, and a finding that \u201cthe conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d In other words, \u201ca parent must not only comply with the treatment plan, but the treatment plan must also be successful.\u201d <em>In re S.C. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 24, 29, 869 P.2d 266, 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u00b627 In the present case, the Department expressly petitioned to terminate J.A.\u2019s parental rights on the grounds \u201cthat the treatment plan has not been successful and the mother\u2019s conduct or condition rendering her unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d In light of our determination that the District Court correctly concluded that J.A.\u2019s treatment plan had met with only mixed results, and was thus unsuccessful, whether J.A. complied with the 1996 treatment plan is immaterial. Accordingly, we decline to address J.A.\u2019s argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>she in fact complied with the requirements of the January 1996 treatment plan and that the District Court thus erred in terminating her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b628  Section 41-3-609(l)(c), MCA (1995), also required that to order the termination of parental rights a district court must find \u201cthe conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d That the District Court in this case evaluated this statutory requirement is evidenced by its conclusion that, \u201cby proof beyond all doubt,\u201d J.A. \u201cwill never be a competent mother\u201d and \u201cwill never be able to parent these three children adequately, given the intensive parenting they require and her level of parenting skills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b629  On appeal, J.A. generally argues it was error for the court to conclude she was, and would continue to be, an unfit mother. Having reviewed the record, however, we hold otherwise. As it did with respect to the implementation of J.A.\u2019s treatment plan, the court made numerous findings of fact regarding her ability to parent her children. For example, the court pointed to testimony from various witnesses which indicated J.A. had failed to maintain regular visitation, did not properly medicate her children, missed medical appointments, dressed her children inappropriately, did not wake up in the morning to care for her children, and failed to pick them up after school. Moreover, the court noted the Department\u2019s six-year involvement with J.A. and her children, concluding she had \u201cbeen given every service available by the department\u201d but was still unable to properly parent her children. Having reviewed the record, we conclude the court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, and are not clearly erroneous. We hold the court did not err in effectively concluding the conduct or condition which rendered J.A. unfit to parent her children was unlikely to change within a reasonable time, and on that basis ordering the termination of her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\u00b630 Based on the foregoing, we affirm the order the District Court, and hold the court did not err in terminating J.A.\u2019s parental rights on the grounds that her treatment plan had been unsuccessful and the conduct rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<judges id=\"b224-9\">JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-11\">. The Department additionally petitioned to terminate L.W.\u2019s parental rights.
