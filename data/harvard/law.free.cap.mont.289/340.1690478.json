In a separate child custody action between Scriber and A.E.\u2019s father, custody of A.E. was transferred to A.E.\u2019s father. That decision was not appealed. The proceedings herein were subsequently dismissed. Because we conclude this matter is now moot, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u00b62 Scriber states the issue as whether the court\u2019s order granting an extension of the Department\u2019s legal custody of A.E. violated her right to have and raise her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">\u00b63 When these proceedings began, Scriber and A.E.\u2019s father were divorced and Scriber had physical custody of nine-year-old A.E. and her twelve-year-old brother. In November 1996, Scriber reported to the Department that A.E.\u2019s brother had sexually abused A.E. The Department\u2019s investigation confirmed that A.E.\u2019s brother had forcefully sexually molested her on multiple occasions while both children were in Scriber\u2019s custody, and that when A.E. had told Scriber about the incidents, Scriber accused A.E. of lying and sent her to her room.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">\u00b64 The Department obtained temporary investigative authority (TIA), which included the authority to require that A.E. and her family obtain counseling. Scriber refused to participate in family counseling and threatened to remove A.E. from the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court thereafter declared A.E. a youth in need of care and placed her temporary physical custody with her father, who lived in Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">\u00b65 While these proceedings were pending, A.E.\u2019s father filed an independent motion to modify the provisions of the decree dissolving his and Scriber\u2019s marriage. Under that decree, Scriber had primary physical custody of A.E. Scriber appeared pro se in the modification action, as in this action, despite the court\u2019s advice that she seek legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u00b66 Meanwhile, the court held a hearing on the Department\u2019s request for a ninety-day extension of its TIA. At the end of the hearing, the court orally granted the request for an extension of TIA based upon the evidence presented, including the evidence that Scriber had been uncooperative with family counseling. Scriber immediately filed a notice of appeal which, pursuant to Rule 5(a)(2), M.R.App.R, was treated as filed on the date the written judgment was entered, September 18, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b67 In the action by A.E.\u2019s father to modify the decree of dissolution, the court awarded sole custody of A.E. to her father. Scriber did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b68 After the custody modification order was entered, the Department moved to dismiss its petition for TIA and to vacate the court\u2019s order granting it extended temporary legal custody of A.E. The motion to dismiss was granted and the order giving temporary custody to the Department was vacated on November 14, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b69  A legal question is moot when it no longer presents ajusticiable controversy because the issues have become academic or dead or because any action the court may take will have no effect on the situation of the parties. <em>Air Pollution Control v. Bd. of Env. Rev. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 255, 264, 937 P.2d 463, 469. In other words, a question is moot when the court can no longer grant effective relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">\u00b610  Here, the validity of the Department\u2019s TIA and temporary legal custody of A.E. is a moot question because the Department no longer possesses such authority over and custody of A.E. In the absence of an ongoing, concrete controversy, the court cannot grant effective relief. Furthermore, this Court cannot fashion the remedy which Scriber seeks (return to her of legal and physical custody of A.E.), because Scriber did not appeal the court\u2019s order in the custody modification proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">\u00b611 Because this appeal of the order extending the Department\u2019s TIA and temporary legal custody of A.E. is moot, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b366-11\">JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
