Kneeland, brought this action alleging that he was wrongfully discharged by defendant Luzenac America, Inc. Kneeland appeals the decision of the Fifth Judicial District Court, Madison County, granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his breach of implied covenant claim. Kneeland also appeals the jury verdict finding that he was not wrongfully discharged by Luzenac. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-16\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Luzenac on Kneeland\u2019s claim of post-termination bad faith?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-18\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court properly instruct the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">\u00b65 3. Was there substantial evidence to support the jury verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-20\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err in denying Kneeland\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law, and motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b67 In 1981, Bruce G. Kneeland was hired by Cyprus Industrial Minerals to work for the company\u2019s Yellowstone Mine Operation. Later, Cyprus was renamed Luzenac America, Inc. Luzenac is a talc company with principal mine facilities in Montana and headquarters in Denver, Colorado. Luzenac\u2019s Montana Mines Division has three mine sites in Montana that operate separately. The largest site is the Yellowstone Mine near Ennis. The company also operates the Beaverhead Mine, a small underground mine in the Ruby Mountains, and the Antler Mine, a surface mine located south of Silver Star.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b68 In the early 1990s, the talc market was in a downturn. Talc, a commodity, is an industrial mineral. Talc companies face competition from other industrial mineral producers, such as clay and calcium carbonate companies. Also, in recent years, there has been a large influx of talc into the market from cheaper, foreign producers. As a result, the United States talc market accumulated a large supply of inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"ARL\">\u00b69 Faced with these conditions, Luzenac\u2019s Montana Mines Division reconfigured its workforce in late 1993 and mid-1994 to reduce its personnel by fifty-eight hourly positions. At first, Luzenac offered voluntary retirement and voluntary incentive packages to trim its workforce. However, these incentives did not result in a total reduction of fifty-eight hourly positions. Subsequently, the company reviewed its personnel needs and determined which job positions would be reduced in number and which positions would be eliminated completely or reconfigured.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b610 The Montana Mines Division had a handbook applicable to all its hourly employees published by Cyprus, prior to the company\u2019s name change in 1992. The handbook was amended from time to time. As of 1994, the handbook contained a policy dealing with downsizing. The handbook specifically outlined a process by which employees may \u201cbid\u201d for open positions, or \u201cbump\u201d into occupied positions in the event of a reduction in force. A bump from an employee would displace another employee currently occupying that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b6 11 The employees of the Montana Mines Division were aware that it was over staffed and required downsizing. The employees approached Mike Toelle, the general manager, with their concerns. To achieve an equitable result acceptable to all personnel, Toelle formed a committee of hourly employees from all three mine sites. The purpose ofthe committee was to develop a consensus onhowthe downsizing should occur and revise the policy on reducing the workforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u00b612 Under the policy the committee developed, Yellowstone Mine employees, like Kneeland, could bid for any open position available at their mine. These employees could also bump into any position at the Yellowstone Mine or into a designated \u201centry-level\u201d position at the Beaverhead mine, if they had the necessary qualifications for the position and more seniority than the individual occupying the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b6 13 Job descriptions were posted detailing the open positions available for bid, and the entry level positions vulnerable to bumping. Employees were requested to fill out bid and bump sheets identifying the position they were seeking. The person with the most seniority and necessary qualifications for the position would be chosen. A committee evaluated each application and an applicant was required to gain the consensus of the members of the committee before being selected for a position.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b614 At first, Kneeland attempted to bid into the positions of plant maintenance and mobile maintenance at the Yellowstone Mine. However, those positions were filled by applicants with more seniority than Kneeland. He then attempted to bump into the position of underground mechanic at the Beaverhead Mine. That position was not vulnerable to bumping and his application was rejected. He also attempted to bump into the position of underground mine support at the Beaverhead Mine, but was unsuccessful because he lacked the published minimum qualifications for that position. Kneeland made no other attempt to bid upon or bump into any other position for which he was eligible. Therefore, after the application process was over, Kneeland was laid off in a reduction in force from Luzenac in mid-1994.</p>\n<p id=\"AQR\">\u00b615 In July 1994, after the workforce reduction, Luzenac acquired Montana Talc Company, a competitor with a mine site adjacent to the Yellowstone Mine facility. Due to the acquisition, Luzenac hired five individuals whom they had recently terminated. Kneeland was not one of those hired back to work for Luzenac.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b6 16 On September 27,1994, Kneeland filed a complaint in the Fifth Judicial District Court, Madison County, alleging wrongful discharge and related tort claims, including conspiracy. He also alleged a claim based on \u201cpost-termination bad faith,\u201d arising out of Luzenac\u2019s failure to reinstate, recall, or rehire him after acquiring the Montana Talc Company. On November 1,1994, Luzenac filed its answer to the complaint, denying the allegations and setting forth numerous affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b617 On December 1,1995, Luzenac filed motions, moving for summary judgment against all of Kneeland\u2019s claims. Kneeland filed a motion to recover sanctions, alleging that Luzenac violated Rule 11 by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>moving for summary judgment on all claims. A hearing was held and the parties stipulated that the claim based on civil conspiracy should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b6 18 On February 6,1996, the court granted summary judgment to Luzenac on Kneeland\u2019s claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and post-termination bad faith. The court denied summary judgment on Kneeland\u2019s wrongful discharge claim, finding that \u201ca factual issue exists as to whether there has been a violation of express provisions of a written personnel policy in reduction of force.\u201d The court also denied Kneeland\u2019s request for the imposition of attorney fees and sanctions against Luzenac.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b619 On February 13,1996, Kneeland filed a petition for reconsideration of the court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment relating to Kneeland\u2019s claim for post-termination bad faith. In the alternative, Kneeland requested that the court certify the claim as final pursuant to Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.R, in order for this Court to review the issue. The District Court granted the motion to certify and postponed any further action on the case pending a ruling by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b620 Kneeland filed a \u201cnotice of certification of proposition of state law\u201d with this Court on February 26,1996. We issued an order on February 29,1996, stating that Kneeland\u2019s request would be handled as an appeal of a judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b), but that we would not rule on the propriety of the Rule 54(b) certification at that time. Luzenac then filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the requirements for Rule 54(b) certification had not been met. We agreed, and on March 28,1996, this Court dismissed Kneeland\u2019s appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b621 A jury trial began on October 15,1996, on Kneeland\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. On October 21,1996, the jury returned a unanimous verdict for Luzenac. Judgment was entered on October 31,1996. On November 1,1996, Kneeland filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,or alternatively, motion for a new trial. On November 29, 1996, the District Court denied Kneeland\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u00b622 On December 30, 1996, Kneeland filed a notice of appeal. Kneeland now appeals from the order of summary judgment dismissing his claim of post-termination bad faith, the final judgment and jury verdict, and from the order denying his post-trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b623  Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Luzenac on Kneeland\u2019s claim of post-termination bad faith?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b624 Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. See Motaire v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156; <em>Mead v. M.S.B., Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 465, 470, 872 P.2d 782, 785. When we review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we apply the same evaluation as the district court based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>See Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. In <em>Bruner, </em>we set forth our inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of material fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\"><em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264-65, 900 P.2d at 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\u00b625 Kneeland argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Luzenac on his claim based on post-termination bad faith. The court had ruled that Kneeland\u2019s claim was precluded by the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (WDFEA), \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA. Kneeland argues that Luzenac\u2019s failure to rehire him after it had acquired Montana Talc Company constitutes a separate and independent tort of post-termination bad-faith.</p>\n<p id=\"AOI\">\u00b626 By its own terms, the WDFEA \u201csets forth certain rights and remedies with respect to wrongful discharge\u201d and \u201cprovides the exclusive remedy for a wrongful discharge from employment.\u201d Section 39-2-902, MCA. The Act provides that \u201cno claim for discharge may arise from tort or express or implied contract.\u201d Section 39-2-913, MCA. Furthermore, under the WDFEA, \u201c[t]here is no right under any legal theory to damages for wrongful discharge under this part for pain and suffering, emotional distress, compensatory damages, puni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tive damages, or any other form of damages, except as provided for in [the Act].\u201d Section 39-2-905(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b627 In construing \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, we have held that the section bars all claims arising from an asserted wrongful discharge based upon common law tort or implied or express contract. <em>Beasley v. Semitool, Inc. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 258, 261, 853 P.2d 84, 86. However, not all tort or contract claims are barred by \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, because they arise from employment. Rather, \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, bars only those tort and contract claims which are \u201cfor discharge.\u201d <em>Beasley, </em>258 Mont. at 262, 853 P.2d at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b628 First, we examine whether Kneeland\u2019s claim of post-termination bad faith constitutes a separate and independent tort unrelated to the alleged wrongful discharge. Kneeland claims that Luzenac is liable for bad faith because it failed to rehire him after it acquired Montana Talc Company and hired five workers. Luzenac counters that it had no duty to rehire Kneeland after he had been permanently terminated in the reduction of force in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b629 This Court has held that the breach of a covenant or a contract may result in the tort of bad faith only in exceptional circumstances. To be actionable the plaintiff must establish a special relationship. <em>See Story v. City of Bozeman </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 436, 791 P.2d 767. In this case, Kneeland has not established that a contract existed between him and Luzenac after his termination. Therefore, there is no need to establish whether or not a special relationship existed between Kneeland and Luzenac or if Luzenac acted tortiously in failing to rehire him.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b630 In fact, once Kneeland was terminated in 1994, Luzenac had no duty to rehire Kneeland at any time in the future. Kneeland understood that once he was terminated, Luzenac had no further obligations to him. Kneeland so testified in his deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">Q: All right. Nobody [at Luzenac] promised you, \u201cWe\u2019re going to hire you back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">A: No. As a matter of fact, this wasn\u2019t a layoff. Mr. Pearson stood up in front of the whole room and said this was a termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">A: So that if we do rehire, we have no obligation to rehire anybody. That\u2019s why we are offering this separation package.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">Q: And that was clear to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">A: Yes, at that particular point in time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u00b631 Kneeland was also unable to identify any basis for his claim that Luzenac had a duty to rehire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">Q:... I am asking you if you thought youhad some kind of personnel policy right, some right that is established by an employee guideline or a statement you saw? What do you think established, in your view, this concept that you had a right to be rehired back to the company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">A: I guess I didn\u2019t feel that I had a right to be rehired back. I felt that in good faith they should have hired me back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b632 Kneeland admitted that there was no representation or policy by Luzenac that established a duty or obligation for the company to hire him back at any time in the future. He admitted that he understood at the time he was terminated that his separation from Luzenac was permanent. Furthermore, he cannot establish the existence of a contract or special relationship that would support a claim for post-termination bad fath.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b633 We determine that Kneeland\u2019s tort claim is not actionable under the WDFEA and is also precluded by the Act because he cannot establish a basis for the claim aside from his discharge in 1994. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court was correct in granting summary judgment to Luzenac and denying Kneeland\u2019s claim for post-termination bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">\u00b634 Did the District Court properly instruct the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">\u00b63 5  We have previously stated that the district court has discretion when it decides how to instruct the jury, taking into consideration the parties\u2019 theories, and that we will not overturn the court\u2019s decision absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Cechovic v. Hardin &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 104, 116, 902 P.2d 520, 527. When we examine whether jury instructions were properly given or refused, we consider the instructions in their entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and the evidence at trial. <em>Cechovic, </em>273 Mont. at 116, 902 P.2d at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">\u00b636  First, Kneeland argues that the District Court erred when it refused Kneeland\u2019s proposed Instruction No. 4. Instruction No. 4, given by the District Court, to which Kneeland objected, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">A discharge is wrongful if it is done without good cause or if the employer violated the express provisions of its own written personnel policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Under Montana law, \u201cdischarge\u201d includes any termination of employment, including resignation, elimination of the job, layoff for lack of work, or any other cutback in the number of employees for legitimate business reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b637 Kneeland\u2019s proposed Instruction No. 4 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">\u201cDischarge\u201d includes a constructive discharge as defined in subsection (1) and any other termination of employment, including resignation, elimination of the job, layoff for lack of work, failure to recall or rehire, and any other cutback in the number of employees for a legitimate business reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Kneeland requested this instruction based on his contention that Luzenac\u2019s failure to rehire him is actionable under WDFEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b638 Although not entirely clear, it appears that Kneeland attempted to bring his \u201cfailure to rehire claim\u201d back within the auspices of the WDFEA during the jury trial. Kneeland\u2019s proposed Instruction No. 4 included the \u201cfailure to recall or rehire\u201d language contained in the definition of discharge provided in \u00a7 39-2-903(2), MCA. In the pretrial proceedings, however, Kneeland maintained that the defendant\u2019s post-termination conduct was outside the purview of the WDFEA. As stated above, we have concluded that the District Court was correct in dismissing on summary judgment Kneeland\u2019s claim that Luzenac was liable for a separate and independent tort of post-termination bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b639 We determine that Kneeland\u2019s claim that Luzenac is liable for wrongful discharge because it failed to rehire or recall him is also without merit. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court properly instructed the jury in the court\u2019s Instruction No. 4. This was not a situation where the \u201cfailure to recall or rehire\u201d language should have been included in the definition of \u201cdischarge.\u201d Kneeland testified at length that he considered his termination from Luzenac to be permanent. He was not temporarily laid off or in a recall status. <em>See Arnold v. Boise Cascade Corp. </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 259, 856 P.2d 217. Kneeland was permanently separated and received a severance. Thus, we hold that the District Court properly exercised its discretion in giving the court\u2019s Instruction No. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u00b640  Next, Kneeland argues that the District Court erred by instructing the jury on the defense of failure to complete an internal appeal procedure. Kneeland claims that the court erred in allowing Luzenac to present as a defense Kneeland\u2019s failure to complete the company\u2019s internal appeal process. Kneeland argues that since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Luzenac did not assert his failure to complete the internal grievance process as an affirmative defense in this action, the jury should not have considered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b641 On October 17,1996, the parties discussed the settlement of instructions before the case was turned over to the jury. Instruction No. 8 given by the District Court reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">If an employer maintains written internal procedures under which the employee may appeal a discharge within the organizational structure of the employer, the employee shall first exhaust those procedures prior to filing a wrongful discharge action. The employee\u2019s failure to initiate or exhaust available internal procedures is a defense to a wrongful discharge claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This instruction was based on \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA, which states that an \u201cemployee\u2019s failure to initiate or exhaust available internal procedures is a defense to an action brought under this part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b642 Luzenac counters that Kneeland made no objection when the court and the parties settled the instructions. Moreover, Luzenac argues that this affirmative defense was included within the pretrial order jointly prepared by both parties before the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u00b643 This Court has previously held that, generally, a failure to object to a jury instruction at the trial level amounts to a waiver of the right to raise the objection on appeal. <em>State v. Holzapfel </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 105, 113, 748 P.2d 953, 957. The instruction which is given without objection becomes the law of the case. <em>Wisher v. Higgs </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 132, 143, 849 P.2d 152, 158. The transcript shows that both parties and the court thoroughly discussed Luzenac\u2019s proposed jury instruction that became Instruction No. 8. After reviewing the transcript, we note that Kneeland did not object to Instruction No. 8. Thus, because Kneeland did not object, we determine that Instruction No. 8 was properly before the jury. Furthermore, Kneeland was put on notice by Luzenac to this affirmative defense in the pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">\u00b644  Was there substantial evidence to support the jury verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"AQy\">\u00b645  In <em>Lee v. Kane </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 505, 893 P.2d 854, this Court discussed our standard ofreview of a jury verdict in a civil case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX2\">Our scope of review of jury verdicts is necessarily very limited. This Court will not reverse a jury verdict which is supported by substantial credible evidence. This Court has defined substantial credible evidence as evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. The evidence may be in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>herently weak and conflicting, yet it may still be considered substantial. It is well established that if the evidence is conflicting, it is within the province of the jury to determine the weight and credibility to be afforded the evidence. Finally, upon reviewing a jury verdict to determine if substantial credible evidence exists to support the verdict, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><em>Kane, </em>270 Mont. at 510-11, 893 P.2d at 857 (quoting <em>Hansen v. Hansen </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 152, 157, 835 P.2d 748, 750-51).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b646 Kneeland argues that the jury verdict is not supported by substantial evidence. However, outside of discounting the credibility of the witnesses that testified, his brief contains nothing to support his contention that \u201cthe evidence at trial raised the direct and inescapable conclusion that [Luzenac] was guilty of a pattern of selective and disparate treatment of Kneeland over a course of years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b647 As Luzenac points out, it presented testimony regarding the treatment of the mine\u2019s employees during the downsizing. Luzenac offered testimony through Toelle stating the reasons for the mine\u2019s downsizing and how the process was carried out. He testified that all decisions were based on the consensus of a committee comprised of different department heads, managers, and supervisors. Toelle testified that Luzenac tried to avoid as many layoffs as possible by offering early retirement and voluntary resignation packages to any employee who wanted to leave. Toelle also explained that Kneeland was not qualified for the positions he sought or had less seniority than the people ultimately chosen for those positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b648 Furthermore, upon questioning by Luzenac, Kneeland admitted that although he believed that the review committee had an ulterior motive against him, his accusations were not based on any evidence, but were merely speculation. Kneeland also admitted that he tried to bid for or bump into positions which were awarded to employees who had more seniority than he did or who were more qualified than he was, and that he bid for a position that was not available for bidding or bumping.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b649 As for Kneeland\u2019s claim that he should have been hired for one of the positions that became available after Luzenac acquired Montana Talc Company, he admitted that his termination was permanent and that he had no recall rights. Also, as we have stated above, there is no factual or legal basis to Kneeland\u2019s claim that Luzenac had a duty to rehire him following the reduction of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u00b650 In denying Kneeland\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-4\">The suggestion that the evidence of wrongful discharge was \u2018overwhelming\u2019 is not sustained by the record. The evidence was \u2018overwhelming\u2019 sustaining Defendant\u2019s positions, not Plaintiff\u2019s. The unanimous verdict confirms the assessment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">This Court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b651 It is within the province of the jury to determine the weight to be given to evidence presented and to judge the credibility of witnesses, and in reviewing the jury\u2019s verdict we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>See Hogan v. Flathead Health Center, Inc. </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 388, 842 P.2d 335; <em>Silvis Through Silvis v. Hobbs </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 407, 824 P.2d 1013. We conclude that when the evidence in this case is viewed in the light most favorable to Luzenac, the jury\u2019s verdict is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b652  Did the District Court err in denying Kneeland\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law, and motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\u00b653  The standard of review in appeals from the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, made pursuant to Rule 50(b), M.R.Civ.R, is the same as that formerly used for review of a motion for a directed verdict, and may be granted only where it appears as a matter of law that a party could not prevail upon any view of the evidence including the legitimate inferences to be drawn therefrom. <em>Wilkerson v. School District </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 203, 211, 700 P.2d 617, 622. Motions for judgment as a matter of law are proper only when there is a complete absence of any evidence to warrant submission to a jury. <em>Durden v. Hydro Flame Corp., </em>1998 MT 47, \u00b621, [288 Mont. _], 955 P.2d 160, (citing <em>Jacques v. Montana Nat\u2019l Guard </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 493, 504, 649 P.2d 1319, 1325). Courts must exercise the greatest self-restraint in interfering with the constitutionally mandated processes of jury decision. Unless there is a complete absence of any credible evidence in support of the verdict, a judgment as a matter of law motion is not properly granted. <em>Ryan v. City of Bozeman </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 507, 510, 928 P.2d 228, 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">\u00b654 Our review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Hando v. PPG Industries, Inc. </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 146, 149, 900 P.2d 281, 283. Our review of an appeal based upon insufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>is whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the verdict. <em>Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assur. Society of U.S. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 1, 23, 914 P.2d 976, 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b655 On October 17, 1996, at the close of Luzenac\u2019s case in chief, Kneeland made an oral motion for judgment as a matter of law, indicating that the evidence was overwhelming that Kneeland was, in some respects, the most qualified and senior employee and should not have been passed over for jobs at the mine. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AGv\">\u00b656 On November 1,1996, after the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Luzenac, Kneeland filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, or alternatively, for a new trial. In his motion, Kneeland argued that the general verdict form was improper, Instruction No. 8 regarding the internal grievance procedure was misleading and prejudicial, and that the evidence was overwhelmingly in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b657 In an order filed on November 29, 1996, the court denied Kneeland\u2019s motion. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">The suggestion that the evidence of wrongful discharge was \u2018overwhelming\u2019 is not sustained by the record. The evidence was \u2018overwhelming\u2019 sustaining Defendant\u2019s position, not Plaintiff\u2019s. The unanimous verdict confirms the assessment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">The Plaintiff now objects to the general verdict form which according to the record was agreed to by both parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">In summary, in the Court\u2019s view, Plaintiff\u2019s post trial motions are totally without merit....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u00b658 We agree with the assessment of the District Court. As stated above, we have concluded that Instruction No. 8 was proper for the jury to consider in resolving this action. Moreover, Kneeland did not object to the instruction or the general verdict form before it was submitted to the jury. Furthermore, as also stated above, the jury\u2019s verdict is supported by substantial credible evidence. The evidence was not overwhelming for Kneeland\u2019s position, rather the evidence was overwhelming in support of Luzenac\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\u00b659 In conclusion, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Kneeland\u2019s oral motion for judgment as a matter of law, nor did the court abuse its discretion in denying Kneeland\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\u00b660 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\">. While Kneeland, Luzenac, and the District Court refer to Kneeland\u2019s Rule 50, M.R.Civ.P., motion as a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, Rule 50 was amended by order of this Court, effective March 26,1993, to do away with the terms \u201cjudgment notwithstanding the verdict\u201d and \u201cdirected verdict.\u201d The proper term is \u201cjudgment as a matter of law.\u201d Therefore, for purposes of clarity, we will refer to Kneeland\u2019s motion, and all other motions, as \u201cmotions for judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
