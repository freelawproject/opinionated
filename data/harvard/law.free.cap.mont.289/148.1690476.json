We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">\u00b62 In April 1996, Kevin Connor, d/b/a Kevin Connor Construction (Connor), filed a lien foreclosure action against Michael J. Zimmerman and Gail L. Zimmerman (Zimmermans). That cause of action, Lewis and Clark County Cause No. ADV 96-438, was tried to a jury in December 1997, and resulted in a verdict for Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">\u00b63 In the instant cause of action, Zimmermans claim that Connor contracted with Zimmermans to remodel and expand the business premises of Zimmermans in Helena, Montana, known as the \u201cCountry Kitchen.\u201d Zimmermans contend that Connor negligently failed to protect the roof of the building from heavy rain during the construction process with the result that the building was damaged by flooding. Zimmermans claim various damages as a result of Connor\u2019s al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>leged negligence, including structural damages, loss of income, loss of rent and other expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b64 Connor moved to dismiss Zimmermans\u2019 complaint contending that Rule 13(a), M.R.Civ.R, precluded Zimmermans from litigating their cause of action because their claims were compulsory counterclaims that were required to have been asserted in the lien foreclosure action which Connor filed against Zimmermans. Following briefing, the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, ruled on the basis of our decision in <em>Julian v. Mattson </em>(1985), 219 Mont. 145, 710 P.2d 707, that Zimmermans\u2019 claims were in fact compulsory counterclaims in the lien foreclosure action and that as such, Zimmermans\u2019 complaint was barred, and was subject to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"ABn\">\u00b65 This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b66 The sole issue on appeal is whether the court correctly concluded that the claims in Zimmermans\u2019 complaint were compulsory counterclaims under Rule 13(a), M.R.Civ.R</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b67  The District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint on the basis of Rule 13(a), M.R.Civ.R, is a conclusion of law. We review the legal conclusions of a trial court <em>de novo. </em>We simply determine whether the tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. See <em>Boreen v. Christensen </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 405, 408, 884 P.2d 761, 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">\u00b68 Rule 13(a), M.R.Civ.R, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">Compulsory counterclaims. A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. But the pleader need not state the claim if (1) at the time the action was commenced the claim was the subject of another pending action, or (2) the opposing party brought suit upon the claim by attachment or.other process by which the court did not acquire jurisdiction to render a personal judgment on that claim, and the pleader is not stating any counterclaim under this Rule 13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u00b69 [2] As stated in our decision in <em>First Bank Missoula v. District Court </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 515, 737 P.2d 1132, the purpose of this requirement is to avoid a multiplicity of suits by requiring the parties to adjust, in one action, their various differences growing out of any given transaction. <em>First Bank Missoula, </em>226 Mont. at 521, 737 P.2d at 1135 (citing <em>Friedrichsen v. Cobb </em>(1929), 84 Mont. 238, 275 P. 267). \u201cThis insures that only one judicial proceeding is required to settle all matters determinable by the facts or law and to bring all logically related claims into a single litigation.\u201d <em>First Bank Missoula, </em>226 Mont. at 521, 737 P.2d at 1135-36 (citing <em>Julian, </em>219 Mont. 145, 710 P.2d 707).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b610 As we pointed out in <em>First Bank Missoula:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">Since a claim which \u201carises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim\u201d must be pleaded or is barred, it is important to understand what the quoted phrase means. The United States Supreme Court defined \u201ctransaction\u201d as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\u201c\u2018Transaction\u2019 is a word of flexible meaning. It may comprehend a series of many occurrence[s], depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship... It is the one circumstance without which neither party would have found it necessary to seek relief. Essential facts alleged by appellant enter into and constitute in part the cause of action set forth in the counterclaim. That they are not precisely identical, or that the counterclaim embraces additional allegations ... does not matter. To hold otherwise would be to rob this branch of the rule of all serviceable meaning, since the facts relied upon by the plaintiff rarely, if ever, are, in all particulars, the same as those constituting the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.\u201d <em>Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange </em>(1926), 270 U.S. 593, 610, 46 S.Ct. 367, 371, 70 L.Ed. 750, 757.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-9\"><em>First Bank Missoula, </em>226 Mont. at 521-22, 737 P.2d at 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\u00b611 Moreover, in <em>Turtainen v. Poulsen </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 355, 792 P.2d 1089, we stated that even though two lawsuits may require different proof, identical evidence is not required for compulsory counterclaims. Rather, all that is required is that the claims be logically related. <em>Turtainen, </em>243 Mont. at 359, 792 P.2d at 1092 (citing <em>First Bank, </em>226 Mont. at 521-22, 737 P.2d at 1136).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u00b612  Finally, Rule 13, M.R.Civ.R, makes no distinction between legal and equitable counterclaims or suits but only between compulsory and permissive counterclaims. If a defendant\u2019s counterclaim is compulsory it must be pleaded regardless of whether the plaintiff\u2019s suit is legal or equitable in nature, and, if not pleaded, a compulsory counterclaim will be barred. <em>Turtainen, </em>243 Mont. at 359, 792 P.2d at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b613 In <em>Connor v. Zimmerman, </em>Cause No. ADV 96-438, Connor sued to foreclose a construction lien which it claimed against the business premises of Zimmermans and arising out of Connor\u2019s construction contract. Zimmermans\u2019 claims in the case at bar arise out of the construction contract. In fact, Zimmermans\u2019 answer in Connor\u2019s lien foreclosure suit sets up a second affirmative defense and counterclaim as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">With respect to the allegations in paragraph V of [Connor\u2019s] complaint, [Zimmermans] allege that the Country Kitchen commercial building sustained serious damage as a result of certain flooding which occurred on July 10,1995, which flooding occurred because of negligence on the part of [Connor]. One of the results of said flooding was that [Connor] and [Zimmermans] did then agree to share some of the effort toward getting the commercial building remodeled and rehabilitated. Prior to the flooding there had been a bid given by [Connor] to [Zimmermans] which [Zimmermans] had accepted. Following the flooding much of the items which were to be furnished by [Connor] were instead furnished by [Zimmermans] and paid for by [Zimmermans],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b614 Furthermore, in paragraph V of Zimmermans\u2019 second affirmative defense and counterclaim in Connor\u2019s suit, Zimmermans contended that they were damaged as a result of Connor\u2019s negligence and that even without such negligence they had paid all sums owing which Connor\u2019s claimed in his lien foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u00b615  Under the circumstances, we conclude that Zimmermans\u2019 claims in the case at bar arise out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of Connor\u2019s claims in his lien foreclosure action. Moreover, while Zimmermans claim that the two causes of action involve different witnesses, they have failed to demonstrate that the adjudication of their counterclaim against Connor would have required the presence of third parties over whom the court could not acquire jurisdiction. Furthermore, and contrary to Zimmermans\u2019 argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ment, the fact that Connor\u2019s claim and Zimmermans\u2019 counterclaim have a different legal basis and require different proof and evidence, does not defeat application of the compulsory counterclaim rule, providing that, as in this case, the claims and counterclaims are logically related because they arise out of a single transaction. <em>First Bank Missoula, </em>226 Mont. at 522, 737 P.2d at 1136; <em>Turtainen, </em>243 Mont. at 359, 792 P.2d at 1092. Finally, neither of the exceptions set forth in the final sentence of Rule 13(a), M.R.Civ.P., is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b616 As previously mentioned, the District Court relied on our decision in <em>Julian. </em>While Zimmermans attempt to distinguish the case at bar from the facts <em>o\u00ed Julian, </em>we conclude that <em>Julian </em>is persuasive authority for the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal. Our decision in <em>Julian </em>was preceded by our opinion in <em>Mattson v. Julian </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 48, 678 P.2d 654. <em>Mattson </em>arose out of a transaction where a property owner entered into a contract for construction work on his property. Upon completion of the work, the contractor sued the owner for payment on the contract. The owner, however, failed to properly plead a compulsory counterclaim based on his claim of defective work for which he sought recoupment. The trial court refused evidence of the defective workmanship claim since there was no properly pleaded counterclaim. <em>Mattson, </em>209 Mont. at 53, 678 P.2d at 657. Citing Rule 13(a), M.R.Civ.P, we held that the owner was not entitled to present evidence of defective performance inasmuch as he had not pleaded or otherwise given notice of his defects theory prior to trial by way of a compulsory counterclaim. <em>Mattson, </em>209 Mont. at 54, 678 P.2d at 657-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b617 Following our decision in <em>Mattson, </em>Julian sued, pleading the same claim that was concluded to be the compulsory counterclaim in <em>Mattson. </em>In affirming the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the defendant/contractor, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">This Court has defined the term transaction as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\u2018\u201cthat combination of acts and events, circumstances and defaults, which, viewed in one aspect, results in the plaintiff\u2019s right of action, and viewed in another aspect, results in the defendant\u2019s right of action\u2019(Cite omitted.), and it \u2018applies to any dealings of the parties resulting in wrong, without regard to whether the wrong be done by violence, neglect or breach of contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scott v. Waggoner </em>(1914), 48 Mont. 536, 545, 139 P. 454, 456.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\"><em>Julian, </em>219 Mont. at 148, 710 P.2d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u00b618 The instant case is different from <em>Julian </em>only in that Zimmermans did file a counterclaim against Connor but then chose not to pursue their counterclaim in the lien foreclosure suit but, instead, opted to file a second cause of action. Since Zimmermans\u2019 counterclaim was a compulsory counterclaim in Connor\u2019s lien foreclosure action, the effect of Zimmermans\u2019 failure to litigate their counterclaim in that action is <em>res judicata. First Bank </em>Missoula, 226 Mont. at 522-23, 737 P.2d at 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b619 We conclude that the District Court correctly ruled that Zimmermans\u2019 claim should have been pursued as a mandatory counterclaim in Connor\u2019s foreclosure action and that, thus, their instant cause of action is barred. We hold that the District Court properly dismissed Zimmermans\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b178-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
