The District Court issued a writ of certiorari, and on July 3,1997, issued an opinion and order affirming the denial of Sutey Oil\u2019s special use permit. It is from the court\u2019s July 3,1997, order that Sutey Oil presently appeals. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b62 The sole dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in concluding that the Board of Adjustment did not abuse its discretion in denying Sutey Oil\u2019s application for a special use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b63 Sutey Oil owns a business establishment known as the Thriftway Super Stop #7, located in Anaconda, Montana. In early 1994, David Sutey, the president of Sutey Oil, became interested in expanding his business by adding a room with four or five gambling machines. Sutey contacted the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Planning Department, and spoke with permit official Scott H. Hurley about the possibility of adding gambling machines to his establishment. The record indicates that the two did not, however, discuss the possibility that Sutey might seek a beer and wine license.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">\u00b64 On April 5,1994, Hurley wrote to Sutey and advised him \u201cthat Thriftway Super Stops <em>would not </em>be required to file for and obtain a special use permit for the establishment of gambling machines\u201d because the \u201cestablishment is deemed as an expansion of an existing retail and service use.\u201d Although Hurley did not specifically address the possibility that Sutey might be required to obtain a special use permit were he to seek a beer and wine license, Hurley did note that Thriftway would have to adhere to \u201call county and state requirements ... before the commencement of any type of construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">\u00b65 Sutey obtained a building permit and began remodeling his facility. On January 9,1995, Sutey submitted an application to the State Liquor Division for a retail on-premises consumption beer and wine license. In March 1995, the State Liquor Division notified Ana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>conda-Deer Lodge County of Sutey\u2019s application to provide the county with \u201cthe opportunity to evaluate whether the applicant has met all laws and ordinances your office is responsible for regulating.\u201d It was upon receipt of this notice that the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Planning Department first learned that the expansion proposed by Sutey would not only include gambling machines, but would also involve the issuance of a retail on-premises consumption beer and wine license.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b66 On March 20, 1995, James Manning, the Planning Director of Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, advised the State Liquor Division that the county \u201cwould strongly protest the issuance of a on-premise license for Thriftway Super Stop of Anaconda #7.\u201d Manning explained that \u201can on-premise consumption license for this location would constitute a change in use for the premises,\u201d and that \u201cto be in compliance with Zoning regulations, a Special Use Permit would need to be approved by the Planning Board.\u201d Sutey received a copy of Manning\u2019s letter, and filed an application for a special use permit with Anaconda-Deer Lodge County on March 30,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b67 On April 20,1995, the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Planning Board held a public hearing to address Sutey Oil\u2019s application for a special use permit. Following public comment, the Planning Board denied Sutey Oil\u2019s application. On April 21, 1995, Manning wrote a letter to Sutey Oil, explaining that the Planning Board had denied its application for a special use permit, and advising it of its right to appeal to the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Board of Adjustment. Sutey Oil pursued an appeal, and on May 17,1995, the Board of Adjustment held a public hearing during which it voted to uphold the Planning Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b68 On June 7,1995, Sutey Oil filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in District Court, asking that the court review the Planning Board\u2019s and the Board of Adjustment\u2019s denial of its application for a special use permit. The District Court issued a writ of certiorari on October 11, 1995. On November 25, 1996, following review of the record and oral argument, the court issued an opinion rejecting Sutey Oil\u2019s equitable estoppel argument, but remanding the case \u201cto the Planning Board for determination of the basis for denial of Petitioner\u2019s Special Use Permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b69 The Planning Board met on December 2,1996, and explained its \u201creason for denying the Special Use Permit for Sutey Oil, Thriftway West, to acquire an on-premise beer/wine license, is that it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>incompatible to neighboring land which is designated single family residential land use.\u201d On July 3,1997, the District Court issued a second opinion and order in which it affirmed the Planning Board\u2019s denial of Sutey Oil\u2019s application for a special use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b610 Pursuant to \u00a7 27-25-102(2), MCA, the district court may grant a writ of certiorari, or writ of review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">when a lower tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial functions has exceeded the jurisdiction of the tribunal, board, or officer and there is no appeal or, in the judgment of the court, any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b611 Ordinarily, the district court\u2019s scope of review upon a writ of certiorari \u201ccannot be extended further than to determine whether the inferior tribunal, board, or officer has regularly pursued the authority of such tribunal, board, or officer.\u201d Section 27-25-303, MCA. In a case involving an appeal from a decision by the Board of Adjustment, however, \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA, provides the district court with a broader scope of review than that generally available upon a writ of certiorari. For example, \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA, provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">(1) Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment or any taxpayer or any officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">(2) Upon the presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the board of adjustment to review such decision of the board of adjustment....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">(3) If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with his findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the court shall be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">(4) The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">\u00b612  Although \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA, contemplates relief by certiorari, it simultaneously authorizes the reviewing court to hold a hearing and reverse, affirm, or modify a decision made by the Board of Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>justment. In so doing, \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA, clearly provides the district court with a broader scope of review than that generally available upon a writ of certiorari. <em>See Bryant Development Ass\u2019n v. Dagel </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 252, 257, 531 P.2d 1320, 1323 (interpreting identical language in \u00a7 16-1706, RCM (1947)). Thus, the District Court in this case was bound to review the Board of Adjustment\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b613 Having identified the standard by which the District Court is bound to review the Board of Adjustment\u2019s decision, we must now determine the standard by which we are bound to review the District Court\u2019s decision. In so doing, we turn first to the terms of \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA, which specifically empower the district court to \u201ctake evidence\u201d if \u201cnecessary for the proper disposition of the matter.\u201d In <em>Lambros v. Board of Adjustment of Missoula </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 20, 26, 452 P.2d 398, 401, we held that \u201cupon review of a determination by a district court where it is hearing a petition for variance and takes additional testimony the question for this Court to determine is whether the court committed an abuse of discretion.\u201d Indeed, in cases where the district court exercises its statutory option to take additional evidence, we have consistently reviewed the district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion and to determine whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Whistler v. Burlington Northern R.R. Co. </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 150, 155, 741 P.2d 422, 425 (noting that district court \u201creceived evidence indicating that the decision itself was reasonable,\u201d and holding the district court\u2019s conclusion was \u201csupported by substantial, credible evidence\u201d); <em>Cutone v. Anaconda Deer Lodge </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 515, 518, 610 P.2d 691, 693 (where district court \u201callowed the appellant a full hearing and testimony was introduced by both parties,\u201d we reviewed the court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b614  In the present case, review of the record indicates that the District Court did not take any additional witness testimony during the oral argument held on September 18,1996. Although the court did not take any additional evidence during the parties\u2019 oral argument, the parties did supplement the record with affidavits from David Sutey and Brian Bossard. Because the District Court exercised its statutory option and took additional evidence before making its decision, we review the District Court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b615 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in concluding the Board of Adjustment did not abuse its discretion in denying Sutey Oil\u2019s application for a special use permit?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b616  On appeal, Sutey Oil argues the District Court erred in upholding the Board of Adjustment\u2019s decision on several grounds. Sutey Oil first argues that, pursuant to Chapter XII of the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Development Permit System, its proposed gaming facility was a permitted use, and it was thus not required to obtain a special use permit. Even assuming it were required to secure a special use permit, however, Sutey Oil argues the District Court erred in affirming the Board of Adjustment\u2019s decision in the absence of any evidence that the proposed expansion would materially or adversely impact any of the zoning regulation criteria set forth in \u00a7 76-2-304, MCA, and recognized by this Court in <em>Lowe v. City of Missoula </em>(1974), 165 Mont. 38, 41, 525 P.2d 551, 552-53. Finally, Sutey Oil argues Anaconda-Deer Lodge County was equitably estopped from denying Sutey Oil\u2019s application in light of permit official Hurley\u2019s initial opinion that Sutey Oil <em>\u201cwould not </em>be required to file for and obtain a special use permit for the establishment of gambling machines.\u201d Based on the foregoing, Sutey Oil argues the District Court erred in affirming the Board of Adjustment\u2019s denial of its application for a special use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">A. <em>Necessity of special use permit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b617 As noted, Sutey Oil first argues the provisions of the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Development Permit System did not require that it obtain a special use permit in this case. Sutey Oil points specifically to Chapter XII of the County\u2019s Development Permit System which governs development in the Highway Commercial Development District in which Sutey Oil\u2019s Thriftway Super Store is located. Sutey Oil argues that the expansion it proposed constituted a permitted use pursuant to the provisions of Chapter XII, and asserts it was thus not required to obtain a special use permit. Because it did not need a special use permit, Sutey Oil argues, that the Planning Board subsequently denied its application \u201cshould have no legal effect upon Mr. Sutey\u2019s right to operate a gaming room and acquire an on-premise beer and wine license at his present commercial location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWG\">\u00b618 In response, respondents note that Sutey Oil did not appeal the Development Permit System administrator\u2019s decision to require a special use permit in this case, but instead \u201cagreed to follow the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>cess and submitted an application for a special use permit.\u201d Respondents assert that, because Sutey Oil did not appeal from the Development Permit System administrator\u2019s decision requiring that it obtain a special use permit, Sutey Oil failed to exhaust its administrative remedies on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b619 Neither the District Court\u2019s initial order remanding this case to the Planning Board, nor its final decision affirming the Board of Adjustment\u2019s decision contain a discussion regarding the propriety of the Development Permit System administrator\u2019s decision requiring that Sutey Oil obtain a special use permit to proceed with its proposed expansion. Moreover, nowhere does Sutey Oil dispute the respondents\u2019 assertion that it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and is thus precluded from objecting on appeal to the requirement that it secure a special use permit. In light of the foregoing, we decline to address Sutey Oil\u2019s argument that it should not have been required to secure a special use permit under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">B. <em>Review of Planning Board and Board of Adjustment decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ap8\">\u00b620 Sutey Oil next argues the District Court erred in affirming the Board of Adjustment\u2019s decision denying its application for a special use permit because there existed no evidence that the proposed expansion would materially or adversely impact any of the statutory zoning regulation criteria set forth in \u00a7 76-2-304, MCA, and recognized by this Court in <em>Lowe, </em>165 Mont. at 41, 515 P.2d at 552-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b621 Sutey Oil argues it was incumbent upon the Planning Board, in making its decision regarding Sutey Oil\u2019s application for a special use permit, to consider and comply with the following statutory provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">76-2-304. Purposes of zoning. (1) Such regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">(2) Such regulation shall be made with reasonable consideration, among other things, to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout such municipality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u00b622 Relying on our decision in <em>Lowe, </em>Sutey Oil argues the Planning Board was compelled to consider and comply with the criteria set forth in \u00a7 76-2-304, MCA, in making its decision regarding Sutey Oil\u2019s application for a special use permit. In <em>Lowe, </em>we concluded the district court had abused its discretion in upholding a decision by the Missoula City Council to adopt a rezoning ordinance. <em>Lowe, </em>165 Mont. at 41, 525 P.2d at 553. In so concluding, we considered the twelve criteria set forth in \u00a7 76-2-304, MCA, and held the factual information upon which the Missoula City Council had relied in adopting the rezoning ordinance at issue was so lacking, that its action, as well as that of the district court, constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>Lowe, </em>165 Mont. at 41, 525 P.2d at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b623 In the present case, Sutey Oil argues the Planning Board\u2019s decision to deny Sutey Oil\u2019s application for a special use permit on the grounds that the proposed use \u201cwould be incompatible to neighboring land which is designated single family residential land use,\u201d does not take into account the statutory criteria set forth in \u00a7 76-2-304, MCA. Sutey Oil asserts \u201c[t]here has been absolutely no evidence that the operation of on-premises gambling of the type that was to be used in this convenience store would materially or adversely impact any of those mandatory criteria outlined in \u00a7 76-2-304, MCA.\u201d In light of the foregoing, Sutey Oil suggests, the Planning Board abused its discretion in denying Sutey Oil\u2019s application for a special use permit and the District Court erred in affirming the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b624 Upon remand, the Planning Board explained that it was denying Sutey Oil\u2019s application because the proposed expansion \u201cwould be incompatible to neighboring land which is designated single family residential land use.\u201d Moreover, the Planning Board noted that \u201c[t]he Public Hearing, held on April 20,1995, clearly indicated that the adjoining neighborhood did believe that the beer/wine license would have a detrimental impact on the neighborhood designated for single family residential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b625 As discussed above, we review the District Court\u2019s order upholding the Board of Adjustment\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lambros, </em>153 Mont. at 26, 452 P.2d at 401. In its order affirming the Board of Adjustment\u2019s decision, the District Court rejected Sutey Oil\u2019s argument that it was necessary for the Planning Board to specifically evaluate each of the twelve criteria set forth in \u00a7 76-2-304, MCA, before making a decision with respect to Sutey Oil\u2019s application. Instead, the court noted that the Planning Board had acted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>accordance with the terms of its authority pursuant to the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Development Permit System, which provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">The purpose of the special use permit procedure is to implement the plan by requiring intensive public review of any development that may have a significant impact on the landscape setting, neighboring land uses, or public facilities and services, and requiring that such developments comply with performance standards designed to assure their compatibility with the landscape setting, neighboring land uses, and the capacity of public facilities and services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b626 By its terms, the County\u2019s Development Permit System required that the Planning Board ensure that proposed developments \u201ccomply with performance standards designed to assure their compatibility with... neighboring land uses.\u201d In denying Sutey Oil\u2019s application on the grounds of incompatibility with neighboring land use, the Planning Board was thus acting within its authority pursuant to the express terms of the County\u2019s Development Permit System.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b627 In its order upholding the Board of Adjustment\u2019s decision, the District Court improperly identified its scope of review as that traditionally available upon a writ of certiorari, and thus primarily discussed the question of whether the Planning Board had acted legally and within its jurisdiction in denying Sutey Oil\u2019s application for a special use permit. Although the court set forth the incorrect standard of review, it nevertheless concluded that the Planning Board \u201chad sufficient information upon which to base its denial of Petitioner\u2019s Special Use Permit.\u201d That the court so concluded indicates it additionally reviewed the Planning Board\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b628 Although the District Court did not discuss the basis for its determination that the Planning Board had sufficient information upon which to base its decision, review of the record indicates the court did not abuse its discretion in so concluding. More specifically, the minutes from the Planning Board\u2019s April 20,1995, public meeting chronicle testimony from a number of citizens concerned about the impact of the proposed expansion. For example, citizens voiced concerns regarding property values, increased traffic, parking problems, and raising their children in the vicinity of an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic beverages. Having reviewed the record, we conclude the District Court did not err in holding the Planning Board had suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>cient evidence before it upon which it could base its decision denying Sutey Oil\u2019s application for a special use permit. Accordingly, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in upholding the Board of Adjustment\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">C. <em>Equitable estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b629 Sutey Oil points to the District Court\u2019s November 25,1996, order and argues the court erred in concluding Anaconda-Deer Lodge County was not equitably estopped from denying Sutey Oil\u2019s request for gaming machines in light of permit official Hurley\u2019s initial opinion that Sutey Oil <em>\u201cwould not </em>be required to file for and obtain a special use permit for the establishment of gambling machines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b630 Respondents, in contrast, argue that the District Court\u2019s review upon a writ of certiorari \u201ccannot be extended further than to determine whether the inferior tribunal, board, or officer has regularly pursued the authority of such tribunal, board, or officer.\u201d Section 27-25-303, MCA. Respondents thus assert that \u201cequitable estoppel is not an available remedy\u201d in light of the limited scope of review available pursuant to a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b631 Having already recognized that the scope of review available upon an appeal from a decision by the Board of Adjustment is broader than that generally available upon a writ of certiorari, we will turn to the merits of Sutey Oil\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u00b632  In its November 25,1996, order, the District Court held that, were it \u201cto consider equitable estoppel, it would find in favor of Respondent.\u201d More specifically, the court determined that Sutey Oil had failed to demonstrate \u201cconduct, acts, language, or silence amounting to a representation or a concealment of material facts,\u201d and had thus failed to demonstrate the first element of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u00b633 In <em>Dagel v. City of Great Falls </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 224, 234, 819 P.2d 186, 192, we indeed recognized that one of the six essential elements of equitable estoppel is that \u201cthere must be conduct, acts, language, or silence amounting to a representation or a concealment of material facts.\u201d In the present case, although Hurley initially advised Sutey Oil that it <em>\u201cwould not </em>be required to file for and obtain a special use permit for the establishment of gambling machines,\u201d he also instructed Sutey Oil to adhere to \u201call county and state requirements ... before the commencement of any type of construction.\u201d Moreover, as the District Court noted, \u201cthere is nothing in the record about beer or wine on-premises consumption until March of 1995.\u201d Based on the foregoing, we hold, as did the District Court, that \u201c[t]he record does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>not reveal any conduct, act, language, or silence on the part of Anaconda-Deer Lodge County which would lend itself to estoppel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-5\">JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
