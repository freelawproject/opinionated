Pipkin moved to suppress all evidence seized pursuant to the State\u2019s search warrant on the ground that the warrant was not directed to a specific peace officer as required by \u00a7 46-5-223, MCA, and that it had not been served by a peace officer named in the warrant, as required by \u00a7 46-5-226, MCA. That motion was granted and the evidence seized at Pipkin\u2019s residence was suppressed. The State appeals the District Court\u2019s order of suppression pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-103(2)(e), MCA. We reverse the District Court\u2019s suppression order.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it concluded that the State violated Pipkin\u2019s substantial rights and, therefore, suppressed all evidence seized pursuant to the State\u2019s search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">\u00b63 On May 20, 1997, Deputy Darrell Chenoweth, of the Sanders County Sheriff\u2019s Department applied for a search warrant from Sanders County Justice of the Peace Bob Beitz. Chenoweth made the application under oath and swore to the accuracy of the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>contained in the application. Chenoweth described with particularity the places to be searched and described the items to be seized.</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">\u00b64 Judge Beitz issued the search warrant on May 20, 1997, based upon the sworn application of Deputy Chenoweth. The search warrant described with particularity the locations authorized to be searched and the items subject to seizure. Judge Beitz stated in the warrant that he was \u201csatisfied that there is probable cause\u201d to believe that the items indicative of criminal conduct that are described in the search warrant application were located at the property described. The face sheet of the warrant is a printed form which includes the salutation: \u201cThe State of Montana to:_.\u201d Deputy Chenoweth\u2019s name was not inserted following the salutary language. For some reason, the space was left blank. The first line of the opening paragraph, however, states: \u201cA sworn application having been made before me by Deputy Darrell Chenoweth ...\u201d After signing the search warrant, Judge Beitz personally delivered it to Chenoweth.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b65 On the same date, May 20,1997, Chenoweth executed the search warrant by searching the residence and outbuildings owned and occupied by the defendant, Joni Marie Pipkin, and her husband. During that search, Chenoweth, along with other Missoula law enforcement officers, seized marijuana plants, drug paraphernalia, and other items used to grow the plants. After completing the search, Pipkin and her husband were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b66 On May 21,1997, Chenoweth personally filed the return of the search warrant with Judge Beitz, and filed a detailed list of all the items seized pursuant to the search warrant. On June 4, 1997, the State filed the information in the District Court which charged Pipkin with the drug-related offenses. Pipkin pled not guilty to all of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b67 On August 5,1997, Pipkin filed a motion to suppress all evidence the State seized pursuant to the search warrant. Pipkin claimed the warrant was invalid because it was not directed to a specific peace officer as required by \u00a7 46-5-223, MCA, and was not served by the peace officer named in the search warrant as required by \u00a7 46-5-226, MCA. Pipkin further argued that any statutory violation concerning the issuance of a search warrant \u201cclearly violates a \u2018substantial right\u2019 of Pipkin to be protected by the Fourth Amendment against \u2018unreasonable searches and seizures.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b68 On October 3,1997, the District Court entered its order which granted Pipkin\u2019s motion to suppress based on its conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>State\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 46-5-223, MCA, \u201cviolates the Defendant\u2019s U.S. and Montana constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it concluded that the State violated Pipkin\u2019s substantial rights and, therefore, suppressed all evidence seized pursuant to the State\u2019s search warrant?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b610  We have held that a district court\u2019s conclusions of law regarding a motion to suppress are reviewed to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>See State v. Roberts </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 54, 55, 943 P.2d 1249, 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b6 11 Warrants to search a person\u2019s home are required by the Federal and State Constitutions. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Article II, Section 11, of the Montana Constitution, similarly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">The people shall be secure in their persons, papers, homes and effects from unreasonable searches and seizures. No warrant to search any place, or seize any person or thing shall issue without describing the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized, or without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation reduced to writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">\u00b6 12  In order to deter law enforcement officials from conducting unconstitutional searches or seizures, the United States Supreme Court established the exclusionary rule in <em>Mapp v. Ohio </em>(1961), 367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081. The exclusionary rule functions as a judicially created remedy \u201cdesigned to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\u201d <em>United States v. Calandra </em>(1974), 414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S. Ct. 613, 620, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561, 571. The primary purpose of the exclusionary rule \u201cis to deter future unlawful police conduct\u201d by making evidence which the State obtains through a search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, inadmissible in criminal proceedings. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 347, 94 S. Ct. at 619, 38 L. Ed. 2d at 571. The result of the exclusionary rule is that, in the absence of one of the recognized exceptions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>warrant requirement, a search made without a warrant is unlawful and any evidence which results from the search should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b613  We review the validity of a search warrant by employing a common sense and realistic approach. In <em>United States v. Ventresca </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 102, 85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L. Ed. 2d 684, the Supreme Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">[T]he Fourth Amendment\u2019s commands, like all constitutional requirements, are practical and not abstract. ... Technical requirements of elaborate specificity once exacted under common law pleadings have no proper place in this area. A grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts toward warrants will tend to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\"><em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. at 108, 85 S. Ct. at 746, 13 L. Ed. 2d at 689. Our public policy to encourage police officers to obtain warrants, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Chadwick </em>(1977), 433 U.S. 1, 9, 97 S. Ct. 2476, 2482, 53 L. Ed. 2d 538, 547, <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 1879, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 905, <em>United States v. Lefkowitz </em>(1932), 285 U.S. 452, 464, 52 S. Ct. 420, 423, 76 L. Ed. at 877, 882, is reflected in \u00a7 46-5-103, MCA, which sets forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">When search and seizure not illegal. (1) A search and seizure, whether with or without a warrant, may not be held to be illegal if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">(a) the defendant has disclaimed any right to or interest in the place or object searched or the evidence, contraband, or person seized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">(b) a right of the defendant has not been infringed by the search and seizure; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">(c) <em>any irregularity in the proceedings has no effect on the substantial rights of the accused.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">\u00b614 Pipkin contends that the State violated \u00a7 46-5-223, MCA (formerly \u00a7 45-5-203, MCA), when it failed to address the warrant to a specific officer. That statute requires that \u201c[a] search warrant must be directed to a specific peace officer commanding the officer to search for and seize the evidence, contraband, or person designated in the warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">\u00b615 The Commission Comments to the rule identify the purpose of the statute as follows: \u201cThe requirement that the officer be named presumes that the officer will have knowledge of the place to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>searched and the object to be seized.\u201d Section 46-5-223, MCA, Commission Comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b6 16 In the past, when we have considered whether failure to direct a warrant to a specific peace officer affects the substantial rights of the accused, we have been inconsistent. When this Court was first called upon to decide this issue, we concluded that \u201c[w]e cannot agree with defendant\u2019s contention that error was predicated on this highly technical point of law to the extent that it was so prejudicial as to necessitate retrial.\u201d <em>State v. Meidinger </em>(1972), 160 Mont. 310, 319, 502 P.2d 58, 64. We did note, however, that we disapproved of the State\u2019s practice of addressing search warrants to \u201cany\u201d peace officer. Three years later, we reaffirmed that holding in <em>State v. Snider </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 220, 514 P.2d 1204. Once again we noted that we disapproved of the State directing search warrants to \u201cany\u201d peace officer, but we concluded that based upon the facts of the case, that failure did not render the search warrant fatally defective. <em>Snider, </em>168 Mont. at 227, 514 P.2d at 1208. We stated that \u201cno prejudice resulted to defendant by failure to direct the search warrant to a particular peace officer.\u201d <em>Snider, </em>168 Mont. at 227, 514 P.2d at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b617 Although we addressed this issue peripherally in <em>State ex rel. Stief v. Sande </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 87, 90, 540 P.2d 968, 970, and <em>State v. Tropf </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 79, 87, 530 P.2d 1158, 1162, where we stated that \u201c[t]he formal defect in [Meidinger] could in no way have infringed on the rights of the defendant and was not prejudicial,\u201d we did not directly address the issue again until <em>State ex rel. Sanford v. District Court Thirteenth Judicial Dist. </em>(1976), 170 Mont. 196, 551 P.2d 1005. As in <em>Meidinger </em>and <em>Snider, </em>the search warrant in <em>Sanford </em>was directed to \u201c[a]ny Peace Officer of this State.\u201d <em>Sanford, </em>170 Mont. at 198, 551 P.2d at 1006. Without analysis or further discussion, we held in <em>Sanford </em>that we would be unwilling to allow the practice to continue and noted that we had previously condemned the State\u2019s practice of routinely directing search warrants to \u201cany\u201d peace officer. <em>Sanford, </em>170 Mont. at 198, 551 P.2d at 1006. There we stated that \u201c[w]e simply will not tolerate further violation of section 95-703, R.C.M. 1947 [now \u00a7 46-5-223, MCA], to permit incursions by law enforcement officers into a constitutionally protected area.\u201d <em>Sanford, </em>170 Mont. at 199, 551 P.2d at 1006. For that reason, we reversed the district court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u00b618 Based on our decision in <em>Sanford, </em>Pipkin contends that anything but strict compliance with \u00a7 46-5-223, MCA, violates the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Amendment. Because this warrant was not addressed to officer Chenoweth, Pipkin contends that suppression is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b6 19  Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Pipkin has not been prejudiced by the State\u2019s procedural omission, and that the effect of failure to comply with a statutory procedural requirement must be considered in the context of other relevant statutory provisions. In that regard, \u00a7 46-5-103, MCA, states that \u201c[a] search and seizure, whether with or without a warrant, may not be held to be illegal if... any irregularity in the proceedings has no effect on the substantial rights of the accused.\u201d Considering the purpose of \u00a7 46-5-223, MCA, and the facts in this case, we conclude that Pipkin\u2019s substantial rights have not been affected by the fact that the salutation of the warrant was not directed to Chenoweth.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b620 Our approach finds support in recent search and seizure decisions of this Court in which we have considered violations of statutory procedure to determine whether that violation affected the substantial rights of the accused. In State <em>v. Steffes </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 214, 887 P.2d 1196, State <em>v. Cope </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 387, 819 P.2d 1280, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Bower </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 1, 7, 833 P.2d 1106, 1110, and State v. <em>Chatriand </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 375, 792 P.2d 1107, we held that the State\u2019s failure to comply with ministerial statutory requirements does not void an otherwise valid search so long as the purpose of the statute in question is fulfilled. In each case we concluded that the State\u2019s failure to comply with statutory procedure did not affect the substantial rights of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b621 Similarly, in this case, the Justice of the Peace complied with all applicable constitutional provisions and, but for the omission of Chenoweth\u2019s name in the heading of the warrant, all of Montana\u2019s statutory provisions. To suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the search warrant because Chenoweth\u2019s name was not in the heading, even though he applied for the warrant, served the warrant, and executed the return of service for the warrant, would be an irrational result.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b622 Even when the defect in the search warrant is one of constitutional magnitude, we have refused to automatically invoke the exclusionary rule. <em>See State v. Peterson </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 503, 741 P.2d 392; <em>State v. Broell </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 117, 814 P.2d 44. <em>In Peterson, </em>the defendant claimed that the incriminating evidence seized should be excluded because the search warrant was not supported by probable cause and it did not particularly describe the items to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>seized. We held that although the search warrant, standing alone, would be invalid for its failure to describe with particularity the contraband to be seized, the warrant was valid because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">When the application for the search warrant and the search warrant are read together and when, as in this case, the application is signed by the officer named in the warrant as the officer directed to make service of the warrant and who did personally make such service, the documents in combination satisfy the requirement of particularly describing the thing to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><em>Peterson, </em>227 Mont. at 506, 741 P.2d at 394. We reaffirmed our holding that it is appropriate to read the search warrant and the search warrant application together when considering the statutory and constitutional requirement of particularity in <em>Broell, </em>249 Mont. at 122, 841 P.2d at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b623 When we apply the same approach to this case we conclude that the purpose of \u00a7 46-5-223, MCA, has been satisfied and, therefore, that Pipkin\u2019s substantial rights have not been affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b624 When read alone, the search warrant in this case clearly identifies, on the first line of the text, that \u201c[a] sworn application has been made before [Judge Beitz] by Deputy Darrell Chenoweth.\u201d When read in combination with the application for the search warrant, it is clear that Chenoweth swore to the accuracy of the information presented therein. The fact that Chenoweth directed the execution of the search warrant is evident by the fact that he personally filed the return of service with the court. If Pipkin could not determine the officer to whom the warrant was directed and by whom it was executed from the language of the warrant itself, she could have easily determined the officer\u2019s identity from the return of service. Despite technical noncompliance with the statute, the information the statute was intended to provide was otherwise available to the person who was subject to the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b625 As stated by the Commission Comments, the purpose of the requirement in \u00a7 46-5-223, MCA, that the officer be named, \u201cpresumes that the officer will have knowledge of the place to be searched and the object to be seized.\u201d Section 46-5-223, MCA, Commission Comments. Clearly, Chenoweth, the officer who swore to the accuracy of the information contained within the warrant application and who was named in the warrant, had knowledge of the place to be searched and the objects to be seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u00b626 We recognize that the requirement of including the officer\u2019s name in the heading of the warrant is more than a mere formality. In any instance where this requirement is not met, the noncompliance must be carefully examined to see if the interests of the defendant have been compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b627 However, the public policy of this state is to encourage law enforcement officers to seek prior judicial approval before conducting searches, and to conduct those searches pursuant to search warrants. Therefore, technical attacks on warrants must be dealt with in a realistic manner. The correct approach is to analyze the facts and circumstances of each case to determine whether the irregularity in procedure has had an affect on the substantial rights of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b628 Our application of that approach to the facts of this case leads us to the conclusion that the omission of Chenoweth\u2019s name from the heading of the search warrant was an irregularity in the procedure that did not affect Pipkin\u2019s substantial rights. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court erred when it ordered that all evidence obtained as a result of the search warrant be excluded. We reverse the District Court\u2019s suppression order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b272-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, REGNIER, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
