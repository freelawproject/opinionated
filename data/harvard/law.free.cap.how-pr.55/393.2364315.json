The plaintiff forwarded to Mr. Griswold, its solicitor in New York, the sum of $80,000; and on the execution of the bonds and mortgages, Mr. Griswold paid to the defendant W. B. Nichols, including $200 paid for premium on fire</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">insurance, the sum of......................... $77, 000</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">Betained for his services and disbursements in</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">searching the title.......................... 950</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">And, by direction of Nichols, paid to Charles Whit-lock, his (Nichols\u2019) broker the remainder...... 2, 050</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">Total................................... $80,000</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-11\">For this last mentioned sum of $2,050, Mr. Griswold drew, as requested by Whitlock, the broker, two checks, both to his order, one for $1,521.17, and the other for $528.83, and handed them to Whitlock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-12\">It is true that Nichols tried to deny that he directed Mr. Griswold to pay the remainder to Whitlock; but the preponderance of evidence, and the fact that the checks would not have been so drawn without Nichols\u2019 instruction, irrespective of the contemporaneous memoranda made by Mr. Griswold in bis cheek-book, is the other way. Mr. Griswold\u2019s testimony on this subject is further supported by the fact that, as he testified, Whitlock told him that he was employed by Nichols to <em>secure this loam, \u2022 </em>that <em>im, case he succeeded </em>in procuring the loan of $80,000 on these ten houses\u2014$8,000 on each <em>\u2014he was to recei/oe </em>$3,000 <em>from Nichols, out of which he was to pay all the expenses of the loam,, </em>title examination and every thing. Mr. Griswold is further corroborated by Mr. Harper, who testifies, in substance, that <em>Whitlock told him the same thing, </em>and substantially by Whitlock also. Nichols himself, on being recalled, testified, in answer to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>question propounded by his own counsel, as follows: \u201cAs Mr. Griswold was taking his check-book out to write the check, he says, \u20181 am to retain $3,000, am I not<em> </em>V Yes, Mr. Griswold, <em>you ane.\u2019 \u201d </em>Or, as Whitlock testified: \u201c Q. Why did Mr. Griswold give you the check for the balance, if Mr. Nichols wasn\u2019t there ?\u201d \u201cA. Because Mr. Nichols told him that. He says, \u2018am I to reserve $3,000 of this?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\u201d \u201c Q. Is that all that was said ?\u201d \u201c A. I don\u2019t know that that was all, but. <em>he ga\u00f1e him to understand </em>that <em>three thousand was to be reserved </em>out of the $80,000. That was to go toward paying the expenses; <em>1 don\u2019t hnow that he </em>knew, or <em>that Mr. Griswold knew all about UP</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">IY. Whitlock was employed by Nichols, as a broker, to effect the loan. He was neither directly- or indirectly connected with, or employed by, the plaintiff. W. T. Gale was district agent of the plaintiff in the city of New York. His functions were limited \u201c to procure life insurance, attend to the collection of premiums on policies as they became due, and remit to the company.\u201d Besides, his whole conduct and the correspondence clearly show that with the making of loans he had no concern. His compensation depended to a great extent on the life insurance he obtained, as he received a commission thereon, the company guaranteeing, however, that his income should not be less than $2,000 during the six months he was in their employment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">Y. The plaintiff issued and delivered to Whitlock, policies of insurance on his own, his son\u2019s and some friends\u2019 lives, amounting to $37,000. The annual premium thereon amounted to $1,521.17, which Whitlock paid by handing to Gale, as agent for the company, one of the two checks which he had received from Mr. Griswold, as above narrated, first indorsing the same. Whether this cheek was handed to Gale by Whit-lock in Mr. Griswold\u2019s office, or at his own office, is utterly immaterial, for Whitlock testified, as above alluded to, that he did not tell Mr. Griswold any thing about life insurance, <em>and that </em>he, Griswold, <em>knew nothing about it. </em>It is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>than likely, however, such being the remembrance of both Mr. Griswold and Gale, that the check was given to Gale in his office. It is true that Whitlock testified to the contrary, in fact, that he never received such check, never had it in his hand, did not know what name was to it. When the check, on being produced, appeared to be to his order, and bearing his indorsement, he had to admit that all his testimony given on that subject, <em>which he was aspositi/ce was as true as any other thing he had testified </em>to, was incorrect. The probabilities are that all the remainder of his t\u00e9stimony is equally inborrect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">\"VT. The rates of premium charged were the usual, <em>regulan rates </em>of the company, and Gale declined to take less premium for the policies. At the expiration of the first year, Whit-lock claimed that he was entitled to \u201c paid-up policies.\u201d The president demurred thereto; but it resulted in Whitlock receiving \u201c paid-up policies \u201d for a majority of the policies, making three paid-up policies, one for $500, and two for $250 each, total $1,000, <em>which he now owns ; </em>and the other policies, under the Massachusetts law, lapsing after <em>two </em>years from them date of issue, <em>though only one year\u2019s </em>premium had been paid. The plaintiff actually lost money by the issuance of the policies. Harper also gives the true report of the conversation that occurred between Mr. Thornton and Whitlock, a year after the issuing of the policies, when Whitlock demanded <em>\u201c </em>paid-up policies.\u201d He contradicts Whitlock, and says what Mr. Thorton remarked was (as would be very natural to remark), that had the company known that these policies would suffer to be lapsed, or <em>\u201c </em>paid-up policies \u201d demanded after the first year*, they would <em>not ha/ve issued the policies </em>of insurance, because a direct loss thereby resulted to the company. Mr. Harper distinctly says that <em>nothing </em>was said <em>about a mortgage.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">VII. It is claimed by the defendant that the procuring of these policies was exacted as a condition precedent to the loan being made. He and Whitlock testified in substance that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Gale, the district agent, told them that the application for the loan was refused, and suggested that he thought he could arrange it if they would take out policies, the premium of which would amount to about $1,500; that he was told to make such <em>offer; </em>and that subsequently they were informed that the company had accepted the offer; that Nichols, while acceding to the proposition, said to Gale, in Whitlock\u2019s presence, that the manner of issuing the policies he left entirely to Whitlock, and that he (Whitlock) could fix that up to suit himself. The story, as told by these two men, is contradicted by Gale, who states, in substance, that Whitlock was the person who first proposed the life insurance; that it is possible the company may have, at first, declined the loan, as to which he \u201c does not remember,\u201d <em>hut it had nothing to do with Ufe insurance ; </em>that the agreement concerning life insurance was one made between Whitlock and himself, <em>amid had nothing to do with the cornyamy\u2019s making the loan; </em>for the making of the loan was not within his province, but only the obtaining of insurance on the premiums for which he earned a commission. The check of $1,521.17, which Whitlock indorsed and gave to Gale, was by him deposited in his bank account, as receipts for premiums, and it was by him credited in his general account with the company for and as such premiums.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">If the defendant\u2019s story and theory be adopted, it is, of course, utterly immaterial with what specific check or money these premiums were paid, so long as such specific check or money did not, in law, belong to the defendant Nichols.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\">Will. The defendant Nichols paid his interest for two years after the delivery of the bond and mortgage, to wit, up to the 29th day of September, 1876. Thereafter he ceased to pay the interest, and did not attempt to avail himself of the pretended defense of usury until foreclosure suits were instituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>IX. The cause was tried on the 28th of December, 1877. On that day there was due, on each mortgage, the following sum:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">Principal..................................$8,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\">Interest from September 29th, 1876, to date of</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\">trial..................................... 697 82</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-8\">Premium of insurance paid since the filing of the ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-9\">complaint................................ 12 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-10\">Total..................................$8,709 82</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-11\">To which is to be added the sum of one dollar and fifty-three cents for interest for each day from the time of the trial until the decision.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-12\"><em>Ch\u00f3reles M. Da Costa </em>and <em>G. A. Seward, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-13\">I. The contract between the parties is found in the written application, prepared and signed by the defendant Nichols himself, and in the letters of the plaintiff\u2019s officers to Dale, them district agent in New York. No mention is anywhere therein made of life insurance. Being the written, expression of the parties at the time, it ought to prevail, on well-settled rules, over loose and contradictory oral statements by interested parties, especially when such loose and contradictory oral statements are invoked in favor of an unconscionable defense, interposed for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff of the sum of $80,000. If, as it is confidently claimed, the preponderance of testimony shows that Nichols agreed to pay to Whitlock, his broker, the sum of $3,000 for procuring the loan, provided the broker would pay all the expenses out of such $3,000, then it is utterly immaterial to consider whether or not the plaintiff made it as a condition of the loan that Whitlock, the broker, should furnish them with life insurance, the premium of which would amount to about $1,500. It would be very difficult to cite any principle or any authority which made a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>between A and B usurious, because A and 0 entered into an independent and mutually beneficial contract founded upon <em>a </em>valuable consideration. Any agreement between Hichols and Whitlock, his broker, by which the broker was to receive any amount of money for Ms services, does not render the contract between the plaintiff and Hichols usurious. Since <em>Condit </em>agt. <em>Baldwin </em>(21 <em>N. Y., </em>219) the question is no longer open to debate <em>(See Estevez </em>agt. Purdy, 66 N. <em>Y., </em>448, <em>where Condit </em>agt. <em>Baldwin and subsequent authorities are cited; and also Guardian M. L. Ins. Co. </em>agt. <em>Kasaw, </em>66 <em>N. Y., </em>544).</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-5\">Whitlock had certainly a right to insure in the plaintiff\u2019s company his own, his son\u2019s, and Ms friends\u2019 lives, receive' the policies therefor, and pay the usual fair premium thereon. Such insurances were valid contracts between WMtlock and the company. He has held the company to them, and has had, and yet has, the benefit of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-6\">II. It has already been suggested that the only contract between the parties is the one evidenced by the written application and letters. If it be said that, from the parol evidence of WMtlock and iSTichols on one side, and that of Gale on the other, the terms of the contract are to be gathered, yet, even then, as the defendant has the burden of proof, he has failed to establish the fact (as above more particularly referred to) that the application for the life insurance policies was made a condition by the plaintiff for making the loan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-7\">It is plain to see that the head officials in Boston, who alone determined on the acceptance of the loan, knew nothing of any matter connected with the life insurance. The interest to effect that was specially with Gale, the district agent, who the more the premiums he got, the larger were his receipts from commissions thereon. Gale had, however, notMng to do with the effecting of the loan, save to carry out the instructions of his principals in Boston. There clearly was no intent on the part of the plaintiff to violate the usury laws, for their contract provided but for seven per cent, and such con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>tract, as accepted in writing, did not make the obtaining or non-obtaining of any life insurance policy a condition. It is equally clear that the company never gave and never intended to give Gale any authority to violate the usury laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">Usury consists in taking more than seven per cent on a loan of money, in pursuance of a corrupt and unlawful agreement to that effect, made at the time by the parties to such loan. Without such corrupt and unlawful agreement there is no usury. The loose statements of what Gale said about the company being able to get eight per cent in Boston, as testified to by Whitlock, is contradicted by Gale. But even if true, the declarations of an agent with reference to a loan \u2014 when such agent had nothing to do with the making of loans, when his only functions were to obtain life insurance, collect the premiums and remit the same \u2014 would, under no rule of law, be binding on, or evidence against, his principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-6\">III. But assuming, for the sake of argument, and for that only, that application for life insurance policies, on which premiums to the amount of about $1,500 should be paid, was a condition precedent, or an inducement for making the loan, yet that would not sustain a defense of usury, provided, as appears in this case, the policies were actually issued and the premium charged was the usual and fair premium.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-7\"><em>(a.) </em>The statute against usury does not forbid the entering into of independent collateral contracts between parties, contemporaneously with or as a condition of the loan of money, provided such contemporaneous contracts be <em>Iona fide, </em>and not fictitious, and thus a mere shift or device to evade the statute <em>(Utica Ins.

Co. </em>agt. <em>Paterson S. M. Co. </em>(10 <em>E. C. Green, </em>160 <em>[N. J. Fq.]) </em>the facts were almost identical with those claimed by the defendant in this case. It was held that the requirement by the lender, a life insurance company, that the <em>borrower </em>should take out a policy of insurance as a condition of making the loan, was not, of itself, evidence of a usurious agreement <em>(See, also, Downes </em>agt. <em>Green, </em>12 <em>Mees. &amp; W., </em>481).</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-7\">Similar doctrine, too, has been held in the case of annuities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-8\">Thus a provision for insurance of the grantor\u2019s life does not make the grant of an annuity impeachable for usury <em>(Byrne </em>agt. <em>Kinnefeck, </em>1 <em>Hogan, </em>184; <em>French </em>agt. <em>Morgan, Batty, </em>254; <em>Strong </em>agt. <em>Ormsby, </em>2 <em>Hogan, </em>59).</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-9\">And in <em>Manly </em>agt. <em>Hawkins </em>(1 <em>Drury &amp; Walsh, </em>363) it was held that the circumstances of the repayment of the purchase-money being secured by an insurance on the life of the grantor, and the grantor having covenanted to pay the premiums did not bring the case within the statute of usury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-10\">IV. Usury must be strictly proven as alleged, and any variance is fatal.

R., </em>319 <em>and cases there </em>cited; <em>see, also, Vroom </em>agt. <em>Ditmas, </em>4 <em>Paige, </em>526; <em>New Orleans G. L. &amp; B.

Hor can I give full credence to the version of that conversation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>which was given by the latter. Assuming, however, that the evidence is sufficient to warrant the inference that the plaintiff refused to make the loan unless the defendant effected the insurance put in evidence by him, I think the transaction was not usurious for two reasons. (1.) The plaintiff gave <em>quid pro quo </em>for the premiums received. (2.) Whether the insurances would enable it to acquire the legal interest on the sum loaned, depended upon the contingency of the assured living for a period long enough to produce that result. It is not unlawful for a lender to refuse to lend to persons who are not his customers. The business of the plaintiff is to make insurances upon lives. It must invest its surplus funds. To confine its loans to its own patrons, is no more than the insisting upon fair reciprocity. There may be cases where the issuing of policies of life insurance is resorted to as a mere shift or device to cover up the real transaction which is an usurious one; but that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">I think, therefore, that, upon principle as well as upon authority, the plaintiff is entitled to the usual judgment with costs ( <em>Washington Company </em>agt. <em>Paterson Company, </em>10 <em>E.
