ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The trial court found Christopher Brent Cooper guilty of manufacturing marijuana not for his own use, Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(c), and for knowingly receiving a stolen shotgun, Code \u00a7 18.2-108. On appeal, Cooper argues his convictions should be overturned because (a) the court erroneously continued the trial date at the Commonwealth\u2019s request; (b) the court erred in admitting into evidence a report from the FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center (NCIC); and (c) insufficient evidence supports his convictions. Disagreeing with each of these assertions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). Viewing the record through this evidentiary prism requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted). As an appellate court, moreover, our examination of the record \u201cis not limited to the evidence mentioned by a party in trial argument or by the trial court in its ruling.\u201d <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 147, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008), <em>aff'g, </em>49 Va.App. 285, 640 S.E.2d 526 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">At trial, Andrew Forest Milam testified that he knew Cooper and \u201chung out\u201d at Cooper\u2019s home prior to being incarcer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ated in June 2007. Cooper lived in the home with his sister. While in Cooper\u2019s residence, Milam and Cooper \u201cdiscussed drugs\u201d and specifically talked about marijuana. They focused on \u201ccertain plants, where we could get it, things like that.\u201d Milam observed potted, growing marijuana plants on Cooper\u2019s back porch. Cooper said he and \u201cJeff\u2019 owned the plants. Cooper also mentioned that he had a few firearms \u201cupstairs\u201d in his bedroom. \u201cI have guns in my room,\u201d Cooper stated, mentioning specifically a pistol and a 12-gauge shotgun. Cooper admitted they \u201cwere stolen weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Another of Cooper\u2019s friends, Jerry Simmons, testified that Cooper discussed \u201cdrugs\u201d with him as well. Cooper said \u201che could get me some\u201d in May 2007, Simmons continued. Like Milam, Simmons saw the marijuana plants growing on Cooper\u2019s back porch. Simmons recalled Cooper saying \u201che had four guns that I could buy.\u201d Cooper said Simmons could choose between two 12-gauge shotguns, an Uzi, and a .40 caliber firearm\u2014all of which, Cooper confided, had been stolen. Simmons returned the next day to buy the .40 caliber firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Special Agent R.D. Zullig of the Virginia State Police testified that \u201c[njumerous complaints\u201d had been received \u201cregarding narcotics-related activity\u201d at Cooper\u2019s residence. Based on interviews with Milam and Simmons, Zullig obtained warrants to search Cooper\u2019s residence. On the back porch, police found the two marijuana plants observed by Milam and Simmons. Throughout the house, police discovered \u201cdrug paraphernalia and narcotics in numerous rooms\u201d including electronic digital scales, two sets of hemostats, a multitude of large and small baggies, a plastic grinder, additional marijuana, a .25 caliber pistol with an obliterated serial number, individually packaged methamphetamine, and various drug pipes. Several of these items (a digital scale, the additional marijuana, the .25 caliber pistol, the individually packaged methamphetamine) were found in the bedroom of Cooper\u2019s sister. Cooper\u2019s sister, however, said none of these items belonged to her. Testifying as an expert, Zullig explained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>items found in Coopers home were all \u201cconsistent with the distribution of drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Police also collected 12-gauge shotgun shells scattered about in \u201cnumerous areas of the house.\u201d In Cooper\u2019s bedroom, police recovered a 12-gauge shotgun. Without objection, the Commonwealth introduced a picture of the shotgun into evidence. Zullig testified it was \u201cthe shotgun identified as being stolen from Rockingham County....\u201d Later in Zullig\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth sought to introduce an NCIC report confirming that the shotgun (identified by its unique serial number) had been reported as stolen. Cooper\u2019s counsel objected on hearsay grounds. Applying <em>Frye v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 345 S.E.2d 267 (1986), the trial court overruled the objection and admitted the NCIC report under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In his case in chief, Cooper called to the stand his live-in girlfriend. She testified that Cooper obtained the 12-gauge shotgun from someone named \u201cAdam\u201d who asked Cooper to \u201chold onto it\u201d for him. She overheard Cooper ask Adam \u201cif the gun was stolen.\u201d When asked if the marijuana plants \u201cwere there for selling, or for ... \u201d she interrupted Cooper\u2019s counsel, \u201cOh, that, I\u2014I\u2014I don\u2019t-I don\u2019t know.\u201d At that, the prosecutor waived cross-examination and the defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The trial court found Cooper guilty. On the marijuana charge, the court concluded \u201cthere\u2019s no question\u201d Cooper was manufacturing the marijuana in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(c). On the charge of receiving stolen property, the 12-gauge shotgun, the court concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019d get much stronger circumstantial evidence than that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">A. <em>Continuance of Trial Date</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Prior to trial, the Commonwealth requested a continuance because a witness who was under indictment could not be compelled to testify. The prosecutor proffered to the trial court that the witness\u2019s counsel had reported she would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>pleading guilty in the next few days and afterwards would be available for subpoena in Cooper\u2019s case. The court granted the motion and continued the case for about a month. Cooper argues on appeal we should vacate his convictions and remand for retrial because the trial court erroneously granted the continuance motion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Whether to grant or deny a continuance rests within the \u201csound discretion\u201d of the trial court. <em>Ortiz v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 705, 722, 667 S.E.2d 751, 762 (2008) (quoting <em>Haugen v. Shenandoah Valley Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>274 Va. 27, 34, 645 S.E.2d 261, 265 (2007)). An appellate court can reverse only if the trial court committed an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d <em>and </em>thereby caused \u201cresulting prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This \u201ctwo-pronged\u201d test, <em>Lebedun v. Commonwealth, </em>27 VaApp. 697, 712, 501 S.E.2d 427, 434 (1998), has long been the standard under Virginia practice. <em>See also Silcox v. Commonwealth, </em>32 VaApp. 509, 513, 528 S.E.2d 744, 746 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Satisfying both prongs of the test is \u201cessential to reversal.\u201d <em>Butler v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 614, 621, 570 S.E.2d 813, 817 (2002) (citations omitted). \u201cThe absence of one renders inconsequential the presence of the other.\u201d <em>Bolden, </em>49 VaApp. at 290, 640 S.E.2d at 529. \u201cWe cannot reverse if a defendant \u2018has shown no prejudice resulting from what he claims was an abuse of discretion\u2019 in granting or denying a continuance motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Quintana v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 135, 295 S.E.2d 643, 646 (1982)). Prejudice, moreover, \u201cmay not be presumed; it must appear from the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lowery v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 304, 307, 387 S.E.2d 508, 510 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In this case, Cooper cannot demonstrate any prejudice. He does not claim the continuance compromised his ability to get his witnesses to trial, conflicted with his counsel\u2019s other responsibilities, or otherwise weakened his ability to mount a defense to the charges. Perhaps so, Cooper counters, but the continuance did give the Commonwealth \u201canother month to prepare.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7. We fail to see the harm in that. Cooper likewise received another month to prepare. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>And Cooper can hardly claim that justice would be served by \u201cforcing the Commonwealth to go to trial unprepared.\u201d <em>Bol-. den, </em>49 Va.App. at 292, 640 S.E.2d at 530. Nor can he overcome the illogic of his own argument: Even if we accepted his more-time-to-prepare thesis, he would not be acquitted. We would at most reverse and remand for retrial\u2014thereby remedying an allegedly erroneous month-long continuance by the trial court with a <em>de facto </em>year-or-two continuance by the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Cooper\u2019s failure to demonstrate prejudice \u201crenders inconsequential,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 290, 640 S.E.2d at 529, his allegation that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the continuance. \u201cGiven our holding, any discussion on that point would conflict with two principles of judicial self-restraint: our reluctance to issue what amounts to an \u2018advisory opinion\u2019 on an inessential subject, <em>Craddock v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 539, 551 n. 1, 580 S.E.2d 454, 461 n. 1 (2003), and our corresponding desire to decide the case \u2018on the best and narrowest ground available.\u2019 <em>Air Courier Conference v. Am. Postal Workers Union, </em>498 U.S. 517, 531, 111 S.Ct. 913, 922, 112 L.Ed.2d 1125 (1991) (Stevens, J., concurring).\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 113, 117 n. 3, 609 S.E.2d 58, 60 n. 3 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">B. <em>Admissibility of NCIC Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Without objection, Agent Zullig testified that the 12-gauge shotgun in the photograph offered into evidence was the gun recovered from Cooper\u2019s bedroom and was \u201cthe shotgun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>identified as being stolen from Rockingham County....\u201d When the prosecutor sought to admit into evidence the NCIC report confirming this, Cooper objected on hearsay grounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court held that the NCIC report fit within the business records exception to the hearsay rule under <em>Frye v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 345 S.E.2d 267 (1986). We find no error in the trial court\u2019s application of <em>Frye.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In <em>Frye, </em>a defendant found guilty of capital murder argued that the admission of an NCIC report violated the hearsay rule. The NCIC report stated \u201cFrye was wanted for escape from a West Virginia correctional facility,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 387, 345 S.E.2d at 279, a fact relevant to the murder charge. There was no dispute that an official acting within his authority made the report entry. A West Virginia prison official testified that an escape warrant had been filed with the NCIC, thus generating the statement in an NCIC report identifying the defendant as an escapee. The trial court admitted the NCIC report into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Applying the \u201cbusiness records exception\u201d to the hearsay rule, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>This exception, <em>Frye </em>acknowledged, \u201cgenerally limit[s] admission of such evidence to facts or events -within the personal knowledge and observation of the recording official.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Frye, </em>however, there was no evidence that the prison official had personal knowledge that the defendant escaped from the West Virginia prison. <em>Frye </em>nevertheless pointed out that the personal knowledge limitation must sometimes yield to practical necessity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">In certain cases, where verification of the recorded facts is not possible through the personal knowledge of the record keeper, <em>practical necessity nevertheless requires admission of recorded evidence which has a circumstantial guarantee </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><em>of trustworthiness; </em>this guarantee is provided where evidence shows the regularity of the preparation of the records and reliance on them by their preparers or those for whom they are prepared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 387, 345 S.E.2d at 279-80 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Ashley v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 705, 707-08, 261 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1980); <em>\u2018Automatic\u201d Sprinkler Corp. v. Coley &amp; Petersen, </em>219 Va. 781, 792-93, 250 S.E.2d 765, 773 (1979); <em>French v. Virginian Ry., </em>121 Va. 383, 387-88, 93 S.E. 585, 586 (1917)). Just after making this point, the next sentence of <em>Frye </em>held: \u201cThe NCIC printout, <em>therefore, </em>also comes within the exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 345 S.E.2d at 280 (emphasis added). That conclusion, <em>Frye </em>added, was particularly true given the fact that \u201crecords of the NCIC are routinely used and relied on by the Virginia State Police in the regular course of business.\u201d <em>Id.; accord Estes v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 520, 524, 382 S.E.2d 491, 493 (1989) (referring to <em>Frye </em>as \u201cthe NCIC exception to the hearsay rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">While there \u201cmay be some confusion in these cases between the business entries rule and the official records exception,\u201d Professor Friend explains, the \u201clatter requires firsthand knowledge on the part of the entrant; the former does not.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-15, at 775 (6th ed. 2003). Citing <em>Frye, </em>Professor Friend correctly concludes that, \u201cin Virginia today, personal knowledge of the entrant, or of the entrant\u2019s informant, is no longer an absolute prerequisite to the admissibility of business records, provided that the \u2018circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019\u2014regularity of preparation and reliance upon the records by those for whom they are prepared\u2014are present.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In this case, after Cooper made his hearsay objection to the NCIC report, the trial court took the objection under advisement and allowed Agent Zullig to lay a foundation. Zullig stated that he provided the serial number of the shotgun to a dispatcher and learned from her that the NCIC report identified the shotgun as stolen. Zullig then spoke directly to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>investigator at the Rockingham County Sheriffs Office assigned to the stolen shotgun case to confirm the information included in the NCIC report. The investigator further verified that the shotgun, at the time of its seizure from Cooper\u2019s residence, was \u201cstill entered as stolen by their agency, in their jurisdiction.\u201d Zullig also explained the written request and verification procedure he used to obtain the written NCIC report.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The trustworthiness of the stolen-shotgun report, the trial court concluded, came \u201cboth from NCIC as well as from the Rockingham County Sheriffs Department.\u201d Finding ample circumstantial indicia of trustworthiness, the trial court admitted the NCIC report under the <em>Frye </em>exception. Though considering Zullig\u2019s efforts to verify the NCIC report as foundation for applying the <em>Frye </em>exception, the court limited his hearsay testimony to that role and excluded it from being considered as evidence on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">On appeal, Cooper does <em>not </em>argue that Agent Zullig\u2019s testimony failed to lay a sufficient trustworthiness foundation for the application of the NCIC exception recognized in <em>Frye. </em>So we assume, without deciding, the foundation was adequate. Instead, Cooper relies solely on <em>Tickel v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 558, 564-68, 400 S.E.2d 534, 538-40 (1991), which excluded certain entries on DMV reports under the \u201cofficial documents\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Ticket </em>explained that the <em>narrower </em>\u201cofficial documents\u201d exception required that result, <em>id. </em>at 568, 400 S.E.2d at 540, but noted that application of the <em>broader </em>\u201cbusiness records\u201d exception would not necessarily \u201cexclude all entries made by persons not having personal knowledge of the facts entered,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 565, 400 S.E.2d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\"><em>Ticket </em>acknowledged that the Virginia Supreme Court had considered a \u201ccomputer report from the NCIC information bank\u201d and had <em>\u201creferred </em>to the business records exception\u201d in <em>Frye. Tickel, </em>11 Va.App. at 567, 400 S.E.2d at 540 (emphasis added). In <em>dicta, </em>however, <em>Ticket </em>claimed the Virginia Supreme Court \u201cinadvertently\u201d applied the business records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>exception in <em>Frye </em>while meaning instead to apply only the official documents exception to NCIC reports. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe believe, however, that public officials acting in their official capacity, and documents purporting to convey information known to those officials, should be held to a higher standard of personal knowledge than the business records exception requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 400 S.E.2d at 539. Cooper asks us to apply the <em>Ticket dicta, </em>rather than the <em>Frye </em>holding, to the trial court\u2019s decision in this case. Needless to say, we cannot do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><em>Ticket\u2019s dicta </em>notwithstanding, the Virginia Supreme Court has repeatedly cited <em>Frye </em>as an application of the \u201cbusiness records exception\u201d to the hearsay rule. <em>See 1921 Leonard Road, L.L.C. v. Van Roekel, </em>272 Va. 543, 554-55, 636 S.E.2d 378, 385 (2006); <em>Kettler &amp; Scott, Inc. v. Earth Tech. Cos., </em>248 Va. 450, 457, 449 S,E.2d 782, 785 (1994). We have as well. <em>See Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 643, 654, 587 S.E.2d 749, 754 (2003); <em>Lee v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 571, 576, 507 S.E.2d 629, 632 (1998); <em>Fitzhugh v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 275, 280, 456 S.E.2d 163, 165 (1995); <em>Penny v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 494, 497, 370 S.E.2d 314, 316 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Applying the business records exception, <em>Frye </em>specifically addressed the admissibility of NCIC reports and clearly held that \u201cwhere verification of the recorded facts is not possible through the personal knowledge of the record keeper, practical necessity <em>nevertheless requires admission </em>of recorded evidence which has a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness. ...\u201d <em>Frye, </em>231 Va. at 387, 345 S.E.2d at 279 (emphasis added). Thus, assuming a proper foundation has been laid, the <em>Frye </em>rule is clear: \u201cThe NCIC printout, <em>therefore, </em>also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>comes within the exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 345 S.E.2d at 280 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">It is not for us to decide whether the <em>Frye </em>exception for NCIC reports could be (or should be) decoupled from the business records exception and reattached to the narrower official documents exception. The <em>dictum </em>in <em>Ticket </em>provides us no authority for doing so. <em>\u201cStare decisis </em>cannot be properly applied without \u2018the need to distinguish an opinion\u2019s holding from its <em>dicta.\u2019\u201d Newman v. Newman, </em>42 Va.App. 557, 565, 593 S.E.2d 533, 537 (2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted). <em>\u201cDicta </em>cannot \u2018serve as a source of binding authority in American jurisprudence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 593 S.E.2d at 538 (citation omitted). Chief Justice Marshall said it best:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">It is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which these expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in the subsequent suit when the very point is [involved] for decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Va. Ry. &amp; Power Co. v. Dressler, </em>132 Va. 342, 350-51, 111 S.E. 243, 245^6 (1922) (Burks, J.) (quoting in turn <em>Cohens v. Virginia, </em>6 Wheat. 264, 19 U.S. 264, 399, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821) (Marshall, C.J.))).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In short, the trial court properly applied <em>Frye\u2019s </em>business records exception applicable to NCIC reports. We cannot hold, as Cooper urges us to, that the trial court erred by not applying the narrower official records exception which, unlike <em>Frye, </em>requires the official making the entry to have personal knowledge of the information entered in the official record.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">C. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Cooper challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions for manufacturing marijuana \u201cnot for his own use,\u201d a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(c), and for knowingly receiving the stolen shotgun, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-108.

Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788-89, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (emphasis in original). \u201cRather, the relevant question is whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted and emphasis in original).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These principles recognize that we are \u201cnot permitted to reweigh the evidence,\u201d <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007), because appellate courts have no authority \u201cto preside <em>de novo </em>over a second trial,\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Our sufficiency review \u201cis not limited to the evidence mentioned by a party in trial argument or by the trial court in its ruling. In determining whether there is evidence to sustain a conviction, an appellate court must consider all the evidence admitted at trial that is contained in the record.\u201d <em>Bolden, </em>275 Va. at 147, 654 S.E.2d at 586. This deferential standard of review \u201capplies not only to the historical facts themselves, but the inferences from those facts as well.\u201d <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 663 n. 2, 588 S.E.2d 384, 387 n. 2 (2003). Thus, a factfinder may \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 10, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (citations omitted), unless doing so would push \u201cinto the realm of <em>non sequitur,\u201d Thomas, </em>48 Va.App. at 608, 633 S.E.2d at 231 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>When considering circumstantial evidence, a fact-finder cannot arbitrarily disregard a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. Even so, \u201cthe reasonable-hypothesis principle is not a discrete rule unto itself.\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 671, 681, 674 S.E.2d 571, 576 (2009) (quoting <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 8, 602 S.E.2d at 405). \u201cWhether the hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is itself a \u2018question of fact,\u2019 subject to deferential appellate review.\u201d <em>Clanton v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 561, 572-73, 673 S.E.2d 904, 910 (2009) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted). \u201cMerely because defendant\u2019s theory of the case differs from that taken by the Commonwealth does not mean that every reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence has not been excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201cthe question is not whether \u2018some evidence\u2019 supports the hypothesis, but whether a rational factfinder could have found the incriminating evidence renders the hypothesis of innocence unreasonable.\u201d <em>James, </em>53 Va.App. at 682, 674 S.E.2d at 577 (citing indirectly <em>Hudson, </em>265 Va. at 513, 578 S.E.2d at 785).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">(ii) <em>Manufacturing Marijuana \u201cNot For His Own Use\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Cooper does not contest that he was growing marijuana plants and nurturing them with the hope they could be harvested for smoking uses. This fact constitutes \u201cmanufacturing\u201d marijuana for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(c). <em>See King v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 708, 711, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986) (\u201cthe term manufacturing includes the planting, cultivating, growing, or harvesting of marijuana\u201d). Cooper disclaimed, however, any intent to sell or give the marijuana to anyone else. Under Cooper\u2019s hypothesis of innocence he was manufacturing the marijuana solely for his own use. The trial court, sitting as factfinder, rejected this hypothesis and found Cooper intended the marijuana for purposes <em>other </em>than his own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Ample evidence supports the rationality of the trial court\u2019s factfinding. Cooper\u2019s intent to use the marijuana for purposes other than his own use can be inferred from the fact that he nested a drug distribution operation in his home. <em>Cf. Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 430, 440-41, 388 S.E.2d 659, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>665-66 (1990) (reversing a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(c) where no evidence suggested on-going distribution). Cooper admitted as much to Milam, specifically talking about marijuana and discussing \u201ccertain plants, where we could get it, things like that.\u201d Referring to \u201cdrugs\u201d generally, Cooper told Simmons \u201che could get [him] some.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Scattered throughout Cooper\u2019s home were various items of \u201cdrug paraphernalia and narcotics in numerous rooms\u201d including electronic digital scales, hemostats, baggies, a plastic grinder, additional marijuana, and individually packaged methamphetamine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cooper\u2019s sister disclaimed any ownership of the items stashed in her bedroom\u2014leaving the permissible inference that these items were part of Cooper\u2019s on-going operations. <em>See generally Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 754 n. 4, 607 S.E.2d 738, 744 n. 4, adopted upon reh\u2019g en bane, 45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005) (describing role of \u201cevidentiary\u201d or \u201cbasic\u201d facts). Agent Zullig offered, without objection, his expert opinion that the various items found in Cooper\u2019s home were all \u201cconsistent with the distribution of drugs.\u201d Zullig\u2019s opinion confirmed the \u201c[njumerous complaints\u201d received by the Virginia State Police \u201cregarding narcotics-related activity\u201d at Cooper\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Coupling these circumstances with Cooper\u2019s statement that he also had stolen firearms for sale (12-gauge shotguns, an Uzi, and a .40 caliber firearm), the evidence led to the conclusion that Cooper\u2019s home was a heavily armed drug distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>hub. To be sure, \u201c[g]uns are the \u2018tools of the trade\u2019 in the underground drug world. In a variety of contexts, courts have observed the connection between illegal drug operations and guns in our society is a tight one.\u201d <em>Bolden, </em>49 Va.App. at 293, 640 S.E.2d at 530 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Into this factual context Cooper asserted the hypothesis that the marijuana plants on the back porch were <em>wholly </em>unique\u2014that is, unlike everything else for sale in the home (including the \u201cadditional marijuana\u201d located elsewhere), the marijuana plants on the porch were <em>solely </em>for his own use.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court understandably rejected this hypothesis of innocence and found the marijuana plants were simply additional stock in Cooper\u2019s drugs-and-guns inventory. The court did not plainly err in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">(iii) <em>Receipt of the Stolen Shotgun</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Challenging his conviction for receiving stolen goods under Code \u00a7 18.2-108, Cooper argues the evidence failed to prove \u201cthat the shotgun was stolen.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Cooper admitted to Milam that the \u201cguns in my room\u201d were stolen weapons. Cooper also told Simmons \u201che had four guns that [Simmons] could buy.\u201d Simmons was given the option of choosing between two 12-gauge shotguns, an Uzi, and a .40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>caliber firearm\u2014all of which, Cooper confided, had been stolen. Agent Zullig found one of the shotguns in Cooper\u2019s room. Without objection, the Commonwealth introduced a picture of the shotgun into evidence. Zullig testified it was \u201cthe shotgun identified as being stolen from Rockingham County....\u201d Zullig later offered into evidence an NCIC report confirming that the shotgun had been reported as stolen. Cooper further compounded the incriminating evidence by calling to the stand his girlfriend. She testified Cooper obtained the 12-gauge shotgun from someone named \u201cAdam\u201d who asked Cooper to \u201chold onto it\u201d for him. She overheard Cooper ask Adam \u201cif the gun was stolen.\u201d Given the totality of these facts, we agree with the trial judge\u2019s observation, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019d get much stronger circumstantial evidence than that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The trial court did not err in granting the Commonwealth a continuance, by applying the <em>Frye </em>business records exception to the NCIC report, or by finding the evidence sufficient to convict Cooper on both charges. We thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\">. These admonitions are particularly applicable to cases where, as here, any opinion we might offer on the abuse-of-discretion prong of the continuance <em>test\u2014if </em>it were adverse to the Commonwealth\u2014would be immune from further appellate review by the Virginia Supreme Court. <em>See Commonwealth v. Harley, </em>256 Va. 216, 219, 504 S.E.2d 852, 853 (1998) (refusing to review an issue that was \"rendered moot by the Court of Appeals' further ruling\u201d that the trial court's ruling \u201cwas harmless\u201d). Creating an anomaly of no small import, our holding on one issue (the defendant suffered no prejudice) would necessarily preclude the appellate process from testing the validity of what might appear to be a holding on another issue (the trial court abused its discretion). While this may be of little concern to courts of last resort, it is of great concern to intermediate appellate courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\"><em>. </em>Cooper also objected to Agent Zullig\u2019s testimony concerning his conversations with an investigator with the Rockingham County Sheriff's Office.
