BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Carter devised a plan to take paint from a display shelf in a Home Depot store, place it in a shopping cart, meet, Tracy Browning with the cart at the returns desk, have Browning represent that the paint had been previously purchased, and attempt to return it for a cash \u201crefund.\u201d In accordance with the plan, Carter entered the store and placed four five-gallon buckets of paint into a shopping cart. Browning, as instructed by Carter, met Carter at the returns desk and took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>shopping cart from Carter who then left the store and walked to a local restaurant. Browning attempted to return the paint for the retail value of $398.92 in cash but the assistant manager suspected a fraudulent return and alerted the loss prevention investigator who contacted police. The police arrested Browning<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and later apprehended and arrested Carter. In a bench trial, Carter was convicted of grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Carter contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the Commonwealth failed to prove he intended to steal the paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\"> Larceny is defined as the wrongful or fraudulent taking of personal property of some intrinsic value, belonging to another, \u201cwithout his permission and with the intent to permanently deprive him of that property.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Webber, </em>260 Va. 90, 96, 531 S.E.2d 311, 315 (2000); <em>see also Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 295, 300, 349 S.E.2d 414, 417-18 (1986). \u201c \u2018The intent with which property is taken determines the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Overstreet v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 234, 236, 435 S.E.2d 906, 907-08 (1993) (quoting <em>Slater v. Commonwealth, </em>179 Va. 264, 267, 18 S.E.2d 909, 911 (1942)). \u201cIn determining intent, the factfinder may consider the conduct of the person involved and all the circumstances revealed by the evidence.\u201d <em>Welch v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 518, 524, 425 S.E.2d 101, 105 (1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Removal of property from an owner\u2019s premises is not required.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">To constitute the crime of simple larceny, there must have been a felonious taking of the property from the possession of the owner, and the thief must, for an instant at least, have had complete and absolute possession of the stolen property, and during such possession and control he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>have feloniously removed the same from the place it occupied just before he grasped, seized or laid hold of the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0Hi\"><em>Jones, </em>3 Va.App. at 301, 349 S.E.2d at 418 (internal quotations and citation omitted). \u201cWhere the property has been feloniously taken, the slightest removal, even if it is only a hair\u2019s breadth, with intent to steal the same, is sufficient to constitute the asportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 349 S.E.2d at 418. \u201cAll that is required is that a defendant remove \u2018the items from the locations in the store where they were displayed by the owner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Welch, </em>15 Va.App. at 524, 425 S.E.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Carter concedes the Commonwealth proved removal of the paint from the shelf, the placement of the paint in the shopping cart, and even asportation of the paint within the store. He argues, though, he did not intend to steal the paint but planned to return it upon receipt of a refund.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Browning testified she did not know what she would have done if Home Depot had refused to accept the return, we must presume the trial court resolved this factual question in favor of the Commonwealth, <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 326, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2792-93, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), and found the paint would have been kept by Carter and Browning to conceal their own wrongdoing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u201cIn Virginia, absent countervailing evidence of an intention otherwise, \u2018the wrongful taking of the property in itself imports the <em>animus furandi,\u2019 </em>\u201d or intent to steal. <em>McEachern v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 679, 685, 667 S.E.2d 343, 346 (2008.) (quoting <em>Bryant v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 179, 183, 445 S.E.2d 667, 670- (1994)). Thus, as the Commonwealth argues, \u201cthe very existence of.a trespassory taking permits the inference (unless other circumstances negate it) that the taker intended to steal the property.\u201d . <em>Id. </em>Applying .the <em>animus furandi </em>inference, the trial court could properly infer Carter intended to steal the paint from his wrongful taking of the paint\u2014he removed the paint from the display shelf and placed it in the cart without any intent to pay for it but with every intent to claim its ownership.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Because the return of the paint was conditioned on Home Depot\u2019s acceptance of the refund request and we presume the trial court found the paint would have been kept had Home. Depot refused the refund, removing the paint from the shelf, placing it in the cart, and representing the paint as having already been purchased created a substantial risk of perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>nent loss of the paint to Home Depot. ' \u201c \u2018[A]n intent to deprive the owner of his property permanently, or an intent to deal with another\u2019s property unlawfully in such a manner as to create an obviously unreasonable risk of permanent deprivation, [is] all that is required to constitute the <em>animus furan</em>di\u2014or intent t\u00f3 steal\u2019 \u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>87 (7th ed.1999) (quoting Rollins M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N. Boyce, <em>Criminal Law </em>832-33 (3d ed.1982)). \u201cWhat better proof can there be of [the intent to deprive the owner of his property], than the assertion of such a right of ownership by the [defendant] as to entitle him to sell it.\u201d <em>Regina v. Hall, </em>69 Eng. Rep. 291, 292 (1848). An offer to sell the property to its owner is one of the strongest acts of dominion and control over the property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Although an intent to return the property could ne- \u2022 gate the <em>animus furandi </em>inference,'\u201c[t]he intent to return ... must be unconditional. Thus it is no defense to larceny that the taker intended to return it only if he should receive a reward for its return or only upon some other condition which he has no right to impose.\u201d 3 Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 19.5(b), at 90 (2d ed.2003). \u201cFor all practical purposes [an owner] has been permanently deprived of his property if he can get it back only by paying the full value thereof.\u201d Rollins M. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>269 (2d ed.1969). Carter\u2019s stated intent to return the paint was entirely contingent upon Home Depot\u2019s payment of the full value of the paint, a condition Carter had no right to impose. Therefore, we agree with the Commonwealth that Carter\u2019s intent \u201cto \u2018sell\u2019 it back to the owner under fraudulent circumstances\u201d did \u201cnot negate his intent to steal the paint at the time of the taking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The intent to return, conditioned on a future event that may or may not occur and based on a false assertion of ownership, should be disregarded as a matter of law and, as such, cannot negate the inference of intent to steal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Commonwealth asserted in the trial court, \u201cthe larceny was committed as soon as [Carter took] possession of the property with the intent to steal.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Jones, </em>3 Va.App. at 302, 349 S.E.2d at 418 (where, after the close of business, defendant moved items from their display locations but did not leave the store, the act of \u201clarceny was accomplished when [he] removed the items from the locations in the store where they were displayed by the owner\u201d); <em>see also Welch, </em>15 Va.App. at 525 n. 4, 425 S.E.2d at 106 n. 4 (\u201cthe larceny was complete when Welch moved the televisions from the display shelf with the intent to steal\u201d despite the fact he was found in an area on store premises open to the public for selection of items for purchase).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>We find the evidence supports the rationality of the trial court\u2019s finding that Carter intended to steal the paint.

Only \"when an individual harbors the requisite <em>intent to steal and permanently deprive the owner of property, </em>acts on such intent by taking possession of the property even for an instant, and moves the targeted property, [has] larceny [] been committed.\u201d <em>Welch, </em>15 Va.App. at 522, 425 S.E.2d at 104 (emphasis added). The intent to temporarily deprive the owner of possession of property is insufficient to prove the intent to steal the property. <em>See Tarpley v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 251, 256-57, 542 S.E.2d 761, 763-64 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">. The dissent\u2019s statement that the trial court did not expressly find Carter and Browning were going to return the paint <em>only </em>if they received the refund ignores the standard of review requiring that we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Nolen, </em>53 Va.App. at 595, 673 S.E.2d at 921. There was no evidence tending to show an intent to return the paint if a refund was not paid, and we must presume the trial court resolved any conflicting inferences regarding the intent to return the paint in favor of the Commonwealth \u201c \u2018even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record.' \" <em>Harper v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 517, 523, 642 S.E.2d 779, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>782 (2007) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. at 2793). In fact, if the Home Depot sales clerk had refused to pay the refund, it is unreasonable to conclude that Carter and Browning would have said \u201cOkay, well, you keep the paint\u201d or \u201crun the risk of confirming the suspicions of the sales clerk or store security personnel by <em>putting the [paint] back in the </em>display.\u201d <em>People v. Davis, </em>19 Cal.4th 301, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 295, 965 P.2d 1165, 1175 (1998) (court discussing numerous cases in which \"a defendant, rebuffed in ah attempt to 'return' an item taken from a display in the same store, simply took the item with him'when he left the store\u201d to avoid drawing attention to the theft).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">. Although a\u2018 store owner generally consents to the public entering, viewing, and carrying around merchandise \u201cfor the limited purpose of purchase, or to otherwise engage in a lawful activity thereon,\u201d it is not the owner's will \u201cthat entrance be made to defraud or steal from him.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>3 Va.App. at 300, 349 S.E.2d at 417 (where defendant remained in a store after its closing and removed items from their display locations, owner\u2019s consent did not extend to remaining in the store after the close of business). Similarly, common sense dictates that Home Depot\u2019s consent to the public removing and carrying around merchandise for the purpose of purchase did not extend to the removal of paint by Carter for the purpose of claiming it to be his own to seek a refund based on this false assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">. Because the claim of ownership evidences an intent to permanently deprive the owner of its property and the return is conditioned on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>owner's acceptance thereby creating a substantial risk of permanent loss, the Supreme Court of California has also concluded \"a defendant who takes an item from a store display with the intent to claim its ownership and restore it only on condition that the store pay him a 'refund' must be deemed to intend to permanently deprive the store of the item within the meaning of the law of larceny.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>79 Cal.Rptr.2d 295, 965 P.2d at 1175. <em>See also State v. Hauptmann, </em>115 N.J.L. 412, 180 A. 809 (1935) (where defendant kidnapped Lindbergh baby in its nightdress, court upheld conviction of murder in the commission of larceny since it was larceny to take the nightdress with the intent to return it only on condition of advancement of negotiations); <em>Slaughter et al. v. The State, </em>113 Ga. 284, 38 S.E. 854 (1901) (court affirmed conviction for larceny and rejected defendants' argument that they did not intend to permanently deprive owner of property where defendants took owner's property and returned it to claim an award); <em>Berry v.

Because there was no intent to pay for the paint, Carter took possession of the paint\u2014not bare custody as contended by the dissent. (By attempting to return the paint, Carter took not only possession, but claimed ownership of the paint.) \"Where there is evidence that an individual has acted in a manner that is inconsistent with that of a prospective purchaser, and has exercised immediate dominion and control over the property, despite his continued presence within the owner's store, such conduct establishes sufficient possession to satisfy [the asportation] element of larceny.\u201d <em>Welch, </em>15 Va.App. at 523-24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>425 S.E.2d at 105. It should be noted, as well, Carter does not contest the asportation element of larceny, rather he argues his intent to return the paint upon receipt of a refund negates his intent to steal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b757-10\">. The Commonwealth argued on appeal that it is sufficient if Carter intended to steal the \"value\u201d of the paint, an argument we reject since \"an intangible cannot be the subject of larceny.\u201d <em>Bruhn v.

Nevertheless, the Commonwealth argued in the trial court that the larceny was committed through the act of taking the paint from the shelf and then attempting to return it. The larceny was thus committed as soon as Carter took possession of the paint with the intent to steal it. Furthermore, the Commonwealth also argued on appeal that we could infer the intent to steal the paint by applying the <em>animus furandi </em>inference and that the intent to return it under fraudulent circumstances should not negate the intent to steal. <em>Cf. Whitehead v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 105, 677 S.E.2d 265 (2009) (where the rationale rejected by the Virginia Supreme Court was not argued in either the trial court or the Court of Appeals).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b757-6\">POWELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">I respectfully disagree with the majority that the evidence was sufficient to convict Carter of grand larceny of paint under Code \u00a7 18.2-95. In my view, the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to show that Carter intended to steal paint from Home Depot rather than use the paint to obtain money from the store. Therefore, I dissent from the analysis and judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">While it is true that we must view the evidence that tends to support conviction and uphold that conviction unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, this Court is equally obligated to reverse a conviction where the judgment is contrary to the law and evidence, i.e. is plainly wrong. <em>Tarpley v.

Larceny involves a taking and carrying away of a certain concrete article of personal property. <em>Lund v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 688, 691-92, 232 S.E.2d 745, 748 (1977). \u201c[Wjhen an individual harbors the requisite intent to steal and permanently deprive the owner of property, acts on such intent by taking possession of the property even for an instant, and moves the <em>targeted </em>property, larceny has been committed.\u201d <em>Welch v.

It is for this reason that \u201c[n]ew crimes as embezzlement and false pretenses [were] developed to fill the gaps caused by the intricacies of proving possession in larceny prosecutions.\u201d <em>Foster v.

It is well recognized that under Virginia law, embezzlement, false pretenses, and larceny are three separate offenses and there is no general \u201ctheft\u201d statute as in most states. <em>See United States v.

Such conclusion presupposes that appellant possessed the paint rather than obtained bare custody of it. In discussing the difference between bare custody and possession of personal property in the context of larceny, the Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8D\">[t]he owner of personal property may deliver it to another upon conditions, or in circumstances, which give the recipient bare custody of the property. Constructive possession remains in the owner. Examples are: a watch handed to a friend to time a race, the owner expecting its return at the end of the race; clothing handed to a customer in a clothing store, to try on for size, the owner expecting it to be returned if rejected, paid for if accepted; groceries loaded into a shopping cart in a supermarket, the owner expecting them to be paid for at a cash register before they are removed from the premises. Even though the property remains in the control of the custodian, asportation has not been completed until it is carried away in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>condition precedent upon which it was delivered. But if the property is carried away before the condition is performed, with the intent to steal it from the owner, the act becomes larceny.

Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 179, 184, 445 S.E.2d 667, 670 (1994) (reiterating that \u201cthe wrongful or fraudulent taking must be a trespass against the owner\u2019s constructive possession\u201d). The evidence in appellant\u2019s case is not unlike the scenario where groceries are loaded into a cart\u2014Home Depot retained constructive possession of the paint while appellant loaded the paint into the shopping cart and delivered the shopping cart to Browning because there is no evidence that appellant intended to steal the paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">I do not believe that the evidence proved that Carter intended to permanently deprive Home Depot of the paint. To the contrary, the evidence established Carter intended to take temporary custody of the paint until Browning received the refund from Home Depot. Browning testified at appellant\u2019s trial that their plan was to use the paint to obtain money and that the plan had not progressed as far as discussing what to do with the paint if she was unable to \u201creturn\u201d it. The majority\u2019s statements that the return of the paint was \u201cconditioned\u201d on Home Depot\u2019s acceptance of the refund request implying that Browning and Carter would have kept the paint if no refund was obtained and that we can presume that the trial court found that Browning and Carter would have kept the paint to conceal their own wrongdoing are not supported by the record. First, as previously stated, Browning\u2019s testimony was that they had not discussed what to do with the paint in the absence of a refund. More importantly, however, the presumption as to what the trial court found is dispelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>by the record. In making his ruling on the motion to strike, the trial judge found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">I think the overall intent from the evidence I\u2019ve heard so far was to take the paint, take it up and get a false refund, get the money. And I think they certainly had the intent to steal when they went in there and when you use the paint and I think there was transportation because it was taken to the register and with the intent to use that as a vehicle to get the money, I think that\u2019s sufficient....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Similarly, when making his final ruling, the trial judge stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">I think when they take possession of the paint, it is moved at that time, with that intent in mind, that is a vehicle or agent then it allows them to commit the thrift [sic] of theft, which they are intending to do. <em>And I think when that happens, that is sufficient for the larceny.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Clearly, the trial judge did not contemplate that Browning and Carter would have kept the paint as his statements indicate that he believed that the asportation of the paint within the store with the intent to turn it over for a refund was sufficient to establish the elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Likewise, the line of cases cited by the majority that one who takes property with the intent to return it <em>only </em>if he should receive a reward are not dispositive of the facts in this case, since there is no evidence, nor did the trial court conclude, that Carter and Browning were going to return the paint <em>only </em>if they received the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">\u201c[W]here an offense consists of an act combined with a particular intent, the intent must be established as a matter of fact, and \u2018surmise and speculation as to the existence of the intent are not sufficient.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dixon v. Commonwealth, </em>197 Va. 380, 382, 89 S.E.2d 344, 345 (1955). The intent to temporarily deprive the owner of possession of property is insufficient to prove the intent to steal the property. <em>See Tarpley, </em>261 Va. at 256-57, 542 S.E.2d at 763-64. Thus, I would hold that the Commonwealth failed to prove that appellant had the intent to permanently deprive Home Depot of <em>the paint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Although the evidence is arguably sufficient to prove that Carter intended to obtain money from Home Depot by false pretenses, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-178, the Commonwealth did not charge him with that offense or an attempt to commit that offense. \u201cThe Commonwealth cannot prosecute a defendant for a specific larceny and prevail by proof of another act of larceny for which the defendant \u2018was not prosecuted <em>Owolabi v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 78, 80, 428 S.E.2d 14, 15 (1993) (quoting <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 192, 195, 300 S.E.2d 788, 789 (1983)). Accordingly, I would hold that the evidence was insufficient to support Carter\u2019s conviction for grand larceny. For these reasons, I would reverse the conviction, vacate the judgment below, and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
