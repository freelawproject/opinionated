VDOT also challenged several of AMEC\u2019s claims as unrecoverable under the contract and some aspects of AMEC\u2019s claimed damages as unavailable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The circuit court rejected all of VDOT\u2019s arguments and awarded AMEC a general verdict of $21,181,941, the entire amount AMEC sought at the time of trial. AMEC requested, but the court disallowed, an award of prejudgment interest. The parties\u2019 cross-appeals bring each of these issues to us for review. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In 2000, VDOT awarded AMEC a contract for the construction of the Route 58 Clarksville Bypass in Mecklenburg County. The contract price, approximately $72.5 million, included widening four miles of roadway, constructing interchanges and overpasses, and building four new bridges, the largest spanning the John H. Kerr Reservoir. The contract called for completion of the project in November 2003. The contract\u2019s actual completion occurred in 2005. During the five-year project, AMEC encountered difficulties meeting deadlines and completing tasks within its original cost estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">After the completion of the project, AMEC requested an additional $24 million in cost overruns. Though bundled as a single administrative claim, AMEC\u2019s request for damages included over a dozen specific allegations arising out of various aspects of the five-year project. When VDOT rejected AMEC\u2019s administrative claim, AMEC filed suit in the circuit court. In its amended complaint, AMEC alleged damages caused by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">\u2022 \u201cdiffering site conditions\u201d involving the drilled shaft work on the Kerr Reservoir bridge, Amended Complaint 1\u00cd1\u00cd 36-63,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u2022 high lake water levels in the Kerr Reservoir, <em>id. </em>KK 64-71,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">\u2022 Work Orders 4, 6, 7, 12, and 16 authorizing deadline extensions, <em>id. </em>1111 72-80,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">\u2022 work performed during two \u201cwinter periods,\u201d <em>id. </em>111181-89,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">\u2022 \u201cdiffering site conditions\u201d involving \u201cboulders at the B640 bridge,\u201d <em>id. </em>ITU 90-95,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">\u2022 work site interference from \u201coverhead power lines\u201d at bridge B641, <em>id. </em>HIT 96-104,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-13\">\u2022 problems with the \u201cdrilled shaft concrete mix design,\u201d <em>id. </em>1111105-16,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u2022 replacing the pier 17 foundation cap on the Kerr Reservoir bridge, <em>id. </em>H1\u00cd117-22,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\u2022 a pier cap plan error involving pier 23 on the Kerr Reservoir bridge, <em>id. </em>IN123-27,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u2022 shaft layout problems with pier 18 on the Kerr Reservoir bridge, <em>id. </em>U1\u00cd128-33,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u2022 repair to a pier 2 column on bridge B643, <em>id. </em>HIT 134-36, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u2022 acceleration efforts, <em>id. </em>HIT 144-50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Seeking damages for each of these claims, AMEC relied on Code \u00a7 33.1-387. Under the statute, a government contractor may institute a \u201ccivil action\u201d claiming damages \u201cunder the contract\u201d so long as (i) the civil action seeks only \u201ccosts and expenses\u201d caused by VDOT, and (ii) the contractor submits its claim to VDOT \u201cwithin the time and as set out\u201d in Code \u00a7 33.1-386, which \u201cshall be a condition precedent\u201d to filing suit. Only administrative claims submitted to VDOT, and denied by it, can be asserted in the civil action. <em>See Commonwealth v. Yeatts, Inc., </em>233 Va. 17, 20, 353 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1987) (noting the statute authorizes a civil action \u201cfor any portion of the claim\u201d denied by VDOT).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In its responsive pleadings, VDOT asserted that AMEC failed \u201cto satisfy legal and contractual conditions precedent to the initiation of legal action\u201d and failed to \u201cexhaust administrative remedies.\u201d Prior to trial, VDOT filed a \u201cMotion for Leave to File Pleas in Bar.\u201d The pleas in bar contended that many of AMEC\u2019s claims violated Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A), which authorizes the assertion of an administrative claim \u201cprovided that written notice of the contractor\u2019s intention to file such claim shall have been given to the Department at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based.\u201d VDOT proffered that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>AMEC never provided timely, written notice of its intention to file many of the claims asserted in the civil action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">AMEC resisted the motion for leave on several grounds, including the assertion that the pleas in bar would involve a \u201cfull blown evidentiary hearing, based on a year\u2019s worth of voluminous discovery, which will properly occur at trial anyway.\u201d AMEC Brief in Response to VDOT\u2019s Motion for Leave to File Pleas in Bar at 6. For this reason, AMEC argued, \u201ca full and fair determination of whether notice was provided is best suited for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">On December 13, 2007, the circuit court held a hearing on VDOT\u2019s motion for leave. Without addressing the merits of the underlying pleas, the court held the motion for \u201cleave to file pleas in bar will be denied.\u201d On January 23, 2008, the court entered a written order denying VDOT\u2019s motion for leave to file the pleas in bar.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> About a month later, the parties received a letter opinion from the circuit court addressing the merits of the pleas in bar which the court earlier held could not be filed. The letter began with a reference to \u201coral argument\u201d on \u201cJuly 10, 2007\u201d and ended with this conclusion: \u201cAccordingly, the court finds that AMEC\u2019s actual notice was sufficient enough to satisfy the statutory and written notice provisions a[t] issue.\u201d <em>AMEC Civil, LLC v. Commonwealth, </em>74 Va. Cir. 492, 507 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">With respect to the statutory written notice requirement, the circuit court held that \u201cAMEC did not provide VDOT with written notice of its claims as required by Va.Code Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>\u00a7 33.1-386.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500; <em>see also id. </em>at 504 (\u201calthough AMEC did not fully comply with the written notice requirement of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 33.1-386\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 506 (noting \u201cAMEC\u2019s failure to abide by the statute\u2019s written notice provision\u201d). AMEC\u2019s failure to provide written notice did not matter, the court reasoned, because VDOT had \u201cactual notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506. Actual notice, whether written or not, satisfied the court\u2019s \u201cliberal construction\u201d of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 499.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">VDOT filed a motion for reconsideration pointing out that no hearing had been held on \u201cJuly 10, 2007\u201d as the court\u2019s letter opinion stated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> More important, VDOT argued, the letter opinion \u201ccontained findings of fact and conclusions of law on issues on which no evidence has been taken\u201d and concluded with a judicial ruling on pleas in bar \u201cwhich the Court did not allow VDOT to file.\u201d A few days later, the trial court entered an order denying without comment VDOT\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">At trial, VDOT repeated its assertion that the lack of written notice barred many of AMEC\u2019s claims. When VDOT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>raised the point during its motion to strike, the circuit court held the issue had already been decided pretrial. \u201cThe motion on actual notice as a substitute for written notice has already been ruled on,\u201d the court continued, \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear another thing about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">After trial, the court issued a short letter stating it would enter a \u201cgeneral verdict\u201d in favor of AMEC for $21,181,941, the entire amount of AMEC\u2019s request at trial. <em>See </em>Letter Opinion at 1 (July 1, 2008). The court refused AMEC\u2019s request for prejudgment interest. Reaffirming its pretrial ruling on VDOT\u2019s unfiled pleas in bar, the court stated that every \u201cfactual assumption\u201d made in its pretrial ruling turned out to be true. <em>Id. </em>at 2. The court did not identify any specific exhibits or witnesses supporting this conclusion. The court instead referred generally to \u201cmemoranda addressing the issues\u201d and \u201cminutes\u201d of meetings. <em>Id. </em>These unspecified documents, the court held, provided whatever \u201cwritten notice\u201d AMEC was required to give during the period of contract performance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The cross-appeals in this case raise an array of issues, with the resolution of some mooting the need to resolve others. We believe the dispute on appeal can be clustered into four principal subjects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">A. Timely, Written Notice of AMEC\u2019s Intention to File Claims Pursuant to Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">B. VDOT\u2019s Contractual Challenge to Several of AMEC\u2019s Claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">C.

AMEC\u2019s Request for Prejudgment Interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Our holdings on the issues we address render it unnecessary to offer advisory opinions on the issues we do not address. \u201cIn this case, as in all others, we seek to decide cases \u2018on the best and narrowest ground available\u2019 from the record.\u201d <em>Kirby </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>v.

This statute must be \u201cstrictly construed\u201d by the courts. <em>XL Specialty Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 362, 371, 611 S.E.2d 356, 361 (2005). This principle of strict construction follows a long and unbroken tradition in Virginia law. <em>See Sabre Constr. Corp. v. County of Fairfax, </em>256 Va. 68, 73, 501 S.E.2d 144, 147 (1998) (\u201cThe Public Procurement Act constitutes a waiver of public bodies\u2019 sovereign immunity, is in derogation of the common law, and, therefore, must be strictly construed.\u201d); <em>Halberstam v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 248, 252, 467 S.E.2d 783, 785 (1996) (holding that the \u201cnotice provisions of the Virginia Tort Claims Act\u201d must be \u201cstrictly construed\u201d by the courts). It is thus fair to say, as most commentators do, that \u201cstrict compliance with notice of claim requirements has become the clearly established rule.\u201d Robert K. Richardson, <em>Notice of Claim Requirements under the Virginia Public Procurement Act: Owner\u2019s Friend\u2014Contractor\u2019s Nightmare, </em>48 Va. Lawyer 34, 36 (October 1999); <em>see also </em>14 Michael A. Branca Mark R.

When a statute imposes a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d on a suit against the Commonwealth, that limitation \u201cis not merely a procedural requirement, but a part of the newly created substantive cause of action.\u201d <em>Sabre Constr., </em>256 Va. at 72, 501 S.E.2d at 147 (citation omitted); <em>cf. Hallstrom v. Tillamook County, </em>493 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>U.S. 20, 31,110 S.Ct. 304, 311,107 L.Ed.2d 237 (1989) (holding the legislature\u2019s \u201cmandatory conditions precedent to commencing suit\u201d may not be disregarded as mere technical requirements). It is not an affirmative defense obligating the Commonwealth to disprove the occurrence of the condition but rather an element of the <em>prima facie </em>case on which the plaintiff has the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A) authorizes a contractor to submit an administrative claim to VDOT seeking damages \u201cunder the contract.\u201d The statute, however, includes an important proviso. The administrative claim must \u201cset forth the facts upon which the claim is based, <em>provided </em>that <em>written notice </em>of the contractor\u2019s intention to file such claim <em>shall </em>have been given to the Department <em>at the time </em>of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based.\u201d Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In its pretrial ruling, the circuit court held that \u201cAMEC did <em>not </em>provide VDOT with written notice of its claims as required by Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 33.1-386.\u201d <em>AMEC, </em>74 Va. Cir. at 500 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 504 (acknowledging \u201cAMEC did not fully comply with the written notice requirement of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 33.1-386\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 506 (noting, but finding unimportant, \u201cAMEC\u2019s failure to abide by the statute\u2019s written notice provision\u201d). The court dismissed the statutory default as an inconsequential technicality because VDOT had \u201cactual notice\u201d of AMEC\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In its post-trial ruling, the court reaffirmed its pretrial ruling that \u201cactual notice was an acceptable substitute for written notice.\u201d Letter Opinion at 1 (July 1, 2008). The court added, however, a few sentences offering an alternative holding: From \u201cminutes\u201d of meetings and \u201cmemoranda\u201d exchanged between the parties, VDOT <em>\u201calso </em>had written notice of the plaintiffs claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 (emphasis added). On several levels, we disagree with both the circuit court\u2019s pretrial and post-trial rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">To begin with, the circuit court\u2019s pretrial ruling began its statutory analysis under the heading, \u201cLegal Function Trumps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Legal Form,\u201d and ended on a similar note, \u201clegal form must yield to the interests of legal function.\u201d <em>AMEC, </em>74 Va.

Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 767, 773, 667 S.E.2d 779, 782 (2008), neither we nor the circuit court have the power to excise the \u201cwritten notice\u201d requirement out of Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A) or to discount it as an aberrant formalism ill-suited for the function intended. \u201cJudicial review does not evaluate the \u2018propriety, wisdom, necessity and expediency\u2019 of legislation.\u201d <em>Laurels of Bon Air, LLC v.

The circuit court erred in finding that anything other than written notice would suffice. <em>See Main v.

To comply with Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A), the writing must announce \u201cthe contractor\u2019s <em>intention to file such claim </em>\u201d with VDOT \u201cat the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This unique notice is not a mere heads-up about an ongoing problem with the contractor\u2019s ability to perform. Nor is it a status report on the myriad difficulties discussed during th\u00e9 management of the contract. As was true in this case, most complex government contracts generate an avalanche of such documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">A written notice under Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A) differs from the mass of ordinary documentation by conspicuously declaring that, at least in the contractor\u2019s view, a serious legal threshold has been crossed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Signaling discontent with the agreed contract pricing, the contractor declares its intent to assert an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>administrative claim for damages that, if rejected, could result in the assertion of a civil action against the contracting agency in the courts. Once hopeful of an on-time, on-budget, conflict-free contract, the parties find themselves traveling the path toward litigation. Knowing when a particular dispute has started down that path can be crucial. A contracting agency may need to make difficult judgments about continued management of the contract. And, depending on the magnitude of the dispute, the agency may also need to calibrate the effect a threatened claim might have on its limited procurement budgets.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">That said, Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A)\u2019s written notice proviso does not require the sophistication of a legal pleading. Any document can suffice if it clearly and timely states the contractor\u2019s intention to later file an administrative claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The leading Virginia case on this subject, <em>Flory Small Bus.

Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 230, 541 S.E.2d 915 (2001), enforced an identical written notice requirement of the Public Procurement Act, Code \u00a7 2.2-4363, formerly Code \u00a7 11\u2014 69(A).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Flory, </em>a dispute arose between a contractor and an agency over whether the agency should pay for services performed by the contractor prior to signing the contract. Six months later, after providing services, the contractor sent invoices demanding payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Flory </em>held that the contractor\u2019s invoices, while arguably a written notice of intent to make a claim, came too late because they had not been issued at the \u201ctime of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim is based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238-39, 541 S.E.2d at 919-20. And the dispute over payment six months earlier, while arguably timely, made the agency generally aware of the contractor\u2019s position but did not specifically \u201cinform\u201d the agency that the contractor <em>\u201cintended to claim reimbursement </em>\u201d for the disputed services. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). It was not enough that the contracting agency could have intuited the contractor\u2019s intent to file a claim based upon the nature of the dispute. The intent to file the claim had to be express, timely, and in writing. Because the statute established \u201cmandatory, procedural requirements which must be met in order for a court to reach the merits of a case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 238, 541 S.E.2d at 919, these omissions defeated the contractor\u2019s civil action as a matter of law. <em>Compare Flory, </em>261 Va. at 239, 541 S.E.2d at 920 (\u201c[W]e hold that the trial court did not err in dismissing the Center\u2019s motion for judgment with prejudice, and we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.\u201d), <em>with AMEC, </em>74 Va. Cir. at 500 (asserting that the <em>\u201cFlory </em>Court ... held that the plaintiffs claim could not be dismissed for failing to comply with the written statutory notice requirement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Under <em>Flory, </em>each written notice of intent must be examined individually. \u201cBy identifying more than one event that triggers the filing of an intent to file a claim, the statute acknowledges that not all claims will arise under the same circumstances.\u201d <em>Flory, </em>261 Va. at 238, 541 S.E.2d at 919. It necessarily follows that the \u201ctiming and form\u201d of a putative notice of intent \u201crequires an examination of the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Guided by these principles, we review on appeal each of AMEC\u2019s claims that VDOT contends did not satisfy the written notice requirement of Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u2022 <em>Claim Involving Drilled Shaft Work</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">This claim involved difficulties AMEC encountered while performing the drilled shaft work for the Kerr Reservoir bridge. Various letters and meeting minutes, some as early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>as 2000, showed that AMEC and VDOT knew of problems associated with this aspect of the project. In 2001, despite these concerns, AMEC began the drilled shaft work on the Kerr Reservoir bridge. AMEC waited until 2003\u2014two years after beginning the drilled shaft work\u2014to provide its first written notice of an intention to assert a claim. By that time, AMEC had completed about 85% of the drilled shaft work on the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">As in <em>Flory, </em>the earlier exchange of documents concerning the problems with the drilled shaft work did not comply with Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A)\u2019s requirement that the notice announce the contractor\u2019s intention to file an administrative claim for damages. AMEC\u2019s 2003 written notice, while clearly announcing such an intention, was untimely because it came long after \u201cthe time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based.\u201d Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u2022 <em>Claim for Defects in the Drilled Shaft: Concrete Specification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">During the drilled shaft work, AMEC encountered problems with the concrete mix it used in an effort to comply with the applicable contractual specification. In its administrative claim, AMEC asserted the specification was defective and VDOT should have known about it. No evidence at trial, however, showed that AMEC ever provided any written notice during the performance of the contract of an intention to later file a claim for damages caused by the allegedly defective concrete specification.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u2022 <em>Claim for Concrete Formivork for Foundation Caps, Piers &amp; Columns</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">In its administrative claim, AMEC sought damages for work associated with setting and stripping concrete formwork for foundation caps, piers, and columns. At no point during the contract performance, however, did VDOT ever receive written notice of AMEC\u2019s intention to file independent claims for these alleged additional costs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u2022 <em>Claim for Pier 17 Foundation Cap Repair</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In December 2002, AMEC began constructing a foundation cap for pier 17 at the Kerr Reservoir bridge. Lake water leaked into the form during the concrete pour. The water weakened the concrete and rendered the foundation cap defective. AMEC eventually had to demolish the defective cap and replace it \"with a new one.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">At trial, an AMEC witness testified that an unidentified AMEC representative, on an unspecified date, verbally informed VDOT of AMEC\u2019s intention to file a claim for damages arising out of the extra work associated with the pier 17 foundation cap repair. VDOT denied any such conversation took place. The record contains no written notice from AMEC to VDOT that can be reasonably interpreted as stating any intention by AMEC to file a claim based upon the repair work to pier 17\u2019s foundation cap.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u2022 <em>Claim for Work Authorized, by Work Orders 4, 6, 7 &amp; 16</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The contract anticipated the need for additional work not specified in the bid or award. When the need arose, the contract authorized the issuance of a work order after the parties reached agreement on what was to be done, when it would be done, and at what additional cost.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Over sixty work orders were issued during the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16 collectively authorized additional work, compensated AMEC at contractual unit prices, and extended the project completion date. When AMEC and VDOT agreed to these work orders, AMEC made no written request for any compensation other than the unit pricing specified in the contract. Nor did AMEC at that time communicate in writing any intention to later file a claim seeking damages related to these work orders. AMEC claimed it provided written notice in July 2004, <em>see </em>Trial Ex. D-135, at 7-8, but that notice came after commencement of the work authorized by Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u2022 <em>Claim for Acceleration Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">On various aspects of the job, AMEC accelerated its efforts to keep on track with expected timelines. AMEC claimed this accelerated effort began in January 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">In 2003, one of AMEC\u2019s representatives engaged VDOT \u201cin a talking process\u201d concerning AMEC\u2019s acceleration efforts. The first written notice of any intention to assert an accelera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tion claim came in April 2004. This notice announced an intent to file a claim for damages \u201cincurred to date\u201d for <em>prior </em>acceleration efforts (work commenced before April 2004) not \u201ccorrectly and fully addressed by Work Order No. 39.\u201d AMEC\u2019s later administrative claim sought damages for acceleration efforts commenced before and after the April 2004 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u2022 <em>Claim for Damages During the First Winter Period</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The original contract term of performance contemplated three winter periods from 2000 to 2003. Anticipating the possibility of an extension of the completion date, VDOT Road and Bridge Specification \u00a7 108.09(b) provided that delays caused by \u201cunforeseen causes\u201d pushing work into later winter seasons could render winter working conditions \u201cunsuitable\u201d for completing the job. If that occurred, \u201cconsideration <em>may </em>be given to granting an extension of time that will encompass a suitable period during which such work can be expeditiously and acceptably performed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In March 2003, AMEC provided VDOT with written notice of its intent to claim damages for the winter extension from November 30, 2003, to April 1, 2004 (the \u201cfirst winter period\u201d). This first winter period extension was necessary, AMEC stated, given the time extensions previously granted by VDOT in Work Orders 6, 7, 12, and 16. VDOT acknowledged receipt of the written notice and directed AMEC to keep daily records of its work and actual costs during the extension period.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\"><em>% </em>* * \u00edfc <em>% </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>With respect to this last item, AMEC\u2019s claim for damages during the first winter period, the circuit court correctly held AMEC\u2019s March 2003 written notice informed VDOT in a timely manner of AMEC\u2019s intent to claim damages.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">As for AMEC\u2019s acceleration claim, it turns on the timing and scope of the April 2004 written notice. This notice was untimely as to acceleration efforts prior to April 2004 but timely as to acceleration efforts after April 2004 to the extent they were reasonably attributable to contractually compensable delays not \u201ccorrectly and fully addressed by Work Order No. 39.\u201d On remand, the circuit court should determine whether any such post-notice efforts existed consistent with our views of the contractual compensability of AMEC\u2019s claims. <em>See </em>Part 11(B), <em>infra </em>at 18-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">With respect to the remaining items contested on appeal (AMEC\u2019s claims for drilled shaft work; drilled shaft concrete specification; concrete formwork for foundation caps, piers, and columns; pier 17 foundation cap repair; and Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we hold the court erred as a matter of law in concluding AMEC gave timely \u201cwritten notice\u201d of its \u201cintention to file\u201d a claim \u201cat the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A). The circuit court\u2019s contrary conclusion first dispensed with the statutory requirement of written notice and then held, in the alternative, that written notice had been given from \u201cminutes\u201d of meetings and \u201cmemoranda\u201d exchanged between the parties. No legal precedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>supports the court\u2019s first ruling, and no evidence supports its alternative ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">B. <em>VDOT\u2019s Contractual Challenges to Several of AMEC\u2019s Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"Alp\">At trial, VDOT challenged AMEC\u2019s recovery of damages caused by elevated lake water levels, two winter periods, unanticipated boulders at the B640 bridge, interference from overhead power lines, and premium costs for a bond. No provisions of the contract, VDOT argued, provided any remedy for these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u2022 <em>Damages for Elevated Lake Water Levels</em></p>\n<p id=\"AS_\">Code \u00a7 33.1-387 authorizes a contractor to recover damages \u201cunder the contract.\u201d AMEC sought, and the circuit court awarded, damages caused by elevated lake water levels in the Kerr Reservoir. In support of this claim, AMEC relied on Specification \u00a7 104.03, entitled \u201cDiffering Site Conditions.\u201d This provision authorized additional compensation in two situations: first, when \u201csubsurface or latent physical conditions\u201d encountered during the work differ materially \u201cfrom those indicated in the Contract\u201d and, second, when \u201cunknown physical conditions of an unusual nature\u201d differ materially \u201cfrom those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work----\u201d Specification \u00a7 104.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Another provision of the contract, however, directly addressed the issue of fluctuating lake water levels. Under the heading \u201cSite Information,\u201d the contract stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">The Contractor should be aware that due to the method of operating the John H. Kerr Reservoir and other factors beyond the control of the Department, the power pool elevation in the reservoir routinely fluctuates by several feet. These fluctuations can take place within a few days. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to avail himself of the historical records of the water levels maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wilmington District and determine the impacts possible fluctuations may have on planned construction methods and operation. Information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>on past water levels is available through the Corps website at http://www.saw.usace.army.mil while current and predicted water elevations can be obtained by contacting the John H. Kerr Powerhouse at (804) 738-6371....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Contract Order No. F77 at 142.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> VDOT argued this provision precluded high lake water fluctuations from being deemed a differing site condition under Specification \u00a7 104.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We cannot discern from the record how the circuit court reconciled these two provisions. AMEC draws our attention to a remark from the bench on the last day of trial in which the court said the high water was a \u201cmajor condition,\u201d making it \u201cvery difficult to believe that anyone could reasonably be expected to plan for a period of high water at the level this water was.\u201d The ostensible clarity of that remark, however, is clouded by another statement, only a moment or two earlier, in which the court acknowledged: \u201cI\u2019m not sure there were differing site conditions or not.\u201d And both comments were made in a soliloquy which began, \u201cLet me give you a couple of observations because I\u2019m still not totally pessimistic you can find a way to work this out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">However one interprets th\u00e9 court\u2019s remarks, we hold the contract defeats AMEC\u2019s high-water claim as a matter of law. Specification \u00a7 104.03 authorized a recovery of costs caused (i) by \u201csubsurface or latent physical conditions\u201d encountered during the work which differ materially \u201cfrom those <em>indicated </em>in the <em>contract,\u201d </em>or (ii) by <em>\u201cunknown </em>physical conditions of an unusual nature\u201d which differ materially \u201cfrom those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work.... \u201d (Emphasis added.) In the lexicon of government contract law, the first part of \u00a7 104.03 is known as a Type I condition and the second as a Type II condition. <em>See generally </em>Gerald I. Katz, <em>Virginia General Conditions for Public </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Projects </em>1-9 to I\u201410 (Virginia Law Foundation 1993); John Cibinic, Jr., Ralph C. Nash, Jr. &amp; James F. Nagle, <em>Administration of Government Contracts </em>494-514 (4th ed.2006) (reviewing parallel provision in federal government contracts).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Both aspects of Specification \u00a7 104.03 must then be placed within the context of the Site Information provision. This provision unmistakably informed AMEC that \u201cfactors beyond the control\u201d of VDOT caused the lake water level to \u201croutinely\u201d fluctuate \u201cby several feet.\u201d <em>See </em>Contract Order No. F77 at 142. Inherent in the representation that fluctuations by several feet were <em>routine </em>was the suggestion that <em>non-routine </em>fluctuations might be even higher. The Site Information provision warned AMEC to examine the U.S. Army Corps historical records (which included nearly 50 years of water elevation data) to \u201cdetermine the impacts <em>possible </em>fluctuations may have on <em>planned </em>construction methods and operation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">When read alongside the Site Information provision, neither aspect of \u00a7 104.03 justifies the court\u2019s award. No Type I condition existed because the elevated lake water levels did not differ from any condition \u201cindicated in the contract.\u201d <em>See </em>Specification \u00a7 104.03. Only an incongruence between a contract\u2019s representations and the realities of the worksite triggers a Type I condition under \u00a7 104.03. <em>See, e.g., Asphalt Roads &amp; Materials v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 452, 454, 512 S.E.2d 804, 805 (1999) (finding Type I condition where \u201ccontract drawings\u201d badly underestimated the specific amount of unusable soil to be removed by the contractor). The VDOT-AMEC contract established neither a baseline nor even a range of fluctuations. Instead, the contract advised AMEC that the water level of the lake \u201croutinely fluctuates\u201d by several feet and directed AMEC to review the historical records to take into account non-routine \u201cpossible fluctuations\u201d of these levels. <em>See </em>Contract Order No. F77 at 142. Because lake water fluctuations were \u201cbeyond the control\u201d of VDOT, <em>id., </em>the contract steered clear of making any binding representations on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>No Type II condition existed either. \u201cA Type II differing site condition is more rare than its Type I counterpart and is much more difficult to prove.\u201d 1 Richard F. Smith, <em>Virginia Construction Law Deskbook </em>\u00b611.403, at 296 (2008); <em>see also </em>Cibinic, Nash Nagel, <em>supra, </em>at 492 (recognizing the \u201crelatively heavy burden of proof\u2019 required to prove a Type II condition). At best, AMEC\u2019s evidence proved only that for a period of time the lake water rose to an unusual level. Standing alone, however, that fact did not authorize contractual compensation. ' To recover damages, the contractor must prove \u201cthe condition was <em>unknown, unforeseeable </em>and <em>unusual.\u201d </em>Cibinic, Nash Nagel, <em>supra, </em>at 509 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">As Specification \u00a7 104.03 makes clear, only <em>\u201cunknown </em>physical conditions\u201d can constitute a Type II condition. Known conditions, whether of an unusual nature or not, must be factored into the contractor\u2019s risk assessment. <em>See, e.g., </em>Steven W. Feldman, <em>Government Contract Guidebook </em>\u00a7 28:8(b), at 797-98 (4th ed.2008-09) (listing \u201c[h]igh water level in a lake where work was to be performed\u201d as a condition not included within the \u201cDiffering Site Conditions\u201d provision); Cibinic, Nash Nagle, <em>supra, </em>at 486-87 (listing \u201cflooding\u201d and \u201cunusually high water\u201d as outside the scope of the \u201cDiffering Site Conditions\u201d clause). Under the VDOT-AMEC contract, routine and non-routine water level fluctuations presented <em>known </em>conditional risks associated with the worksite\u2014both categorically placed outside the scope of a Type II condition of Specification \u00a7 104.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In reply, AMEC argues VDOT conceded its contractual responsibility to compensate AMEC for delays attributable to high water by extending the contract completion date for this very reason. Thus, \u201cAMEC as a matter of logic became entitled to compensation for the delay.\u201d AMEC Appellee Br. at 23 (No. 2061-08-2). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">VDOT issued work orders granting AMEC extra time to complete the work. The extensions protected AMEC from <em>per diem </em>liquidated damages under Specification \u00a7 108.12 for failing to complete the work on time and also protected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>contract from being terminated because of the delay. But nothing in these extension work orders, or in the contract itself, necessarily provided AMEC with any contractual entitlement to recover damages during the periods of extension.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">As a general rule, \u201cwhere the issue is excusable delay as opposed to compensable delay, the government accedes, because alternatives such as default termination are not feasible or otherwise not in the governments best interests.\u201d Feldman, <em>swpra, </em>\u00a7 29.11, at 827. Similarly, excusable delay provisions generally \u201cprotect a contractor only from a default termination or liquidated damages liability.\u201d \u201cThese clauses do not entitle the contractor to recover any additional performance costs.\u201d Glen E. Monroe, <em>Government Contract Law Manual </em>\u00a7 2.92, at 52 (1979). \u201cNormally, if the delay was caused by events beyond the contractor\u2019s control, the contractor will be excused for the delay in performance (under the contract\u2019s \u201cDefault\u201d clause) but is responsible for the additional costs caused by the delay.\u201d Feldman, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 16:1, at 488. AMEC\u2019s view to the contrary, if it had the force of law, would badly disorient the management of government contracts. A contracting agency would be loath to grant time extensions if the invariant consequence of doing so meant the agency thereby stipulated to inestimable damages and forfeited any right to contest the compensability of the contractor\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u2022 <em>Claim for Damages During Two \u201cWinter Periods </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The contract initially required AMEC to complete the project by November 2003. On several occasions, VDOT agreed to extend the deadline. The extensions collectively spanned two additional winters. In the circuit court, AMEC argued it had a contractual right to be compensated for damages during these two additional winter periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">On appeal, VDOT claims the circuit court\u2019s general verdict included compensation for each day of both winter periods: $1,938,418 for November 30, 2003, to April 1, 2004, and $1,922,530 for November 30, 2004, to April 1, 2005. AMEC disagrees, arguing that it \u201cdid not claim, nor was it awarded, damages for the <em>entirety </em>of <em>both </em>Winter Periods, as VDOT claims.\u201d AMEC Appellee Br. at 25 (No. 2061-08-2) (emphasis in original). AMEC asserts its evidence established that, \u201cthrough AMEC\u2019s efforts, the \u2018Second Winter Period\u2019 did not ultimately affect AMEC\u2019s completion of the Project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, to the extent AMEC overcame any delay event, including the \u2018Second Winter Period,\u2019 <em>AMEC did not seek compensation for that time.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The circuit court\u2019s general verdict did not segregate either or both of the additional winter periods from the aggregate damages awarded to AMEC. Because we reverse many of AMEC\u2019s claims the circuit court relied upon for its general verdict, we cannot determine how much, if any, of the damage award is attributable to either or both of the additional winter periods. We decline to offer what, in all likelihood, could be an advisory opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Suffice it to say, even when a government contract authorizes recovery of damages for winter weather, the \u201ccontractor must demonstrate\u2014through contemporaneous records if possible\u2014the extent of the adverse weather and its impact on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>critical activities.\u201d Feldman, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 29:7, at 821. We direct the circuit court on remand to review the evidentiary record and to make specific findings on whether AMEC proved any entitlement to damages for conditions during either or both of the two additional winter periods. If the court finds in AMEC\u2019s favor, the court should identify the contractual basis for the award and make factual findings as to the specific damages awarded.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u2022 <em>Claim Related to Boulders at Bridge B6k0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">At trial, AMEC claimed it sustained damages due to drilled shaft problems and unanticipated boulders at the bridge B640 worksite. These conditions allegedly delayed work for 40 days. On appeal, VDOT does not challenge the compensability of the boulders claim. Instead, VDOT contends the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to AMEC proved no more than 8 days of delay attributable to boulders. The remainder, VDOT argues, belongs solely to delays attributable to the drilled shaft claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Here again, on this record, we cannot resolve this dispute on appeal given the inseverable nature of the circuit court\u2019s general verdict. Because we find many of AMEC\u2019s claims statutorily barred (including the drilled shaft claim), we remand the boulders claim to the circuit court with instructions to examine the evidentiary record and to make specific factual findings.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> On remand, the circuit court should apply the maxim: \u201c[WJhere there is evidence of damage from several causes, for a portion of which a defendant cannot be held liable, a plaintiff must present evidence that will show within a reasonable degree of certainty the share of damages for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that defendant is responsible.\u201d <em>TechDyn Systems Corp. v. Whittaker Corp., </em>245 Va. 291, 296, 427 S.E.2d 384, 337 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u2022 <em>Claim for Interference from Overhead Power Lines</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The circuit court\u2019s general verdict included an award of damages AMEC sought as a result of having to wait for Dominion Virginia Power to deenergize overhead power lines near the worksite of pier 1 on bridge B641. AMEC claimed Specification \u00a7 105.07 inaccurately stated that \u201c[e]xisting utilities\u201d were indicated on the plans. The plans specifically noted the presence of the \u201cfootings for the power line post\u201d near pier 1 on bridge B641 but not the lines strung between the power poles. After the contract was awarded, Dominion Virginia Power moved the power pole pedestal shown on the original plans to make way for AMEC to install the road leading to bridge B641.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">In its pretrial motions and at trial, VDOT pointed out that AMEC failed to read the entirety of Specification \u00a7 105.07. Though \u00a7 105.07 anticipated that all utilities would be indicated on VDOT\u2019s plans (presumably the poles as well as the lines between them), the provision nonetheless placed the burden on AMEC to conduct its own pre-construction investigation to confirm the information in the plans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">Prior to preparing a bid, the bidder shall contact known utility owners to determine the nature, extent, and location of existing, adjusted, or new utility facilities. Any additional cost resulting therefrom shall be reflected in the bid price for other items in the Contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Specification \u00a7 105.07. The contract further provided: \u201cThe new location of such utilities will <em>not </em>normally be shown on the plans. Some utilities may remain or be adjusted within the construction limits simultaneously with project construction operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The specification required AMEC to \u201ccoordinate project construction with planned utility adjustments....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>As for any contractual right to damages, Specification \u00a7 105.07 expressly disclaimed VDOT\u2019s liability for damages caused by \u201cinterference\u201d from electrical utility lines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">Except as otherwise specified herein, the Department will not be responsible for any claims for additional compensation from the Contractor resulting from delays, inconvenience, or damage sustained by him attributable to interference by utility appurtenances, or the operation of moving the same, other than a consideration of an extension of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">If it is determined that interference by utility appurtenances caused a delay of such magnitude or otherwise altered project operations so as to increase significantly the Contractor\u2019s cost of performing the work, the [VDOT] Engineer may consider additional compensation limited to the actual costs incurred by the Contractor. The determination of the severity of the interference, its impact on the Contractor\u2019s costs, and the amount, if any, of compensation shall be at the sole discretion of the Engineer.... Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring acceptance of the Contractor\u2019s presentation or payment of additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In short, Specification \u00a7 105.07 noted that the plans should indicate the location of utility lines. AMEC does not deny the pre-construction plans depicted the location of the \u201cpower line pedestal\u201d or claim the utility lines were not readily apparent from a site visit. At trial, AMEC claimed only that the lines themselves were not drawn in. Even assuming an insufficiency in the plans, Specification \u00a7 105.07 obligated the contractor to conduct its own investigation \u201cto determine the nature, extent, and location\u201d of the lines and to \u201ccoordinate project construction with planned utility adjustments.\u201d AMEC conceded that it made no effort to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">While VDOT reserved the \u201csole discretion\u201d to provide the contractor either with an extension or compensation, Specification \u00a7 105.07 divested AMEC of any right to \u201cadditional compensation\u201d beyond that which VDOT has approved. For these reasons, the circuit court erred in awarding any contrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>tual damages under Specification \u00a7 105.07 for damages AMEC allegedly sustained due to the overhead power lines near pier 1 on bridge B641.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u2022 <em>Claim for \u201cBond Premium </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The circuit court awarded AMEC damages for a \u201cbond premium.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> On appeal, VDOT challenges the bond premium award as factually insupportable.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We have found no place in the record, however, where VDOT objected to the bond premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Rule 5A:18 precludes appellants from raising for the first time on appeal \u201cgrounds asserted as a \u2018basis for reversal\u2019 of the trial court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Blackman v.

VDOT asserts AMEC failed to present a <em>prima, facie </em>case for its claim for extended, unabsorbed, home office overhead costs. VDOT also argues AMEC recovered impermissible mark-ups on its claims for reimbursement of actual costs for extra material, labor, and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u2022 <em>Home Office Overhead Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">AMEC\u2019s expert included in his damage model a component for extended, unabsorbed, home office overhead. In a pretrial <em>in limine </em>motion and at trial, VDOT objected to AMEC\u2019s failure to present any evidence that it was unable to recoup home office overhead expenses by deploying its workforce on other revenue-producing aspects of the project. The court rejected VDOT\u2019s objection without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Overhead costs include expenses incurred by a contractor \u201cfor the benefit of its business as a whole.\u201d <em>Fairfax County Redev. &amp; Housing Auth. v. Worcester Bros., </em>257 Va. 382, 387-88, 514 S.E.2d 147, 150-51 (1999). The calculation includes, for example, \u201cthe salaries of office staff, accounting expenses, dues and subscriptions, equipment costs, and utility services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a project takes longer than the contractor estimated, the overhead expenses are \u201cextended\u201d for the period of delay. <em>See generally </em>Cibinic, Nash &amp; Nagle, <em>supra, </em>at 720-26; Branca &amp; Berry, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11:25, at 369. The overhead costs become \u201cunabsorbed\u201d when the contractor cannot perform other revenue-generating work to cover the lost income from the delayed work. <em>See </em>W. Noel Keyes, <em>Government Contracts </em>\u00a7 42.8, at 944-45 &amp; nn. 13 &amp; 15 (3d ed.2003). \u201cWhen this occurs, the \u2018reduced activity\u2019 contract no longer \u2018absorbs\u2019 its share of overhead costs.\u201d <em>Fairfax County Redev., </em>257 Va. at 388, 514 S.E.2d at 150 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Not \u201cevery instance of delay,\u201d even if attributable to a contractual breach, entitles the contractor to a recovery of home office overhead costs. <em>Id. </em>at 388, 514 S.E.2d at 151. To prevail under Virginia law, the contractor must prove among other things \u201cthat it could not otherwise reasonably recoup its <em>pro rata </em>home office expenses incurred while its workforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>was idled by the delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a matter of law, the contractor cannot recover if it fails to \u201cshow that it was reasonably unable to recoup its overhead costs.\u201d <em>Lockheed Info.

It is not enough to show that the \u201cgovernment significantly interfered with efficient performance of the contract.\u201d <em>Charles G. Williams Constr., Inc. v. White, </em>326 F.3d 1376, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2003). In those circumstances, the contractor can still \u201callocate a portion of its indirect costs to that contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On appeal, VDOT contends AMEC failed to offer any evidence that it could not reasonably recoup its home office overhead costs from other revenue-producing work during the periods of delay.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We agree. AMEC\u2019s expert described his calculation of home office overhead in cursory terms. His trial exhibit simply did the math: first calculating the ratio of project revenue to company revenue, applying that ratio to home office overhead, creating a <em>per diem </em>rate from the resulting project attribution, and then multiplying the <em>per diem </em>rate by the total days of delay. These mathematical equations, however, relied wholly upon the unstated (and thus unproven) assumption that AMEC could not have recouped its home office overhead from other revenue-producing work. Neither AMEC\u2019s expert nor any of its fact witnesses addressed this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The inadequacy of AMEC\u2019s factual foundation parallels a similarly insufficient showing rejected by <em>Lockheed. </em>There, a contractor\u2019s expert allocated \u201ccompany-wide overhead ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>penses\u201d to the breached contract and testified that the lost revenue from the contract caused the allocated overhead to drive down the company\u2019s overall profits. <em>Lockheed, </em>259 Va. at 115, 524 S.E.2d at 433. The expert did not specifically address (nor did any other evidence) whether other revenue-producing work could have reasonably absorbed the overhead. <em>Lockheed </em>held the expert\u2019s testimony failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for home office overhead damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">When a breach by a party causes a delay to the ability of the other party to perform, the injured party is entitled to recover, as damages, unabsorbed overhead expenses. To recover such damages, the injured party must show that it could not otherwise recoup its <em>pro rata </em>home office expenses incurred during the delay and it must prove the amount of these expenses with reasonable certainty____ [T]he plaintiff is required to show that it was reasonably unable to recoup its overhead costs. <em>There is no such evidence in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 115-16, 524 S.E.2d at 433 (second emphasis added). The same can be said here as well. AMEC\u2019s evidence failed to address its \u201cability or inability to reasonably recoup,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 116, 524 S.E.2d at 433, overhead expenses from other revenues. The circuit court, therefore, erred in finding AMEC\u2019s evidence sufficient to support an award of home office overhead.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u2022 <em>Actual Costs vs. \u00a7 109.05 Mark-Ups</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Prior to trial, VDOT filed a motion <em>in limine </em>objecting to AMEC\u2019s expected expert testimony on damages. AMEC\u2019s expert, VDOT argued, improperly calculated damages by employing cost mark-ups under Specification \u00a7 109.05. These mark-ups included, among other things, enhancements for \u201cadministration and profit.\u201d The circuit court denied the motion without prejudice reserving all such issues for resolution at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>At trial, AMEC\u2019s expert admitted his damage model used mark-ups allowed under Specification \u00a7 109.05. That provision authorized compensation for \u201c[ejxtra work\u201d on a \u201cforce account basis.\u201d AMEC used this method in its administrative claim and expressly applied \u201capplicable mark ups\u201d to base labor and equipment costs. <em>See </em>AMEC Administrative Claim at 22. A 10% mark-up was applied to AMEC\u2019s subcontractor costs under \u00a7 109.05(f) and a 15% mark-up to AMEC\u2019s rented equipment costs under \u00a7 109.05(d). The materials costs included a 15% mark-up to cover \u201cadministration and profit\u201d under \u00a7 109.05(c). AMEC added to its labor costs a 70% mark-up under \u00a7 109.05(a)-(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">VDOT renewed its objection at trial to this testimony and contested any damage award based upon it. VDOT argued \u00a7 109.05\u2019s \u201cforce account\u201d pricing formula applied not to contractual damages generally but only to \u201c[ejxtra work\u201d pursuant to work orders issued by VDOT during the project. AMEC\u2019s claims for contractual damages did not seek recovery for force-account work orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The circuit court rejected VDOT\u2019s arguments without comment. The court\u2019s general verdict adopted in full the damage figures advocated by AMEC\u2019s expert. On appeal, AMEC defends the circuit court\u2019s award arguing that \u201cSpecification \u00a7 109.05 prescribes the method of calculation.\u201d AMEC Appellee Br. at 18 (No.2061-08-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">As we have already explained, AMEC failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case for the recovery of home office overhead. To the extent \u00a7 109.05\u2019s force-account pricing formula included a recovery of home office overhead, the circuit court erred by awarding such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">We reach the same conclusion with respect to profit margins included within the mark-ups allowed by \u00a7 109.05. Because AMEC\u2019s claims did not (and could not) seek recovery on a force-account basis, \u00a7 109.05 has no relevance.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>AMEC\u2019s claims stemmed either from the Differing Site Conditions provision, \u00a7 104.03, which expressly excluded \u201canticipated profits,\u201d or from the general dispute provision, \u00a7 105.16, which twice stated, \u201cOnly <em>actual costs </em>for materials, labor, and equipment will be considered.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">To the extent it relied on \u00a7 109.05\u2019s allowance of profit margin mark-ups, AMEC\u2019s damage model was systemically flawed. An award of actual costs includes direct costs (like the price of materials and the wages of employees) and indirect costs (like home office overhead). <em>See Fairfax County Redev., </em>257 Va. at 388, 514 S.E.2d at 151. Actual costs exclude profit margin mark-ups, which by definition go beyond direct and indirect expenditures. <em>Cf. </em>William Schwartzkopf &amp; John J. McNamara, <em>Calculating Construction Damages </em>\u00a7 8.03, at 171 (2d ed. 2001) (\u201cGenerally, profit may not be recovered when a contractor is simply delayed in the performance of its work.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">On remand, the circuit court should reexamine the evidentiary record to determine whether the evidence provides a reasonable basis to determine actual costs incurred by AMEC as a result of the claims unaffected by this appeal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>recalculated damage award should exclude any recovery for mark-ups attributable to home office overhead and profit margins.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">D. <em>AMEC\u2019s Request for Prejudgment Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The circuit court denied AMEC\u2019s request for prejudgment interest on its award of compensatory damages.

Code \u00a7 33.1-387 authorizes AMEC\u2019s civil action only on the \u201cportion\u201d of the administrative claim denied by VDOT.

Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A) says nothing about an allowance of prejudgment interest on contractually recoverable costs and expenses. The general prejudgment interest statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-382, does not expressly or by necessary implication apply to the Commonwealth. To be sure, the statutory predecessors to Code \u00a7 8.01-382 (Code of 1904, \u00a7\u00a7 3390-91) existed when the Virginia Supreme Court said our courts \u201caided by the legislature\u201d have authorized prejudgment claims, but that no court has authorized such claims \u201cagainst the State\u201d itself. <em>City of Lynchburg, </em>115 Va. at 608, 80 S.E. at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Nothing in the contract authorized a recovery of prejudgment interest on a successful administrative claim.

At the hearing on January 23, 2008, the court denied the motion without \u201cruling on the merits,\u201d deciding instead \"to wait until trial\u201d to resolve the contested issues. The court memorialized that ruling in a written pretrial order entered February 20, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">. The court addressed the analogous contractual written notice requirement, <em>see </em>n. 4, <em>supra, </em>by finding that the \"lack of written notice, standing alone, does not contractually preclude AMEC from properly bringing claims against VDOT.\u201d <em>AMEC, </em>74 Va. Cir. at 497. In the alternative, the court <em>sua sponte </em>held VDOT \"implicitly waived\" the contractual written notice requirement, id.\u2014a point not raised, briefed, or argued by either party. On appeal, AMEC concedes \"this was not an argument AMEC asserted during motion practice or trial.\" AMEC Appellee Br. at 18 n. 9 (No. 2061-08-2). \u201cNor does AMEC rely upon 'waiver' now.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\"AMEC is <em>not </em>asserting that any notice provisions were waived.\" <em>Id. </em>at 15 n. 7 (emphasis in original). We accept AMEC\u2019s concession. <em>See Billups v. Carter, </em>268 Va. 701, 709, 604 S.E.2d 414, 419 (2004) (\"We adhere to the rule that the principles of waiver and estoppel do not apply to the Commonwealth and that when acting in its governmental capacity it cannot be bound by the unauthorized acts or representations of its employees and agents.\u201d) (citing, among other cases, <em>Main v. Dep\u2019t of Highways, </em>206 Va. 143, 150, 142 S.E.2d 524, 529 (1965), which refused to apply waiver or estoppel to notice provisions of a highway contract).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">.

VDOT's motion for leave to file pleas in bar was not filed until December 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">. That was certainly true of this contract. During the course of the project, AMEC sent VDOT over five hundred serialized letters addressing various concerns. Only a handful announced AMEC\u2019s intention to escalate an ongoing issue into an administrative claim. In one letter, AMEC stated its intention to file a claim only to later expressly withdraw the notice when it \"decided that the extent of this claim did not escalate and therefore AMEC is withdrawing this claim.\u201d AMEC Serial Letter No. 161, withdrawing AMEC Serial Letter No. 100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\">. For purposes of our analysis, we assume <em>arguendo </em>that \"minutes of a progress meeting\" can constitute a statutorily compliant \"written notice\u201d if the written minutes specifically record the contractor's assertion of its intent to file a claim. <em>See Welding, Inc. v. Bland County Serv.

The General Assembly copied the requirement of a \"written notice\u201d of an \"intention to file such claim\u201d from Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A) and incorporated it verbatim into the Public Procurement Act, Code \u00a7 2.2-4363, formerly Code \u00a7 11-69(A). <em>See </em>Virginia Procurement Law Study of Senate Joint Resolution 148, 1979 Session, at 51 (1980) (\"The language in subsection (a) [of former Code \u00a7 11-69] is derived from Section 33.1-386.\u201d). We construe these two synonymous provisions the same way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\">. On appeal, VDOT also contends the circuit court erred by not barring the drilled shaft claim under accord and satisfaction principles. Our holding makes it unnecessary to address this issue. We similarly need not pass judgment on AMEC\u2019s assertion, or VDOT's argument in rebuttal, that VDOT's \"superior knowledge\u201d of the underlying problem (allegedly obtained from another project which experienced similar problems) implied a contractual duty on VDOT\u2019s part to notify AMEC of all foreseeable difficulties associated with this aspect of the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\">. Our holding renders it unnecessary to address VDOT\u2019s alternative argument that, even if AMEC had complied with Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>no viable claim existed because the concrete mix requirements constituted a performance, not a design, specification. <em>See, e.g., P.R. Burke Corp. v. United States, </em>277 F.3d 1346, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2002); <em>Conner Bros. Constr. Co. v. United States, 65 </em>Fed.Cl. 657, 685 (2005). In addition, as was the case with the drilled shaft claim, we do not examine the merits or demerits of AMEC\u2019s \"superior knowledge\u201d assertion. <em>See </em>n. 11, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\">. VDOT\u2019s opening brief addressed this issue specifically. <em>See </em>VDOT Opening Br. at iii &amp; 19-20 (No. 2061-08-2). AMEC\u2019s brief in response does not address the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\">. VDOT also argues that, as a matter of law, AMEC failed to establish any contractual basis for this claim even if it had been the subject of a timely, written notice under Code \u00a7 33.1-386(A). <em>See </em>VDOT Opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Br. at 30-31(No.2061-08-2). We need not decide this question given our holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b308-10\">. The contract also authorized \"force account\u201d work in which VDOT orders the contractor to perform specific tasks. <em>See </em>Specification \u00a7 109.05. Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16 were not \"force account\u201d orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b308-11\">. Work Orders 6 and 7 stated that AMEC agreed to perform \"the work described herein and at the unit prices set forth\u201d and that VDOT agreed to grant the extension and compensate AMEC on a \"unit price\u201d basis. On appeal, VDOT reasserts its accord-and-satisfaction argument made at trial. <em>See </em>VDOT Opening Br. at 38-40 (No.2061-08-2). We need not address this issue given our holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\">. We cite to VDOT\u2019s Road and Bridge Specifications existing at the time of the contract. VDOT amended these Specifications in 2007 and began using the amended version in 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b309-10\">. VDOT does not assert on appeal any written-notice challenge to AMEC's claim for damages arising out of the \u201csecond winter period.\u201d Instead, VDOT challenges the \"second winter period\u201d claim (as well as the first) as unrecoverable under the contract. <em>See </em>Part 11(B), <em>infra </em>at 23-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\">. The same conclusion applies to VDOT\u2019s argument that AMEC failed to provide written notice under Specification \u00a7 105.16, which similarly required written notice \"at the time of the occurrence <em>or </em>beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action are based.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\">. At trial, VDOT either acknowledged or failed to contest AMEC\u2019s assertions that it provided timely, statutorily compliant, written notices of an intention to file claims related to elevated lake levels, the second winter period, boulders at bridge B640, and overhead power lines. VDOT has not made an issue of these claims on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">. Specification \u00a7 103.06, entitled \"Contract Documents,\u201d provided that the \"Contract shall include the schedule of prices submitted by the bidder, plans, standard drawings, these specifications, supplemental specifications, special provisions, special provision copied notes, and the standard form of the Contract, all as furnished by the Department.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b315-5\">. VDOT made this point to AMEC at the time of the extensions. Work Order 39 granted a 148-day extension with the caveat: \"This time extension shall in no way be construed to mean the Department will pay for any overhead cost associate[d] with the time extension.\u201d Work Order 51 repeated this qualification: \"This time extension is not recognition by the Department of responsibility for any delays on the Project and shall in no way be construed to mean the Department will pay for any overhead cost associated with the lime extension.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\">. VDOT raises two additional points. VDOT argues AMEC anticipated unusual water level fluctuations by instructing its subcontractor to \"design the system\u201d for constructing foundation caps so it would work if the water level increased to \"15 feet above the soffit elevation\u201d (about 307 feet), thus putting in place a \u201cdesign parameter\u201d belying AMEC's later allegation that high water levels constituted a differing site condition. To make matters worse, VDOT adds, high water could not be viewed as a but-for cause in any event because AMEC\u2019s engineering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>manager admitted at trial that AMEC could only pour foundation caps \"up to about 301\u201d feet, a level well within the lake's routine fluctuations. We offer no opinion on these assertions, preferring instead to rest our decision solely on the plain meaning of governing contractual provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\">. On appeal, VDOT challenges the contractual compensability of AMEC\u2019s claims to both winter periods. Thus, it should not be assumed on remand that VDOT\u2019s challenge has been waived under law-of-the-case principles (as it should be with respect to AMEC's claim related to boulders at bridge B640, <em>see </em>n. 25, infra).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\">. As for the boulders issue, AMEC\u2019s entitlement to a recovery under the \"Differing Site Conditions\u201d clause became law of the case when VDOT did not challenge it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\">. Other than a line item on a spreadsheet exhibit summarizing AMEC's damages, no evidence in the record discloses what the bond was or what contractual right AMEC had to recover it as an element of damages. The circuit court made no mention of it from the bench or in its letter opinions. We infer the court awarded the bond premium line item, however, because the general verdict award necessarily included the amount. <em>See </em>Modified Summary of Damages (Tr. Exhibit P-103).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\">. Because VDOT does not raise the issue on appeal, we do not address whether the defaulted appellate challenge to the bond premium could be analogized to the situation in <em>Little v. Cooke, </em>274 Va. 697, 719, 652 S.E.2d 129, 142 (2007). In neither its appellate briefs nor oral argument did VDOT seek a remand of the bond premium award for recalculation based upon any success VDOT might have in obtaining the reversal of any of AMEC\u2019s other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">. VDOT's argument on appeal goes further, contending that the evidence affirmatively disproved AMEC\u2019s entitlement for home office overhead by establishing that AMEC mobilized to other revenue-generating aspects of the project\u2014thus producing earnings that fully or partially recouped any allegedly unabsorbed overhead. <em>See P.J. Dick, Inc. </em>v. <em>Principi, </em>324 F.3d 1364, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2003) (affirming denial of overhead costs where die evidence \u201cshows conclusively tiiat [the contractor] was able to progress other parts of the work during the time periods it alleges it was suspended\u2019\u2019). Our holding makes it unnecessary to decide whether the evidence <em>disentitled </em>AMEC to a recovery of home office overhead.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b323-10\">. VDOT does not argue AMEC similarly failed to prove its worksite overhead expenses were unabsorbed. We express no opinion on the matter. <em>See generally </em>Feldman, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 29:6, at 817-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b324-9\">. As AMEC correctly notes, Specification \u00a7 109.05 provided: \u201cExtra work performed in accordance with the requirements of Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u00a7 104.03 will be paid for at the unit prices or lump sum specified in the work order.\" Under \u00a7 101.02, however, \"[e]xtra work\u201d means an \u201citem of work that is not provided for in the Contract as awarded but that is found to be essential to the satisfactory fulfillment of the Contract within its intended scope.\u201d Extra work thus does not include completing, albeit under more arduous or costly conditions, an \"item of work\u201d already required by the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">. The applicability, if any, of Code \u00a7 2.2-4335 to any aspect of AMEC\u2019s delay damage claims has not been addressed by AMEC or VDOT either in the circuit court or on appeal. We thus offer no opinion on this subject. <em>Cf. Martin Bros. Contractors v. Va. Military Inst., </em>277 Va. 586, 675 S.E.2d 183 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\">. VDOT also challenges any use of the \"Rental Rate Blue Book\u201d for purposes of estimating actual costs associated with owner-furnished equipment. AMEC\u2019s expert, however, testified that he used the Blue Book to approximate \"actual costs\u201d for owner furnished equipment. Based on this testimony, the circuit court accepted the Blue Book as \"a standard used in the profession\u201d for estimating these costs. <em>On this record, </em>we cannot say the court was plainly wrong. Therefore, once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>purged of home office overhead and profit margins, if any, the estimates in the \u201cRental Rate Blue Book\u201d may be relied upon by the circuit court as a basis for determining owner-furnished equipment costs on remand. <em>See generally </em>Schwartzkopf &amp; McNamara, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3.04[C], at 88-89.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\">. <em>Safe Deposit Co. </em>quoted this <em>dictum </em>from a Wisconsin case that has since been overruled. <em>See City of Milwaukee v.
