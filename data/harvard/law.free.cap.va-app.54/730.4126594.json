Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); and 2) the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request for individual therapy in lieu of the court-ordered sex offender treatment program. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">On September 6, 2007, pursuant to a plea agreement with the Commonwealth, Carroll entered a guilty plea to rape in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-61 while asserting his innocence pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160. The trial court accepted Carroll\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea of guilty, and continued the case for five years. Under the conditions of the agreement, Carroll was required to be on active probation during the five years. If, during the five years, Carroll remained of general good behavior, had no contact with the victim or her family, and paid his court costs, the Commonwealth agreed, at the end of the five years, to ask the trial court to vacate the plea of guilty and accept instead a guilty plea to assault and battery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">During Carroll\u2019s guilty plea hearing, the trial court asked him several questions about whether he understood his <em>Alford </em>plea.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\">THE COURT: What is an Alford plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">[DEFENDANT]: It\u2019s a plea where you\u2019re pleading guilty, sir, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-10\">THE COURT: No, you\u2019re not pleading guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-11\">[DEFENDANT]: Well, what the plea is, it says that the prosecutor feels he has enough evidence to convict me even though I don\u2019t think I\u2019m guilty of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>THE COURT: And you don\u2019t want to take that chance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">[DEFENDANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">THE COURT: In other words, you didn\u2019t want to roll the bones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">[DEFENDANT]: I don\u2019t play the lottery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">THE COURT: Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">[DEFENDANT]: I don\u2019t play the lottery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-10\">THE COURT: Okay. Now, do you <em>realize\u2014do you understand that the legal consequences of an Alford plea are the same as a guilty plea or a finding of guilt?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-11\">[DEFENDANT]: That\u2019s what I\u2019m told.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-12\">THE COURT: <em>But do you understand that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-13\">[DEFENDANT]: <em>I understand as best that I have from what my attorney has told me, yes, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-14\">THE COURT: Did you need more time to talk to your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-15\">[DEFENDANT]: No, sir. I mean, he\u2019s explained.it to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-16\">THE COURT: Well, then, do you understand what he\u2019s saying to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-17\">[DEFENDANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-18\">THE COURT: I have to be convinced that you know what you\u2019re doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-19\">[DEFENDANT]: <em>Yes, sir. I know what I\u2019m doing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-20\">The trial court then accepted Carroll\u2019s plea and continued the case to September 14, 2012. One provision of the trial court\u2019s order was that: \u201cThe Defendant shall comply with all the rules and requirements set by the Probation Officer. Probation shall include <em>any </em>substance abuse counseling, testing, and/or treatment as prescribed by the Probation Officer.\u201d On October 9, 2007, Carroll again appeared in court for a hearing on his motion to amend provisions of the sentencing order. Carroll\u2019s motion asked the court for an order that his probation be administered and supervised by the Arlington County probation office, that his travel within the Commonwealth be unrestricted to accommodate his work as a realtor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>and that no sex offender treatment be required. The court issued an order October 30 of the same year, granting the motion in part. The court agreed that Carroll\u2019s probation could be supervised from Arlington\u2014it had previously been supervised from Fairfax\u2014and left any travel restrictions to the discretion of Carroll\u2019s probation officer. The order also states that, \u201cany sex offender treatment is to be determined by the Defendant\u2019s supervising Probation Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">After this hearing, Carroll enrolled at the Center for Clinical and Forensic Services, Inc. (CCFS) for sex offender treatment. On May 7, 2008, Cynthia Urick, of CCFS, wrote a letter to Carroll\u2019s probation officer. According to the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQp\">When Mr. Carroll began treatment at CCFS, he was placed in Phase 1 of the process. During this component of treatment, offenders are introduced to foundational concepts associated with sex offender treatment (e.g. Denial and Consent) and are required to present full disclosure of their referral offense and sexual history. In addition, the polygraph is used as a treatment tool to verify the offender\u2019s self-reported history. When Mr. Carroll began services at CCFS, he denied all accounts of the offense he was convicted of and indicated that he was \u201cset up\u201d by his ex-wife. Efforts to engage him in discussions about the offense did not produce a change in his position. In fact, he became hostile and resistant when asked about the specific details. As a result, he was referred for an instant offense polygraph, which he took on March 28, 2008. On the exam, he denied questions related to ever having sexual intercourse or sexual contact with his stepdaughter and the result was \u201cdeception indicated.\u201d Subsequent to the exam, Mr. Carroll was again presented with several opportunities to take responsibility for the offense but he failed to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">Mr. Carroll has been in treatment for approximately two months and has made no forward progress regarding accepting responsibility for the crime for which he was convicted. Insofar as there is no indication that he will make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>the needed change, Mr. Carroll is being unsuccessfully discharged for lack of amenability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The court issued a bench warrant for Carroll\u2019s arrest for violating the conditions of his probation and, on June 13, 2008, held a hearing on the allegations. Carroll\u2019s attorney denied that he was in violation, and the court heard evidence from the probation office, including the letter from CCFS describing the reasons for Carroll\u2019s discharge from the program. The court announced that it did not consider the part of the letter referring to polygraph testing. At the close of the evidence, Carroll argued that he was not in violation of his probation because of the trial court\u2019s acceptance of his <em>Alford </em>plea. He did not argue that the court could not find him in violation because of the terms of any plea agreement. The trial court found Carroll in violation of his probation, convicted him of the rape charge, sentenced him to five years in prison, with all five years suspended, and ordered him to complete five years of supervised probation and to successfully complete sex offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Carroll also argued that the court should order individual therapy. His attorney proffered that Dr. Stan Saminov, who holds a Ph.D and has dealt with sex offense cases before, would be willing to provide treatment for Carroll. Instead of ordering individual therapy, the court\u2019s order requires Carroll to \u201center and complete sex offender treatment as required by his Probation Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">\n<em>Scope of the Issues Presented for Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">The greater part of the dissent\u2019s criticism of our decision concerns the terms of the plea agreement Carroll made with the Commonwealth. This agreement was recorded in a written document, signed by the parties, that includes an integration clause stating that \u201cI understand that the judge will not enforce any agreement not written down here.\u201d Sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>offender treatment is not mentioned anywhere in this document. The dissent argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to find Carroll in violation of his probation was, itself, a violation of the plea agreement\u2019s terms, and therefore, was error. We note, with respect, the argument advanced by the dissent is not before us for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The reason we may not consider the plea agreement terms is that they are not a basis for reversal permitted by our Rules of Court. According to Rule 5A: 12(c): \u201cOnly questions presented in the petition for appeal will be noticed by the Court of Appeals.\u201d Carroll petitioned for, and was granted, an appeal on the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">1) Whether the trial court erred in finding Appellant in violation of probation based solely on Appellant\u2019s refusal to admit to rape during sex offender therapy given the fact that the Commonwealth agreed to and the court accepted an <em>Alford </em>plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\">2) Whether the trial court erred in not considering a reasonable alternative treatment modality (sex offender treatment with an expert forensic psychologist) in lieu of probation revocation coupled with the condition of successfully completing the same program from which appellant was terminated?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Neither question asks us to consider whether the trial court\u2019s decision finding that Carroll was in violation of his probation was a breach of the terms of the plea agreement Carroll made with the Commonwealth. Accordingly, the dissent\u2019s emphasis on the general rule that plea agreements are enforced under contract principles, while correct as a statement of the law, <em>see Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 77, 80-82, 655 S.E.2d 7, 9-10 (2008), does not, we respectfully conclude, speak to the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">The dissenting opinion\u2019s discussion of the plea agreement suggests, however, that its terms are <em>necessarily </em>connected to our resolution of the first of Carroll\u2019s questions presented. Specifically, the dissent adduces \u201ctwo important reasons\u201d for disagreeing with our conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>(1) there is a fundamental inconsistency between appellant\u2019s claim of innocence implicit in his making a <em>plea agreement </em>to the underlying charge pursuant to <em>Alford </em>and a subsequently and unilaterally imposed probation condition requiring that appellant <em>admit </em>to the same charge during sex offender treatment; and (2) the <em>plea agreement </em>in the instant case, which by its very nature is a contract entered into by the Commonwealth and appellant and approved by the trial court, contained no probation condition that the appellant sacrifice his contractual prerogatives under his <em>Alford </em>plea and <em>admit </em>to the underlying charge in sex offender treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-5\"><em>Infra </em>at 751-58, 682 S.E.2d at 103-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">We agree that the dissent presents two separate arguments: (1) that the trial court\u2019s finding that Carroll was in violation of his probation was error because Carroll\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea gave him an enforceable prerogative to maintain his innocence; and (2) that the same finding was error because the terms of Carroll\u2019s plea agreement gave him an enforceable prerogative to maintain his innocence. The dissent describes these separate arguments in successive clauses, each of which assigns importance both to the <em>Alford </em>plea <em>and </em>the plea agreement. Thus, the dissent reasons that these arguments are logically intertwined and legally inseparable, that is, that one cannot reach the merits of the <em>Alford </em>plea question narrowly raised on appeal without first resolving the merits of the plea agreement question, which is,' simply stated, not before us for resolution. Our analysis follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">We know the plea agreement\u2019s terms have no necessary connection to the issue of Carroll\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea because, under the contract principles relied upon by the dissent, the argument\u20141) that the agreement was recorded in a written document; 2) that the document included an integration clause stipulating that all the terms of the agreement were in the document; and 3) that the document contained no specific requirement that Carroll undergo sex offender treatment or admit his guilt during that treatment\u2014would be an equally valid argument, <em>even if Carroll had entered a standard, non-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number><em>Alford, guilty plea and admitted that he committed the offense. </em>What the two arguments have in common is that each attacks the same ruling of the trial court. However, we do not believe that is a sufficient connection to meet the requirement of Rule 5A:12(c). <em>See Clifford v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 23, 645 S.E.2d 295 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">In <em>Clifford, </em>the defendant objected in the trial court to its refusal to allow him to cross-examine the complaining witness about a prior complaint of sexual abuse against another person, not the defendant. At trial, the defendant argued such questioning should be permitted, despite the Rape Shield statute, because such questioning tended to show the complaining witness had access to law enforcement, and yet did not make a contemporaneous complaint about the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 23, 645 S.E.2d at 296. Our Supreme Court held that this argument could not be considered as part of the separate argument, made in defendant\u2019s petition for appeal, that, because the person accused in the alleged victim\u2019s prior complaint was later acquitted, the defendant had a constitutional right to cross-examine his accuser about the prior false accusations. <em>Id. </em>at 25, 645 S.E.2d at 297. <em>See also Lay v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 330, 336, 649 S.E.2d 714, 716-17 (2007) (In appeal of breaking and entering conviction, Rule 5A: 12(c) prevented this Court from reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence under a constructive breaking theory because defendant\u2019s question presented asked whether evidence was sufficient to prove an actual breaking.).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">However, the application of Rule 5A:12(c) is not uniformly rigid. <em>See Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 747, 668 S.E.2d 150 (2008). In <em>Moore, </em>our Supreme Court reversed the decision of the <em>en banc </em>Court of Appeals, <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 1, 654 S.E.2d 305 (2007), that Rule 5A:12(c) barred us from reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the fruits of a police stop of his vehicle, where the parties argued the question of whether the police officer had \u201ca reasonable, articulable suspicion\u201d to make the stop before the trial court and before a panel of this Court, but where the question presented in the defendant\u2019s brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>framed the issue as whether the trial court erred in finding that the stop was supported by the higher standard of probable cause. <em>Moore, </em>276 Va. at 754-56, 668 S.E.2d at 154-55. A majority of the <em>en banc </em>Court of Appeals had concluded that consideration of the suppression issue on appeal was barred because the defendant misstated the applicable legal standard in his question presented. <em>Moore, </em>51 Va.App. at 3-4, 654 S.E.2d at 306. It is not clear that the Supreme Court entirely adopted the view of the <em>en banc </em>dissenting opinion; since the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion stresses the argument that the Attorney General waived any right to rely on Rule 5A: 12(c) by rephrasing the standard as one of reasonable suspicion in his own brief, <em>Moore, </em>276 Va. at 756, 668 S.E.2d at 155, and did not proceed to analyze whether the reasonable suspicion question was \u201csubsumed\u201d within the probable cause issue raised in the defendant\u2019s petition. In this case, the Commonwealth\u2019s brief did not rephrase any of Carroll\u2019s questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Even if we assume that the <em>Moore </em>dissent correctly analyzed the 5A: 12(c) issue, an issue apparently not reached by the Supreme Court decision that is binding on us, the Rule would still bar our consideration of the terms of Carroll\u2019s plea agreement. In distinguishing <em>Clifford </em>and <em>Selph v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 426, 632 S.E.2d 24 (2006), from the issues raised in <em>Moore, </em>the dissent wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">Here, the question whether reasonable suspicion for the stop existed was subsumed within the probable cause assignment of error because the same evidence was involved and the only difference in the legal analysis was whether that evidence met the \u201clesser\u201d legal standard of reasonable suspicion rather than the \u201cgreater\u201d legal standard of probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-7\"><em>Moore, </em>51 Va.App. at 8, 654 S.E.2d at 308 (Elder, J., joined by Felton, C.J., and Beales J., dissenting). Unlike the issues in <em>Moore, </em>the plea agreement and <em>Alford </em>plea questions do not involve the same evidence; the former requires attention to the text of the written agreement, and the latter does not. Nor do the questions require similar legal analyses. As the dissent acknowledges, plea agreements are governed by con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>tract principles. The <em>Alford </em>plea issue, however, requires instead a close analysis of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Alford </em>decision and the cases interpreting it. Even under the most flexible interpretation arguably supported by our Rule 5A:12(c) precedents, the plea agreement terms are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The dissent raises two other arguments that should be addressed before proceeding to the merits. Neither, we respectfully submit, can be considered under Rules 5A:12(c) and 5A:18. First, there is the argument that, because Carroll did not know he would be required to admit to the offense in sex offender treatment at the time he entered his <em>Alford </em>plea, his plea was not \u201cintelligently and voluntarily made\u201d as required by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711-12, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), to protect several federal constitutional rights, e.g. trial by jury, confrontation of witness, and the privilege against self-incrimination. Secondly, the dissent argues that the probation officer, as an agent of the executive branch, violated the separation of powers provisions of the Virginia Constitution, Va. Const., art. I, \u00a7 5 and art. Ill, \u00a7 I, and acted in a judicial capacity by imposing a probation condition not ordered by the trial court at sentencing. We note these issues were not raised in Carroll\u2019s questions presented, and Carroll\u2019s brief does not cite <em>Boykin </em>or any provision of the United States or Virginia Constitutions. Constitutional questions are not immune from the requirements of Rule 5A:12(c). <em>See e.g. Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va. App. 196, 207, 629 S.E.2d 701, 706 (2006) (\u201cTo the extent appellant\u2019s argument may raise due process notice issues, he did not include a due process claim in his petition for appeal, and no appeal was granted on this issue. Thus we may not consider such a claim in this appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A: 12(c).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Moreover, Rule 5A:18 provides that: \u201cNo ruling of the trial court or the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling....\u201d Carroll did not argue at his probation violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>hearing, or at any point during the litigation in the circuit court, that a finding that he was in violation would violate <em>Boykin, </em>the Federal Constitution, or the Virginia Constitution. Nor does he argue <em>on </em>appeal that these issues must be considered to attain the ends of justice. \u201c[A]n appellate court may not \u2018recast\u2019 an argument made in a lower court into a different argument upon which to base its decision.... \u201d <em>Clifford, </em>274 Va. at 25, 645 S.E.2d at 297. We must, therefore, restrict the scope of our review to the merits of Carroll\u2019s questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">\n<em>Did Entering an Alford Plea Give Carroll an Enforceable Prerogative to Maintain His Innocence During Sex Offender Treatment?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">\u201c[W]e have held consistently that \u2018revocation of a suspended sentence lies in the discretion of the trial court and that discretion is quite broad.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peyton v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 503, 508, 604 S.E.2d 17,19 (2004) (quoting <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 325, 326, 228 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1976)). The trial court had the authority, under Code \u00a7 19.2-303.3(B), to impose the probation condition that Carroll abide by any additional requirements established by his local probation office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-306(A): \u201cIn any case in which the court has suspended the execution or imposition of sentence, the court may revoke the suspension of sentence for any cause the court deems sufficient that occurred at any time within the probation period, or within the period of suspension fixed by the court.\u201d \u201cNonetheless, we have required that \u2018[t]he cause deemed by the court to be sufficient for revoking a suspension must be a reasonable cause.... The discretion required is a judicial discretion, the exercise of which implies conscientious judgment, not arbitrary action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peyton, </em>268 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Va. at 508-09, 604 S.E.2d at 19 (quoting <em>Marshall v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 217, 220, 116 S.E.2d 270, 273 (I960)). There is no dispute that Carroll had notice, by the time of the trial court\u2019s order of October 30, 2007 at the latest, that his compliance with any sex offender treatment ordered by his probation officer was required by the court. Nor can we say that, given the offense of conviction, such a condition was unreasonable. <em>See Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 565, 574-75, 490 S.E.2d 274, 278 (1997); <em>Nuckoles v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1083, 1086, 407 S.E.2d 355, 356 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Carroll\u2019s argument is that it was not the offense of conviction, but the fact that he was convicted of that offense via an <em>Alford </em>plea, that made his later violation of probation for refusing to admit to the offense unreasonable as a matter of law. <em>At its core, Carroll\u2019s argument is that an Alford plea, by its nature, contains an implicit promise that the defendant will never be required to admit his guilt. </em>And that is the precise issue before us for resolution. Because Carroll\u2019s argument depends heavily on the correctness of his interpretation of <em>Alford, </em>and also because this appears to be a question of first impression in Virginia, we must examine the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Alford </em>opinion in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The defendant in <em>Alford </em>was indicted for first-degree murder, a capital offense, and entered a plea of guilty to second-degree murder, which carried a maximum penalty of thirty years imprisonment. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 26-29, 91 S.Ct. at 162-63.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-7\">After the summary presentation of the State\u2019s case, Alford took the stand and testified that he had not committed the murder but that he was pleading guilty because he faced the threat of the death penalty if he did not do so. In response to the questions of his counsel, he acknowledged that his counsel had informed him of the difference between second- and first-degree murder and of his rights in case he chose to go to trial. The trial court then asked appellee if, in light of his denial of guilt, he still desired to plead guilty to second-degree murder and appellee answered, \u201cYes, sir. I plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>guilty on\u2014from the circumstances that he [Alford\u2019s attorney] told me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 28-29, 91 S.Ct. at 162-63. The defendant later sought habeas corpus relief in federal court, arguing that his guilty plea had not been made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily because he had been coerced into entering the plea by his fear of the death penalty. A divided panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, relying heavily on <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>390 U.S. 570, 571-72, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 1210-11, 20 L.Ed.2d 138 (1968) (federal kidnapping statute that authorized the death penalty if defendant was convicted after a jury trial but not if defendant pled guilty was unconstitutional for impermissibly impairing the right to trial by jury). <em>Alford v. North Carolina, </em>405 F.2d 340 (4th Cir.1968). The State of North Carolina then appealed to the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The Supreme Court began its analysis by announcing that <em>Jackson </em>did not create any new test for the validity of guilty pleas. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 31, 91 S.Ct. at 164. \u201cThe standard was and remains whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court emphasized that making a guilty plea that had the consequence of limiting the severity of the potential sentence could clearly be the product of a free and rational choice, even if \u201c[the defendant] would not have pleaded except for the opportunity to limit the possible penalty. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court recognized that ordinary pleas of guilty are accompanied by an admission by the defendant that he committed the crime charged, <em>id. </em>at 32, 91 S.Ct. at 164, and proceeded to assess the implications of the defendant\u2019s protestations of innocence on the validity of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">After summarizing the conflicting state and lower federal court cases on the question, the Court reviewed its own prior cases, <em>Lynch v. Overholser, </em>369 U.S. 705, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962) (suggesting that a judge could accept a guilty plea even if the evidence suggested there was a valid defense), and <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>272 U.S. 451, 47 S.Ct. 127, 71 L.Ed. 347 (1926) (upholding a federal court\u2019s power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>impose a prison sentence after accepting a plea of <em>nolo </em>contendere).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">These cases would be directly in point if Alford had simply insisted on his plea but refused to admit the crime. The fact that his plea was denominated a plea of guilty rather than a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>is of no constitutional significance with respect to the issue now before us, for the Constitution is concerned with the practical consequences, not the formal categorizations, of state law. Thus, while most pleas of guilty consist of both a waiver of trial and an express admission of guilt, the latter element is not a constitutional requisite to the imposition of criminal penalty. An individual accused of crime may voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even if he is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\"><em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 37, 91 S.Ct. at 167 (citations omitted). Noting the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d against the defendant, the Court concluded: \u201cWhen his plea is viewed in light of the evidence against him, which substantially negated his claim of innocence and which further provided a means by which the judge could test whether the plea was being intelligently entered, its validity cannot be seriously questioned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37-38, 91 S.Ct. at 167-68 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Carroll argues that his probation violation for making claims of innocence during sex offender therapy was inconsistent with his <em>Alford </em>plea. At least two courts in other jurisdictions have agreed with him, holding that a defendant did not violate probation by refusing to admit guilt during sex offender treatment. <em>People v. Walters, </em>164 Misc.2d 986, 627 N.Y.S.2d 289 (N.Y.Co.Ct.1995); <em>State v. Birchler, </em>2000 WL 1473152, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 4622 (2000). However, the Commonwealth\u2019s position to the contrary is endorsed by several other jurisdictions, which reach the opposite conclusion. <em>See State v. Faraday, </em>268 Conn. 174, 842 A.2d 567 (2004); <em>Warren v. Richland Co. Circuit Ct., </em>223 F.3d 454 (7th Cir.2000); <em>State v. Alston, </em>139 N.C.App. 787, 534 S.E.2d 666 (2000); <em>State ex rel. Warren v. Schwarz, </em>219 Wis.2d 615, 579 N.W.2d 698, 706 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>(1998); <em>People v. Birdsong, </em>958 P.2d 1124 (Colo.1998) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; <em>State v. Jones, </em>129 Idaho 471, 926 P.2d 1318 (App.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We find the latter set of cases more persuasive, not because they form a longer list, but because their analysis is more faithful to the reasoning of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Alford. </em>Recall that <em>Alford </em>did not announce any new standard for the validity of guilty pleas. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 31, 91 S.Ct. at 164. The decision merely recited an existing standard, previously announced in <em>Boykin, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709 (i.e., a valid guilty plea requires an affirmative showing that the plea was intelligent and voluntary), and applied that standard to a guilty plea entered amid contemporaneous assertions of innocence, holding that such a guilty plea is not automatically invalid under the Federal Constitution. <em>Alford </em>contains no language indicating that the <em>consequences </em>of such a plea are different from the consequences of a plea of <em>nolo </em>contendere,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, the text of the opinion affirmatively suggests that they are the same.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Nor can we perceive <em>any material difference </em>between a plea that refuses to admit commission of the criminal act and a plea containing a protestation of innocence when, as in the instant case, a defendant intelligently concludes that his interests require entry of a guilty plea and the record before the judge contains strong evidence of actual guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9W\"><em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 37, 91 S.Ct. at 167 (emphasis added). \u201cAn Alford plea is a guilty plea in the same way that a plea of nolo contendere or no contest is a guilty plea.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Warren, </em>254 Neb. at 631, 579 N.W.2d at 706. <em>See also </em>Ward, <em>A Plea Best Not Taken: Why Criminal Defendants Should Avoid the Alford Plea, </em>68 Mo. L.Rev. 913, 915-18 (2003). We also note that this was exactly what the trial judge told Carroll an <em>Alford </em>plea meant, and what Carroll acknowledged he understood, given his affirmative answer to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">Q: [Do] you understand that the legal consequences of an Alford plea <em>are the same as a guilty plea or a finding of guilt?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\"><em>Walters </em>and <em>Birchler. </em>on the other hand, do not review the reasoning of <em>Alford, </em>and they contain propositions with no basis in the text of that decision. <em>See Birchler, </em>2000 WL 1473152, at *2, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 4622, at 4 (\u201cAn <em>Alford </em>plea is considered a qualified guilty plea because it allows a defendant to enter a guilty plea yet maintain his or her innocence.\u201d). The <em>Birchler </em>court cites <em>\u201cAlford, supra\u201d </em>for this proposition, but it does not mention the page where this proposition is to be found, nor does it quote or cite any language from <em>Alford </em>suggesting that such a plea is a \u201cqualified\u201d guilty plea. <em>See also Walters, </em>164 Misc.2d at 988, 627 N.Y.S.2d at 291 (holding, without any citation to authority that \u201c[t]o require defendant to admit to his factual guilt during treatment, upon threat of incarceration, is directly inconsistent with the plea agreement entered into by the People, the defendant and the Justice Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Of course there is an inconsistency between any defendant\u2019s protestations of innocence and the probation con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>dition that he admit his guilt. But, in some degree, this kind of tension is inherent in every <em>Alford </em>plea.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">A guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine is a judicial oxymoron in that the defendant does not admit guilt but acknowledges that the state\u2019s evidence against him is so strong that he is prepared to accept the entry of a guilty plea nevertheless. In <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37 [91 S.Ct. 160,167, 27 L.Ed.2d 162] (1970), the United States Supreme Court treated such guilty pleas as the functional equivalent of a plea of nolo contendere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\"><em>State v. Palmer, </em>[196 Conn. 157] 491 A.2d 1075, 1077 n. 3 (Conn.1985). Ultimately, Carroll\u2019s argument of inconsistency proves too much. A defendant who has entered an <em>Alford </em>plea is not an innocent person for the purposes of criminal sentencing and probation. To mitigate the possibility that an innocent person will so plead, a factual basis is required supporting the finding of guilt before an <em>Alford </em>plea can be accepted. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 503, 511, 513 S.E.2d 431, 435 (1999). \u201cWhile <em>Alford </em>pleas are rare, from the State\u2019s perspective they are no different from other guilty pleas; it would otherwise be unconscionable for a court to sentence an individual t&lt;3 a term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Silmon v. Travis, </em>[95 N.Y.2d 470, 718 N.Y.S.2d 704] 741 N.E.2d 501, 504 (N.Y.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The rest of Carroll\u2019s argument is an attack on the evidence that he actually raped his stepdaughter. Carroll emphasizes the lack of physical evidence that he committed the crime, the inconsistencies between the alleged victim\u2019s statements and the physical evidence, and the alleged victim\u2019s prior inconsistent statements. Finally, Carroll makes the quite plausible claim that a plea of guilty to assault and battery after five years of probation is an unusually favorable disposition for such a serious charge, and indeed a disposition that would probably be unacceptable to the Commonwealth if it had stronger evidence. But these points are relevant to the claim that the trial judge erred in finding an adequate factual basis to support <em>Carroll\u2019s Alford plea, </em>and Carroll has not appealed this finding. They do nothing to advance the separate claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>that the trial court, <em>after </em>accepting the plea, later erred in finding Carroll in violation of probation because <em>every Alford </em>plea necessarily imposes special limits on the probation conditions a court may impose, a claim that is not supported by the reasoning of the <em>Alford </em>decision. Given the questions presented in this case, our acceptance of the second claim is necessary before we may reverse Carroll\u2019s conviction. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in finding that Carroll violated his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">\n<em>Did the Trial Court Abuse its Discretion in Denying Carroll\u2019s Request for Individual Sex Offender Therapy?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Carroll also appeals the trial court\u2019s refusal to order him into individual therapy in lieu of the sex offender program from which he had already been discharged for refusing to admit his guilt. Carroll formulates his second question presented thusly: \u201cWhether the trial court erred in not considering a reasonable alternative treatment modality (sex offender treatment with an expert forensic psychologist) in lieu of probation revocation coupled with the condition of successfully completing the same program from which Appellant was terminated?\u201d In general, a court does not need to announce that it has considered specific alternatives to its orders in determining the appropriate sanction for a probation violation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">The decision to revoke probation is generally predictive and subjective in nature, and the fairness guaranteed by due process does not require a reviewing court to second-guess the factfinder\u2019s discretionary decision as to the appropriate sanction. Accordingly, our precedents have sought to preserve the flexible, informal nature of the revocation hearing, which does not require the full panoply of procedural safeguards associated with a criminal trial. We believe that a general requirement that the factfinder elaborate upon the reasons for a course not taken would unduly burden the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>revocation proceeding without significantly advancing the interests of the probationer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><em>Black v. Romano, </em>471 U.S. 606, 613, 105 S.Ct. 2254, 2258-59, 85 L.Ed.2d 636 (1985) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Carroll\u2019s argument on brief is closely related to the <em>Alford </em>plea argument we rejected in Part I of this opinion. He relies heavily on <em>Gilfillen v. State, </em>582 N.E.2d 821 (Ind.1991), a decision of the Supreme Court of Indiana, for the proposition that the sex offender treatment condition imposed by the trial court in this case was unreasonable, arbitrary, and useless. The defendant in <em>Gilfillen </em>was convicted at trial of child molestation, despite his assertion that he was innocent. <em>Id. </em>at 822. The court reversed his conviction for violating probation because he refused to admit his guilt during sex offender therapy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-7\">Reasonable conditions on probation may be imposed on a defendant, but thought control is not one of them. Thus, in a circumstance such as this, where the defendant has not pled guilty but was instead convicted while denying guilt, trial courts may not insist on an admission of guilt as a condition of probation or use a continued denial of guilt as the basis for revocation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 824. There is, however, an important difference between Virginia and Indiana on the law applicable to guilty pleas. As a matter of Indiana state law, it is reversible error for a trial judge to accept an <em>Alford </em>plea. <em>See Ross v. State, </em>456 N.E.2d 420, 423 (Ind.1983). The Indiana Supreme Court\u2019s characterization of the requirement that a defendant must admit his guilt during sex offender therapy as \u201cthought control\u201d in <em>Gilfillen </em>seems to us to reflect the same distaste for the inconsistency between protestations of innocence and the legal effect of a guilty plea that had earlier persuaded the same court to reject the <em>Alford </em>plea in <em>Ross. See id. </em>at 422-23 (\u201c \u2018No plea of guilty should be accepted ... when it appears that, for any reason, the plea is wholly inconsistent with the realities of the situation.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Harshman v. State, </em>232 Ind. 618, 619, 115 N.E.2d 501, 502 (1953))).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>But the Virginia courts have never expressed this view, and we must follow our own precedents holding that the <em>Alford </em>plea, and any potential inconsistencies that may accompany the same, are an accepted part of Virginia law. <em>See e.g. Parson v. Carroll, </em>272 Va. 560, 565, 686 S.E.2d 452, 455 (2006) (citing cases); <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 357, 363, 499 S.E.2d 11, 14 (1998). The record does not show that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering sex offender treatment as a condition of Carroll\u2019s probation. Carroll\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">. Incidentally, our acceptance of the dissent's state separation of powers argument would require that we hold this statute unconstitutional. Though we may need to review the constitutionality of the statute in some future case, we should not do so in the context of a case in which the issue was never briefed by the parties, and neither the defense nor the Commonwealth has had a chance to argue its merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\">. Carroll attempts to distinguish <em>Birdsong </em>because in that case, the defendant had actual knowledge that he would be required to complete sex offender treatment at the time of his <em>Alford </em>plea. Carroll accurately distinguishes this case from the view of <em>Birdsong </em>adopted in Justice Scott\u2019s concurring opinion, which argued that the defendant's actual knowledge meant that there was no need for the court to address the more general question of the probation conditions allowed by an <em>Alford </em>plea. However, the majority's holding is broader: \"There is nothing inherent in an Alford plea that gives the defendant any rights, or promises any limitations with respect to the punishment imposed after the conviction,\u201d <em>Birdsong, </em>958 P.2d at 1130, and is inconsistent with Carroll's argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">. As the dissent correctly notes, the consequences of <em>Alford </em>pleas and pleas of <em>nolo contendere </em>are different from the consequences of ordinary guilty pleas in that unlike the person who makes an ordinary guilty plea, an <em>Alford </em>plea defendant is not estopped from denying that he committed the offense in a subsequent civil proceeding. <em>See Parson v. Carroll, </em>272 Va. 560, 566, 636 S.E.2d 452, 455 (2006). What is missing from the dissent\u2019s argument, however, is any authority holding that a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea, which the dissent concedes is legally the same as an <em>Alford </em>plea, imposes any special limitations on the probation conditions that a sentencing court may impose in its final disposition of the <em>same criminal case </em>in which the plea was originally entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b799-6\">ALSTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag6\">concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">I concur in the holding and judgment of the majority that the trial court did not err in failing to consider \u201ca reasonable alternative treatment modality (sex offender treatment with an expert forensic psychologist) in lieu of probation revocation coupled with the condition of successfully completing the same program from which [ajppellant was terminated.\u201d The \u201conly limitation placed upon the discretion of the trial court in its determination of what conditions are to be imposed is that a condition be \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nuckoles v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1083, 1086, 407 S.E.2d 355, 356 (1991). The record does not show that the imposition of group sex offender therapy as a condition of probation in this case was unreasonable. Thus, I agree that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">However, I respectfully disagree with the majority decision that the trial court did not err in finding appellant in violation of probation based solely on his refusal to <em>admit </em>to rape during sex offender treatment. The majority decision makes a strong and compelling policy statement regarding the expectations of probation in the traditional case. However, this matter is not the traditional case. I believe that the majority result eviscerates a plea made pursuant to <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), by stripping the plea of its most salient feature from appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>perspective, that is, the ability of a defendant to maintain his innocence while simultaneously agreeing to the <em>entry </em>of a guilty conviction without the benefit of a trial on the merits. While I appreciate the critical importance in assuring that probationers adhere to the demands and rigors of probation supervision, in my view, the majority\u2019s conclusion in this particular case is analytically flawed for two important reasons: (1) there is a fundamental inconsistency between appellant\u2019s claim of innocence implicit in his making a <em>plea agreement </em>to the underlying charge pursuant to <em>Alford </em>and a subsequently and unilaterally imposed probation condition requiring that appellant <em>admit </em>to the same charge during sex offender treatment; and (2) the <em>plea agreement </em>in the instant case, which by its very nature is a contract entered into by the Commonwealth and appellant and approved by the trial court, contained no probation condition that the appellant sacrifice his contractual prerogatives under his <em>Alford </em>plea and <em>admit </em>to the underlying charge in sex offender treatment. Therefore, after much careful deliberation and circumspection, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the judgment and would reverse the trial court\u2019s decision revoking appellant\u2019s probation on this specific ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Appellant was indicted in 2007 for a crime that occurred in 1983.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1984, the Commonwealth destroyed specimens and other evidence obtained through a physical examination of the victim of the crime. Against this backdrop of evidentiary deficiencies, appellant and the Commonwealth conducted plea negotiations and entered into a plea agreement. In the plea agreement, appellant stated, and the government explicitly agreed, that appellant \u201c[did] not admit that [he] committed the crime to which [he was] pleading guilty\u201d and that he \u201cstill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>claim[ed] innocence.\u201d Pursuant to the plea agreement, the trial court agreed to continue sentencing on the charge for five years. In exchange for the plea, appellant agreed to five years of supervised probation and to \u201cbe of general good behavior;\u201d have \u201cno contact with [the] victim and her family;\u201d and \u201c[pay] court costs.\u201d At the end of five years and upon appellant\u2019s performance of the conditions, the Commonwealth would request that the trial court vacate the conviction and accept a guilty plea to the lesser-included offense of assault and battery pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-57. The plea agreement further stated that \u201c[t]here [was] no agreement in connection with this case except for the agreement described [herein].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">At a September 6, 2007 hearing, the trial court conducted a colloquy with appellant. During the colloquy, appellant made an <em>Alford </em>plea. In accord with <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711-12, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), the trial court found that the plea was made \u201cfreely and voluntarily with an understanding of its nature and its consequences.\u201d <em>See James v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 746, 750, 446 S.E.2d 900, 902 (1994) <em>(\u201cBoykin </em>requires that before a trial court may accept a criminal defendant\u2019s guilty plea there must be an affirmative showing that the plea was intelligently and voluntarily made.\u201d). The trial court approved the plea agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">On September 20, 2007, the trial court entered an order noting that appellant \u201cprotested his innocence\u201d by making an <em>Alford </em>plea and restating the conditions of his probation. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>addition, the order stated that appellant must \u201ccomply with all the rules and requirements set by the Probation Officer,\u201d including \u201c[any] substance abuse counseling, testing, and/or treatment as prescribed by the Probation Officer.\u201d On October 5, 2007, appellant made a motion to amend the September 20, 2007 order requesting, in part, that \u201c[n]o sex offender treatment be prescribed or required by the Probation Officer.\u201d <em>On </em>October 9, 2007, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s request. Accordingly, appellant entered sex offender therapy but was terminated solely because he refused to admit to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">On June 13, 2008, the trial court conducted a probation revocation hearing. At the hearing, appellant claimed he did not violate the conditions of his probation by failing to admit to the crime. Specifically, he contended the trial court could not find that he violated his probation because the trial court accepted his <em>Alford </em>plea under the plea agreement. In doing so, according to the appellant, the trial court permitted him to maintain his innocence. Furthermore, appellant claimed that requiring him to admit to the crime would be \u201ca breach of the plea agreement, to the extent that specifically in the plea agreement ... [appellant] recite[d], [\u2018]I do not admit that I committed the crime to which I am pleading guilty.[\u2019]\u201d The trial court disagreed with appellant, and revoked his probation for his failure to admit to the crime and sentenced him on the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">As a preliminary matter, I disagree with the majority\u2019s characterization that an <em>Alford </em>plea is indistinguishable from a guilty plea in all respects. An <em>Alford </em>plea is akin to a plea <em>nolo contendere, </em>that is, a plea that is not \u201ca confession of guilt and has no effect beyond permitting the court to impose sentence in a particular case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Jackson, 255 </em>Va. 552, 555, 499 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1998) (citing <em>Roach v. Commonwealth, 157 </em>Va. 954, 959, 162 S.E. 50, 51 (1932)). Nonetheless, \u201cby entering a plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>the defendant \u2018implies a confession ... of the truth of the charge ... [and] agrees that the court may consider him guilty\u2019 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the purpose of imposing judgment and sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Honaker v. Howe, </em>60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 50, 53 (1869)). Practically applied, a plea <em>nolo contendere </em>and an <em>Alford </em>plea are the same. <em>See Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 37, 91 S.Ct. at 167 (\u201cNor can we perceive any material difference between a plea that refuses to admit commission of the criminal act and a plea containing a protestation of innocence.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Originating from early medieval practice, the plea <em>nolo contendere </em>was a means used by a defendant wishing to avoid imprisonment and seeking \u201cto make an end of the matter <em>(finem </em>facere) by offering to pay a sum of money to the king.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36 n. 8, 91 S.Ct. at 167 n. 8 (citing 2 F. Pollock &amp; F. Maitland, <em>History of English Law </em>517 (2d ed.1909)). In making this plea, the defendant did not admit his guilt when he sought such a compromise, but merely \u201c \u2018put himself on the grace of our Lord, the King, and asked that he might be allowed to pay a fine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Anon., </em>Y.B. Hil. 9 Hen. 6, f. 59, pi. 8 (1431)). Eighteenth century case law distinguished the <em>nolo contendere </em>plea from a jury verdict of guilt, noting that in the former, \u201cthe defendant could introduce evidence of innocence in mitigation of punishment, whereas in the latter such evidence was precluded by the finding of actual guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Queen v. Templeman, </em>1 Salk. 55, 91 Eng. Rep. 54 (K.B.1702)). \u201cThroughout its history, ... the plea <em>nolo contendere </em>has been viewed not as an express admission of guilt but as a consent by the defendant that he may be punished as if he were guilty....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Against this historical backdrop, the <em>Alford </em>plea developed as a mechanism whereby \u201c \u2018a defendant maintains innocence while entering a plea of guilty because the defendant concludes that his interests require entry of a guilty plea and the record before the court contains strong evidence of actual guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perry v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 410, 412, 533 S.E.2d 651, 652-53 (2000) (quoting <em>Cortese v. Black, </em>838 F.Supp. 485, 492 (D.Colo.1993) (citing <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 37, 91 S.Ct. at 167)). In making an <em>Alford </em>plea, \u201c \u2018[a]n individual accused of crime may voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly consent to the imposition of a prison sentence <em>even if he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number><em>is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime.\u2019 \u201d Parson v. Carroll, </em>272 Va. 560, 565, 636 S.E.2d 452, 454-55 (2006) (quoting <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 37, 91 S.Ct. at 167) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">Based on this holding in <em>Alford, </em>the courts in this Commonwealth in the exercise of their discretion have permitted criminal defendants who wish to avoid the consequences of a trial to plead guilty by conceding that the evidence is sufficient to convict them, while maintaining that they did not participate in the acts constituting the crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 565-66, 636 S.E.2d at 455 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Further defining the nature of the <em>Alford </em>plea, the Supreme Court of Virginia stated in <em>Parson </em>that in making such a plea, a defendant \u201cassume[s] a position of law, not a position of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 636 S.E.2d at 455. In that case, the Court held that Parson\u2019s concession of law in making an <em>Alford </em>plea \u201cdid not provide a basis for applying judicial estoppel\u201d in a subsequent defamation action by Parson against the victim. <em>Id. </em>Admittedly, <em>Parson </em>presents a different factual context than the facts herein. The Court\u2019s conclusion, however, is applicable in this case. <em>Parson </em>makes clear that when a defendant tenders an <em>Alford </em>plea, he \u201cconcede[s] only that the evidence was sufficient to convict him of the offenses\u201d and \u201cd[oes] not admit as a factual matter that he had participated in the acts constituting the crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Manifest to the <em>Alford </em>plea, therefore, is the defendant\u2019s protestation that he did not commit the acts for which he is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">By stark contrast, a guilty plea is founded upon the defendant\u2019s express admission to having committed the crime. It is clear, therefore, that the only conceivable similarity between the guilty plea and the <em>Alford </em>plea is in the nature of their result. Stated another way, an <em>Alford </em>defendant agrees to be treated as if he had made a guilty plea only for purposes of sentencing. Notwithstanding this similarity, the <em>Alford </em>defendant retains, unlike defendants who enter a traditional guilty plea, the enforceable prerogative to maintain his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Turning to the circumstances of this case, it is clear that appellant tendered his <em>Alford </em>plea because he believed he was innocent. It is not insignificant that the underlying allegations against the appellant were over two decades old and that there were serious evidentiary considerations for both the appellant and the government. Part and parcel of appellant\u2019s plea agreement was his protestation that he was innocent and by written accord, an agreement by the government that appellant would not have to admit that he committed the offense. During the plea colloquy, appellant informed the trial court that he was not \u201cguilty of the crime.\u201d To subsequently force appellant to <em>admit, </em>upon government enforced sanction, to the same crime to which he entered the <em>Alford </em>plea in his sex offender therapy when he vehemently denied committing the crime and contractually was permitted to forego an admission of his guilt in his deal with the government is irreconcilable with his <em>Alford </em>plea and renders meaningless the distinction between an <em>Alford </em>plea and a guilty plea.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the majority\u2019s conclusion requires appellant to pursue one of several untenable courses: to take a position in sex offender treatment legally inconsistent with his plea; to tell a lie in either the sex offender treatment or during the <em>Boykin </em>colloquy <footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; or to forfeit his right to enter a plea consistent with the requirements of <em>Alford. </em>To be sure, when appellant entered his <em>Alford </em>plea, he \u201cassumed a position of law, not a position of fact,\u201d and he \u201cdid not admit as a factual matter that he had participated in the acts constituting the crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>would hold that appellant could not be required to admit to the crime in sex offender therapy when he tendered an <em>Alford </em>plea.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">My disagreement with the majority\u2019s holding on this matter is underscored for a second reason particular to this case: the plea agreement in the instant case, which by its very nature is a contract entered into by the Commonwealth and appellant, and approved by the trial court, contained no probation condition that appellant sacrifice his contractual prerogatives under his <em>Alford </em>plea and admit to the underlying charge in sex offender treatment. \u201cThe Court of Appeals and other courts that have considered such agreements have uniformly held that ... a plea agreement[ ] implicate^] a defendant\u2019s due process rights and [is] generally governed by' the law of contracts.\u201d <em>Hood v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 176, 181, 608 S.E.2d 913, 915-16 (2005). A contract is an agreement between two or more parties requiring acceptance of an offer, as well as valuable consideration. <em>See Montagna v. Holiday Inns, Inc., </em>221 Va. 336, 346, 269 S.E.2d 838, 844 (1980). Consideration is the price bargained for and paid for the agreement or promise. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, it is clear that appellant entered into a valid and enforceable contract with the Commonwealth, whereby he maintained he did \u201cnot admit that [he] committed the crime\u201d and that he \u201cstill claim[ed] innocence.\u201d As a result of the plea, the Commonwealth received the benefit of the bargain by obtaining an <em>Alford </em>plea from appellant and the entry of an order of conviction, by satisfying a significantly lower burden of proof requiring only a \u201cstrong factual basis\u201d for the plea, <em>see Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 38, 91 S.Ct. at 168, and by disposing of the case in an efficient means. Appellant, in turn, received the benefit of maintaining his innocence, having his sentencing continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>while he was on probation, and upon satisfying the probation conditions, having his conviction vacated and amended to a guilty plea to the lesser-included offense of assault and battery. The conditions of probation included that he was to \u201cbe of general good behavior,\u201d have \u201cno contact with victim and her family,\u201d and pay court costs. The plea agreement further stated, \u201cThere is no agreement in connection with this case except for the agreement described in this document.\u201d Thus, following the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the plea agreement, appellant and the Commonwealth were bound by the terms of a valid and enforceable contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Here, the government, through the probation officer, added a new condition of probation requiring appellant to admit to the underlying offense during sex offender therapy. To the contrary, the plea agreement specifically stated that the appellant was <em>not </em>admitting that he committed the offense. The position of the government, endorsed by the majority, effectuates a change in the fundamental purpose in the agreement reached between the parties in this matter. To accomplish such an objective, there must have been a clear and definite intention on the part of all concerned to the agreement that such is the purpose of the new agreement. At no point did appellant agree to this additional probation condition and at no point did the parties execute a valid novation to the plea agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is no evidence in the record to support this concept of mutual assent to a change in the agreement the parties reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The majority takes great pains to point to the various and arguably significant indicators of appellant\u2019s culpability in the matter, yet criticizes the dissent for pointing out the signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>cant factors in this case which may suggest the incongruence of legal culpability. However, for our purposes, the majority\u2019s references are not relevant to the issue before the Court. The appellant met his part of the bargain by not exercising his constitutional right to challenge the Commonwealth\u2019s case <em>and </em>by acceding to the entry of a guilty conviction. The appellant\u2019s \u201cbargain for in exchange\u201d was the prerogative to maintain his innocence even in light of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Appellant\u2019s ability to maintain his innocence was the <em>sine qua non </em>or essence of his agreement with the Commonwealth. By recommending that the trial court revoke his probation for a condition not only <em>not included </em>in the plea agreement, but instead, specifically disclaimed by both parties to the agreement, the Commonwealth gained the benefit of a prerogative it had specifically renounced in the agreement. Thus, I would hold that the trial court erred in revoking appellant\u2019s probation because the plea agreement did not require that appellant admit to the charge during sex offender therapy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>I also disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that Rule 5A: 12(c) precludes consideration of whether the trial court erred in revoking his probation because the plea agreement did not require that he admit to the charge. Rule 5A:12(c)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is a non-jurisdictional rule, and as such, the rule\u2019s invocation \u201cto prevent consideration of [an appeal\u2019s] merits, should not be undertaken without considering whether a party\u2019s failure to adhere strictly to the rule\u2019s requirements is insignificant, or so substantial as to preclude the court\u2019s addressing the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 747, 753, 668 S.E.2d 150,153-54 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">In this case, appellant\u2019s question presented does not explicitly state that the terms of the plea agreement permitting appellant to maintain his innocence was a ground upon which his probation could not be revoked for failure to admit to the crime. Nevertheless, in explicitly making his claim based on his <em>Alford </em>plea, appellant also implicitly included a claim embodied in the plea agreement terms. Indeed, \u201cwhen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). Ignoring the existence of the plea agreement in this case is to disregard an indispensable and prominent aspect of the factual and legal background of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">It is clear that in appellant\u2019s case, he made an <em>Alford </em>plea in conjunction with the terms of the plea agreement in which he maintained his innocence. The plea agreement terms certainly induced him to make his <em>Alford </em>plea, and it cannot be contended that he would have made the <em>Alford </em>plea without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>entering into the express terms of the plea agreement. Thus, I would conclude that appellant\u2019s failure to explicitly include his claim pertaining to the plea agreement in the question presented was not significant. <em>See Moore, </em>276 Va. at 753, 668 S.E.2d at 153-54. Accordingly, I would conclude that the issue is not defaulted pursuant to Rule 5A:12(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">For these reasons, I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding and judgment that the trial court did not err in finding appellant in violation of probation based solely on his refusal to admit to rape during sex offender treatment. Therefore, I dissent from that portion of the judgment and I would reverse the trial court\u2019s decision revoking appellant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\">. The initial charge for the 1983 crime was dismissed by a <em>nolle prosequi. </em>Later, while investigating a different allegation of rape that involved appellant's sister, the assigned detective re-opened the 1983 case. Consequently, appellant was indicted for a second time pertaining to the 1983 crime in 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\">. Significantly, the Commonwealth did not agree to a \"plea and recommendation\u201d pursuant to Rule 3A:8, a rule substantially equivalent to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. In circumstances involving a \"plea and recommendation,\u201d the Commonwealth agrees to make a recommendation, or not to oppose the defendant's request for a particular sentence, with the understanding that the recommendation or request is not binding on the trial court. <em>See </em>Rule 3A:8(c)(l)(B), 3A:8(c)(2): <em>see also United States v. Iaquinta, </em>719 F.2d 83, 85 (4th Cir.1983) (explaining that in the context of a Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(B) plea agreement, the U.S. Attorney simply agrees to make sentencing recommendations with the understanding that such recommendations are not binding on the district court). By contrast, the trial court in this case approved and accepted a plea agreement, a disposition binding the trial court to the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b805-4\">.

Furthermore, I have grave concerns about the circumstances surrounding the plea agreement in this case. The probation officer added a condition to appellant's probation that was in opposition to the plea agreement terms approved by the trial court. Essentially, the probation officer, who was an agent of the executive branch, acted in a judicial capacity by requiring that appellant admit to the crime, a probation condition inconsistent with the terms of the plea agreement. The result suggested by this dissent avoids what could be considered the more significant question as to whether the probation officer violated principles of separation of powers contained in the Constitution of Virginia. <em>See </em>Va.
