(appellant), doing business as Whisper Ridge Behavioral Health System\u2014Charlottesville, appeals from a decision rendered under the Virginia Administrative Process Act that it was overpaid for services provided to Medicaid patients under a contract with Virginia\u2019s Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS). Appellant contends DMAS did not contest that the services at issue were provided and complained only about the method appellant used to document the services. Under these circumstances, contends appellant, the only issue is one of contract law, and the evidence compels a holding that, despite these minor deficiencies in documentation of some of the services, it fulfilled its contractual duties to DMAS to an extent entitling it to full payment under the terms of the contract. DMAS contends both that contract law principles are inapplicable in this regulatory matter and, in any event, that the shortcomings in appellant\u2019s documentation were more than mere technical deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we hold contract principles applied to the interpretation of the provider agreement and that, under settled principles of contract law, appellant would be entitled to payment if its noncompliance did not amount to a material breach of the agreement. Nevertheless, the agency\u2019s factual findings, which appellant does not challenge on appeal, compel the conclusion that appellant\u2019s ongoing deficiencies in documenting the execution of a specific component of the integrated treatment plan for each of twenty randomly selected patients constituted a material breach of the provider agreement. On this basis, we conclude the circuit court did not err in upholding DMAS\u2019s retraction of the general inpatient treatment fees for twenty patients for a period of approximately 29 weeks each.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">DMAS, under the guidance of the Director of Medical Assistance Services, is the state agency responsible for administering Medicaid, a state medical assistance program funded by both the state and federal governments. The director of DMAS is required by statute to \u201c[ajdminister [the] state plan and receive and expend federal funds therefor in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1-325(D)(1); <em>see </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.0, 430.10. The director is also \u201cauthorized to ... [e]nter into agreements and contracts with medical care facilities ... and [various] health care providers where necessary to carry out the provisions of [the] state plan.\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1-325(D)(2). As a condition of the receipt of federal funds, applicable federal regulations require execution of such agreements, which must include the condition that the provider will \u201c[k]eep any records necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>to disclose <em>the extent of services </em>the provider furnished to recipients.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.107(b)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In 2003, appellant acquired the Whisper Ridge facility in Charlottesville, a 60-bed inpatient psychiatric facility for adolescents 13 to 17 years old, and executed a provider participation agreement in which it agreed to care for patients under DMAS\u2019s Virginia Medical Assistance Program. The provider agreement contained the following additional terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">3. The applicant agrees to keep such records as DMAS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">determines necessary____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">4. The provider agrees to care for patients at [a specified rate].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">5.... Should an audit by authorized state or federal officials result in disallowance of amounts previously paid to the provider by DMAS, the provider will reimburse DMAS upon demand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">7. The applicant agrees to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, as well as administrative policies and procedures of DMAS as from time to time amended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">*****$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">9. All disputes regarding provider reimbursement ... shall be resolved through administrative proceedings conducted at the office of DMAS.... These administrative proceedings and judicial review of such administrative proceedings shall be pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">In 2006, DMAS audited appellant\u2019s records for services billed to Medicaid for twenty randomly selected patients covering various periods between August 1, 2004, and February 27, 2006. DMAS audited an average total of about 29 weeks of records for each of those twenty patients. In the course of the 2006 audit, DMAS identified multiple problems it denoted as \u201c[b]illing errors,\u201d including \u201cfailure] to properly document with respect to certain of the residents at issue that a mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>mum of 21 distinct treatment intervention sessions [as required by DMAS\u2019s <em>Psychiatric Services Manual, </em>hereinafter the manual, the 2004 manual, or the 2005 manual,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] (excluding individual and family therapy) were provided each week.\u201d DMAS auditors noted as follows in their written report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">None of the records reviewed contained documentation of the required weekly interventions. [Appellant\u2019s] Therapeutic Group Activities [Weekly Grid] Form is not sufficient. Documentation of the treatment intervention ... must be child-specific, [and] describe how the activities of the session relate to the recipient-specific treatment goals, ... and the child\u2019s level of participation which will indicate the child\u2019s response to the intervention____Very few treatment interventions were child-specific and/or related to issues identified in the child\u2019s treatment plan as required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">DMAS disallowed payment for each seven-day period in which the 21 distinct treatment intervention sessions were not properly documented to have occurred. It concluded that error alone resulted in an overpayment to appellant of $761,135.60 in Medicaid funds, as documented by a detailed spreadsheet of errors noted in the records of specified patients.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Appellant disagreed with DMAS\u2019s determination and requested an informal fact finding conference, following which the informal appeals agent upheld DMAS\u2019s retraction of payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Appellant filed an agency appeal, and the hearing officer heard testimony and argument in February 2007. Appellant argued its therapeutic group activities grid form provided sufficient documentation of the 21-interventions requirement but that, even if it did not, the form entries \u201csubstantially complied]\u201d with the manual\u2019s requirements and entitled it to full payment. Appellant offered testimony from Whisper Ridge employee Victoria Waterfield, a licensed clinical social worker who worked first as a therapist and then as clinical coordinator at Whisper Ridge. DMAS offered the testimony of Shelley T. Jones, one of two DMAS employees who performed the audit at Whisper Ridge. Jones\u2019s primary job responsibilities included \u201coverseeing] residential treatment,\u201d \u201cmanaging] ... the Psychiatric Services Manual\u201d and \u201cdoing updates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Jones testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that, although the 21 interventions had no \u201cprofessional requirement\u201d and could be provided by high-school-educated mental health technicians, the manual required these interventions to be client-specific, such that \u201cif you have a child who doesn\u2019t have a substance abuse problem, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a substance abuse treatment group for that child. If you have a child who has anger management problems, we <em>would </em>expect to see an anger management group for that child.\u201d (Emphasis added). Jones also explained that documentation for the 21-interventions-per-week requirement was not \u201cjust a paper thing\u201d and was necessary to provide information for other staff to review following a shift change and for \u201cthe physician [overseeing the adolescent\u2019s treatment], who is not on site every day or not on site twenty-four hours a day, to be able to review the documentation and to be able to make judgments about medication, to make judgments about treatment plan changes.\u201d Jones testified that other than group psychotherapy notes from about three sessions per week per child, and some substance abuse treatment records at the rate of one or two per child per month, the only documentation she and her co-auditor found for the 21-interventions-per-week requirement was the weekly grid-formatted \u201ctherapeutic group activity reports,\u201d forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Jones said \u201cwere filled out by the children.\u201d These forms were deficient, she testified, because they were not developed for the particular child, did not \u201cdescribe how the activities of the session [held] relate[d] to the Recipient-specific goals\u201d or set out \u201ca plan for the next session,\u201d and did not provide \u201ca staff person who did not participate in th[e] session ... any idea what occurred in this session.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">After the parties submitted briefs on the issue, the hearing officer issued a written decision in which she concluded appellant failed to carry its burden of proof on \u201cthe 21-per-week planned therapeutic interventions issue.\u201d She noted that although \u201creimbursement for all audited weeks of residential services for the sample of twenty patients ... was retracted,\u201d \u201creimbursement for individually billed professional sessions, such as individual psychotherapy, family psychotherapy, and group psychotherapy\u201d for those twenty patients was not retracted. The hearing officer found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">8. [Appellant\u2019s witness] Waterfield ... discussed the facility\u2019s form grid for documentation of \u201cGroup Therapeutic Activities\u201d sessions as treatment interventions. She further testified that documenting a treatment intervention in the same manner as documenting an individual therapy session would necessitate spending more time on paperwork and less on supervising and helping the patients. \u201cIt would be an onerous task.\u201d <em>On questioning ivhether the form grid actually documents how the required specific child-related goal of the planned treatment intervention was met, Water-field responded, \u201cNo. </em>\u201d <em>Although she elaborated on certain terms used in the form grid, </em>such as what \u201cactive\u201d and what durations of \u201c0 to 30 minutes\u201d are intended to convey, <em>she did not focus on the requirement that the 21 interventions must be planned in the treatment plan and must be treatments toward a specific goal related to the child, not random instructions to patients to do certain things.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">13. At all times pertinent to this case, the provider has been required in <em>Psychiatric Services Manual </em>Chapter IV, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>page 15, to develop an active treatment plan that must relate to the admission diagnosis and reflect all of four treatment requirements. Requirement B.l.b. of the treatment plan is for a minimum of 21 distinct <em>sessions </em>of appropriate treatment interventions each week, where the 21 \u201cappropriate treatment interventions\u201d may be group therapy with specific topics focused to the patient\u2019s needs, insight-oriented and/or behavior modifying and may include play, art, or music therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy although those means of treatment must not be the major treatment modality. Section B.2 sets forth requirements of documentation, obviously for the four requirements for the treatment plan described in B.l (i.e., B.l.a.d.). <em>Those documentation requirements include </em>progress notes reflecting positive or negative reaction to treatment on a daily basis; continued needs; <em>concurrent documentation of therapies as they are provided, where the progress notes for each session must describe how the activities of the session relate to recipient-specific goals, </em>the frequency and duration of the <em>session, </em>the level of participation in treatment, the type of <em>session, and the plan for the next session, </em>with dated signatures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">14. Counsel for Whisper Ridge contended that the requirements for documentation set out in B.2 applied only to professional individual therapy, family therapy, and group therapy settings. Such an argument ignores the consistent use of the word \u201csession\u201d to describe the 21 distinct[] \u201csessions\u201d of appropriate treatment interventions each week and to describe what is to be documented\u2014\u201ceach session.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">15. <em>By demonstration, example, and testimony, Jones showed that the lack of individualized detail in the form grids failed to comply with the documentation requirements to reflect patient reaction to treatment on a daily basis, the relationship of the treatment to the recipient-specific goals, </em>the duration of the session, the type of the session, a concurrent signature, and the date of the session (sometimes omitted on the form grids), and <em>provided no understanding of the benefits of the treatment, the patient\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>progress with the treatment, or planning for future treatment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">16.... <em>Jones testified at length, was knowledgeable, consistent at all times, and very credible.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">(Emphases added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Based on these findings, the hearing officer concluded in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">The agreement signed by every provider with DMAS specifies that the provider agrees to comply with \u201call applicable state and federal laws, as well as administrative policies and procedures from DMAS as from time to time amended.\u201d ... The Commonwealth has passed enabling legislation under which DMAS has carried out its federal mandate through its state plan, regulations, and federally required policy manuals. Va.Code \u00a7 32.1-325. In executing the participation agreement with DMAS, Whisper Ridge has agreed to comply with these laws, plans, regulations, and policies, where the policy pertaining to Whisper Ridge is the <em>Psychiatric Services Manual.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">Moreover, the <em>Psychiatric Services Manual </em>establishing the terms of the agreement was extant well before Whisper Ridge chose to accept it, as Whisper Ridge did voluntarily in order to receive public remuneration....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">In executing the Provider Agreement, Whisper Ridge has been put on notice of the provision in Va.Code \u00a7 32.1-325.1(B) that any proceedings, administrative or judicial, are controlled by the Administrative Process Act. In this instance, DMAS has made a case decision finding that Whisper Ridge is \u201cnot in compliance with any existing requirement for obtaining .\u25a0.. a ... right or benefit.\u201d Va.Code \u00a7 2.2-4001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">... Whisper Ridge\u2019s suggestion of a \u201cwindfall\u201d by DMAS is contradicted by the fact that only twenty of a total possible census of sixty patients were reviewed for a total period of time that encompasses, on average, fewer than 29 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>weeks per patient over a two year period. Whereas standard auditing principles would include extrapolation of the population and time specimens to the entire population and total time period, that was not done; thus, any equitable argument of a DMAS \u201cwindfall\u201d fails on an audit basis----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">Pursuant to Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 32.1-325.1(B) and 2.2-4020, the burden of proof in formal administrative appeals is on the provider. <em>Whisper Ridge has not carried its burden. By acknowledging that the only documentation of 21 treatment interventions per week per audited child is its inadequate, sketchy form grids, Whisper Ridge has been unable to demonstrate a single example of compliance with the requirements of the Psychiatric Services Manual, Chapter IV, p. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 B.l.b andB.2.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">ifc # <em>% </em>\u00cd-\u00cd ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">DMAS is required to analyze, audit, and determine whether the costs claimed by providers constitute true, reimbursable costs under the Medicaid program. <em>DMAS has </em>properly discharged its obligation by a rigorous review of and organization of volumes of records, and <em>identified the absence of reasonable and appropriate progress notes documenting the 21-per-iveek planned treatment interventions as required by the Psychiatric Services Manual, Chapter TV, p. 15. </em>Services not documented cannot be reimbursed, and full retraction is due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">(Emphases added; citations omitted). After the parties submitted their exceptions, the director of DMAS adopted the hearing officer\u2019s recommended decision with minor corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Appellant requested circuit court review of the final agency decision, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the documentation provision did not apply to the 21-interventions requirement but that, even if it did, appellant\u2019s completion of its gridded log sheets constituted \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with that requirement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>thereby entitling appellant to payment. DMAS responded that the lack of an \u201cexplanation of how [each] session was focused on the child\u2019s specific mental health issues\u201d was fatal to appellant\u2019s claim. It also noted that in signing the provider agreement, appellant \u201csigned away its ability to bring actions under contract law by agreeing that actions would be brought under the APA, and that state Medicaid law and policy would govern in exchange for payment from DMAS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The circuit court held the record contained evidentiary support for DMAS\u2019s conclusion that the documentation for the 21-interventions requirement was deficient and that appellant\u2019s presentation of contrary evidence indicating that the documentation was not deficient did not permit the circuit court to make a different finding. The circuit court also held that whether appellant had substantially complied with the documentation requirement was not controlling because appellant, by signing the provider agreement, agreed to comply with state policies and procedures. Finally, the circuit court concluded that \u201c[e]ven on the question of substantial performance,\u201d the record contained \u201cevidentiary support for the agency\u2019s determinations of documentation deficiency which the court is not authorized to disturb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">On appeal of an agency decision, \u201c[t]he sole determination as to factual issues is whether substantial evidence exists in the agency record to support the agency\u2019s decision. The reviewing court may reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind necessarily would come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988). In making this determination, \u201cthe reviewing court shall take due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">On appeal of an agency\u2019s determination on issues of law, the standards differ. \u201c \u2018If the issue falls outside the area generally entrusted to the agency, and is one in which the courts have special competence, i.e., the common law or constitutional law,\u2019\u201d the court need not defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 243-44, 369 S.E.2d at 8 (quoting <em>Hi-Craft Clothing Co. v.

In this related context, we have also held we \u201cwill overturn DMAS\u2019s \u2018interpretation of the statutes and regulations governing Medicaid ... principles of reimbursement ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>only ... when found to be arbitrary and capricious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fralin, </em>18 Va.App. at 701, 447 S.E.2d at 241).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">On appeal, appellant argues it does not challenge DMAS\u2019s factual finding that its documentation of the 21 therapeutic interventions required per week for each patient failed to satisfy the manual\u2019s requirements. Appellant contends it argues only that the circuit court committed an error of law in upholding the agency\u2019s determination that, \u201cunder Virginia contract law, this technical deficiency ... permits DMAS to retract the entirety of payments to Whisper Ridge for each of the twenty Residents ..., despite the fact that DMAS does not dispute that all Program Services were provided to the Residents\u2014including the Interventions.\u201d We hold that, despite appellant\u2019s disclaimer, this assignment of error presents both legal and factual issues, which we examine in turn after setting out the regulatory and contractual framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The provider agreement appellant executed entitled it to payment of public funds entrusted to DMAS as compensation for providing \u201ca 24-hour-per-day specialized form of highly organized, intensive, and planned therapeutic interventions ... to treat severe mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders.\u201d <em>See </em>12 VAC 30-130-860(B).

IV, at 15 (emphasis added). The provider manual also required that appellant \u201c[m]aintain and retain the business and professional records sufficient to document fully and accurately the nature, scope, and details of the health care provided\u201d by Medicaid, <em>2004 Manual </em>ch. II, at 6, just as required by federal regulations, <em>see </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.107(b)(1) (requiring in the provider agreement the condition that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>provider will \u201c[k]eep any records necessary to disclose the extent of services the provider furnished to recipients\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Thus, although the statutes and regulations require an \u201cintegrated program\u201d of \u201chighly organized, intensive and planned therapeutic interventions,\u201d and the keeping of detailed records regarding same, only by signing the provider agreement, a contract, did appellant become obligated to provide patients with the 21 planned, therapeutic interventions per week and to document those interventions in the specific manner set out in the manual. Accordingly, in determining whether any deficiencies in the provision of these 21 interventions per week or the documentation thereof support a retraction of payment, ordinary contract law principles apply. Nevertheless, we hold as a matter of law, based on DMAS\u2019s factual findings made pursuant to the Administrative Process Act, that contract law does not support appellant\u2019s retention of the Medicaid payments at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The Virginia Supreme Court has recognized the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">Generally, a party who ... breaches] ... a contract is not'entitled to enforce the contract.

However, DMAS, in addition to \u201cshowing] that the lack of individualized detail in the form grids failed to comply with the documentation requirements,\u201d also articulated how that failure significantly impacted appellant\u2019s ability to provide to its \u201cexceedingly mentally ill\u201d residents the around-the-clock, \u201cspecialized form of highly organized, intensive and planned therapeutic interventions,\u201d <em>2004 Manual </em>ch. IV, at 13; <em>2005 Manual </em>ch. IV, at 13, for which DMAS had paid appellant. This \u201clack of individualized detail in the form grids\u201d constituted a failure, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cto reflect patient reaction to treatment on a daily basis and the relationship of the treatment to the recipient-specific goals,\u201d information required to be set out in each patient\u2019s treatment plan and reviewed and revised every thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">DMAS employee Shelley Jones, whose testimony the hearing officer found \u201cknowledgeable, consistent ... and very credible,\u201d testified the documentation requirement was not \u201cjust a paper thing\u201d and that its primary purpose was to have information available for other staff to review following a shift change and for \u201cthe physician, who is not on site every day or not on site twenty-four hours a day, to be able to review the documentation and to be able to make judgments about medication, to make judgments about treatment plan changes.\u201d Jones explained that in the absence of such information on the grid sheets, the records of the 21 interventions per week per patient, a significant component of each individual\u2019s inpatient treatment, <em>\u201cprovided no understanding of benefits of the treatment, the patient\u2019s progress with the treatment, or planning for future treatment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Absent such information, appellant\u2019s treatment team was deprived of information important to the stated goals of \u201cimproving] the recipient\u2019s condition or preventing] further regression <em>so that the [inpatient] services will no longer be needed,\u201d </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 441.152 (emphasis added), and \u201cachieving] the recipient\u2019s discharge from inpatient status <em>at the earliest possible time,\u201d </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 441.154 (emphasis added); <em>see 2004 Manual </em>ch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>IV, at 15; <em>2005 Manual </em>ch. IV, at 14. Thus, appellant failed as a matter of law to establish an entitlement to payment for the 21 interventions per week provided as a part of the general inpatient treatment fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">DMAS\u2019s factual finding that appellant\u2019s lack of \u201creasonable and appropriate progress notes documenting the 21-per week planned treatment interventions\u201d interfered with the ability to achieve the stated goal of stabilization or improvement allowing a discharge from inpatient treatment is supported by substantial evidence in the record. This finding compels the holding that these documentary deficiencies constituted a material breach of the provider agreement. Thus, we hold DMAS\u2019s decision to retract payment of the inpatient treatment fee for twenty individuals for a period of approximately 29 weeks each\u2014but not for the separately-billed professional sessions for individual, family, and group psychotherapy for these patients\u2014was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">For these reasons, we conclude the circuit court did not err in upholding DMAS\u2019s conclusion that appellant was overpaid for Medicaid services. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">. These fees included, in one lump sum per patient, costs such as food, lodging, and certain therapeutic group treatment interventions administered by medical technicians. They did not include the fees DMAS paid for separately-billed, individual and group psychotherapy provided by licensed therapists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. The version of the <em>Psychiatric Seivices Manual </em>that was in effect when appellant signed the provider agreement in March 2003 was updated on January 16, 2004, before the audit at issue [hereinafter the 2004 manual]. The manual was revised and renamed the <em>Psychiatric Services Provider Manual </em>effective March 4, 2005 [hereinafter the 2005 manual]. Thus the 2004 manual and the 2005 manual were each applicable to a portion of the audit period. By signing the provider agreement, appellant agreed to comply with all \u201cadministrative policies and procedures of DMAS <em>as from time to time amended.\" </em>Provider Agreement, 11 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\">. DMAS noted other things it also termed billing errors, but the only issue in this appeal is retraction of payment based on the 21-interven-tions-per-week issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b235-9\">. <em>See supra </em>footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">. Appellant also relies upon the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Akers v. James T. Barnes of Washington, D.C., Inc., </em>227 Va. 367, 371, 315 S.E.2d 199, 201 (1984), for the principle that \"substantial compliance\" with the terms of the contract was sufficient to entitle it to payment. In <em>Akers, </em>however, which involved a brokerage agreement, the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>itself expressly provided that a commission would be paid the broker \u201c[i]f a commitment [to finance a condominium development] is obtained <em>substantially in accordance with the terms contained in paragraph 2 of this agreement.\" Id. </em>at 369, 315 S.E.2d at 200. In appellant\u2019s case, by contrast, the provider agreement appellant executed contained no such provision. To the extent substantial compliance or substantial performance principles nevertheless apply under Virginia law to contracts like DMAS\u2019s provider agreement, <em>see, e.g., Davis v. Holsten, </em>270 Va. 389, 394-97, 621 S.E.2d 101, 104-05 (2005) (holding that although substantial performance principles may apply to construction and sales contracts in Virginia, they \"will not be applied to an escrow agreement\u201d \"unless the agreement provides otherwise\u201d), such principles are merely the inverse of the material breach principles set out in the text, <em>see Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 237, cmt. d (1981) (\"The considerations in determining whether perfoimance is substantial are those listed in \u00a7 241 for determining whether a failure is material.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 241 (listing \u201csignificant\u201d factors to consider \u201d[i]n determining whether a failure to render or offer performance is material,\u201d including \"(b) the extent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated for that benefit of which he will be deprived\u201d). Thus, a conclusion that appellant materially breached the agreement necessarily precludes a holding that appellant substantially performed under it. We need not decide here whether any breach or only a material breach of the provider agreement permitted DMAS to demand repayment because, as set out <em>infra </em>in the text, the evidence, viewed in light of the agency\u2019s factual findings, compels the conclusion that the breach was material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\">. The circuit court examined whether appellant exhibited \"substantial performance\u201d under the contract and did not use the language, \"material breach.\u201d Applying the \"substantial performance\u201d language, the court concluded, \"Even on the question of substantial performance,\u201d the record contained \"evidentiary support for the agency\u2019s determinations of documentation deficiency which the court is not authorized to disturb.\u201d This constituted a ruling that the finding of documentary deficiency, which was supported by substantial evidence in the record, prevented the circuit court from concluding appellant substantially performed under the terms of the contract. In other words, the circuit court held the documentary deficiency was a material breach. <em>See supra </em>footnote 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
