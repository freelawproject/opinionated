Harper (\u201cHarper\u201d) entered guilty pleas to aggravated sexual battery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A) and taking indecent liberties with a minor child in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370(A)(1). He appeals the prison sentences ordered by the trial court. The only question presented is whether the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution applies to post-trial sentencing proceedings. Harper argues that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), has effectively overruled our earlier decision in <em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 293, 300, 498 S.E.2d 451, 455 (1998), holding that the Confrontation Clause does not apply to sentencing proceedings. Our review of the relevant decisions persuades us that, though <em>Crawford </em>substantially changed the way courts must analyze claims under the Confrontation Clause, neither <em>Crawford </em>nor its progeny have expanded the applicable scope of the right of confrontation to sentencing hearings. Thus, we conclude that <em>Moses </em>controls this case and that it also compels us to affirm Harper\u2019s sentences.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">On May 10, 2007, Harper entered guilty pleas to the indictments. When asked for the factual basis for Harper\u2019s pleas of guilty, the Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney made a proffer of what she believed the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence would have shown if the case had gone to trial. The proffer was that, on September 13, 2006, Harper\u2019s sister asked Harper to watch her eleven-year-old son, S.D. When she returned and opened the door to Harper\u2019s bedroom, she saw S.D. with Harper. She also saw Harper pulling up his pants. Harper and his sister began to argue, and Harper left the house through his bedroom window. S.D. later told the investigating police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>officers that Harper had grabbed him, pulled him into his bedroom, positioned him facedown on the bed, pulled his pants down, and attempted to have anal sex with him. When the police arrived, they questioned Harper about the incident. After receiving warnings pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602,16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), Harper told the police that S.D. wanted to know what sex was like and that Harper was about to show him when they were interrupted by his sister walking into his bedroom. At his guilty plea hearing, the trial judge asked Harper\u2019s defense counsel whether Harper had any objection to the Commonwealth\u2019s proffer. Though Harper disputed the Commonwealth\u2019s account as to a collateral matter,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he accepted as true all of the portions of the Commonwealth\u2019s proffer mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">On September 26, 2007, Harper appeared at his sentencing hearing. Both Harper and the Commonwealth presented evidence and argument. The Commonwealth\u2019s sentencing evidence included testimony from Harper\u2019s sister. She described the difficulties that Harper\u2019s offense had created in their family. She also stated that S.D. did not like Harper, S.D. did not want to be around Harper, and that \u201c[S.D.] don\u2019t even want him living.\u201d Harper objected to these statements, arguing that his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him meant that S.D.\u2019s out-of-court testimonial statement could not be introduced against him because Harper had had no prior opportunity for cross-examination of S.D. The trial court overruled Harper\u2019s objection and sentenced him to a term of ten years imprisonment, with six years suspended, on the charge of aggravated sexual battery and ten years imprisonment, all suspended, on the charge of taking indecent liberties with a minor child. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>Harper\u2019s claim that his right to confrontation was violated. <em>Dickens v. Commonwealth, 52 </em>Va.App. 412, 417, 663 S.E.2d 548, 550 (2008). There is no dispute that the alleged constitutional violation of which Harper complains took place during a sentencing hearing. There is, likewise, no dispute that our decision in <em>Moses, </em>27 Va.App. 293, 498 S.E.2d 451, concluded that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment does not apply to sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">Defendant next contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s refusal to identify all its sources violated her right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. The United States Supreme Court has stated \u201cthe right to confrontation is a <em>trial </em>right, designed to prevent improper restrictions on the types of questions that defense counsel may ask during cross-examination.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 52, 107 S.Ct. 989, 999, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987) (citing <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1934-35, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970)). In <em>Ritchie, </em>the defendant was denied access during pretrial discovery to investigative files which contained statements by the victim and information about witnesses. The Court concluded the Sixth Amendment was not offended because a defendant has no right to confront witnesses outside of trial. <em>See Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 849, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 3165-66, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990) (\u2018\u201cthe Confrontation Clause reflects a preference for face-to-face confrontation at trial\u2019 \u201d); <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 456, 470 S.E.2d 114, 124 (1996). Therefore, application of the Confrontation Clause to the post-trial sentencing proceedings is inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 300-01, 498 S.E.2d at 455 (emphasis in original). The principle of <em>stare decisis </em>applies to panel decisions of the Court of Appeals. <em>Commonwealth v. Burns, </em>240 Va. 171, 174, 395 S.E.2d 456, 457 (1990). Panel decisions may be overruled through the <em>en banc </em>hearing process, <em>see id., </em>but not by other panel decisions. Accordingly, we may reverse Harper\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>tences only if Harper is correct that the United States Supreme Court has already overruled <em>Moses </em>in <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Before <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that hearsay statements were admissible, and did not violate the Confrontation Clause, if the hearsay statements bore adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). An out-of-court statement\u2019s reliability was considered adequate if the statement fell within a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or if the statement was accompanied by \u201ca showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The Supreme Court overruled <em>Roberts </em>in <em>Crawford. Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61-65, 124 S.Ct. at 1370-72. In <em>Crawford, </em>the defendant stabbed a man and was tried for assault and attempted murder. <em>Id. </em>at 38, 124 S.Ct. at 1356-57. The defendant did not plead guilty, as Harper has done, but relied instead on a theory of self-defense. To refute the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim, during the guilt/innocence phase of Crawford\u2019s trial, the prosecution played a tape-recorded statement made to police by the defendant\u2019s wife, who could not testify at the trial because of Washington\u2019s statutory marital privilege. <em>Id. </em>Despite the finding of the Washington courts that the wife\u2019s statement showed particularized guarantees of trustworthiness pursuant to <em>Roberts, </em>the Supreme Court held that the prosecution\u2019s use of the wife\u2019s statement violated the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Part I of the <em>Crawford </em>opinion describes the facts of the case and the proceedings at Crawford\u2019s trial and in the Washington appellate courts. <em>Id. </em>at 38-42, 124 S.Ct. at 1356-59. Part II begins with the recognition that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s text does not settle the question, so an investigation into the history of the Confrontation Clause is necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 42\u201443, 124 S.Ct. at 1359. Sections A and B of Part II describe the confrontation right as it existed, respectively, in the common law of England and of the American colonies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>early Republic, prior to and around the time of the ratification of the Sixth Amendment in 1791. <em>Id. </em>at 42-50, 124 S.Ct. at 1859-1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Part III draws two inferences from this history. The first was that the goal of the Confrontation Clause was to protect the accused from civil law criminal procedure practices, particularly the <em>ex parte </em>examinations of witnesses by public officials. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. The second inference was that the founding generation understood the Confrontation Clause to prohibit the admission in evidence of testimonial statements of witnesses who did not appear for trial, unless the witness was unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1365-66. In Part IV, the Court reviewed its own prior cases interpreting the Confrontation Clause, and found that \u201c[o]ur case law has been largely consistent with these two principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57,124 S.Ct. at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Part V begins: \u201c[although the results of our decisions have generally been faithful to the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause, the same cannot be said of our rationales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60,124 S.Ct. at 1369. What follows is a forceful criticism of the Court\u2019s Confrontation Clause jurisprudence under <em>Roberts. </em>The Court attacks the <em>Roberts </em>standard for being highly unpredictable in practice and for departing from the original understanding of the Confrontation Clause. Specifically, the Court emphasizes that <em>Roberts </em>permits admission of exactly the kind of <em>ex parte </em>testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause was meant to exclude \u201cbased on a mere judicial determination of reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1370.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">Admitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation. To be sure, the Clause\u2019s ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. \u201cDispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1371. \u201cWhere testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68,124 S.Ct. at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We have reviewed the <em>Crawford </em>opinion in some detail because Harper\u2019s reliance on <em>Crawford </em>is the essential question before us. And we find nothing in that opinion that supports Harper\u2019s claim that <em>Crawford </em>extended the applicable scope of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to sentencing proceedings. The application of the Confrontation Clause to sentencing was quite clearly not the issue before the Court. After all, the prosecution played the recorded statements of the defendant\u2019s wife during the guilt/innocence phase of the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 40-41, 124 S.Ct. at 1357-58. Nor does the Court\u2019s analysis support Harper\u2019s position. The <em>Crawford </em>opinion focuses on the necessity of replacing the <em>Roberts </em>standard with what the Court considers to be the original understanding of what the confrontation right <em>is, </em>that is, a procedural guarantee to the accused that he may challenge testimonial evidence against him through the process of cross-examination. The opinion does not contain a similar revision of the type of legal proceedings to which the Confrontation Clause applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Moreover, the early English and American cases cited in Part II of <em>Crawford, </em>particularly <em>Raleigh\u2019s Case, </em>2 How. St. Tr. 1, 15-16 (1603), provide the foundation for the Court\u2019s argument that the <em>Roberts </em>standard reflected a fundamentally mistaken view of the Confrontation Clause. If any of these early cases applied the confrontation right to sentencing proceedings, the <em>Crawford </em>opinion does not mention it. It would be strange indeed for an opinion so anchored in history, and attaching such importance to the original understanding of the founding generation, to apply the Confrontation Clause to sentencing proceedings without first seeking to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>whether, prior to the ratification of the Sixth Amendment, there existed any precedents to support such a view.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">That <em>Crawford </em>has not overruled our decision in <em>Moses </em>is also apparent from the way the United States Supreme Court has treated its own earlier decision in <em>Williams v. New York, </em>387 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). Pursuant to statute, the trial judge in <em>Williams </em>had the discretion to impose the jury\u2019s recommendation of life imprisonment or a death sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 245, 69 S.Ct. at 1082. \u201cIn giving his reasons for imposing the death sentence the judge discussed in open court the evidence upon which the jury had convicted stating that this evidence had been considered in light of additional information obtained through the court\u2019s \u2018probation department, and other sources.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 69 S.Ct. at 1080-81 (quoting <em>People v. Williams, </em>298 N.Y. 803, 83 N.E.2d 698, 699 (1949)). The defendant argued that his sentence was imposed based on information \u201csupplied by witnesses with whom the accused had not been confronted and as to whom he had no opportunity for cross-examination or rebuttal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 69 S.Ct. at 1081. <em>Williams </em>affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">Tribunals passing on the guilt of a defendant always have been hedged in by strict evidentiary procedural limitations. But both before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 246, 69 S.Ct. at 1082. If <em>Williams </em>remains good law, then it is clearly a serious obstacle to Harper\u2019s claim that his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses applied to his sentencing proceeding. Yet the United States Supreme Court has continued to treat <em>Williams </em>as a valid precedent, <em>even in cases decided since Crawford. See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 233, 125 S.Ct. 738, 749-50, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 304, 124 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>2531, 2537-38, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We also believe that, if the Court had intended that its <em>Crawford </em>decision should overrule <em>Williams, </em>it would have clearly expressed that intention. Yet <em>Crawford </em>does not mention <em>Williams </em>at all. <em>\u201cCrawford </em>does not explicitly overrule <em>Williams.\u201d United States v. Littlesun, </em>444 F.3d 1196, 1200 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">We further note that each United States Court of Appeals that has considered the application of <em>Crawford </em>to sentencing has reached the same conclusion. <em>\u201cCrawford </em>does not apply to sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Monteiro, </em>417 F.3d 208, 215 (1st Cir.2005). <em>See also United States v. Luciano, </em>414 F.3d 174, 178-80 (1st Cir.2005) (\u201cNothing in <em>Crawford </em>requires us to alter our previous conclusion that there is no Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause right at sentencing.\u201d); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>413 F.3d 239, 242 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cBoth the Supreme Court and this Court, however, have consistently held that the right of confrontation does not apply to the sentencing context and does not prohibit the consideration of hearsay testimony in sentencing proceedings.\u201d); <em>United States v. Stone, </em>432 F.3d 651, 654 (6th Cir.2005) (\u201cBecause <em>Crawford </em>was concerned only with testimonial evidence introduced at trial, <em>Crawford </em>does not change our long-settled rule that the confrontation clause does not apply in sentencing proceedings.\u201d); <em>United States v. Roche, </em>415 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir. 2005) (same); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>430 F.3d 942, 944 (8th Cir.2005) (same); <em>Littlesun, </em>444 F.3d at 1200 (same); <em>United States v. Bustamante, </em>454 F.3d 1200, 1202-03 (10th Cir.2006) (same). \u201cThe <em>Crawford </em>opinion does not state that its rule applies at sentencing; it does not refer to sentencing. While that rule may eventually be extended to the sentencing context, that has not happened yet.\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">On brief, Harper attempts to support his position with authority from two other jurisdictions. <em>See In re M.P., </em>220 S.W.3d 99 (Tex.App.2007); <em>Rodgers v. State, </em>948 So.2d 655 (Fla.2006). It is true that these cases apply a confrontation right to sentencing under specific circumstances. But neither adopts the view that it was <em>Crawford </em>or any other United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>States Supreme Court case decided after <em>Moses </em>that here compels this application: accordingly, Harper\u2019s reliance is misplaced. Unlike Harper\u2019s case, <em>Rodgers </em>was a death penalty case, <em>id. </em>at 659, and the decision rested its application of <em>Crawford </em>to sentencing, at least in part, on the \u201c \u2018uncontroverted proposition that the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation applies to all three phases of the <em>capital trial.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 663 (quoting <em>Rodriguez v. State, </em>753 So.2d 29, 43 (Fla.2000)) (emphasis added). <em>Compare United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1146 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(Crawford </em>does not extend to non-capital sentencing), <em>with Proffitt v. Wainwright, </em>685 F.2d 1227, 1254-55 (11th Cir.1982) (right to confrontation applies to capital sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><em>In re M.P. </em>at least endorses the view that the Confrontation Clause should apply to the defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony regarding S.D.\u2019s feelings about Harper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">We do conclude, however, that at a minimum an adult criminal defendant has a constitutional right of confrontation at sentencing: (1) in cases in which the State seeks imposition of a sentence on the basis of findings beyond those \u201creflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant\u201d; <em>see Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 232, 125 S.Ct. at 749; <em>[State v.] McGill, </em>213 Ariz. 147, 140 P.3d [930,] 942 [(Ariz. 2006)]; and <em>(2) whenever the State calls a witness to testify at punishment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\"><em>In re M.P., </em>220 S.W.3d at 108 (emphasis added). However, <em>In re M.P. </em>rests proposition (2), not on <em>Crawford, </em>but on <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970), and two Texas decisions. None of these cases can possibly have overruled this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moses; Allen </em>was decided eighteen years before <em>Moses </em>and the Texas cases are not binding on this Court. As far as we can tell, no court, in any state, has endorsed the position necessary for our reversal of Harper\u2019s conviction, i.e. that <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny have extended the applicable scope of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Harper also relies on <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 786, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1761-62, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973), for the proposition that a confrontation right exists at a probation revocation hearing. If a convicted defendant enjoys a right to confrontation before the court may order him to serve portions of a previously suspended sentence, Harper continues, it follows that the right to confrontation must apply at the original sentencing hearing as well. We reject this argument because its validity depends on the assumption that the right of confrontation applicable to probation revocation hearings, like the trial right of confrontation described in <em>Crawford, </em>invariably prohibits the admission into evidence of testimonial hearsay in the absence of a prior opportunity for cross-examination. It is clear that <em>Gagnon </em>did not impose a blanket prohibition on such hearsay. <em>See id. </em>at 782 n. 5, 93 S.Ct. at 1760 n. 5 (\u201cWhile in some cases there is simply no adequate alternative to live testimony, we emphasize that we did not in <em>Morrissey [v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972),] intend to prohibit use where appropriate of the conventional substitutes for live testimony, including affidavits, depositions, and documentary evidence.\u201d). Moreover, even <em>post-Crawford </em>Virginia decisions interpreting <em>Gagnon </em>mention the discretion of the trial judge to decide whether to allow hearsay testimony during the course of a probation violation hearing. \u201cThus, hearsay evidence, which would normally be inadmissible in a criminal trial, may be admitted into evidence in a revocation hearing based on the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Dickens, </em>52 Va.App. at 421, 663 S.E.2d at 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Harper\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">.
