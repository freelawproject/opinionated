The court found that husband\u2014a schizoaffective psychotic on weekend furlough from a psychiatric ward of a hospital\u2014lacked the requisite mental competence to execute the agreement. On appeal, wife argues the evidence failed to prove incompetency as a matter of law. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on appeal, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003) (citations omitted). \u201cThat principle requires us to discard the evidence of the appellant which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by the appellee at trial.\u201d <em>Brandau v. Brandau, </em>52 Va.App. 632, 635, 666 S.E.2d 532, 534 (2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">Seth A. Bailey (husband) and Nettie L. Bailey (wife) married in 1983. Husband served as an officer in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>States Navy until the early 1990s, when Navy doctors diagnosed him to be suffering from chronic and severe schizoaffective psychosis. Because of his mental condition, husband was discharged from the Navy as totally disabled and has not worked since. \u201cMany times\u201d over the course of the marriage, wife testified, husband would become \u201ctotally incoherent\u201d and need to be hospitalized to regulate his psychotropic medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On June 14, 1995, husband was hospitalized after wife reported he was experiencing hallucinations involving homicidal and suicidal voices. He was \u201cout of control,\u201d wife testified. During a weekend furlough, on July 16, 1995, wife presented husband with a document entitled \u201cContract of Marriage.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wife warned husband that he could never return home again unless he signed the agreement. She also made clear that if he did not sign the agreement she would divorce him. \u201c[I]f it wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d wife added, \u201cyou\u2019d be homeless.\u201d Husband signed the agreement and returned to the hospital\u2019s psychiatric ward the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Drafted by wife, the \u201cContract of Marriage\u201d recited that the parties desired \u201cinterpersonal immunity to foster a harmonious living environment.\u201d Contract of Marriage at preface (July 16, 1995). To accomplish that goal, the agreement provided the parties \u201cwould not be bound by certain legalities of marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u25a0 husband would execute a power of attorney authorizing wife to solely manage \u201call financial matters of this marriage,\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u25a0 all debts incurred during the marriage would be solely attributed to husband,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u25a0 all real and personal property acquired during the marriage would become the sole property of wife upon dissolution of the marriage, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u25a0 husband would pay wife \u201ccontinuous and adequate support\u201d in the event of a divorce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\"><em>Id. </em>at KH 4(a) to 4(f). Wife claimed husband read the agreement and understood its provisions. Husband testified, however, he \u201cdidn\u2019t read any of it.\u201d All he understood, husband testified, was that he was \u201c[sjigning a document to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">A friend of wife\u2019s testified he saw husband sign the agreement and that husband appeared at the time to be of sound mind. Wife\u2019s friend, however, was unaware of husband\u2019s inpatient psychiatric status on the day the contract was signed. Challenging the friend\u2019s motives, husband testified the witness was not present and did not observe husband sign the agreement. \u201cSo he lied when he said he was there and watching you sign it?\u201d counsel asked. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d husband responded, \u201cthat\u2019s what the gentleman did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AaI\">Husband\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Alison Lynch, recalled him explaining to her on July 17 that he had to sign the document because wife \u201cwould not let him come home\u201d if he refused to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Asked by wife\u2019s counsel if husband understood the agreement, Dr. Lynch answered: \u201cYes, I believe he did understand what he had signed, <em>but </em>....\u201d Before Dr. Lynch could finish the \u201cbut\u201d caveat, counsel interrupted with another question.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Later in her testimony, Dr. Lynch reiterated her expert opinion that husband was \u201cnot competent\u201d at the time he entered into the agreement. Because of his deteriorated psychiatric condition, Dr. Lynch opined, husband lacked the mental \u201ccapacity to manage his affairs and make decisions in his best interest.\u201d He appeared \u201chelpless\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>what to do or how to get himself out of this predicament.\u201d Dr. Lynch made this assessment based upon the Veteran Administration\u2019s definition of a mentally incompetent person as \u201cone who because of injury or disease lacks the mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs, including disbursement of funds without limitation.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.353(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The hospital discharged husband on July 18, two days after he signed the agreement. Though he was no longer having homicidal or suicidal voice idealizations, he was taking seven prescription medications for his psychosis and was scheduled for follow-up psychiatric evaluations. The hospital discharge summary, authored by Dr. Lynch, stated \u201c[t]he patient is not competent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">A former Navy colleague, who knew husband since the 1980s, testified that husband\u2019s condition in 1995 could be best described as \u201can inward catatonic state\u201d and not \u201creally functional.\u201d \u201cHe seemed to be totally dependent, helpless,\u201d the colleague continued. He attributed this weakened condition both to husband\u2019s psychosis and to wife\u2019s reaction to it: \u201cI would say it appeared as though she was abusive, neglectful, she took advantage of him, [and] she talked down to him as if he were a child.\u201d The colleague described husband as \u201cdocile\u201d and \u201cunder the control\u201d of wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Based upon this evidence, the trial court found husband mentally incompetent during his weekend furlough from the psychiatric ward and refused to enforce the \u201cContract of Marriage\u201d he signed that weekend. The court also held, in the alternative, that the agreement was the impermissible product of coercion and had, in any event, been rescinded by a later contract. Because we find the trial court\u2019s incompetency holding sufficient to resolve this appeal, we offer no advisory opinion on the two alternative holdings. \u201cIn this case, as in all others, we seek to decide cases \u2018on the best and narrowest ground available\u2019 from the record.\u201d <em>Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 691, 702 n. 2, 653 S.E.2d 600, 603 n. 2 (2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Virginia law subjects property settlement agreements \u201cto the same rules of construction and interpretation applicable to contracts generally,\u201d <em>Fry v. Schwarting, </em>4 Va.App. 173, 180, 355 S.E.2d 342, 346 (1987), and makes clear such agreements \u201cshall be valid and enforceable if otherwise valid as contracts,\u201d <em>Hurt v. Hurt, </em>16 Va.App. 792, 797, 433 S.E.2d 493, 496 (1993) (citation omitted). The law presumes competency and places the burden on the challenging party to demonstrate incompetency by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Drewry v. Drewry, </em>8 Va.App. 460, 467, 383 S.E.2d 12, 15 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">A contracting party is competent if, at the time he executes the agreement, he had sufficient \u201cmental capacity to understand the nature of the transaction and agree to its provisions.\u201d <em>Jones v. Peacock, </em>267 Va. 16, 19 n. 1, 591 S.E.2d 83, 86 n. 1 (2004) (citing <em>Hill v. Brooks, </em>253 Va. 168, 175, 482 S.E.2d 816, 821 (1997)). A party with sufficient mental capacity cannot disaffirm the agreement no matter how \u201cill-reasoned or ill-advised\u201d it might be. <em>Drewry, </em>8 Va.App. at 469, 383 S.E.2d at 16. While a contracting party must \u201cunderstand the nature and consequences\u201d of entering into the agreement, the \u201claw does not require that one have the ability to make a reasoned judgment\u201d concerning it. <em>Id. </em>at 468, 383 S.E.2d at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u201cThe resolution of conflicting evidence bearing on an individual\u2019s mental capacity is a factual determination to be made by the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 383 S.E.2d at 15. On this issue, as with all others, a factfinder\u2019s resolution of conflicting facts and competing inferences receives \u201cthe highest degree of appellate deference.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006). A trial court, sitting as factfinder, participates \u201cfirst person in the evidentiary process and acquire[s] competencies on the subject that we can rarely duplicate merely by reading briefs and transcripts.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 758, 607 S.E.2d 738, 746, <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005). Therefore, the trial court\u2019s determination of such issue \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Drewry, 8 </em>Va.App. at 467, 383 S.E.2d at 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><em>Dretvry </em>best illustrates the interplay between the appellate standard of review and the issue of mental incompetency. In that case, the trial court was unpersuaded by the challenging party\u2019s evidence of incompetence. A psychiatrist testified that the wife was incompetent to \u201creason through any important legal document\u201d because she was depressed about her poor marriage. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 468, 383 S.E.2d at 14, 15. The trial court, however, discounted the expert opinion because it \u201cwas based in part on fabricated and exaggerated information\u201d and could not be considered \u201ca totally reliable statement of her mental condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 383 S.E.2d at 16; <em>see generally Street v. Street, </em>25 Va.App. 380, 387, 488 S.E.2d 665, 668-69 (1997) (\u201cIn determining the weight to be given the testimony of an expert witness, the fact finder may consider the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Eschewing the expert\u2019s opinion, the trial court in <em>Drewry </em>believed other witnesses including the attorney who drafted the agreement. They observed nothing about wife\u2019s behavior that caused them to \u201cquestion her capacity to contract or whether she understood the terms and nature of the agreement.\u201d Dre<em>wry, </em>8 Va.App. at 468, 383 S.E.2d at 15. Based on this testimony, the court found the wife was competent to contract and deemed the agreement valid. Applying our appellate standard of review, we reviewed the evidence on appeal in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the prevailing party, the husband who sought to <em>affirm </em>the agreement. The question then became whether the evidence, viewed favorably to husband, \u201cestablished <em>as a matter of law </em>\u201d the wife\u2019s mental incompetence. <em>Id. </em>at 463, 383 S.E.2d at 13 (emphasis added). We deferred to the factfinder and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The case now before us presents the opposite scenario. Here, the trial court accepted the expert\u2019s opinion as credible. While our appellate standard of review remains invariant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>party benefiting from it is different than in <em>Drewry. </em>In contrast to <em>Drewry, </em>we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the party seeking to <em>disaffirm </em>the agreement, husband, because he won the contested factual disputes in the trial court. To be successful on appeal, therefore, wife must demonstrate that, when viewed in this light, no subset of facts in this record could lead a rational factfinder to conclude by clear and convincing evidence that husband was incompetent when he signed the agreement. In our opinion, the record does not permit this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Husband signed the agreement during a weekend furlough from the psychiatric ward of the hospital. He had a decades-long history of chronic and severe schizoaffective psychosis, a condition causing him to be totally disabled. He was admitted into the hospital on this occasion after hearing homicidal and suicidal voices, experiencing hallucinations, and being generally \u201cout of control.\u201d The treating psychiatrist, Dr. Lynch, testified husband was \u201chelpless\u201d and \u201cnot competent\u201d because he lacked \u201ccapacity to manage his affairs and make decisions in his best interest.\u201d A witness who had known husband since his Navy days described husband in 1995 as living in \u201can inward catatonic state\u201d\u2014a situation in which he was not \u201creally functional\u201d but rather \u201ctotally dependent\u201d and \u201chelpless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Wife argues on appeal the trial court should have discounted Dr. Lynch\u2019s opinion because of her statement, \u201cYes, I believe he did understand what he had signed, but____\u201d Like the trial court, we find this statement pretermitted the real issue. In context, Dr. Lynch was saying nothing more than what husband told her: If he did not sign the agreement, he would end up divorced and homeless. That was the extent of his understanding. That observation did not render fallacious Dr. Lynch\u2019s ultimate opinion that husband was mentally \u201cincompetent\u201d because he lacked the mental \u201ccapacity to manage his affairs and make decisions in his best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">After all, the <em>true </em>\u201cnature of the transaction,\u201d <em>Jones, </em>267 Va. at 19 n. 1, 591 S.E.2d at 86 n. 1, was not simply a sign-this-or-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>be-homeless deal. It was instead a comprehensive contract that relieved both parties of \u201ccertain legalities of marriage\u201d while simultaneously ensuring wife\u2019s right to control \u201call financial matters\u201d pursuant to a power of attorney, wife\u2019s exclusive right to \u201call property\u201d acquired during the marriage, husband\u2019s sole liability for \u201call debts\u201d \u201cincurred during the marriage,\u201d and husband\u2019s duty to pay \u201ccontinuous\u201d spousal support to wife upon a divorce. <em>See </em>Contract of Marriage at 11114(a) to 4(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In sum, we have neither the authority nor the inclination to second-guess the evidentiary weight the trial court placed on Dr. Lynch\u2019s expert opinion concerning husband\u2019s mental incompetence. \u201cIn Virginia, as in other jurisdictions, it is for the jury, or the court trying the case without a jury, to determine the weight to be given the testimony of expert witnesses.\u201d <em>Ford v. Ford, </em>200 Va. 674, 679, 107 S.E.2d 397, 401 (1959). On this record, the trial court\u2019s factfinding cannot be set aside as \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Drewry, 8 </em>Va.App. at 467, 383 S.E.2d at 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The trial court did not err in accepting the evidence of husband\u2019s mental incompetence and in holding the agreement unenforceable for this reason. We thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">. Wife testified husband signed a predecessor agreement in 1985. Among other things, this earlier contract stated that husband had \"defamed the character of and caused personal injury to\u201d wife. Contract of Marriage at $ 1 (Aug. 8, 1985). Apparently as compensation for this loss and for the benefits of a \"harmonious and conjugal relationship,\u201d <em>id. </em>at preface, the 1985 contract required husband to support wife's children from a prior marriage; transferred all assets to wife and all debts to husband; authorized wife to \"accelerate payment\u201d and \"require collateral\" at her election; and obligated husband to pay wife $10,464 a year. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3. The enforceability, if any, of the 1985 contract was not litigated in the trial court or argued on appeal. We thus offer no opinion on the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\">.
