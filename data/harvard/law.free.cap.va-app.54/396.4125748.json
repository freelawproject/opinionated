On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment or, in the alternative, to remand the case to the juvenile and domestic relations district court for a preliminary hearing. Appellant also contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence as insufficient to support his conviction of custodial indecent liberties. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">On appeal, \u201c[wjhere the issue is whether the evidence is sufficient, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 135, 455 S.E.2d 730, 731 (1995). \u201cThe credibility of the \"witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138, 455 S.E.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">The evidence proved that on July 18, 2005, V., a fifteen-year-old boy, was visiting appellant\u2019s home. V. had known appellant, who was fifty-eight years old at the time, for about four years and had spent several vacations with appellant\u2019s family. Earlier that evening appellant received a call from V.\u2019s father requesting that he send V. home for dinner. Appellant found V. in the house and sent him home. V. returned, and he and appellant\u2019s son played a computer game <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>in appellant\u2019s son\u2019s bedroom, as they typically did \u201cfour or five times a week.\u201d Sometime after 8:30 p.m. that evening, appellant entered his son\u2019s bedroom. The two boys attempted to teach appellant how to play the computer game. After about two hours, appellant told both his son and V. to \u201cgo to bed.\u201d V. spent the night at appellant\u2019s house once or twice a week, and appellant \u201cusually told [V. and appellant\u2019s son] when [they] should go to bed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> V. slept on the futon, as he normally did when he spent the night at appellant\u2019s house. Appellant\u2019s son slept in his own bed. Sometime later that evening, V. asked appellant to give him a massage. V. had previously received \u201c[a] lot\u201d of massages from appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Appellant began rubbing V.\u2019s back while they watched a movie. V. was wearing underwear and sport shorts but no shirt. After about ten minutes, appellant asked V. to \u201cflip over\u201d onto his back so that appellant could rub his neck. V. was unable to fall asleep while appellant was rubbing his neck, but appellant \u201ckept on checking to see if [he] was awake.\u201d After rubbing V.\u2019s neck for a while, appellant \u201cpulled the front part of [V.\u2019s] pants down and was looking at [V.\u2019s] penis.\u201d Appellant then began touching the tip of V.\u2019s penis and continued doing so for about two minutes. When V. moved his leg, appellant quickly returned to massaging his chest. A few minutes later, appellant again reached his hand inside V.\u2019s shorts and started \u201cplaying with\u201d V.\u2019s erect penis. He continued for about three minutes. V. then rolled onto his side away from appellant, and appellant quickly started massaging his back. Appellant put his hands down V.\u2019s shorts a third time, \u201crubbing\u201d V.\u2019s penis for four to five minutes. V. then rolled all the way over onto his stomach, and appellant left the room. Neither appellant, V., nor appellant\u2019s son, who appeared to be sleeping, said anything during the incident. As soon as appellant left the room, V. quickly gathered his effects, ran to his house next door, and told his father what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>At trial, appellant testified that he was aware that V. was not allowed to play the computer game the boys were playing on the night in question and was concerned about the effect the game was having on both boys. He told the trial court that he noticed that V. had developed an erection during the massage, and that he lifted up V.\u2019s shorts to look at his erect penis out of \u201ccuriosity.\u201d He testified that he briefly touched V.\u2019s penis out of \u201csome sort of a morbid curiosity\u201d but quickly removed his hand. He testified that when he saw it was still exposed, he \u201cwas getting ... partial instinctive messages that were guiding [him] at this point.\u201d He also testified that he got some massage oil off V.\u2019s back and touched V.\u2019s penis again for a few seconds. Appellant told the trial court that upon reflection he realized that, at the time he touched V.\u2019s penis, the movie, <em>Caddyshack </em>(Orion Pictures 1980), was playing a scene with a topless woman. He testified that what he did was \u201cincredibly stupid\u201d and that he did not \u201cknow why [he] did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A18\">A. Preliminary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Appellant was tried on a direct indictment charging that he committed custodial indecent liberties on V., a child under eighteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment or, in the alternative, to remand the case to the juvenile and domestic relations district court for a preliminary hearing. He asserts that he was initially arrested on a felony arrest warrant charging that he committed custodial indecent liberties on V. Appellant further asserts that, on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, that charge was <em>nolle prosequied </em>by the juvenile and domestic relations district court, over his objection that \u201cthe Commonwealth failed to show good cause\u201d to justify the <em>nolle prosequi</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>We find no error in the trial court\u2019s denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. This Court recently decided <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, 52 </em>Va.App. 690, 667 S.E.2d 787 (2008) (en banc).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There, we held that \u201cthe circuit court is without subject matter jurisdiction to conduct an appellate review of the district court\u2019s order granting a motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>and therefore cannot reverse that court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 705, 667 S.E.2d at 794. Appellant \u201cwas not entitled to have the circuit court review the district court\u2019s discretionary decision and grant [his] requested remedy of either having the case remanded to the district court for preliminary hearing or having the subsequent indictment[] dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707, 667 S.E.2d at 795. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Appellant also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear the charge against him without first having a preliminary hearing in the juvenile and domestic relations district court. In his brief on appeal, he asserts that Code \u00a7 16.1-241 \u201cvests the juvenile and domestic relations district court with original and exclusive jurisdiction to conduct a preliminary hearing where the charge involves a juvenile victim.\u201d Rule 5A:18 provides, \u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d This Court \u201cwill not consider an argument on appeal [that] was not presented to the trial court.\u201d <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998). \u201cMaking one specific argument on an issue does not preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>a separate legal point on the same issue for review.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 752, 760, 589 S.E.2d 444, 448 (2003) (en banc). Appellant did not request that we invoke the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18, and \u201c[tjhis Court will not consider, <em>sua sponte, </em>an ends-of-justice argument under Rule 5A:18.\u201d <em>Widdifield v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 559, 564, 600 S.E.2d 159,162 (2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">B. Custodial Indecent Liberties</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, at the conclusion of all the evidence, as insufficient to prove that he committed custodial indecent liberties on V. in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 provides, in pertinent part, \u201cAny person 18 years of age or older who ... maintains a custodial or supervisory relationship over a child under the age of 18 ... who, with lascivious intent, knowingly and intentionally ... sexually abuses the child as defined in [Code] \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6), shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6) provides, \u201c \u2018Sexual abuse\u2019 means an act committed with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any person, where ... [t]he accused intentionally touches the complaining witness\u2019s intimate parts or material directly covering such intimate parts.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">1. Custodial or Supervisory Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Appellant argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove that he exercised a custodial or supervisory relationship over V., a minor, at the time of the admitted touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">\u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-370.1 was designed to protect minors from sexual exploitation by adults who hold positions of trust or authority with regard to them.\u201d <em>Sadler v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 17, 25, 654 S.E.2d 313, 316 (2007) (citing <em>Krampen v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 163, 168, 510 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1999)), <em>aff'd, </em>276 Va. 762, 667 S.E.2d 783 (2008). \u201cCode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-370.1 requires proof of a \u2018custodial or supervisory relationship\u2019 as a \u2018predicate to finding guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 654 S.E.2d at 315 (quoting <em>Seibert v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 40, 46, 467 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1996)). \u201cWhether such a relationship exists at the time of the offending conduct is a matter of fact to be determined on a case by case basis.\u201d <em>Sadler v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 762, 765, 667 S.E.2d 783, 785 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201cIn interpreting Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1, the Virginia Courts have broadly construed the meaning of custody, going beyond legal custody, to include those with informal, temporary custody.\u201d <em>Guda v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 453, 458, 592 S.E.2d 748, 750 (2004). We have held that \u201cthe \u2018custodial or supervisory relationship\u2019 required under Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 ... includes those individuals eighteen years or older who have a temporary, custodial relationship with a child, such as, \u2018teachers, athletic instructors and baby-sitters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krampen, </em>29 Va.App. at 168, 510 S.E.2d at 278 (quoting <em>Lovisi v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 848, 850, 188 S.E.2d 206, 208 (1972)). \u201cThe child in each instance has been entrusted to the care and control of the supervising adult.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 does not require the specific entrustment of the child to the care of the adult to create a custodial or supervisory relationship.... [A] custodial relationship arises when the supervising adult exercises care and control over the child, with the care including the \u201cresponsibility for and the control of the child\u2019s safety and well being.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\"><em>Guda, </em>42 Va.App. at 459, 592 S.E.2d at 751 (quoting <em>Krampen, </em>29 Va.App. at 168, 510 S.E.2d at 279).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Here, the record shows that a longstanding relationship between appellant and V.\u2019s family existed. V. frequently spent the night at appellant\u2019s house and accompanied appellant\u2019s family on several vacations. On the night in question, appellant was aware of V.\u2019s presence in the home. He testified that he was concerned about a video game\u2019s effect on both boys, intervening as he saw fit. Appellant asserted authority over V. and, likewise, his own son, telling both boys to \u201cgo to bed.\u201d Appellant acted \u201cin the nature of a baby-sitter, <em>i.e., </em>one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>entrusted with the care of the child for a limited period of time.\u201d <em>Krampen, </em>29 Va.App. at 168, 510 S.E.2d at 279. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant \u201cmaintain[ed] a custodial or supervisory relationship\u201d over V.Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">2. Lascivious Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Appellant also argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he acted with lascivious intent, asserting that \u201cthe trial court improperly placed upon [him], the burden to disprove a lascivious intent at the time of the touching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u201c \u2018Intent may, and most often must, be proven by circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from proven facts are within the province of the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holley v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 158, 165, 562 S.E.2d 351, 354-55 (2002) (quoting <em>Summerlin v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 288, 297, 557 S.E.2d 731, 736 (2002)). \u201cIntent may be shown by a person\u2019s conduct and by his statements.\u201d <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 198, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u201cThe mental state required to support [a] conviction[ ] [under Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1] is one of lasciviousness.\u201d <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 28, 531 S.E.2d 580, 590 (2000) (en banc). We have consistently defined \u201clascivious\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018a state of mind that is eager for sexual indulgence, desirous of inciting to lust or of inciting sexual desire and appetite.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McKeon v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 24, 27, 175 S.E.2d 282, 284 (1970) (under former Code \u00a7 18.1-214)); <em>Viney v.

Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>McKeon, </em>as well as <em>Viney, Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 196, 313 S.E.2d 402 (1984), and <em>Breeding v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 344, 192 S.E.2d 807 (1972), is misplaced. <em>McKeon, </em>as well as the other cases relied on by appellant, involved proof of lascivious intent where the accused was charged with indecent exposure, not sexual abuse of a child as is the case before us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The record shows that, while massaging V.\u2019s back and neck, appellant checked to see if V. was asleep several times over a period of thirty minutes. During that time, appellant pulled V.\u2019s shorts down to see his penis. He then fondled V.\u2019s penis. Only after appellant first touched it did it become erect, at which point he touched it two more times, \u201crubbing\u201d it on the third occasion. Appellant admitted at trial that he touched V.\u2019s erect penis out of \u201csome sort of a morbid curiosity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u201c \u2018[W]hether the required intent exists is generally a question for the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawley v.

The \u201creviewing court does not \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crowder v.

The trial court stated, \u201cI\u2019m entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence that was provided by both sides here, and frankly I think lascivious intent is the most reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence that I\u2019ve heard.\u201d We conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that appellant acted with lascivious intent. <em>See Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257-58, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (\u201c \u2018responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789)).
