FELTON, JR., Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">After a jury trial, Mathurin Ngomondjami (\u201cappellant\u201d) was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. On appeal, appellant contends the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to convict him of DUI, arguing it failed to prove he \u201coperated\u201d a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. He also contends the trial court erred in refusing his proffered jury instruction defining the term \u201coperating a motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Additionally, he contends the trial court erred during the sentencing phase of his trial by admitting into evidence his Department of Motor Vehicles driving record (DMV record) pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-943, arguing the Commonwealth failed to comply with the notice requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">\u201cWhere the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged after conviction, it is our duty to consider it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). We must \u201cexamine the evidence that tends to support the conviction! ] and to permit the conviction! ] to stand unless [it is] plainly wrong or without evidentiary support.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 520, 499 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1998) (citing Code \u00a7 8.01-680).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">So viewed, the evidence proved that in the early morning hours of October 29, 2006, Corporal Arthur Tate of the Arlington County Police Department found appellant, unconscious, reclined in the driver\u2019s seat of a car with its engine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>running in a school parking lot. Appellant was its only-occupant. After several attempts to get appellant\u2019s attention by knocking on the driver\u2019s door window, Tate opened the unlocked driver\u2019s door and woke him.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Corporal Tate determined that appellant had slurred speech, was unsteady on his feet, and had bloodshot eyes. He asked appellant if he would take field sobriety tests, and appellant agreed to do so. However, appellant laughed at Corporal Tate when he demonstrated the one-legged stand test, and refused to attempt it, stating he thought Tate wanted to make fun of him. Appellant also refused to attempt the heel-to-toe test and the alphabet test. Although he previously told Tate he had a degree in electrical engineering, appellant told Tate he had no education and therefore could not perform the alphabet test.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Appellant spoke in a soft voice but was belligerent, and repeatedly threatened Corporal Tate, stating he \u201cprayed that [Tate\u2019s] wife and kids would die within three days.... \u201d After talking with appellant for approximately 15 minutes, Corporal Tate arrested him for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">At trial, appellant testified he was sleeping in his car because he was in the process of divorcing his wife and that he was homeless. He denied being intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">After the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the jury found appellant guilty of DUI. During the sentencing phase, the Commonwealth sought to introduce appellant\u2019s DMV record, pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-943, for consideration by the jury in fixing his sentence. Appellant objected, contending the Commonwealth failed to provide him with notice pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 of its intent to introduce his driving record at sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Appellant also objected to the trial court permitting the jury to consider his DMV record, arguing it was \u201cunreliable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>much more unreliable than an actual record of conviction. That\u2019s ... why there is a surprise and it is prejudicial to the defendant without being able to investigate by looking at the actual record of conviction to see what occurred in court.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel told the trial court that prior to trial she \u201cgot [her] own [copy of appellant\u2019s] DMV record and it was different from [the] one\u201d offered by the Commonwealth. The only DMV record contained in the record on appeal is the DMV record offered by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objections and admitted his DMV record, concluding it was admissible under Code \u00a7 46.2-943 and that statute did not contain a notice requirement. It also refused to grant appellant\u2019s proffered jury instruction defining \u201coperating\u201d a motor vehicle. The jury fixed appellant\u2019s sentence at an $800 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"ATy\">A. Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">On appeal, appellant first contends the trial court erred in not granting his proffered jury instruction defining \u201coperating a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u201cThe trial judge has broad discretion in giving or denying instructions requested.\u201d <em>Gaines v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 562, 568, 574 S.E.2d 775, 778 (2003) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (quoting <em>Swisher v. Swisher, </em>223 Va. 499, 503, 290 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1982)). \u201c \u2018When granted instructions fully and fairly cover a principle of law, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing another instruction relating to the same legal principle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gaines, </em>39 Va.App. at 568, 574 S.E.2d at 778 (quoting <em>Stockton v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 145, 314 S.E.2d 371, 384 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-266 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive <em>or operate </em>any motor vehicle ... while such person is under the influence of alcohol. ...\u201d (Emphasis added). An \u201coperator\u201d of a car is defined as any person \u201cwho either [] drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.... \u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-100. \u201cOperating\u201d a car within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-266</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201cnot only includes the process of moving the vehicle from one place to another, but also includes <em>starting the engine, or manipulating the mechanical or electrical equipment of the vehicle without actually putting the car in motion. It means engaging the machinery of the vehicle which alone, or in sequence, will activate the motive power of the vehi</em>cle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\"><em>Stevenson v. City of Falls Church, </em>243 Va. 434, 438, 416 S.E.2d 435, 438 (1992) (quoting <em>Williams v. City of Petersburg, </em>216 Va. 297, 300, 217 S.E.2d 893, 896 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The trial court declined to give appellant\u2019s proffered instruction, which provided that: \u201cOperating a motor vehicle means starting the engine or manipulating the electrical or mechanical equipment of the vehicle without actually putting the vehicle in motion <em>but with the purpose of putting it in motion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). It granted the Commonwealth\u2019s jury instruction on that issue, which provided that: \u201cOperating a motor vehicle not only includes the process of moving the vehicle from one place to another, but also includes starting the engine, or manipulating the mechanical or electrical equipment of the vehicle without actually putting the car in motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Appellant\u2019s proffered instruction was not an accurate statement of the law. <em>See Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 582, 575 S.E.2d 567, 569 (2003) (\u201cNo instruction should be given that \u2018incorrectly states the applicable law or which would be confusing or misleading to the jury.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bruce v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 298, 300, 387 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1990))). Consistent with prior decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court, it was not necessary that the jury find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>appellant acted \u201cwith the purpose of putting [a car] in motion\u201d to find he \u201coperated\u201d a car within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>See Stevenson, </em>243 Va. at 438, 416 S.E.2d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The instruction granted by the trial court fully and fairly covered the principles of law relevant to the question of whether appellant operated the car in which he was found, intoxicated and while the engine was running. We conclude the trial court did not err in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s proffered jury instruction. <em>See Gaines, </em>39 Va.App. at 568, 574 S.E.2d at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AZE\">Appellant also contends the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove he \u201coperated] [the vehicle,] because there is no evidence that supports a reasonable inference that he had any purpose to put his vehicle in motion on a highway.\u201d We find appellant\u2019s argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The evidence at trial proved appellant was in his car and was intoxicated, that the key was in the ignition switch of his car, turned to the on position, and the car\u2019s engine was running. From this evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude appellant was in actual physical control of the car, and was \u201coperating\u201d it within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Accordingly, we find the jury did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to convict appellant of DUI in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>See Stevenson, </em>243 Va. at 438, 416 S.E.2d at 438; <em>see also Gallagher v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 666, 139 S.E.2d 37 (1964), citing with approval <em>State v. Sweeney, </em>77 N.J.Super. 512, 187 A.2d 39, 45 (App.Div.1962) (holding \u201cdefendant\u2019s acts, while intoxicated, in entering the automobile, turning on the ignition, starting and maintaining the motor in operation, and remaining in the driver\u2019s seat behind the steering wheel, where he was found by the police, justify his conviction as the operator of the automobile\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">C. Admission of Appellant\u2019s DMV Record</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">Appellant also contends the trial court erred at the sentencing phase of his bifurcated jury trial by admitting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>DMV record into evidence pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-943, arguing it was error to do so because the Commonwealth did not comply with the notice provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree, finding that Code \u00a7 46.2-943, rather than Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, is the controlling statute in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201c \u2018The admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and [its ruling thereon] will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 231, 236, 563 S.E.2d 364, 366 (2002) (quoting <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988)). However, \u201ca trial court \u2018by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shooltz v.

Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (quoting <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"><em>Auer v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 637, 643, 621 S.E.2d 140, 142-43 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Code \u00a7 46.2-943 provides that \u201c[w]hen any person is found guilty of a traffic offense, the court or jury trying the case may consider the prior traffic record of the defendant before imposing sentence as provided by law.\u201d The term \u201ctraffic offense,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 46.2-943, is defined as \u201cany moving traffic violation described or enumerated in subdivisions 1 and 2 of \u00a7 46.2-382,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and includes the offense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>DUI, of which appellant was convicted. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-382; <em>see also Farmer v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 175, 180, 390 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1990), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>12 Va.App. 337, 404 S.E.2d 371 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The term \u201cprior traffic record,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 46.2-943, is defined as \u201cthe record of prior suspensions and revocations of a driver\u2019s license, and the record of prior convictions of traffic offenses described in [Code \u00a7 46.2-943].\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-943. A DMV record is admissible evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior traffic record. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-384; <em>see also Mwangi v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 393, 395, 672 S.E.2d 888, 890 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Accordingly, when the jury found appellant guilty of DUI, Code \u00a7 46.2-943 authorized the admission of his DMV record into evidence during the sentencing phase as evidence of his prior traffic record.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Appellant contends, nevertheless, that the trial court erred by admitting his DMV record into evidence because the Commonwealth did not comply with the notice provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. He argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 and Code \u00a7 46.2-943 address similar subjects, i.e., the introduction of evidence of prior offenses during the sentencing phase of a bifurcated trial, and contends the trial court should have harmonized the two statutes by applying the Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 notice requirements to Code \u00a7 46.2-943, which contains no notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u201cUnder well-settled principles of statutory construction, we may not adopt an interpretation of one statute that conflicts with the plain language of another.\u201d <em>Washing</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>ton v.

Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 593, 599, 587 S.E.2d 561, 564-65 (2003)). \u201c[N]or are they permitted to accomplish the same result by judicial interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Burlile v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 501, 511, 544 S.E.2d 360, 365 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">For the trial court to find that the Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 notice requirements applied as a prerequisite to the admission of appellant\u2019s DMV transcript into evidence pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-943, it would have to read those requirements into Code \u00a7 46.2-943, which does not contain a notice requirement. To do so would be to impermissibly add language to a statute that the General Assembly has not seen fit to include. <em>See Washington, </em>272 Va. at 458-59, 634 S.E.2d at 315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Appellant also argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 is the controlling statute because it \u201cprovides very specific provisions on introduction of criminal histories\u201d during the sentencing phase of a bifurcated trial, while \u201c[Code \u00a7 ]46.2-943 generally authorizes introduction of traffic histories during sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AmK\">[W]hen one statute speaks to a subject generally and another deals with an element of that subject specifically, ... if they conflict, the more specific statute prevails. This is so because a specific statute cannot be controlled or nullified by a statute of general application unless the legislature clearly intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\"><em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>259 Va. 697, 706, 529 S.E.2d 96, 101 (2000) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Here, contrary to appellant\u2019s argument otherwise, Code \u00a7 46.2-943 is the more specific statute. Prior to the 1994 enactment of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, \u201c[bifurcated trials [were] provided by statute only in capital murder cases ... and in certain traffic cases, Code \u00a7 46.1-347.2,\u201d the predecessor of Code \u00a7 46.2-943. <em>Brown v.

Code \u00a7 46.2-943 permitted the trier of fact to conduct \u201can individualized assessment of a defendant\u2019s [prior traffic record] in the context of the subject offense, thereby promoting a more informed determination of sentence.\u201d <em>Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 523, 465 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1996). Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 expanded the use of bifurcated jury trials to all trials in which the defendant is found guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor or a felony. Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 is a statute of more general application than Code \u00a7 46.2-943, which pertains solely to trials involving traffic offenses, including DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We additionally note that the \u201cimplied repeal of an earlier statute by a later enactment is not favored,\u201d and we \u201cassume that a legislative body, when enacting new legislation, was aware of existing laws pertaining to the same subject matter....\u201d <em>Sexton v.

We conclude that since the General Assembly did not expressly refer to Code \u00a7 46.2-943, a statute related to sentencing proceedings in bifurcated trials for traffic offenses, when it enacted Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, it did not intend to impose the Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 notice requirements as a prerequisite for the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s prior traffic record into evidence pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-943.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We conclude that the Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 notice requirements do not apply to the admission of a defendant\u2019s prior traffic record into evidence pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-943.
