Cirillo (Cirillo) did not comply with Code \u00a7 2.2-4019(A)(v) of the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA) requiring Cirillo be informed \u201cbriefly and in writing, of the factual or procedural basis\u201d of that decision; (2) even assuming the trial court was correct as to its initial decision, authorized by Code \u00a7 2.2-4027 of the VAPA, that court, nonetheless, exceeded its remedial authority under Code \u00a7 2.2-4029 in directing the VRS to make disability payments to Cirillo; and (3) the trial court erred in reversing the administrative decision by employing an erroneous standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">VRS</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Structurally, a Board of Trustees administers the VRS. Code \u00a7 51.1-124.22. The Board of Trustees may create Medical Boards. Code \u00a7 51.1-124.23(A). Medical Boards review medical reports, examinations, claimant statements, etc., with respect to claims for disability retirement and submit to the Board of Trustees \u201ca written report as to its conclusions and recommendations.\u201d Code \u00a7 51.1-124.23(B). A Medical Board is \u201ca neutral evaluatory mechanism for the Retirement System to gather and analyze medical opinions and reports.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Virginia Retirement Sys., </em>30 Va.App. 104, 112, 515 S.E.2d 784, 788 (1999). These Medical Board reports, and the material upon which they are based, are sent to the Director of the VRS, appointed by the Board of Trustees, for consideration in his final administrative decision. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 51.1-124.22(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">We only recite those facts necessary for determination of the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Cirillo moved from California in August 2002, began work that month in the Chesapeake Public Schools System, and ceased working in December 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">On March 24, 2004, Cirillo filed for disability benefits pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E). Succinctly stated, this code section recites two substantive requirements to justify disability payments: (1) that claimant is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty; and (2) that incapacity is likely to be permanent. However, an award under this section is subject to the following exception: \u201cA member shall not be retired for disability for any condition which existed at the time of becoming a member unless medical evidence, convincing to the Board, supports the fact that the pre-existing condition has worsened substantially.\u201d Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">On April 7, 2004, a Medical Review Board denied Cirillo\u2019s application for disability benefits. Upon receipt of this denial, Cirillo filed additional information for review. On May 12, 2004, the Board again denied the application. Cirillo filed further information. She followed this procedure after denials dated August 11, 2004, November 10, 2004, May 10, 2006, June 7, 2006, and February 21, 2007. Following a May 15, 2006 informal fact-finding proceeding pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-4019, the fact finder recommended that Cirillo\u2019s application be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">On March 9, 2007, VRS issued a final case decision. The basis, or rationale, of that decision was contained in one paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">Based on the VRS review and contrary to the recommendation of the independent fact-finder, regular disability retirement benefits are denied. The medical evidence has not satisfied each element of \u00a7 51.1-156(E) of the Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Virginia. This was evidenced by the conclusion of the Medical Review Board on seven occasions. It is the applicant\u2019s burden to prove every element required by \u00a7 51.1-156(E) to sustain an approval for disability retirement benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Cirillo appealed to the circuit court, pursuant to the provisions of the VAPA, Code \u00a7 2.2-4000 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">By order entered August 8, 2008, the trial court found: (1) that VRS had committed an error of law in that the language of the final case decision of March 9, 2007, quoted above, violated VAPA because it did not \u201cset forth the basis upon which it purports to rest with such clarity as to be understandable,\u201d citing <em>Harrison v. Ocean View Fishing Pier L.L.C., </em>50 Va.App. 556, 651 S.E.2d 421 (2007); and (2) that VRS \u201chas not in fact met its legal burden to present evidence ... in the record ... that is legally sufficient to support its denial, and that in fact the record in great part supports the Petitioner\u2019s application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">With these findings, the trial court reversed the decision of the VRS and \u201cawarded Cirillo all regular disability retirement benefits in accordance with her original application.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">On October 2, 2008, the trial court signed a statement of facts, endorsed by counsel. Therein it is recited that the hearing in this cause was an informal hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-4019, not a formal hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-4020.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Issues of law for court review of administrative action, pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-4027 include \u201c(ii) compliance with statutory authority ... [and] ... (iii) observance of <em>required procedure </em>where any failure therein is not merely harmless error.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4019(A)(v), dealing with informal administrative decisions, requires that a party \u201cbe informed, briefly and generally in writing, of the factual basis for an adverse decision____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">As noted above, the trial court relied upon <em>Harrison </em>as a basis for its decision. There the ABC Board had placed time restrictions upon a permit for restaurant operations. Based upon Code \u00a7 2.2\u20144027 and Code \u00a7 2.2-4020, we reversed the agency decision, and remanded the cause to the circuit court, with directions to remand to the agency, because the ABC Board failed to \u201cmake findings of fact to support the restrictions\u201d imposed in the permit as required by Code \u00a7 2.2-4020. 50 Va.App. at 576, 651 S.E.2d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Likewise, in <em>NRV v. Virginia Department of Health, </em>51 Va.App. 514, 535, 659 S.E.2d 527, 537 (2008), we reversed and remanded with directions to remand to the agency for the agency to comply with Code \u00a7 2.2-4020 by explaining the reasons for its departure from its prior precedents. <em>See also Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, </em>5 Va.App. 374, 384, 363 S.E.2d 433, 438 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The statutory requirement for agency explanation of agency decisions was set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196-97, 67 S.Ct. at 1576-77, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">If the administrative action is to be tested upon the basis upon which it purports to rest, that basis must be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable. It will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency\u2019s action; nor can it be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\"><em>See also Massachusetts v. EPA </em>549 U.S. 497, 534, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 1463, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007) (holding the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it \u201coffered no reasonable explanation for its refusal to decide whether greenhouse gases cause or contribute to climate change\u201d); <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 48, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2869, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983) (noting that \u201c[w]e have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given way\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The basis of a decision is the rationale, or <em>ratio decidendi, </em>of that decision. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1262 (6th ed.1990), defines <em>ratio decidendi </em>as \u201cthe ground or reason of the decision.\u201d This Court has defined <em>ratio decidendi </em>as \u201c[t]he essential rationale in the case that determines the judgment.\u201d <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 73-74, 577 S.E.2d 538, 540 (2003). <em>See also Vienna Council v. Kohler, </em>218 Va. 966, 972, 244 S.E.2d 542, 545 (1978) (\u201cThe rationale of the trial court\u2019s decision can be clearly found within its first nine findings of fact.\u201d); <em>Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. Dungee, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>258 Va. 235, 251, 520 S.E.2d 164, 173 (1999) (\u201clanguage in an opinion is meant to provide a rationale for a decision\u201d); <em>City of Virginia Beach v. Harris, </em>259 Va. 220, 231, 523 S.E.2d 239, 245 (2000) (\u201cThe following excerpts from the court\u2019s letter opinion underscore its rationale.\u201d). In <em>Giannoukos v. Virginia Bd. of Medicine, </em>44 Va.App. 694, 699, 607 S.E.2d 136, 138 (2005), referring to the phrase \u201ccase decision\u201d as set forth in Code \u00a7 2.2-4001, we wrote \u201cAt the \u2018heart\u2019 of a case decision \u2018is a fact determination respecting compliance with law.\u2019 <em>Kenley v. Newport News Hosp. </em>Assoc., 227 Va. 39, 44-45, 314 S.E.2d 52, 55 (1984) (quoting reviser\u2019s note D to predecessor statute Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">There were three rationales by which VRS could deny Cirillo\u2019s application pursuant to Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E): They could determine Cirillo was not incapacitated. They could determine Cirillo was incapacitated, but that incapacity was not \u201clikely to be permanent.\u201d They could apply the exception, that is, a pre-existing condition has not \u201cworsened substantially.\u201d Had VRS chosen to explain the basis for its decision, citing one or more of the rationales above, perhaps with short references to specifics in the record, as required by Code \u00a7 2.2-4019, Cirillo, and a reviewing court, would have been \u201c[ijnformed, briefly and generally in writing, of the factual or procedural basis for an adverse decision....\u201d Neither she nor the trial court was so informed. For example, and by contrast, in <em>Johnson, </em>30 Va.App. 104, 515 S.E.2d 784, this Court affirmed a trial court\u2019s decision affirming a VRS denial of benefits sought pursuant to Code \u00a7 51.1-156. We noted in that opinion that \u201cthe Retirement System informed Johnson that \u2018[t]he medical evidence has not proved that your incapacity is likely to be permanent____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109, 515 S.E.2d at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that VRS committed a procedural error of law for failing to adequately comply with the explanatory requirements of Code \u00a7 2.2-4019(A)(v); that is, by failing to provide in writing \u201cthe factual or procedural basis for an adverse decision____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>As quoted above, Code \u00a7 2.2-4027(iii) further requires that any procedural error be \u201cnot mere harmless error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In <em>Jones v. West, </em>46 Va.App. 309, 327, 616 S.E.2d 790, 799 (2005), we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">Although what constitutes \u201cmere harmless error\u201d under the Administrative Process Act is not amenable to precise definition and inevitably requires a case-by-case analysis, it is clear that procedural violations that \u201ccould have had a significant impact on the ultimate decision so as to undermine the \u2018substantiality of the evidential support\u2019 for the factual findings are not mere harmless error\u201d, <em>Virginia Board of Medicine v. Fetta, </em>244 Va. 276, 283, 421 S.E.2d 410, 414 (1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">In <em>J.B. v. Brunty, </em>21 Va.App. 300, 305, 464 S.E.2d 166, 169 (1995), we stated that: \u201c[t]he party seeking review of required agency <em>procedure </em>must demonstrate such failure was <em>not mere harmless eiror. </em>In this case, appellant points to no infringement of his rights, other than claiming his reputation was tainted for a needlessly prolonged time period.\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">More generally, under the doctrine of harmless error, we will affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment when we can conclude that the error at issue could not have affected the court\u2019s result. <em>Blue Stone Land Co. v. Neff, </em>259 Va. 273, 279, 526 S.E.2d 517, 519 (2000); <em>Rhoades v. Painter, </em>234 Va. 20, 24, 360 S.E.2d 174, 176 (1987); <em>see Holmes v. LG Marion Corp., </em>258 Va. 473, 483, 521 S.E.2d 528, 535 (1999); <em>Forbes v. Rapp, </em>269 Va. 374, 382, 611 S.E.2d 592, 597 (2005). <em>See also Monahan v. Obici Medical Mgmt. Services, </em>271 Va. 621, 632 n. 10, 628 S.E.2d 330, 338 n. 10 (2006) (\u201cthis ruling was harmless error as it did not affect the ultimate conclusion\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>We conclude the failure of VRS to inform Cirillo, \u201cbriefly and in writing, of the factual or procedural basis\u201d of the rationale for its decision is not \u201cmere harmless error.\u201d Cirillo could not know on which of the three potential rationales for denial VRS based its decision denying her benefits. Thus, upon her appeal to circuit court, she was denied her right to intelligently marshal facts in the agency record supportive of her position, and that denial could have had, and may in the future have, a significant impact upon a circuit court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Furthermore, the violation of Code \u00a7 2.2-4019(A)(v), by depriving the trial court of the rationale of the administrative decision, impeded that court in application of the substantive evidence rule in reviewing that decision. A circuit court reviews an administrative decision as an appellate court reviews a trial court decision. In <em>Puckett v. Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 574, 579-80, 113 S.E. 853, 854 (1922), the then Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals quoted from <em>Clements v. Hearne, </em>45 Tex. 415 (1876), as follows: \u201c \u2018To require the appellee or the court to hunt through the record for every conceivable error which the court below may have committed ... would obviously be unreasonable and oppressive on the party recovering judgment, and most burdensome on this court, unnecessarily impeding the progress of its business....\u2019\u201d <em>See also Nicholas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>v. Harnsberger, </em>180 Va. 203, 208, 22 S.E.2d 23, 25 (1942); <em>Fitzgerald v. Bass, </em>6 Va.App. 38, 56 n. 7, 366 S.E.2d 615, 625 n. 7 (1988) (\u201cWe do not deem it our function to comb through the record ... in order to ferret-out for ourselves the validity of these claims....\u201d); <em>Mullin v. Mullin, </em>45 Va.App. 289, 306, 610 S.E.2d 331, 339 (2005). As a consequence, Cirillo\u2019s right to an appropriate review by a circuit court was, likewise, compromised by the violation of Code \u00a7 2.2-4019(A)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Finally, this Court has already held, in <em>Harrison, </em>that the failure of an agency to meet the requirements of Code \u00a7 2.2-4020 is not harmless error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">Nevertheless, in order to support the imposition of restrictions on the licenses, the APA required the Board to \u201cbriefly state ... the findings, conclusions, reasons, or basis [for the restrictions] upon the evidence presented by the record and relevant to the basic law under which the agency is operating.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.241020. Failure to make such findings is not harmless error....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\"><em>Harrison, </em>50 Va.App. at 574-75, 651 S.E.2d at 430. \u201c \u2018If those grounds are inadequate or improper, the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis. To do so would propel the court into the domain which [the legislature] has set aside exclusively for the administrative agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 651 S.E.2d at 430 (quoting <em>Chenery, </em>332 U.S. at 196, 67 S.Ct. at 1577). We believe this reasoning applies with equal force to VRS\u2019s failure to comply with Code \u00a7 2.2-4019(A)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Accordingly, that finding of law by the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Nonetheless, the remedy granted by the trial court for this error was not authorized by statute or case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Code \u00a7 2.241029 states in relevant part that when a court has determined an agency has committed an error of law, that court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>may compel agency action unlawfully withheld ... <em>except that the court shall not itself undertake to supply agency action committed by the basic law to the agency. </em>Where ... a case decision is found by the court not to be in accordance with law under \u00a7 2.2-4027, <em>the court shall suspend or set it aside and remand the matter to the agency </em>for further proceedings, if any, as the court may permit or direct in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Here, as noted, the trial court reversed the VRS decision and awarded benefits. Both remedies constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As we stated in <em>Virginia Imports v. Kirin Brewery of America, </em>41 Va.App. 806, 831, 589 S.E.2d 470, 482 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">If a court finds that an agency has failed to comply with statutory authority, \u201cthe court shall suspend or set the decision aside and remand the matter to the agency.\u201d <em>Virginia Bd. of Medicine v. Fetta, </em>244 Va. 276, 280, 421 S.E.2d 410, 412 (1992); Code \u00a7 2.2-4029. Hence, having found in this case that the ABC Board had \u201cfailed to address and rule upon all the issues raised by Kirin with respect to its grounds for termination of the agreement,\u201d the circuit court, rather than imposing its own judgment on the matter, should have suspended the ABC Board\u2019s decision and remanded the matter back to the ABC Board with instructions to make the additional required factual determinations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\"><em>See also Fetta, </em>244 Va. at 280, 421 S.E.2d at 413 (\u201cThe court itself may not undertake the agency action directly.\u201d); <em>NRV, </em>51 Va.App. at 534, 659 S.E.2d at 537; <em>Harrison, </em>50 Va.App. at 575-76, 651 S.E.2d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the trial court reversing the VRS decision and we remand to the trial court with directions to set aside the decision of the VRS and to remand to VRS for compliance with Code \u00a7 2.2-4019(A)(v). We further reverse the decision of the trial court ordering the payment of disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Code \u00a7 2.2^4027 begins: \u201cThe burden shall be upon the party complaining of agency action to designate and demonstrate an error of law subject to review by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Among designated errors of law subject to review is: \u201c(iv) the substantiality of the evidentiary support for findings of fact.\u201d Continuing, the statute expounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">When the error on review is to be made on the agency record, the duty of the court with respect to issues of fact shall be limited to ascertaining whether there was substantial evidence in the agency record upon which the agency as the trier of the facts could reasonably find them to be as it did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Virginia appellate courts have repeatedly and consistently set forth this standard of review for agency factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">In <em>Doctors\u2019 Hospital v. Stroube, </em>52 Va.App. 599, 607, 665 S.E.2d 862, 865-66 (2008), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">Under this standard of review, this Court will reject an. agency\u2019s finding \u2018\u201conly if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tidewater Psychiatric Inst. v.

Dept. of Mines, Minerals &amp; Energy, </em>28 Va.App. 677, 685, 508 S.E.2d 342, 346 (1998) (\u201cThe burden of proof rests upon the party challenging the agency determination to show that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support it.\u201d); <em>Bias, </em>226 Va. at 269, 308 S.E.2d at 125 (\u201cThe phrase \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 refers to \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind <em>might </em>accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v.

This language makes clear that the trial court re-weighed the evidentiary record and applied a preponderance of the evidence standard in reviewing the agency decision, rather than the appropriate substantial evidence standard set forth above.

Code \u00a7 2.2-4020(B) (dealing with formal hearings) contains explanatory requirement language apparently more expansive than that contained in Code \u00a7 2.2-4019(A)(v) (dealing with informal hearings). Pursuant to the former, a decision must \u201cbriefly state ... the findings, conclusions, reasons or basis therefor upon the evidence presented ... and relevant to the basic law under which the agency is operating.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4020(E). <em>Harrison, </em>cited by the trial court in its order, involved a Code \u00a7 2.2-4020 formal hearing. As noted, the trial court signed a statement of facts memorializing that the decision here arose following a Code \u00a7 2.2-4019 informal hearing. Counsel have briefed and argued the matter based on that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Despite the apparently less explanatory language requirement in Code \u00a7 2.2-4019, we find this Court's opinions concerning Code \u00a7 2.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>4020 persuasive because the underlying statutory principle in both is the same: An administrative agency must offer a basis for its decision, understandable to a party and capable of proper review by a court. <em>See Roanoke Memorial Hospitals v. Kenley, </em>3 Va.App. 599, 609, 352 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1987) (\"Whether reviewing the Commissioner's decision as if a formal proceeding had been conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 9-6.14:12 [now Code \u00a7 2.2-4020] or an informal proceeding conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 9-6.14:11 [now Code \u00a7 2.2-4019] the circuit court was required to determine whether the Commissioner had complied with statutory or legal authority in reaching his decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The federal APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 <em>et seq., </em>likewise, has different explanatory requirements for formal and informal proceedings. <em>See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. LTV Corp., </em>496 U.S. 633, 653-56, 110 S.Ct. 2668, 2679-2681, 110 L.Ed.2d 579 (1990), and its progeny. <em>See also </em>Richard J.

Indeed, the line between what is a substantive administrative error and a procedural administrative error is often hard to discern.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Thus, in <em>Browning-Ferris Ind. v. Residents Involved in Saving the Env\u2019t, </em>254 Va. 278, 492 S.E.2d 431 (1997), Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>portion of the Virginia Waste Management Act, required the Director of the Department of Environment Quality, to make an \"explicit finding\u201d that the proposed facility poses \"no substantial present or potential danger to human health or the environment.\u201d The Director did not do so. The issuance of the permit was challenged on the basis that this failure was a violation of Code \u00a7 9\u20146.14:17(ii) (now Code \u00a7 2.24027(H)); that is, agency failure to comply with statutory authority. The Virginia Supreme Court agreed, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">Finally, we disagree with [the] assertion that the Director's failure to make an explicit determination ... was harmless error under Code \u00a7 9\u20146.14:17(iii) [now Code \u00a7 2.2\u20144027(iii) ]. That provision subjects the failure to comply with required <em>procedures </em>to a harmless error analysis. Here, however, the statutory compliance issue involves a substantive provision which is a prerequisite to the issuance of a permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 285, 492 S.E.2d at 435. <em>See also Volkswagen of America v.
