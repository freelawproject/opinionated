Seaborn was convicted of operating a motor vehicle after being adjudged an habitual offender. Code \u00a7 46.2-357. On appeal, he contends the evidence was insufficient to prove he drove on a highway. Concluding that the evidence permitted such a finding, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">\u201cOn appeal, \u201cwe review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">A police officer on patrol observed the defendant driving \u201cin the rear of\u2019 a privately owned apartment complex known as \u201cLondon Oaks.\u201d After determining the defendant\u2019s license plates had expired, the officer stopped him \u201cat 1100 block of Mount Vernon Street.\u201d On smelling alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath, the officer directed the defendant to \u201cgo over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>toward the parking lot and get out of the road\u201d in order to use the parking space line for conducting sobriety tests.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">The officer described the area variously:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201cIt\u2019s a residential area. I mean, you can come through there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">H\u00ed s\u00a1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">\u201cIt\u2019s in a residential apartment complex. You go through there. You can go\u2014people go\u2014through the apartment complex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">* * * <em>% </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">\u201cIt\u2019s an apartment complex. I mean, there\u2019s speed bumps and outlets from High Street, and there is an outlet from Mount Vernon [Street].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">There were no gates and no restrictions on the road. The officer did not know whether there were any no trespassing signs, but he acknowledged that he had \u201ctrespass authorization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">To be found guilty, the defendant must have operated his motor vehicle \u201con the highways of the Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357. \u201cHighway\u201d is defined in Code \u00a7 46.2-100 and has been interpreted to include \" \u2018ways on private property that are open to public use for vehicular travel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 27, 31, 492 S.E.2d 839, 841 (1997) (quoting <em>Kay Management Co. v. Creason, </em>220 Va. 820, 832, 263 S.E.2d 394, 401 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">Two lines of cases have developed from the analysis of whether a private area is a highway under Code \u00a7 46.2-100. In <em>Prillaman v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 401, 100 S.E.2d 4 (1957), the defendant, whose driver\u2019s license was suspended, drove across a service station lot. The Court noted that the premises were open to the public at the owner\u2019s invitation. However, the invitation was for private business purposes and the owner had the absolute right, at any time, to terminate or limit his invitation. He could bar vehicular travel at will and had complete control of the use of his premises. <em>Id. </em>at 407-08, 100 S.E.2d at 8-9. Thus, the Court held the premises were not \u201c \u2018open to the use of the public for the purpose of vehicular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>traffic\u2019 and were, therefore, not a \u2018highway.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408, 100 S.E.2d at 9 (citing former Code \u00a7 46-1(8) (1950)). <em>Accord Flinchum v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 734, 737-38, 485 S.E.2d 630, 631-32 (1997) (finding a parking lot of a sporting goods store was not a highway); <em>Roberts v. Commomvealth, </em>28 Va.App. 401, 404-06, 504 S.E.2d 890, 891-92 (1998) (finding a parking lot of a convenience store was not a highway).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In <em>Kay Management, </em>220 Va. 820, 263 S.E.2d 394, the Court held that the rules of the road applied to the streets of an apartment complex because they were \u201chighways.\u201d Kay serviced and managed the streets at its expense, but posted traffic signs with direction from the police and fire departments. The streets were paved, curbed, and bordered by sidewalks, and they contained painted lines marking spaces for perpendicular parking. The traveled section of the complex was well defined, and a single short paved street provided the only entrance to the complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">No evidence indicated that the streets were restricted to the private use of the apartment dwellers or those persons who visited them, nor that access was denied by security guards, gates, or warning signs. The streets may have been intended for the primary purpose of providing parking areas for apartment tenants, but there was no evidence that they were constructed only for this purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 830, 263 S.E.2d at 400-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The Court concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">[w]e hold that the evidence of accessibility to the public for free and unrestricted use gave rise to a prima facie presumption that the streets of Barcroft View Apartments were highways within the definition of Code \u00a7 46.1-1(10) [currently Code \u00a7 46.2-100]. It thereupon became Kay\u2019s burden to rebut the presumption by showing that the streets were used for vehicular travel exclusively by the owners and those having either express or implied permission from the owners. No such evidence appears in the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 832, 263 S.E.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\"><em>Furman v. Call, </em>234 Va. 437, 439, 362 S.E.2d 709, 710 (1987), again addressed whether an intersection in a condo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>minium parking area was a \u201chighway.\u201d The Court concluded that <em>Kay Management </em>controlled and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">In the present case, the evidence is undisputed that the roads around and in the condominium complex have always been open to the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Access by the public has never been denied by guards, gates, or any other device. The only signs read: \u201cPrivate Property, <em>No Soliciting.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Clearly, the purpose of the signs is to prohibit soliciting, not the entry of motor vehicles operated by members of the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">Because Furman has not rebutted this evidence and the resulting presumption that the public has full and unrestricted access to the parking area, we hold that the area is a \u201chighway\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 46.1-1(10).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 440-41, 862 S.E.2d at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\"><em>Mitchell v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 27, 492 S.E.2d 839 (1997), held that roads within a mobile home complex were \u201chighways.\u201d The roads in the complex, while private, were open for public use. We found \u201cno evidence in this record proved that the streets ... were \u2018restricted exclusively to the private use of the [mobile home] dwellers or those persons who visited them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 492 S.E.2d at 842 (quoting <em>Kay Management, </em>220 Va. at 830, 263 S.E.2d at 401).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The <em>Kay Management </em>line of cases involves private roads within a privately owned complex that were open to the public for vehicular travel. The <em>Prillaman </em>line of cases involves parking lots that allowed access to commercial establishments but were not streets for vehicular travel. The presumption created in <em>Kay Management </em>has no application in parking lot cases. <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Flinchum, </em>both parking lot cases decided after <em>Kay Management, </em>did not discuss that presumption. <em>Roberts, </em>28 Va.App. at 403-06, 504 S.E.2d at 891-92 (discussing <em>Kay Management </em>but not applying its presumption of public use); <em>Flinchum, </em>24 Va.App. at 735-38, 485 S.E.2d at 630-31 (declining to apply the <em>Kay Management </em>presumption of public use).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\"><em>Kay Management </em>controls here. \u201c[E]vidence of accessibility to the public for free and unrestricted use g[i]ve[s] rise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>to a prima facie presumption that the streets of [an apartment complex] [a]re highways[.]\u201d <em>Kay Management, </em>220 Va. at 832, 263 S.E.2d at 402. <em>Cf. Prillaman, </em>199 Va. at 408, 100 S.E.2d at 9 (service station lot not a highway because \u201cthe premises were not open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular traffic\u201d). Even a street within an apartment complex \u201cintended for the primary purpose of providing parking areas for apartment tenants\u201d is a \u201chighway\u201d if there is no evidence it was constructed <em>\u201conly </em>for this purpose.\u201d <em>Kay Management, </em>220 Va. at 830, 263 S.E.2d at 401 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">This case concerns a street within a private residential apartment complex. People traveled through the apartment complex, and there were no gates or restrictions on the road. The officer recalled no traffic signs in the apartment complex but stated that there were \u201cspeed bumps and outlets from High Street, and ... an outlet from Mount Vernon [Street].\u201d From the evidence, the trial court could infer reasonably that the streets in the complex were open to unrestricted public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The Commonwealth established the public\u2019s \u201cfree and unrestricted use\u201d of the street, and no evidence appears in the record that suggests the roads were marked as private or prohibited to public traffic, or that nonresidents driving on the streets had been arrested for trespassing. <em>See Mitchell, </em>26 Va.App. at 29, 492 S.E.2d at 840 (evidence sufficient to prove road in mobile home complex was a highway where no trespassing signs were absent and persons driving through the complex had not been arrested for trespassing). The officer merely stated that this complex was privately owned, rather than a public housing project, and that he had \u201ctrespass authorization.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The issue before us is whether \u201c <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 285, 292, 640 S.E.2d 526, 530 (2007) (quoting <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 7-8, 602 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2004)), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Va. 144, 654 S.E.2d 584, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 284, 172 L.Ed.2d 208 (2008). When faced with a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cwe \u2018presume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u2019 and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u2018plainly wrong or \"without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v.

As an appellate court, we \"must dispose of the case upon the record and cannot base [our] decision upon ... statements of counsel in open court.
