ALSTON, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">Randy Nicholas Pressley (appellant) appeals his jury trial conviction for carjacking in violation of Code \u00a7 18;2-58.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, because the evidence failed to prove the intentional seizure of a motor vehicle by means of \u201cassault or otherwise putting a person in fear of serious bodily harm.\u201d For the reasons stated below, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">\u201cOn review of a challenge to its sufficiency, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below, and grant to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Nolen v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 593, 595, 673 S.E.2d 920, 921 (2009). So viewed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the record shows that on March 12, 2006, the victim, Mohammad Siddique, was employed as a pizza deliveryman by Pizza Boli. That evening, Siddique was delivering a pizza to a Main Street address in Fairfax County. He parked his vehicle, a Nissan Altima, along the side of the road, exited the vehicle, left the pizza in the passenger seat, and walked into the street to confirm the building\u2019s address prior to delivering the pizza. It was dark outside, but the sidewalk was partially lit. As Siddique was returning to his car, Siddique saw appellant, who wore a mask that covered the lower half of his face, leaving his eyes exposed. Appellant asked Siddique if he was the \u201cpizza man.\u201d Siddique denied that he was the pizza deliveryman, because he was \u201ca little afraid\u201d of appellant due to the fact that appellant was wearing a mask.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Siddique walked very quickly toward his car. He had not had the opportunity to open the door when appellant ran toward Siddique \u201cwith a great degree of speed.\u201d Appellant gestured toward Siddique\u2019s shirt, which had Pizza Boli\u2019s logo on it, and stated, \u2018You are the pizza man.\u201d Siddique did not respond, and appellant asked, \u201cWhere is my pizza?\u201d Siddique told appellant the pizza was in the car. Appellant said, \u201cGive me that pizza.\u201d Siddique said that he would give appellant the pizza if appellant moved to the other side of the car. Instead, appellant opened the driver\u2019s side door, leaned into the car, and retrieved the pizza from the passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Appellant then said to Siddique, \u201cGive me money.\u201d Siddique gave appellant all of the money he had in his pocket\u2014 approximately $50 to $70. Siddique testified that he surrendered his money because he was afraid, as appellant was wearing a mask and had already taken Siddique\u2019s pizza.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Next, appellant demanded Siddique\u2019s cellular phone. Siddique lied, and stated that he did not have one. Appellant then demanded Siddique\u2019s car keys. Siddique responded, \u201cWhy should I give you the keys? I\u2019ve given you the pizza. I\u2019ve given you the money?\u201d Two to three times, Siddique refused to give appellant the car keys. He asked appellant to \u201ctake the pizza, take the money, and go.... \u201d In reply, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>appellant said very firmly to Siddique, \u201cHurry up, man, give me the keys.\u201d Siddique then relinquished his keys, because \u201c[appellant] kept asking [Siddique] and [Siddique] was scared.\u201d Throughout the encounter, Siddique believed that appellant \u201ccould do anything,\u201d including assault Siddique, if Siddique did not comply with appellant\u2019s demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Siddique was standing on the sidewalk when appellant drove away in his vehicle. During the entire encounter, appellant directed no explicit threats of serious bodily harm at Siddique, nor did he indicate that he possessed a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The Fairfax County Police Department later found Siddique\u2019s vehicle near the apartment building where appellant\u2019s mother lived. The pizza order that Siddique attempted to deliver had been made from the number belonging to appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s cell phone. When the police inspected the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s apartment, they found a Pizza Boli box; it was the box that Siddique had tried to deliver earlier in the evening. Also, a neoprene mask belonging to appellant was recovered; it was a half-mask that covered the lower half of the wearer\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case at trial, appellant moved to strike the evidence on the grounds that the Commonwealth had not proved that the appellant had the intent to permanently or temporarily deprive Siddique of possession or control of the vehicle by means of assault or otherwise putting Siddique in fear of serious bodily harm, as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1. The court denied the motion. During the argument of the motion, the trial court stated that it found the appellant\u2019s actions to be sufficient to put someone in fear of serious bodily harm: \u201c[Appellant]\u2019s got a mask on. [Appellant] asks [Siddique] for the pizza. [Siddique] says, \u2018I\u2019m not the pizza guy.\u2019 [Appellant] walks away and then comes back at a fast pace and with a mask on. I can\u2019t imagine a more difficult situation.\u201d The trial court then emphasized that it found the mask-wearing and the fact that appellant ran toward Siddique as compelling evidence that he intimidated Siddique.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Appellant renewed his motion to strike at the close of all evidence. The trial court also denied this motion. The jury-convicted the appellant of carjacking, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1. Appellant now appeals that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">A review of the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cinvolves assessment by the courts of whether the evidence adduced at trial could support <em>any </em>rational determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 67, 105 S.Ct. 471, 478, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984) (emphasis added). <em>See also McMillan v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 11, 15, 671 S.E.2d 396, 397 (2009); <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 171, 182, 670 S.E.2d 727, 734 (2009); <em>Clanton v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 561, 566, 673 S.E.2d 904, 906 (2009) <em>(en banc). </em>The judgment of the trial court should be affirmed, \u201c \u2018unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 507, 519, 559 S.E.2d 415, 421 (2002) (quoting <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975)). \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to convict him of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1, which defines the elements of carjacking as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">As used in this section, \u201ccarjacking\u201d means the intentional seizure or seizure of control of a motor vehicle of another with intent to permanently or temporarily deprive another in possession or control of the vehicle of that possession or control by means of partial strangulation, or suffocation, or by striking or beating, or by other violence to the person, or by assault or otherwise putting a person in fear of serious bodily harm, or by the threat or presenting of firearms, or other deadly weapon or instrumentality whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1(B). Appellant contends that there is no evidence that appellant obtained the car keys by assault or by placing Siddique in fear of serious bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In interpreting Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1, this Court has noted that \u201c\u2018[cjarjacking is a species of robbery.\u2019\u201d <em>Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 443, 448, 592 S.E.2d 400, 402 (2004) (quoting <em>Sanchez v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 238, 241, 527 S.E.2d 461, 463 (2000)). Thus, in cases construing Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1, this Court has considered case law involving robbery. <em>See id.; Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 693, 699, 467 S.E.2d 289, 292 (1996). In so doing, this Court has used the term \u201cintimidation\u201d when analyzing the carjacking element requiring a taking \u201cby assault or by otherwise placing a person in fear of serious bodily harm.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>42 Va.App. at 448, 592 S.E.2d at 402 (holding that defendant forced the victim to relinquish possession of her vehicle through violence and intimidation); <em>Bell, </em>21 Va.App. at 699, 467 S.E.2d at 292 (holding that the defendant forced the victim to relinquish her vehicle keys through violence and intimidation).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">Intimidation is defined as \u201cunlawful coercion; extortion; duress; putting in fear.\u201d \u201cTo take or attempt to take, \u2018by intimidation\u2019 means willfully to take, or attempt to take, by putting in fear of bodily harm.\u201d Intimidation results when the words or conduct of the accused exercise such domination and control over the victim as to overcome the victim\u2019s mind and overbear the victim\u2019s will, placing the victim in fear of bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\"><em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, 52 </em>Va.App. 501, 507, 664 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2008) (quoting <em>Bivins v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 750, 752-53, 454 S.E.2d 741, 742 (1995) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASy\">[WJhere the victim\u2019s fear results from the taking itself, the taking is not accomplished through intimidation.... Whether the subjective fear induced by the accused\u2019s actions facilitated the taking or merely resulted from the taking will depend on the facts of the individual case. The intent of the accused, if it is merely to take, while not determinative, is a factor in this calculus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bivins, </em>19 Va.App. at 753-54, 454 S.E.2d at 743) (citations omitted). Where the defendant\u2019s conduct amounts to intimidation or <em>\u201cis reasonably calculated to produce fear,\u201d see United States v. Amos, </em>566 F.2d 899, 901 (4th Cir.1977) (emphasis added), and is concomitant with a taking, the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction for robbery. <em>See Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 253, 256, 105 S.E.2d 149, 151 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Appellant argues that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he took Siddique\u2019s car by means of violence, threat, or putting him in fear of serious bodily harm. Appellant argues that because he obtained the keys through repeated requests for the keys, and, according to appellant, did not commit any violent act or make a threat of violence, appellant did not obtain the vehicle keys through violence or intimidation. Appellant also argues that Siddique\u2019s repeated refusals to relinquish his keys indicated that his will was not overborne by fear of serious bodily injury when he did finally surrender his keys. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u201cThreats of violence or bodily harm are not an indispensable ingredient of intimidation. It is only necessary that the victim actually be put in fear of bodily harm by the willful conduct or words of the accused.\u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 519, 521, 351 S.E.2d 356, 357 (1986) (citing <em>Falden v. Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 549, 554, 189 S.E. 329, 331 (1937)); <em>accord United States v. Gilmore, </em>282 F.3d 398, 403 (6th Cir.2002) (holding that unequivocal written and verbal demands for money to bank tellers were sufficient basis for a finding of intimidation); <em>State v. Edmondson, </em>231 S.W.3d 925 (Tenn.2007) (finding that the defendant knowingly obtained the victim\u2019s keys through intimidation when he approached her on the sidewalk near her car, and stated, \u201cGive me your money and your keys\u201d); <em>Cf. State v. Moore, </em>269 Kan. 27, 4 P.3d 1141 (2000) (holding that the defendant intended to carjack the victim through intimidation, when defendant approached the victim in a remote parking lot at night and demanded her car keys, while two of his acquaintances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>watched the exchange and appeared ready to assist him in taking possession of the victim\u2019s car, and that a reasonable person would not surrender her car keys in the above circumstances unless she was intimidated). The fear of bodily harm, however, must result from the words or conduct of the accused rather than the temperamental timidity of the victim. <em>Harris, </em>3 Va.App. at 521, 351 S.E.2d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Here, appellant created an atmosphere of intimidation. The victim was alone at night on a partially lit street. A man, wearing a mask that obscured the lower half of his face, ran toward the victim -with \u201ca great degree of speed\u201d and demanded his possessions. Using intimidating conduct and words, this same masked man robbed the victim of a pizza and his money.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This atmosphere of intimidation is further underscored by appellant\u2019s persistent efforts to press the victim for his keys, which culminated in appellant\u2019s final firm demand that the victim \u201churry up, ... [and] give [appellant] the keys.\u201d The victim handed over his keys, because he was afraid and believed appellant \u201ccould do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The jury, who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and weigh the evidence, was entitled to infer that the victim surrendered his vehicle because he was intimidated. It was reasonable for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was intimidated after a masked man, a stranger to the victim, demanded the victim give him the pizza, the victim\u2019s money, the victim\u2019s cell phone, and the keys to the-victim\u2019s car. Accordingly, the factfinder was entitled to infer, based upon the totality of the circumstances, that the appellant\u2019s conduct and words exercised such domination and control over the victim as to overcome the victim\u2019s mind and overbear the victim\u2019s will, placing the victim in fear of bodily harm, and inducing him to surrender his vehicle to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Accordingly, appellant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AHZ\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-15\">. Appellant was also convicted of robbery; this conviction is not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\">. As stated previously, the jury found the appellant guilty of robbery, and as such, it is the law of the case that appellant took the pizza and the victim's money by \"intimidation or the threat of serious bodily harm,\u201d as provided in the jury instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
