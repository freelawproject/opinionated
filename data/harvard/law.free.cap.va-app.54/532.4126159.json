Finding no error in the commission\u2019s factfinding or legal reasoning, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">We view the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to \u201cthe prevailing party before the commission.\u201d <em>Dunnavant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>v. Neuman Tire Co., </em>51 Va.App. 252, 255, 656 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Clifton worked for Clifton Cable Contracting, L.L.C., a company he and his wife owned. In July 2006, Clifton was involved in an accident while riding his motorcycle. The accident occurred on a Sunday after dinner. The motorcycle belonged to Clifton, not his company. A firefighter medic was the first responder to the scene. Arriving at 4:51 p.m., the firefighter found Clifton alive but barely so. Clifton was unresponsive and breathing at a rate of about six breaths a minute. Clifton was evacuated by ambulance. He died at 5:39 p.m. at a designated landing zone for an Air Care helicopter.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Chiton\u2019s widow filed a claim for death benefits against Clifton Cable Contracting, L.L.C. At the evidentiary hearing on the claim, Chiton\u2019s widow testified she beheved her husband left after dinner on his motorcycle on a work-related errand, delivering billing statements to the company bookkeeper. No documentary evidence, however, was offered to corroborate this testimony. Nor did the bookkeeper testify in support of this assertion. Clifton\u2019s widow acknowledged that her husband did not typically ride his personal motorcycle for work-related activities. And she also admitted that, at the time of the accident, she \u201creally didn\u2019t know what happened firsthand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">As for the accident itself, no evidence in the record explains how or why it occurred. No witnesses testified about the accident; the operator of the other vehicle was not deposed or put on the stand; and no expert testimony or investigatory findings were admitted into evidence showing either the primary cause of the accident or any of its contributing factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The commission held the preponderance of the evidence did not prove that the accident arose out of and during the course of Clifton\u2019s employment. The commission reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>There were no witnesses to the decedent\u2019s accident and no independent information as to the cause. It is speculation to conclude how the accident occurred. It could have been the result of carelessness, horseplay, mechanical failure, or other multiple possibilities. Even the requirement that the decedent be in the course of his employment is problematical. His widow testified that he did not usually ride his motorcycle in the course of his employment. Although she testified that on the day in question, the decedent was delivering some billing, she could not testify as to what he was doing at the time of the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Despite the weakness of her evidentiary showing, Clifton\u2019s widow argued that the accident was still compensable under the so-called \u201cdeath presumption.\u201d The commission found the death presumption inapplicable and denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">On appeal, Clifton\u2019s widow contends her testimony proved the compensability of the claim as a matter of law and, in any event, the death presumption shifted the burden of proof to the employer to disprove compensability. We disagree with both assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">A. <em>Evidentiary Proof of an Accident Arising 0 ut</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">\n<em>OF AND IN THE COURSE OF THE EMPLOYMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\"> To be compensable, an injury must be \u201cby accident arising out of and in the course of the employment....\u201d Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u00a7 65.2-101. \u201cThe words \u2018arising out of,\u2019 as used in the Act, refer to the origin or cause of the injury while the phrase \u2018in the course of pertains to the time, place and circumstances under which the accident occurred.\u201d <em>Grand Union Co. v. Bynum, </em>226 Va. 140, 143, 307 S.E.2d 456, 458 (1983) (citation omitted). \u201cThe concepts \u2018arising out of and \u2018in the course of employment are not synonymous and both conditions must be proved before compensation will be awarded.\u201d <em>PYA/Monarch &amp; Reliance Ins. Co. v. Harris, </em>22 Va.App. 215, 221, 468 S.E.2d 688, 691 (1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"> \u201cAn injury arises out of one\u2019s employment if there is a causal connection between the injury and the \u2018conditions under which the work is required to be performed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dan River, Inc. v. Giggetts, </em>34 Va.App. 297, 304, 541 S.E.2d 294, 297 (2001) (citation omitted). The condition \u201cmust be peculiar to the work, incidental to the character of the business, and not independent of the master-servant relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>County of Chesterfield v. Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 183-84, 376 S.E.2d 73, 75 (1989)). On the other hand, an accident occurs in the \u201ccourse of employment\u201d when it takes place within the period of employment, at a place where the employee may be reasonably expected to be, and while he is reasonably fulfilling the duties of his employment or is doing something which is reasonably incidental thereto. <em>Conner v. Bragg, </em>203 Va. 204, 208, 123 S.E.2d 393, 396 (1962) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\u201cThe burden of supplying evidence from which the inference can be legitimately drawn that the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment, rests upon the claimant.\u201d <em>Butler v. Nolde Bros., Inc., </em>189 Va. 932, 944, 55 S.E.2d 36, 42 (1949) (quoting <em>Sullivan v. Suffolk Peanut Co., </em>171 Va. 439, 443, 199 S.E. 504, 506 (1938)). \u201cClaimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he has satisfied each requirement.\u201d <em>TBC Corp. v.

S. Tank Trans., Inc., </em>44 Va.App. 725, 738, 607 S.E.2d 730, 734 (2005) (affirming denial of benefits where \u201cclaimant never explained how the hazards of the street caused his injuries, thereby eliminating the possibility of causes totally unrelated to the street risks of employment\u201d). \u201cIt is speculation to conclude how the accident occurred,\u201d the commission held. Clifton\u2019s accident, the commission continued, \u201ccould have been the result of carelessness, horseplay, mechanical failure, or other multiple possibilities.\u201d Some of those causes could have been compensable; others not.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Equally important, the commission found \u201cproblematical\u201d the evidence offered in support of the assertion that Clifton\u2019s motorcycle ride was \u201cin the course of his employment\u201d with Clifton Cable Contracting, L.L.C. The commission noted that Clifton\u2019s widow \u201ctestified that he did not usually ride his motorcycle in the course of his employment.\u201d Her testimony, the commission added, was inconclusive on the critical issue of what her husband specifically \u201cwas doing at the time of the accident.\u201d He could have finished his work-related errand and continued riding for personal pleasure, or he could have abandoned the errand altogether with the intent to come back to it during the next workweek. No witness testified that he dropped off any billing information or that he was expected to do so. Nor were any business records offered into evidence corroborating the assertion that he was on a work-related errand that Sunday evening. <em>Cf. Dreyfus &amp; Co. v. Meade, </em>142 Va. 567, 576, 129 S.E. 336, 339 (1925) (employee\u2019s injury while on a \u201cpersonal errand\u201d about \u201ctwo blocks away\u201d did not occur in the course of the employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Under our standard of review, we defer to the commission\u2019s assessment of the \u201cprobative weight\u201d (or, in this case, the lack of it) of the evidence\u2014recognizing that the commission \u201cis free to adopt that view \u201cwhich is most consistent with reason and justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Georgia-Pac.

We treat the commission\u2019s factfinding as \u201cconclusive and binding,\u201d <em>Berglund Chevrolet v. Landrum, </em>43 Va. App. 742, 749-50, 601 S.E.2d 693, 697 (2004) (quoting Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A)), so long as a \u201creasonable mind could conclude\u201d as the commission did based upon the evidence before it, <em>Perry v. Delisle, </em>46 Va.App. 57, 67, 615 S.E.2d 492, 497 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (emphasis in original and citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[w]here divergent or conflicting inferences reasonably might be drawn from established facts their determination is exclusively for the fact-finding body.\u201d <em>Hopson v.

Pascal, <em>Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 3.03[3][e] (3d ed. 2000 &amp; Supp. 2009). As one early case explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">[W]here an employee <em>is found dead </em>as the result of an accident <em>at his place of work or near-by, </em>where his duties may have called him during the hours of his work, <em>and there is no evidence </em>offered to show what <em>caused </em>the death or <em>to show that he was not engaged in his master\u2019s business at </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>the time, </em>the court will indulge the presumption that the relation of master and servant existed at the time of the accident and that it arose out of and in the course of his employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><em>S. Motor Lines Co. v. Alvis, </em>200 Va. 168, 171-72, 104 S.E.2d 735, 738 (1958) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added); <em>see also Sullivan, </em>171 Va. at 447-48, 199 S.E. at 507-08; <em>Boys &amp; Girls Club of Va. v. Marshall, </em>37 Va.App. 83, 88, 554 S.E.2d 104, 106 (2001); <em>Thomas Nelson Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Fritz, </em>11 Va.App. 269, 273, 397 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">This presumption, however, remains limited to its \u201coriginal parameters.\u201d <em>K &amp; G Abatement Co. v. Keil, </em>38 Va.App. 744, 758, 568 S.E.2d 416, 423 (2002). It applies only to cases where the employee is \u201cfound dead ... at his place of work or nearby,\u201d <em>Alvis, </em>200 Va. at 171, 104 S.E.2d at 738, and, even then, only when no plausible inference suggests the accident might be noncompensable, <em>see Baggett Transp., </em>219 Va. at 644, 248 S.E.2d at 825 (holding the \u201coccupation as a truck driver\u201d did not subject employee to the risk of \u201cbeing shot\u201d while \u201calongside a public highway\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The factual \u201ccircumstances which form the basis of the presumption must be of sufficient strength from which the <em>only rational inference </em>to be drawn is that death arose <em>out of </em>and <em>in the course of </em>the employment.\u201d <em>Hopson, </em>187 Va. at 305, 46 S.E.2d at 395 (emphasis added). There must be \u201can absence of contrary or conflicting evidence on the point.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Baggett Transp., </em>219 Va. at 644, 248 S.E.2d at 826. When \u201cconflicting inferences might logically be drawn from the circumstances,\u201d and the evidence supports a permissible inference that \u201cthere was no causal relationship between the death and the employment, the presumption [is] not applicable.\u201d <em>Metcalf v. A.M. Express Moving, </em>230 Va. 464, 470, 339 S.E.2d 177, 181 (1986). Thus, \u201cno presumption can be said to arise\u201d when the accident occurred \u201coutside the decedent\u2019s regular working hours\u201d and it is doubtful whether he was \u201cactually on the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Butler, </em>189 Va. at 944-45, 55 S.E.2d at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>This extrastatutory death presumption cannot be broadened beyond its fixed parameters. Making a \u201cchange in the parameters\u201d of the death presumption, we have cautioned, \u201cis a policy decision to be made, if at all, by the General Assembly.\u201d <em>K &amp; G Abatement, 38 </em>Va.App. at 757, 568 S.E.2d at 422 (citing <em>Pinkerton's, Inc. v. Helmes, </em>242 Va. 378, 381, 410 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1991)). Since its creation in the courts a half a century ago, \u201cthe General Assembly has not chosen to expand the presumption beyond its original parameters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758, 568 S.E.2d at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, the commission did not err in finding the death presumption inapplicable. The firefighter medic did not find Clifton at his \u201cplace of work or near-by,\u201d <em>Alvis, </em>200 Va. at 171, 104 S.E.2d at 738, but rather on a public highway.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And his widow\u2019s testimony\u2014 which the commission found \u201cproblematical\u201d\u2014was not convincing enough to render implausible the possibility of noncompensable causes of the accident wholly outside the course of Clifton\u2019s employment. <em>See Butler, </em>189 Va. at 945, 55 S.E.2d at 42 (finding widow\u2019s testimony regarding decedent\u2019s work-related errand not dispositive). Thus, it cannot be said that \u201cthe circumstances which form the basis of the presumption\u201d were of \u201csufficient strength from which the <em>only </em>rational inference to be drawn is that death arose out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Metcalf, </em>230 Va. at 469, 339 S.E.2d at 180 (quoting <em>Baggett Transp., </em>219 Va. at 642, 248 S.E.2d at 824 (quoting in turn <em>Hopson, </em>187 Va. at 305, 46 S.E.2d at 395)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Finding no error in the commission\u2019s factfinding or its reasons for not applying the death presumption, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">. The deputy commissioner refused to accept the police report \"as an exhibit in the matter\u201d for the purpose of speculating \"as to how [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>accident] occurred or why it occurred.\u201d In a reconsideration order, the commission accepted it \u201cfor the limited purpose of showing that there was an accident involving the decedent\u201d and held it had \u201cno probative value as to how or why the accident occurred.\u201d We treat this ruling as the law of the case since the claimant did not challenge it on appeal. <em>See Little v. Cooke, </em>274 Va. 697, 722, 652 S.E.2d 129, 144 (2007) (holdings uncontested on appeal become \"the law of the case\u201d); <em>Lockheed Info. Mgmt. Sys. Co. v.

See <em>Perry, </em>46 Va.App. at 67, 615 S.E.2d at 497.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">. We have not overlooked the claimant's citation to <em>Marketing Profiles, Inc. v. Hill, </em>17 Va.App. 431, 437 S.E.2d 727 (1993) <em>(en </em>banc), a case in which we affirmed the commission's finding that an employee's vehicular accident arose out of and in the course of the employment. The appellate issue in that case, however, was whether the claimant's proof was <em>sufficient </em>for the commission\u2019s findings\u2014that is, whether the claimant\u2019s evidence established a <em>prima facie </em>case. We held it did. Here, however, the factfinder found the evidence wanting. The issue for us is whether the evidence preponderates so strongly that no rational factfinder could resist it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">. Clifton Cable Contracting, L.L.C. also argues that Clifton, while mortally wounded, was not dead when discovered by the firefighter medic after the accident.
