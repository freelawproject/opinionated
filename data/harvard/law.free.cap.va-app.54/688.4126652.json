On appeal, Paiz contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>motion to vacate his convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 because the evidence proved that he did not actually use a firearm and the mere fact that he was a member of a mob does not render him vicariously responsible for that crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we agree with Paiz and reverse his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the prevailing party below, the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578- S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003), and we grant to that party all fair inferences flowing therefrom. <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 19, 21, 660 S.E.2d 687, 688 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Ishmael Paiz was a member of a gang named MS-13. Julio Bonilla and Geovany Silva-Lopez, the victims in this case, were both members of a rival gang named SSL, which is an abbreviation for South Side Locos. MS-13 and SSL have a history of violence ranging from leaving threatening notes to committing assault, battery, and homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">On April 27, 2006, Paiz went to a soccer game with Juan Pablo Salamanca Rodriguez, Hector Rodriguez, and Felipe Salamanca Rodriguez. All were members of MS-13. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>soccer game, members of SSL stared at Juan Pablo and Juan Pablo stared back. This stare-down began a deadly altercation between MS-13 and SSL.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">After the soccer game, Paiz drove Juan Pablo, Hector, and Felipe Rodriguez to a parking lot outside Arlington Mills Center Mall. According to the testimony, everyone in the car knew that Juan Pablo had a gun and that he \u201cmight use it\u201d that day. When they arrived at Arlington Mills Center Mall, Paiz looked to his right while he was at a red traffic light and he saw a SSL member lean out of a black car and \u201cthrow up a [SSL] hand sign.\u201d Paiz drove through the intersection and pulled over. The driver of the black car pulled out of the mall parking lot and passed Paiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In a statement to police, Paiz said that Juan Pablo intended to fight the driver of the black car, but acknowledged that if other members of SSL joined the fight, then the other members of MS-13 would also join. As Paiz was driving, he slowed down and Juan Pablo got out of the car, screamed \u201cMara Salvatrueha\u201d\u2014which is what MS represents in the gang\u2019s name\u2014fired several shots, came back to the car, and told Paiz, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Paiz left the scene and then he took Felipe home, took Hector home, dropped Juan Pablo off, and drove himself home. The shots fired by Juan Pablo killed Julio Bonilla and seriously injured Geovany Silva-Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Paiz was indicted for murder by lynching (Code \u00a7 18.2-40) and aggravated malicious wounding by mob (Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-42.1 and 18.2-51.2). In addition, he was indicted for using a firearm in the commission of murder and using a firearm in the commission of aggravated malicious wounding. After the trial commenced, the Commonwealth amended both indictments to include an allegation that the crimes occurred while Paiz was a member of a mob. As to each offense, the trial court instructed the jury that the Commonwealth had to prove the following elements of the offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">(1) That a firearm was displayed in a threatening manner, used or there was an attempt to use it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>(2) That the display, use or attempted use of the firearm was while committing or attempting to commit [murder and malicious wounding by mob]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">(3) That the use of the firearm was done by a member of the mob; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">(4) That the defendant was a member of the mob.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The trial court further instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">[o]nce the group assembled comprises a mob, every person composing the mob becomes criminally culpable even though the member may not have actively encouraged, aided, or countenanced the act. Criminal accountability flows from being a member of a mob, regardless of whether the member aids or abets in ... act of violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">The jury found Paiz guilty of both offenses. He subsequently moved the trial court to vacate the jury\u2019s verdicts on both use of firearm convictions and to dismiss those charges. The trial court denied Paiz\u2019s motion. Paiz appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Paiz does not challenge in this appeal his conviction for the underlying offenses of lynching or malicious wounding by mob. Nor does he challenge whether he was a member of a mob as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-38. Rather, he challenges his convictions for using a firearm during the commission of murder and using a firearm during the commission of malicious wounding by mob, both in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Paiz argues, and the record supports, that he did not actually use the firearm in the commission of either predicate offense. He reasons that, under the mob theory of collective responsibility, he can only be convicted of an offense committed by some other member of the mob if that offense is an act of violence as defined in Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1. Because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is not included in Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, Paiz concludes that he has no criminal responsibility for the firearm offenses committed by another member of the mob simply because he too was a member of that mob. Thus, the question before us is whether Article 2, Chapter 4, Title 18.2 of the Code of Virginia supplies a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>basis for his convictions of use of a firearm during the commission of murder and malicious wounding by mob when he did not personally use or attempt to use a firearm, or display it in a threatening manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">We consider the issue on appeal one of statutory interpretation, which \u201cpresents a pure question of law subject to de novo review.\u201d <em>Torloni v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 261, 267, 645 S.E.2d 487, 490 (2007) (citing <em>Boynton v. Kilgore, </em>271 Va. 220, 227, 623 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2006)). When statutory language is clear and unambiguous, \u201c[c]ourts are bound by the plain meaning of statutory language.\u201d <em>Hicks v. Mellis, </em>275 Va. 213, 218, 657 S.E.2d 142, 144 (2008). In interpreting the plain meaning of the statute, we strive to \u201c \u2018adopt that sense of the words which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objects of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tyszcenko v. Donatelli, </em>53 Va.App. 209, 216, 670 S.E.2d 49, 53 (2008) (quoting <em>Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 390, 394, 624 S.E.2d 108, 110 (2006)). All statutes on the same subject matter, i.e., those standing <em>in pari materia, </em>must be considered together and harmonized if possible. <em>Lambert v. Barrett, </em>115 Va. 136, 78 S.E. 586 (1913). Further, because Code \u00a7 18.2-42.1 is penal in nature, we must strictly construe the statute in a manner that favors Paiz. <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979). This maxim of appellate review, however, does not \u201centitle[ ] [Paiz] to a favorable result based upon an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Wesley v. Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 268, 275-76, 56 S.E.2d 362, 365 (1949)).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 criminalizes the use, attempted use, and display of a firearm in the commission of a laundry list of felonies including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\"><em>murder, </em>rape, forcible sodomy, inanimate or animate object sexual penetration as defined in \u00a7 18.2-67.2, robbery, carjacking, burglary, malicious wounding as defined in \u00a7 18.2-51, malicious bodily injury to a law-enforcement officer as defined in \u00a7 18.2-51.1, aggravated malicious wounding as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>defined in \u00a7 18.2-51.2, <em>malicious wounding by mob </em>as defined in \u00a7 18.2-41 or abduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The crime of \u201cmurder by mob\u201d is not specifically mentioned in that list of felonies because, technically, the proper term describing that crime is \u201clynching.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-39 and 18.2-40. \u201cMurder by mob\u201d is a shorthand description of both Code \u00a7 18.2-39, which defines lynching, and Code \u00a7 18.2-40, which deems every lynching a murder. However, because lynching is a form of murder, and murder is a listed offense in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, it is included as one of the predicate felonies mentioned in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. <em>See Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405 (1990). \u201c[M]alicious wounding by mob as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-41\u201d is specifically listed as a predicate offense. Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Therefore, it is clear that the offenses for which Paiz was convicted\u2014lynching and malicious wounding by mob\u2014are predicate offenses under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Proof that Paiz committed one of the named predicate offenses, however, is not sufficient to support a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. It is also necessary to prove that <em>\u201che </em>used or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner, while committing or attempting to commit ... one of the ... specified felonies.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 218, 441 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1994) (emphasis added). It is a well established principle of law that \u201c[a] principal in the first degree is the actual perpetrator of the crime.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 370, 372, 157 S.E.2d 907, 909 (1967). Here, Juan Pablo, the one who actually possessed and used the firearm, was the principal in the first degree to the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">However, one need not actually possess a firearm in order to be convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. If the accused did not actually hold or possess the firearm, he may \u201cnevertheless be convicted as a principal in the second degree of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony where he acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>in concert with the gunman.\u201d <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 122, 125, 348 S.E.2d 265, 267 (1986); <em>Cortner v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 557, 281 S.E.2d 908 (1981). Thus, as with almost every other felony, an accused could be convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 under the principal-in-the-first-degree, principal-in-the-second-degree, accessory-before-the-fact, or concert-of-action theories. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-18; <em>Carter, </em>232 Va. at 125, 348 S.E.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">In this case, the Commonwealth did not present any of these theories of vicarious responsibility to the jury. Rather, it elected to present this case to the jury on the theory that Paiz was a member of a mob and that another member of the mob used the firearm in the commission of a listed felony. Therefore, we must limit our review to whether this legal theory permits collective responsibility for this particular crime and we will not consider whether the evidence supports his conviction under some other vicarious responsibility theory. <em>See Carter, </em>232 Va. at 125, 348 S.E.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Virginia\u2019s statutes extending criminal responsibility for offenses committed by a member of a mob to other members of that mob are set out in Article 2, Chapter 4, Title 18.2 of the Code of Virginia. Code \u00a7 18.2-38 defines a mob as \u201c[a]ny collection of people, assembled for the purpose and with the intention of committing ... an act of violence as defined in \u00a7 19.2-297.1, without authority of law....\u201d\u2019 Article 2 establishes two specific mob related felonies: (1) lynching, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-39 and 18.2-40, and (2) malicious or unlawful wounding by mob, Code \u00a7 18.2-41. A mob is guilty of lynching if the mob directs an act of violence toward some person, and that person dies as a result of that act of violence. Code \u00a7 18.2-39. \u201cEvery lynching shall be deemed murder,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny and every person composing a mob and any and every accessory thereto, by which any person is lynched, shall be guilty of murder, and upon conviction shall be punished as provided in Article 1 (\u00a7 18.2-30 et seq.) of this chapter.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-40.Code \u00a7 18.2-41 states that \u201c[a]ny and every person composing a mob which shall maliciously or unlawfully ... wound any person, or by any means cause him bodily injury with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>intent to maim, disable, disfigure or kill him, shall be guilty of a Class 3 felony.\u201d The use of the word \u201cwhich\u201d in these statutes indicates that the mob is the criminal actor. In other words, the statute imposes \u201cindividual liability based on collective act and intent.\u201d Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Virginia Practice: Criminal Offenses and Defenses </em>523 (2008-2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">However, this criminal responsibility does not extend to all crimes. Originally, Article 2 made members of a mob collectively responsible for only three crimes: simple assault and battery, Code \u00a7 18.2-42; malicious wounding by mob, Code \u00a7 18.2-41; and lynching, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-39 and 18.2-40. <em>See Harrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680 (1990) (stating that \u201ccriminal accountability flows from being a member of a mob\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-42 for the crime of simple assault and battery). In 1999, the General Assembly expanded Article 2 by enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-42.1, which established additional, but still limited, collective criminal responsibility to members of a mob. That statute provides that \u201c[a]ny and every person composing a mob <em>which </em>commits an act of violence as defined in \u00a7 19.2-297.1 <em>shall be guilty of that act of violence </em>and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided in the section of this title which makes that act of violence unlawful.\u201d (Emphasis added). An act of violence includes: first and second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, mob-related felonies under Article 2, any kidnapping or abduction felony, any malicious felonious assault or malicious bodily wounding, robbery and carjacking, certain felony criminal sexual assault offenses, or certain arson offenses. Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1. Thus, this collective responsibility theory is limited to these enumerated acts of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Therefore, it is only when one member of a mob commits one of the crimes enumerated in Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-39 to 18.2-42.1 that all members of the mob can be held collectively responsible solely because of their mob membership. Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, use of a firearm in the commission of murder or malicious wounding, is not a crime of violence enumerated in Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, as incorporated in Code \u00a7 18.2-42.1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Therefore, the plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-42.1 requires us to hold that Paiz, who did not use or possess the firearm, cannot be held criminally responsible for that offense simply because he was a member of the mob that committed the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Nonetheless, the Commonwealth notes that Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 includes both malicious wounding and malicious wounding by mob in the list of predicate offenses. It argues that the actual gunman would always be subject to prosecution for use of a firearm in the commission of malicious wounding. Therefore, the Commonwealth reasons, the General Assembly must have intended to hold every person in the mob responsible for the use of a firearm in the commission of malicious wounding by mob. To conclude otherwise, it argues, would render the reference to malicious wounding by mob meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">However, we note that malicious wounding by mob, as set out in Code \u00a7 18.2-41, is a different offense from malicious wounding as codified in Code \u00a7 18.2-51. Malicious wounding by mob does not require the Commonwealth to prove malice because it defines the crime as \u201cmaliciously or unlawfully [wounding] any person ... with intent to maim, disable, disfigure or kill him....\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-41. The disjunctive term \u201cor,\u201d which separates the terms \u201cmaliciously\u201d and \u201cunlawfully,\u201d indicates that Code \u00a7 18.2-41 only requires proof that the wounding was unlawful. Code \u00a7 18.2-41 therefore criminalizes different conduct from malicious wounding under Code \u00a7 18.2-51. Thus, the General Assembly had to make specific reference to \u00a7 18.2-41 in order to include it as a predicate offense in the use of a firearm statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Even though Paiz was a member of a mob, we hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-42.1 does not render him criminally responsible for using a firearm in the commission of lynching and using a firearm in the commission of malicious wounding by mob simply because of that membership. Because of this we conclude that the trial court erred in denying Paiz\u2019s motion to vacate the jury verdicts and dismiss the charges. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>we reverse and dismiss Paiz\u2019s convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\">. Paiz was originally charged with aggravated malicious wounding under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-42.1 and 18.2-51.2. The jury convicted him of the lesser-included offense of malicious wounding by mob in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-41. The trial court sentenced Paiz to five years for malicious wounding by mob, which is a Class 3 felony punishable by five to twenty years. However, the sentencing order incorrectly listed Code \u00a7 18.2\u201451.2, which is a Class 2 felony punishable by twenty years to life, as the code section under which Paiz was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-9\">. Paiz's question presented states as follows: \u201cDid the trial court err in failing to vacate the two convictions for use of a firearm in the commission of both murder by mob and malicious wounding by mob, as a member of a mob, because such crimes do not exist?\u201d While this question presented does not precisely frame the issue as one of sufficiency, Paiz's argument clearly does. While adherence to some rules of court are jurisdictional, \u201cthe requirements of Rule 5A: 12(c) ... have been expressly held to be not jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Jay v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 510, 517-20, 659 S.E.2d 311, 315-17 (2008). Here, the defense attorney and the assistant Commonwealth\u2019s attorney both argued the issue of sufficiency at the hearing on Paiz's motion to vacate and the trial judge ruled on it. Further, the Attorney General did not object to the scope of the question presented and, in fact, argued the sufficiency issue on brief and at oral argument. Therefore, we conclude that appellant\u2019s failure to adhere strictly to Rule 5A: 12(c) \u201cis insignificant, [and not] so substantial as to preclude the court\u2019s addressing the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 747, 753, 668 S.E.2d 150, 154 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
