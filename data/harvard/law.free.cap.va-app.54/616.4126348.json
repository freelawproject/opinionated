McNamara (employer) appeals from a decision of the Prince William County Circuit Court affirming the determination of the Virginia Employment Commission (the commission) that Jeffrey W. Joerger (claimant) was entitled to unemployment benefits. On appeal, McNamara contends the circuit court erroneously concluded the commission\u2019s factual findings were supported by the evidence. We hold the circuit court did not err in concluding credible evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s finding. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Employer, a workers\u2019 compensation attorney operating her own law firm as a sole proprietor, hired claimant as an assistant paralegal on October 24, 2006. She terminated claimant\u2019s employment on February 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Claimant filed a claim for unemployment benefits with the commission. Employer disputed the claim, contending she discharged claimant for misconduct connected with his work. Following a telephonic fact-finding conference, a commission deputy determined claimant\u2019s deficiencies in job performance did not rise to the level of misconduct and held claimant was entitled to unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Employer appealed the deputy\u2019s determination to an appeals examiner, who conducted a hearing at which employer and claimant testified. Employer indicated claimant portrayed himself as an experienced office worker and paralegal and that, although she \u201csaw that he was ... capable of performing the job\u201d for short periods of time, he was not consistent, completed his assigned tasks in a timely fashion only when she \u201cstay[ed] on top of him,\u201d and never completed some of the tasks on his original \u201cto-do\u201d list. Claimant said he performed his job to the best of his ability and that he was not aware until six days before he was terminated that employer was dissatisfied with his work product or level of productivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The appeals examiner issued a written decision in which she recognized that employer bore the burden of proving misconduct and concluded she had done so. The appeals examiner found that claimant failed to complete tasks in the manner he had been trained to do, despite appropriate guidance and warnings. The appeals examiner concluded this evidence, coupled with claimant\u2019s admissions that he did not record and log certain costs as he had been trained to do, \u201cclearly demonstrates a willful disregard for the employer\u2019s business interests, thus amounting to misconduct.\u201d She concluded \u201cclaimant could do much of the work\u201d and that he \u201csimply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>chose not to.\u201d Based on these findings, the appeals examiner held claimant was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Claimant appealed to the commission, which appointed a special examiner<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to hear oral argument and receive written submissions from the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The special examiner, on behalf of the commission, ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">The Commission rejects the testimony of the employer to the effect that she informed the claimant before he had worked as much as a month that she wanted to terminate him and that he had begged so hard for his job that she agreed to place him on three month\u2019s [sic] probation which he had subsequently failed so as to bring about his termination. Not only did the claimant specifically deny ever being told this, but the fact that he received a Christmas bonus with a note indicating that it was for a job well done runs counter to the employer\u2019s contentions in this regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">This employer has not made out a prima facie case that the claimant deliberately or willfully violated any rules or standards of behavior expected of him as an employee. Instead, the most that has been proven is that he was guilty of poor performance or errors in judgment which would not be sufficient to constitute misconduct in connection with work. While the commission takes no issue with the employer\u2019s decision to terminate the claimant due to his inability to pick up procedures on his own and do the necessary multi-tasking required in a solo practice law office, he should not be disqualified for benefits as a result of his separation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Employer filed a petition for review in the circuit court, contending the commission should have deferred to the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>peals examiner\u2019s credibility determinations and held claimant was discharged for behavior amounting to willful misconduct. The circuit court held that although \u201c[mjultiple complaints by the employer about Claimant\u2019s performance appear to be justified,\u201d the evidence supported the commission\u2019s finding that employer \u201cfailed to present sufficient evidence ... to make a prima facie showing that she discharged [claimant] for misconduct connected with his work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Employer noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Employer\u2019s challenge to the award of benefits turns largely upon the commission\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the evidence. She contends the commission arbitrarily disregarded the credibility determinations of the appeals examiner, who heard the witnesses testify, and that the commission was not authorized to do so. She also argues one of the commission\u2019s specific factual findings is not supported by the evidence and that the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the commission\u2019s decision failed to recognize this fact. In part as a result of these errors, she avers the commission and circuit court erred in concluding she did not meet her burden of presenting a <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct. Finally, she contends claimant failed to rebut her evidence of misconduct and that the commission should have held claimant was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">FACTUAL FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">In the course of an appeal of a commission decision to the circuit court or this Court, \u201cthe findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive.\u201d Code \u00a7 60.2-625(A). \u201c[T]he commission is charged with the responsibility of resolving [both] questions ... of controverted facts\u201d and \u201cquestions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>of credibility.\u201d <em>Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n v. Gantt, </em>7 Va.App. 631, 635, 376 S.E.2d 808, 811, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>9 Va.App. 225, 385 S.E.2d 247 (1989) (adopting panel decision as written). If the commission\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence, they are binding on appeal. <em>Kennedy\u2019s Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>14 Va.App. 701, 704, 419 S.E.2d 278, 280 (1992). \u201cWhether an employee\u2019s behavior constituted misconduct ... is a mixed question of law and fact .... \u201d <em>Israel v. Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>7 Va.App. 169, 172, 372 S.E.2d 207, 209 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">At issue in this case is the degree of deference the commission owes to its appeals examiner\u2019s determinations of witness credibility. We have not previously addressed this question in a published decision. In the workers\u2019 compensation context, established principles provide that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission is not bound by a deputy commissioner\u2019s prior findings on questions of witness credibility. <em>Bullion Hollow Enters., Inc. v. Lane, </em>14 Va.App. 725, 729-30, 418 S.E.2d 904, 907 (1992) (citing <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, </em>5 Va.App. 374, 382, 363 S.E.2d 433, 437 (1987)). In first enunciating this standard, we noted the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission has statutory authority to hear a case <em>de novo </em>and that, under such circumstances, it is not bound by the credibility determinations or other factual findings of the deputy. <em>Pierce, </em>5 Va.App. at 382-83, 363 S.E.2d at 437-38 (quoting former Code \u00a7 65.1-97, now Code \u00a7 65.2-705, which provides that upon an application for review of the decision of a deputy, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission \u201c \u2018shall review the evidence or, if deemed advisable, ... <em>hear the parties at issue, their representatives and witnesses\u2019 </em>\u201d). From this statutory authority, we reasoned that when the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission opts to conduct a review on the record without hearing evidence, it must explain any credibility determinations it makes that are contrary to the deputy\u2019s only if the deputy \u201cma[de] an explicit finding of credibility based upon a witness\u2019 demeanor or appearance at the hearing.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>14 Va.App. at 728, 418 S.E.2d at 907. We expressly held that, \u201c[a]bsent a specific, recorded observation [by the deputy] regarding the behavior, demeanor or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>appearance of [a particular witness], the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission] ha[s] no duty to explain its reasons for finding [one witness] more credible than [another].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729, 418 S.E.2d at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Just as in the workers\u2019 compensation context, the statute governing the Employment Commission\u2019s review of an appeals examiner\u2019s decision provides that the commission may \u201creceive [additional] evidence itself,\u201d Code \u00a7 60.2-622(A), thereby permitting <em>de novo </em>review. Accordingly, we now hold that, just as in matters before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, <em>see Lane, </em>14 Va.App. at 729-30, 418 S.E.2d at 907, the Employment Commission is not bound by the appeals examiner\u2019s prior findings on questions of witness credibility. In this context, as in that one, we hold the commission must explain any credibility determinations it makes that are contrary to the appeals examiner\u2019s only if the appeals examiner \u201cma[de] an explicit finding of credibility based upon a witness\u2019 demeanor or appearance at the hearing.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 728, 418 S.E.2d at 907. <em>\u201cAbsent a specific, recorded observation [by the appeals examiner] regarding the behavior, demeanor or appearance of [a particular witness], </em>the commission ha[s] no duty to explain its reasons for finding [that witness] more credible than [another].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729, 418 S.E.2d at 907 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Applying these principles to a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">review of the [appeals examiner\u2019s] decision [here], we find no \u201cspecific, recorded observation\u201d concerning any witness\u2019 demeanor or appearance insofar as it relates to a credibility determination. Although [the appeals examiner\u2019s] decision [was] based ... upon [her acceptance of the testimony of employer over claimant], that decision does not set forth a credibility determination formed by observing [either] witness\u2019 demeanor or appearance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\"><em>Id. </em>Because the commission\u2019s determination regarding the witness\u2019 credibility was not plainly wrong, the circuit court did not err in upholding the commission\u2019s decision to credit claimant\u2019s testimony over employer\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>We also conclude, given the applicable standard of review on appeal, that the commission\u2019s finding that claimant \u201creceived a Christmas bonus with a note indicating ... it was for a job well done\u201d is supported by the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commission\u2019s written decision expressly found as a fact that claimant \u201creceived a $200 Christmas bonus with a note thanking him for his help\u201d and cited Exhibit 9 in support of this finding. Exhibit 9 confirms the note accompanying the bonus check read, \u201cThank you for your help.\u201d Under settled principles, a fact finder is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. <em>See Bros. Constr. Co. v. Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>26 Va.App. 286, 296, 494 S.E.2d 478, 483 (1998); <em>see also Hawks v. Henrico County Sch. Bd., </em>7 Va.App. 398, 404, 374 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1988). The statement, \u201cThank you for your help,\u201d implies that at least some portion of claimant\u2019s job was \u201cwell done,\u201d and employer conceded as much when she testified that claimant successfully worked with two difficult clients over the phone and was able to complete his paperwork in a timely fashion for short periods of time. We hold the commission\u2019s statement that the check was for \u201ca job well done,\u201d after its express finding that the note accompanying the check said, \u201cThank you for your help,\u201d constituted a reasonable inference from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\"><em>PRIMA FACIE </em>CASE AND THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">An employee shall be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits \u201cif the Commission finds such individual is unemployed because he has been discharged for misconduct connected with his work.\u201d Code \u00a7 60.2-618. Manifestly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>only behavior known to the employer at the time of the discharge may serve as a basis for a finding of misconduct \u201cresulting in the employee\u2019s discharge.\u201d <em>See Whitt v. Ervin B. Davis &amp; Co., Inc., </em>20 Va.App. 432, 437, 457 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1995); <em>see also Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 554, 558, 322 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1984) (noting <em>\u201c </em>\u2018a man cannot be influenced or moved to act by a fact or circumstance of which he is ignorant\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Mullins v. Commonwealth, </em>113 Va. 787, 789-90, 75 S.E. 193, 195 (1912))). Under settled principles,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdC\">an employee is guilty of \u201cmisconduct connected with his work\u201d when he deliberately violates a company rule reasonably designed to protect the legitimate business interests of his employer, or when his acts or omissions are of such a nature or so recurrent as to manifest a willful disregard of those interests and the duties and obligations he owes his employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><em>Branch v. Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>219 Va. 609, 611, 249 S.E.2d 180, 182 (1978). The parties agree that only the second prong of <em>Branch\u2019s </em>\u201cmisconduct\u201d definition is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">\u201c[A] continuing recurrence of ... violations over a period of time [may] clearly establish ] ... a deliberate and willful misconduct.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Hurst Harvey Oil, Inc., </em>12 Va.App. 936, 940, 407 S.E.2d 352, 354 (1991); <em>see Helmick v. Martinsville-Henry County Econ. Dev. Corp., </em>14 Va.App. 853, 421 S.E.2d 23 (1992); <em>Britt v. Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>14 Va.App. 982, 420 S.E.2d 522 (1992). However, the term \u201c \u2018 \u201cmisconduct\u201d should not be so literally construed as to effect a forfeiture of benefits by an employee except in clear instances; rather, the term should be construed in a manner least favorable to working a forfeiture so as to minimize the penal character of the provision ....\u2019\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>14 Va.App. at 707-OS, 419 S.E.2d at 282 (quoting 76 Am.Jur.2d <em>Unemployment Compensation </em>\u00a7 77 (1992)). \u201cAlthough it certainly may justify an employee\u2019s discharge, behavior which is involuntary, unintentional or the product of simple negligence does not rise to the level necessary to justify a denial of unemployment benefits.\u201d <em>Borbas v. Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>17 Va.App. 720, 722, 440 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>If an employer presents <em>prima facie </em>evidence of misconduct, the burden shifts to the claimant to prove \u201ccircumstances in mitigation of such conduct.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>219 Va. at 611-12, 249 S.E.2d at 182. \u201cMitigating circumstances are likely to be those considerations which establish that the employee\u2019s actions were not in disregard of [the employer\u2019s] interests. Evidence of mitigation may appear in many forms which, singly or in combination, to some degree explain or justify the employee\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Gantt, </em>7 Va.App. at 635, 376 S.E.2d at 811. Absent proof of circumstances in mitigation, established to the satisfaction of the fact finder, the employee is \u201cdisqualified for benefits.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>219 Va. at 611-12, 249 S.E.2d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Employer contends both that she presented a <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct and that the weight of the evidence in fact proved misconduct. The commission, by counsel, contends employer did not present a <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct and, as a result, that \u201cthe only facts that matter are those that [employer] put into evidence.\u201d It contends that if this Court holds employer did present a <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct, a remand is required to permit the commission to balance claimant\u2019s evidence of mitigation against employer\u2019s evidence of disqualifying misconduct. We hold the record establishes the commission weighed the evidence of both parties and concluded, based on that weighing, that employer failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct. We also hold the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to claimant and the commission, supports that conclusion. Thus, we hold the commission was not required to assess claimant\u2019s evidence of mitigation in order to conclude he was entitled to benefits. We affirm the commission\u2019s ruling that claimant qualifies for unemployment compensation, and we hold that no remand is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We have recognized that the term <em>\u201cprima facie\u201d </em>has two meanings: As we discussed in <em>Whitt, </em>20 Va.App. at 438, 457 S.E.2d at 782, establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case may mean that the party with the burden of proof has presented sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u201cplausible evidence <em>(regardless of whether it is in fact believed) </em>... [to] shift[ ] the burden of persuasion to the other side to rebut it.\u201d <em>Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 274, 590 S.E.2d 631, 637 (2004) (discussing these principles in the context of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act) (emphasis added). The term <em>prima facie </em>may also \u201cbe[ ] used alongside an actual preponderance standard!,] ... requiring] the factfinder to <em>subjectively </em>believe the evidence preponderates in the [movant\u2019s] favor, not merely to conclude that an objective, rational factfinder could so find.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275-76, 590 S.E.2d at 637 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The commission\u2019s written opinion here makes clear it used the term <em>prima facie </em>in the latter sense\u2014it assessed the witnesses\u2019 credibility and weighed the evidence as a whole before concluding subjectively, as it was authorized to do, that employer had not proved claimant engaged in willful misconduct. The commission expressly \u201crejected] [certain] testimony of the employer\u201d that she warned claimant about his lack of productivity in November 2006, and it did so in part because \u201cthe claimant specifically denfied]\u201d employer made such statements. It also expressly found that claimant \u201creceived a Christmas bonus with a note indicating it was for a job well done\u201d and that employer \u201cterminate[d] the claimant due to his inability to pick up procedures on his own and do the necessary multi-tasking required in a solo practice law office.\u201d Thus, we consider on the merits whether the evidence supported the commission\u2019s findings on the misconduct issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to claimant, was that he worked at his job in what he believed was a diligent manner for the duration of his employment, albeit not in a manner that met employer\u2019s expectations for the paralegal position for which she had hired him, and that he worked eight hours a day for each day he was paid to work. He testified that employer provided him with little formal training and that he asked questions when he did not understand how to perform an assigned task. He explained he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>not seek help with his workload or tell anyone he was having trouble completing his work in a timely fashion because, until January 26, 2007, just six days before employer terminated his employment, employer did not do or say anything to indicate \u201cthere was any issue with [his] performance.\u201d To the contrary, he offered into evidence the holiday greeting card containing the $200 check and the note thanking him for his help. The commission expressly relied upon this evidence in rejecting employer\u2019s testimony that she wanted to terminate claimant after only two weeks due to his inefficiency and that, when he begged her not to do so, she agreed to place him on three months\u2019 probation, which he failed to complete successfully, resulting in his termination. The commission properly refrained from relying on evidence of claimant\u2019s alleged poor job performance about which employer learned only <em>after </em>she had discharged claimant, as such evidence was not relevant to the commission\u2019s determination of whether claimant\u2019s behavior <em>causing </em>the discharge was egregious enough to qualify as misconduct. <em>See Whitt, </em>20 Va.App. at 437, 457 S.E.2d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The commission concluded claimant\u2019s behavior about which employer knew at the time she discharged him constituted, at most, \u201cpoor performance or errors in judgment which would not be sufficient to constitute misconduct in connection with work.\u201d The commission was entitled to view the evidence as it did and to conclude this evidence failed to establish \u201cacts or omissions [that were] of such a nature or so recurrent as to manifest a willful disregard of those interests and the duties and obligations he owes his employer.\u201d <em>See Branch, </em>219 Va. at 611, 249 S.E.2d at 182. <em>Compare Borbas, </em>17 Va.App. at 723-24, 440 S.E.2d at 632 (holding the evidence failed to prove that Borbas, a prison employee, committed willful misconduct where she violated three unrelated security procedures over a period of approximately fourteen months and never exhibited \u201ca period of adequate job performance prior to [her] breaches of security,\u201d thereby failing to exclude the inference that her behavior was negligent rather than willful), <em>with Britt, </em>14 Va.App. at 985-86, 420 S.E.2d at 524-25 (holding an employee who had been reprimanded on three separate occasions for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>same behavior-cursing and talking back to his supervisor\u2014 was guilty of misconduct); <em>Helmick, </em>14 Va.App. at 859-60, 421 S.E.2d at 26-27 (holding an employee\u2019s repeated refusal to follow her employer\u2019s reasonable instructions\u2014refusing to prepare a report, adding unauthorized information to a second report, and sending out two additional reports without allowing her supervisor to review them, in direct contravention of his orders\u2014amounted to misconduct); <em>and Robinson, 12 </em>Va.App. at 940, 407 S.E.2d at 354 (involving an employee\u2019s repeated consumption of the employer\u2019s food without paying for it, a volitional act in clear violation of company policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Because the evidence supported the commission\u2019s finding on the merits that claimant was not discharged for misconduct, the commission was not required to assess claimant\u2019s evidence of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision affirming the commission\u2019s ruling that claimant was entitled to receive unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\">.
