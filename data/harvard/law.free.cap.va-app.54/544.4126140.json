ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Against the wishes of the child and both her biological parents, the appellant\u2014a former live-in girlfriend of the child\u2019s mother\u2014sought court-ordered visitation with the child. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court held the appellant was not a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-124.1 for purposes of obtaining court-ordered visitation. The appellant arg-ues the circuit court erred because the evidence established, as a matter of law, a statutory right for her to seek visitation. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">When reviewing a circuit court\u2019s decision on appeal, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). \u201cThat principle requires us to discard the evidence of the appellant which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by the appellee at trial.\u201d <em>Brandau v. Brandau, 52 </em>Va.App. 632, 635, 666 S.E.2d 532, 534 (2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">During their marriage, Mitchell J. Parker, Jr. and Heather York had a baby girl in 1996. They divorced in 2000. The child lived with her mother and had visitation with her father. In October 2002, the mother allowed her girlfriend, Hope Kathleen Damon, to regularly stay overnight. Less than a year later, Damon and the mother briefly traveled to Canada and got married under a Canadian law authorizing same-sex marriage. The child stayed with her mother and the mother\u2019s girlfriend for about a year and nine months. During this period, the maternal grandparents claimed Damon alienated the mother from her family, alienated the child from her father and both sets of grandparents, and falsely reported that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the child had a bipolar disorder. The child\u2019s behavior and performance in school began to suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In 2003, the Department of Social Services learned that the child (then seven years old) was frequently home alone after school unsupervised. DSS initiated an investigation and discovered various conditions suggesting neglect, including a founded complaint that the child was self-medicating. The extended family became aware of DSS\u2019s investigative findings and decided to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In 2004, the child\u2019s maternal grandmother filed a petition for custody in the Virginia Beach Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court. After hearing evidence, the juvenile court ordered that the child be placed in the shared custody of her father and maternal grandmother. In 2004, the juvenile court ordered the parties involved in the custody dispute (the mother, father, and maternal grandmother) not to permit the child to have any \u201ccontact whatsoever\u201d with Damon.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The relationship between Damon and the child\u2019s mother ended in 2005. In July 2006, Damon filed a petition with the juvenile court seeking court-ordered visitation with the child. The child\u2019s mother, father, and maternal grandmother objected to Damon\u2019s request. To represent the child\u2019s best interests, the juvenile court appointed the same guardian <em>ad litem </em>who had represented the child since 2004, spent over 78 hours investigating various allegations, and filed a 28-page report detailing her recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Upon hearing the evidence, the juvenile court held Damon was not a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-124.1 for purposes of obtaining court-ordered visitation over the objections of the child\u2019s parents and custodians. Given the sensitivity of the matters discussed in its earlier 2004 custody hearing, the juvenile court sealed the transcripts of the 2004 proceedings and ordered the parties to return all transcript copies to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Damon appealed the juvenile court\u2019s order seeking a <em>de novo </em>review in the circuit court. She served discovery requests on the child\u2019s father, the child\u2019s mother, and the child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>maternal grandmother. The circuit court entered a protective order finding many of the requests overly broad. The court ordered the mother, however, to answer several discovery requests that arguably related to the question whether Damon was a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d to have standing under Code \u00a7 20-124.1. The court declined Damon\u2019s request for an order compelling discovery responses from the maternal grandmother.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The circuit court observed that standing under Code \u00a7 20-124.1 presented a \u201cthreshold issue\u201d that must be decided before reaching the ultimate issue of visitation. The court received into evidence the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>report to the juvenile court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and accepted the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>proffer that the child desired to have no contact with Damon. The court also heard testimony from the child\u2019s mother opposing Damon\u2019s bid for standing and from Damon in support of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The child\u2019s mother testified there had been no contact between the child and Damon since the 2004 juvenile court order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to that, she continued, Damon was merely \u201can adult presence\u201d in the child\u2019s life during the brief relationship between herself and Damon. Damon was \u201cmy girlfriend at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the time and lived with us during that time,\u201d the mother explained. The child \u201chas as close a relationship with many of my friends at this moment,\u201d the mother pointed out, as she previously had with Damon. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as being any different than that,\u201d she concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">When asked if \u201cany unique bond\u201d developed between the child and Damon, the mother said they \u201cwere friendly together. Nothing particularly unique.\u201d The mother stated that except during \u201cseveral months\u201d in which Damon helped get the child ready for school in the morning, Damon usually worked late and slept late. The mother picked the child up from child-care after school, prepared her dinner, assisted with her homework, and put her to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Damon took the stand and presented a very different rendition of her brief relationship with the child. Aided by her supporting witnesses, Damon claimed she became a \u201cstepparent\u201d of the child after the marriage ceremony. Her relationship with the child, Damon argued, could not be described as a mere adult presence lacking any unique parental bond. She admitted she had had no contact with the child since 2004 but explained she made no earlier effort to seek visitation because of the juvenile court\u2019s no-contact order.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The circuit court rejected Damon\u2019s argument and found that she failed to prove she was a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-124.1. The court acknowledged the evidence showing Damon lived for a brief period with the child\u2019s mother in a \u201cfamilial-type relationship\u201d but noted that the \u201cevidence is in conflict as to the nature and extent during that period of time of Miss Damon\u2019s role in that familial relationship and whether or not it rose to the level of functional equivalent of a stepparent or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The more relevant concern, the court clarified, was not the \u201crelationship between the petitioner [Damon]\u201d and the child\u2019s mother\u2014but \u201crather the relationship between the petitioner and the child.\u201d Even though they \u201clived together\u201d in a \u201cfamilial-type relationship,\u201d the court stated, Damon could not prevail unless she maintained a \u201crelationship with the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>similar in nature to the relationships enumerated in Section 20-124.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The court noted the lapse of time between Damon\u2019s last contact with the child in 2004 and her request, about two years later, for court-ordered visitation. The court said it was not \u201cascribing fault or blame\u201d but only treating it as a factor to be considered. After considering \u201cthe specific facts that have been adduced in these proceedings,\u201d the court concluded Damon failed to prove her standing under Code \u00a7 20-124.1. So as to reinforce the fact-specific nature of its ruling, the court added: \u201cThe decision is based solely upon the court\u2019s evaluation of all of the facts that have been presented as to the nature of the relationship between Miss Damon and [the child], and that is the sole focus of the court\u2019s inquiry and analysis as far as the court is concerned.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Damon filed two motions to reconsider. First, she argued the court failed to find \u201cDamon was the functional equivalent of (if not an actual) former step parent.\u201d Second, Damon claimed the court was essentially punishing her for respecting the juvenile court\u2019s 2004 no-contact order and waiting a period of time before seeking visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Before entering a final order, the court clarified its ruling with several qualifications. The court stated Damon \u201cmay have been in a familial-type capacity of some sort that might be\u2014or might have been the functional equivalent of one of the enumerated categories of the statute and, therefore, may have been at one time a person with a legitimate interest\u201d but \u201cshe was not at the time of my ruling and for the relevant periods of time prior thereto.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">On appeal, Damon claims the circuit court erred as matter of law in not finding she was a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-124.1. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\u201cAs the United States Supreme Court has observed, the \u2018liberty interest at issue in this case\u2014the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u2014is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffin v. Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. 77, 82, 581 S.E.2d 899, 901 (2003) (quoting <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000)). \u201cThe Due Process Clause protects the \u2018fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We tread lightly on this subject recognizing the magnitude of the parental interests at stake and the limited authority of the courts to upend those ancient, constitutionally protected, parental interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">As a general rule, the party seeking relief \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has standing for each type of relief sought.\u201d <em>Summers v. Earth Island Inst., </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1142, 1149, 173 L.Ed.2d 1 (2009). That is particularly true where, as here, the requested relief involves the invocation of coercive judicial remedies interfering with constitutionally protected parental rights. <em>See generally </em>2 Homer H. Clark, Jr., <em>The Law of Domestic Relations in the United States </em>\u00a7 20.7, at 537 (2d ed. 1987) (noting that a non-parent has the \u201cburden of proof\u2019 to establish any statutory entitlement to court-ordered visitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Virginia law imposes a threshold standing requirement for those seeking court-ordered visitation. Under Code \u00a7 20-124.1, only those with \u201ca legitimate interest\u201d can file visitation petitions. Code \u00a7 20-124.1 provides that a person with \u201ca legitimate interest shall be broadly construed and includes, but is not limited to grandparents, stepparents, former stepparents, blood relatives and family members provided any such party has intervened in the suit or is otherwise properly before the court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>To have standing to litigate the question of visitation, the litigant must prove she either fits within the specific categories mentioned in Code \u00a7 20-124.1 or assert some persuasive ground for being treated as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of one of those categories. <em>See Surles v. Mayer, </em>48 Va.App. 146, 165, 628 S.E.2d 563, 572 (2006); <em>see also Stadter v. Siperko, 52 </em>Va.App. 81, 91-92, 661 S.E.2d 494, 499 (2008). As the circuit court correctly observed, both the categorical relationships and their functional equivalents focus on the relationship between the petitioner and the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In this case, Damon argues her \u201cfamilial relationship\u201d with the child gave her the status of \u201cquasi-stepparent\u201d or the functional equivalent of \u201ca stepparent or former stepparent.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 17, 20. Inverting the same point, Damon also contends she should have been considered a \u201cfunctional equivalent of a family member\u201d because she \u201cstepparented\u201d the child during her marriage to the child\u2019s mother. <em>Id. </em>at 20. For several reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">To begin with, Damon failed to prove she fit within any specific statutory category recognized by Code \u00a7 20-124.1. \u201cThe generally accepted definition of a \u2018family\u2019 is \u2018a group of persons connected by blood, by affinity, or by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Surles, </em>48 Va.App. at 164 n. 6, 628 S.E.2d at 571 n. 6 (citation and internal brackets omitted). It follows that a \u201cfamily member\u201d can only be a person related to the child by blood, affinity, or by law. <em>Id. </em>And a stepparent is related to the child by affinity, <em>id., </em>that is, \u201cby virtue of a marriage subsequent to that of which the person spoken of is the offspring.\u201d <em>Kogon v. Ulerick, </em>12 Va.App. 595, 598-99, 405 S.E.2d 441, 443 (1991) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Damon\u2019s marriage to the child\u2019s mother in Canada created neither a family nor a stepparent relationship between Damon and the child. The marriage was \u201cvoid in all respects\u201d under Virginia law. <em>See </em>Virginia\u2019s Marriage Affirmation Act, Code \u00a7 20-45.3. To be sure, the Virginia Constitution forbids our courts from recognizing any \u201clegal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage.\u201d Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 15-A. Damon, therefore, could not directly or indirectly qualify as having either a familial or stepparent relationship with the child by virtue of Damon\u2019s void marriage to the child\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Damon similarly did not prove her status as a functional equivalent of any statutory category. Damon was a former girlfriend of the child\u2019s mother. Damon lived with the child\u2019s mother and the child for only 21 months\u2014from October 2002 to July 2004. The mother testified Damon was, at best, a mere \u201cadult presence\u201d in the child\u2019s life. Damon and the child were \u201cfriendly together,\u201d the mother explained, but the relationship was not \u201cparticularly unique.\u201d To be sure, the mother added, the child \u201chas as close a relationship with many of my friends at this moment\u201d as she previously had with Damon. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as being any different than that,\u201d the mother concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Though Damon contested the mother\u2019s evidence, the circuit court had no obligation to accept Damon\u2019s contrary version of events. The circuit court, therefore, did not err in refusing to recognize Damon as the functional equivalent of a former stepparent. <em>Cf. Surles, </em>48 Va.App. at 166, 628 S.E.2d at 572 (concluding petitioner was the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a stepparent because he proved he and the child \u201cdeveloped a relationship similar to\u2014if not closer than\u2014that ordinarily established between a stepfather and his stepson\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Damon contends this reasoning fails to discern the hidden error in the circuit court\u2019s analysis. The circuit court, Damon asserts,- refused to recognize Damon\u2019s standing solely on the ground that Damon \u201cwaited too long\u201d after the juvenile court\u2019s 2004 order to file a petition for visitation\u2014thus implicitly finding that Damon once was a person with a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-124.1 but lost that status over time. For several reasons, we disagree with Damon\u2019s characterization of the circuit court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">When \u201cfaced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences,\u201d an appellate court must presume, even if the factfinder does not expressly say so, that all such evidentiary conflicts were resolved in favor of the prevailing party. <em>Clanton v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 561, 570, 673 S.E.2d 904, 909 (2009) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). We likewise do not \u201cfix upon isolated statements of the trial judge taken out of the full context in which they were made, and use them as a predicate for holding the law has been misapplied.\u201d <em>Groves v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 57, 62, 646 S.E.2d 28, 30 (2007) (citation omitted). Instead, \u201c[ajbsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a circuit court comes to an appellate court with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Bottoms v. Bottoms, </em>249 Va. 410, 414, 457 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Damon claims the appellate presumption of correctness can be rebutted because the circuit court\u2019s statements imply that Damon was at one time the functional equivalent of a former stepparent, but forfeited that interest by not pursuing the visitation petition earlier. This assertion, we believe, reads too much into the court\u2019s remarks from the bench. While the circuit court appeared to accept that some sort of \u201cfamilial-type relationship\u201d existed, the court expressly noted the evidentiary \u201cconflict as to the nature and extent during that period of time of <em>Miss Damon\u2019s role in that familial relationship </em>and whether or not it rose to the level of <em>functional equivalent of a stepparent or not.\u201d </em>Nothing in the record suggests the court ruled in favor of the mother (while reject<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>ing her testimony) and ruled against Damon (while accepting hers). We thus find no basis in this record to conclude, as Damon urges, that the circuit court found Damon was ever a functional equivalent of a stepparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We similarly find no merit in Damon\u2019s argument that the circuit court\u2019s remarks from the bench found she qualified as the functional equivalent of a \u201cformer\u201d family member. Code \u00a7 20-124.1 includes no statutory category for former family members. The only statutory category described in the past tense is \u201cformer stepparent,\u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.1, a qualitatively distinct class with a uniquely close bond to the child. Consequently, Damon bore the burden of proving that her relationship with the child (not the child\u2019s mother) was the functional equivalent of a family member (not a \u201cformer\u201d family member).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">After hearing conflicting evidence on the subject and clarifying its holding upon reconsideration, the circuit court found Damon <em>\u201cmay </em>have been in a familial-type capacity of some sort that <em>might </em>be\u2014or <em>might </em>have been the functional equivalent of one of the enumerated categories in the statute and, therefore, <em>may </em>have been at one time a person with a legitimate interest, that she was <em>not at the time of my ruling </em>and for the relevant <em>periods </em>of time prior thereto.\u201d To overrule this factual determination, we would have to hold as a matter of law that a person who has previously held some arguable status as a <em>de facto </em>family member, even for a brief period of time, thereby attains perpetual standing to seek court-ordered visitation even when the relationship no longer exists. We decline to do so. Neither the text of the statute nor the facts of this case warrant such an unprecedented conclusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Finally, we reject Damon\u2019s argument that the circuit court essentially punished her for obeying the juvenile court\u2019s no-contact order from 2004 to 2007. The circuit court emphasized it was not \u201cascribing fault or blame\u201d but only treating it as a factor to be considered, an obviously prudent consideration when judging the legitimacy of a petitioner\u2019s effort to establish standing for court-ordered visitation. The ultimate decision was based, the circuit court explained, \u201csolely upon the court\u2019s evaluation of <em>all of the facts </em>that have been presented as to the nature of the <em>relationship between Miss Damon and [the child], </em>and that is the <em>sole focus </em>of the court\u2019s inquiry and analysis as far as the court is concerned....\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Because the circuit court did not err as a matter of law in finding Damon failed to establish her status as a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-124.1, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\">. Damon argues the circuit court erred in failing to compel these discovery responses. Because Damon failed to proffer, either to us or the circuit court, how this alleged error prejudiced her, we will treat the circuit court's ruling as harmless error, if error at all. <em>See Tazewell Oil Co. v. United Va. Bank, </em>243 Va. 94, 112-, 413 S.E.2d 611, 621 (1992) (finding no \"showing of prejudice\u201d or \"abuse of discretion\u201d when appellant had not \u201cindicated what additional evidence it expected to obtain in further discovery\u201d); <em>Helen W. v.

Damon complains that the circuit court improperly disallowed her explanation for the delay (that she dutifully obeyed the no-contact order) under the <em>res gestae </em>exception to the hearsay rule. The record, however, confirms the circuit court's reply to this argument: \"Now, as far as I can tell, the court never precluded by its ruling Ms. Damon from testifying that she ... did do something or did not do something specifically because of her understanding or her belief or her impression or anything else. In fact, that testimony, except to the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>a specific person said a specific thing, otherwise came in.\u201d Hearing Tr. at 31-32 (Nov. 27, 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\">. Damon also argues that, at the evidentiary hearing, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>asked questions during cross-examination implying that Damon had made certain statements to the guardian during her investigation of the case. Damon\u2019s counsel objected \u201cto the extent that it constitutes testifying\u201d by the guardian. The circuit court overruled the objections stating, \"It's a question, not testimony.\u201d A circuit court, sitting without a jury, \"is presumed to separate \u2018the admissible from the inadmissible,\u2019 and to have considered only competent evidence.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 563, 569, 385 S.E.2d 850, 854 (1989) (citation omitted). The \"training, experience and judicial discipline\u201d of a trial judge permits him to separate the admissible from the inadmissible \"even though he has heard both.\u201d <em>Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981). Because nothing suggests the circuit court improperly treated the guardian\u2019s questions as implied testimony, <em>see generally Rakes v. Fulcher, </em>210 Va. 542, 548, 172 S.E.2d 751, 756-57 (1970), we reject Damon's challenge on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
