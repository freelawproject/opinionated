Ilg (\u201cemployee\u201d), pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement to pay benefits to compensate him for a work-related injury to his right knee. Employer\u2019s hearing application included a doctor\u2019s report that employee\u2019s knee injury no longer prevented employee from doing certain restricted work. The commission denied employer\u2019s application because the same doctor opined that a medical condition affecting employee\u2019s right hand prevented him from working in any capacity. But, at the time the commission rejected employer\u2019s hearing application, the commission had not held a hearing on whether the hand condition had been caused by the work-related accident. Nor had the commission accepted any agreement to pay benefits with respect to the hand condition. We agree with employer that the commission erred in rejecting the hearing application under these circumstances. The commission\u2019s decision is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">While working as a delivery truck driver, employee fell from a truck on February 12, 2007 and suffered injuries. On April 26 of the same year, he filed a claim for benefits form with the commission. On that form is a blank space next to the words \u201cNature of the injury.\u201d On that space employee apparently wrote, \u201cinjury to right hand and right knee.\u201d The commission issued an order, dated May 9, requiring that employer complete attached forms and return them to the commission. Employer\u2019s insurance carrier responded to this order with a letter. According to the letter \u201c[employee\u2019s] claim was accepted as compensable but the following issues were unresolved. We have agreed to pay benefits from 2/13/07 and ongoing. We have paid TPD [temporary partial disability] for 2/13/07, TTD [temporary total disability] 2/14-2/15, TPD 2/16/07 and TTD 2/17/07 ongoing.\u201d On June 5, the commission sent a letter to both parties \u201cacknowledging receipt of the carrier\u2019s position that temporary total and temporary partial wage loss benefits have been paid voluntarily.\u201d The letter also an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>nounced that employee\u2019s application for hearing would be placed on \u201cadministrative hold for the executed Agreement to Pay Benefits form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">On June 29, 2007, the agreement to pay benefits form, <em>signed by both parties, </em>was filed with the commission. Next to the form\u2019s pre-printed language \u201cNature of injury or illness, including body parts affected\u201d is only \u201cPain in Right Knee.\u201d The form does not refer to the hand injury mentioned on employee\u2019s original claim for benefits form. The commission approved this agreement to pay benefits by an award order dated July 12. The award order provides that, \u201cLifetime Medical benefits are hereby awarded for reasonable, necessary and authorized medical treatment causally related to the 2/12/2007 injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">After the filing of the award order, employee hired a lawyer, who sent a letter to the commission, dated November 6, 2007. This letter announced that employee had retained counsel and requested copies of the employer\u2019s accident report as well as any medical records or signed statements of the employee in the commission\u2019s file. The letter also stated that, as a result of his February 12 work-related fall from the truck, employee had suffered injuries to his right hand, right knee, and to his head. The letter reads, in part: \u201cPlease treat this letter as Claimant\u2019s <em>Application for Hearing, </em>by counsel, based upon the injuries described above. Claimant seeks all benefits to which he may be entitled under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d The commission\u2019s response to the letter, dated November 9, states that the requested documents are enclosed, but it does not mention employee\u2019s hearing request at all. Nor does it contain any acknowledgement that employee\u2019s hearing request alleges injuries to body parts (right hand and head) that were not included in the earlier agreement to pay benefits. Instead, the commission noted: \u201cNo further action will be taken on this file until requested by the parties. If we can be of any further assistance to you, please so advise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>On February 25, 2008, Dr. Randall Peyton, who treated employee\u2019s knee injury, signed two forms, each labeled \u201cfitness for duty evaluation.\u201d Each form listed employee\u2019s name. One had a diagnosis of \u201cknee pain\u201d and indicated that employee\u2019s fitness for duty was \u201crestricted.\u201d Dr. Peyton checked a box next to the words \u201cMedium work\u2014lifting 501bs maximum with frequent lifting and/or carrying objects weighing up to 251bs.\u201d Under \u201ccomments\u201d Dr. Peyton wrote \u201cunable to perform stair climbing [longer than] 4.5 minutes.\u201d The second form, also dated February 25, has a diagnosis of \u201cR knee/R hand.\u201d On this form, Dr. Peyton circled the words \u201cunable to work in any capacity.\u201d The inconsistency in the forms is explained in follow-up notes also written by Dr. Peyton. According to the notes, \u201c[w]e have gone through his exam and gone through the work-hardening notes and stated that the hand apparently is worsening from lifting. He is supposed to have this operated on. We talked about a work release in relation only to the knee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">After receiving the form that declared employee fit for restricted duty in relation to his knee injury, employer apparently sought employee\u2019s participation in vocational rehabilitation. Employee\u2019s counsel responded by letter on May 29, 2008. This letter referred to the form that stated that employee was unable to work in any capacity. It also reads \u201c[s]ince Mr. Ilg has met his responsibility to participate in an initial vocational assessment, please be advised that he will not now violate his doctor\u2019s orders that he remain off work.\u201d On June 10, 2008, employer filed an application for a hearing. The application included a copy of the fitness for duty evaluation releasing employee for restricted work. Employee wrote a response to the application, including the form signed by Dr. Peyton stating that employee was unable to work in any capacity because of his hand condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Senior Claims Examiner Linda deLamorton issued a letter opinion for the commission, dated July 7, 2008, denying employer\u2019s application for a hearing. The opinion reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A02\">The original agreement does not (likely due to poor preparation) include the right hand as part of the injuries in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>case. Interestingly, the treatment notes from the onset included the right hand. In any event, the employer/carrier did not raise causation on the face of the employer\u2019s application, and this discrepancy is not part of my consideration. It is apparent the employee is totally disabled from both the right knee and right hand, and unable to participate in vocational rehabilitation. At best, the reports from Dr. Peyton are ambiguous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">Under these circumstances, probable cause does not exist to grant a hearing to the employer/carrier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Employer argued that the full commission should reverse Ms. deLamorton\u2019s ruling because the hand condition that kept employee from working was \u201cnot related to the compensable injury.\u201d The full commission issued an opinion on October 30, 2008, affirming the earlier ruling. The commission found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">On July 7, 2008, the Senior Claims Examiner determined that the defendants had not alleged causation in their application and that the claimant was totally disabled from both the right knee and the right hand and therefore was unable to participate in vocational rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">* * * \u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">Here, the documentation does not show that the claimant refused to cooperate with vocational rehabilitation efforts. The medical records indicate that the claimant suffered Dupuytren\u2019s contractions, a middle finger MCP joint sprain and carpal tunnel syndrome. <em>The defendants did not present sufficient evidence that these conditions were pre-existing, </em>such that they did not have to take them into account in conducting vocational placement, <em>or, if they arose after the accident, that they ivere unrelated to it. See American Furniture Co. v. Doane, </em>230 Va. 39, 334 S.E.2d 548 (1985). Hence, the documentation did not warrant the docketing of the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The commission has the power to make and enforce rules to carry out the purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provided that such rules are not inconsistent with the Act. <em>Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 129 n. 2, 510 S.E.2d 255, 260 n. 2 (1999) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cWhen a challenge is made to the commission\u2019s construction of its rules, the appellate court\u2019s review is limited to a determination of whether the commission\u2019s interpretation was reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Commission Rule 1.4 sets out requirements for the employer\u2019s application for a hearing to review compensation previously awarded. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-708 (authorizing hearings to review compensation previously awarded on change in condition). This Court has previously held that the employer must establish probable cause that a change in condition has occurred before the employer\u2019s hearing application will be accepted. <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Scotece, </em>28 Va.App. 383, 386, 504 S.E.2d 881, 883 (1998). \u201cThe commission has defined the standard of \u2018probable cause\u2019 as \u2018[a] reasonable ground for belief in the existence of facts warranting the proceeding complained of.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 504 S.E.2d at 883 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1081 (5th ed. 1979)). \u201c[The predecessor to current Rule 1.4] is designed to serve as a screening device for eliminating obviously unmeritorious applications for hearings filed by insurers and employers.\u201d <em>Dillard v. Industrial Comm\u2019n of Virginia, </em>416 U.S. 783, 795, 94 S.Ct. 2028, 2035, 40 L.Ed.2d 540 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In this case, the employer\u2019s application alleged employee failed to cooperate with vocational rehabilitation. The statutory basis for a suspension of benefits under such circumstances is found in Code \u00a7 65.2-603(B), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">The unjustified refusal of the employee to accept ... vocational rehabilitation services when provided by the employer shall bar the employee from further compensation until such refusal ceases and no compensation shall at any time be paid for the period of suspension unless, in the opinion of the Commission, the circumstances justified the refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The commission\u2019s opinion argues that the medical evidence did not show probable cause that employee made an \u201cunjustified refusal\u201d to accept vocational rehabilitation in light of Dr. Peyton\u2019s undisputed opinion that employee\u2019s hand condition prevented him from working in any capacity. The commission further argues that employer\u2019s application did not introduce any evidence that employee\u2019s hand condition was not a result of employee\u2019s work-related accident. Relying on <em>American Furniture Co. v. Doane, </em>230 Va. 39, 334 S.E.2d 548 (1985), employer responds that the commission erred in assigning to employer the burden of showing probable cause that employee\u2019s hand condition was the result of the work-related accident because the parties\u2019 original agreement mentioned only the knee injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In <em>Doane, </em>the employee suffered a back injury at work and was awarded compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 41, 334 S.E.2d at 549. Almost two years later, the doctor who performed surgery on the employee\u2019s back recommended that she return to \u201clighter work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 334 S.E.2d at 550. Employer offered her a new job, a description of which was approved by the doctor, but employee could not perform the light work because \u201cpain, numbness, weakness, and loss of grip in her right hand\u201d had developed since her back surgery. <em>Id. </em>The employer applied for a suspension of benefits \u201con the ground of unjustified refusal of selective employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After holding a hearing on the issue, a deputy commissioner suspended benefits because the evidence did not show a causal connection between the employee\u2019s hand impairment and the compensable back injury. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 334 S.E.2d at 550. The full commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision, construing former Code \u00a7 65.1-63 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-510)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to mean that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u201cselective employment must be within the employee\u2019s capacity at the time such employment is offered and that refusal based on an unrelated physical condition is not unjustified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our Supreme Court reversed the full commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">In our view, employment \u201csuitable to [the employee\u2019s] capacity\u201d means employment within the employee\u2019s residual capacity resulting from the industrial accident. The Act is based upon the premise that an employer is liable for the condition of an employee resulting from an industrial accident. But an employer is not liable for conditions not causally related to the employee\u2019s work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u201cAn employer, therefore, is absolved of liability for compensation if the employee refuses selective employment because of a physical condition unrelated to the original industrial accident and arising since the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 334 S.E.2d at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We hold that this principle applies with equal force to cases involving a refusal to cooperate with vocational rehabilitation pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-603. When an employee cannot cooperate with vocational rehabilitation because of a medical condition not causally related to the work-related accidental injury for which benefits were originally awarded, the employee\u2019s refusal to cooperate is \u201cunjustified\u201d for the purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-603, and the employer is absolved of liability for compensation for the duration of the refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In this case, the record includes medical evidence providing probable cause that, with respect to his right knee injury, employee was capable of performing certain restricted work duties. Thus, employer\u2019s application to suspend benefits should have been granted unless employee\u2019s hand condition, which prevented his cooperation with vocational rehabilitation, was the subject of an enforceable award finding that the hand condition was the result of the work-related accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>We, therefore, turn to the question: did the senior claims examiner\u2019s finding that the parties\u2019 original agreement to pay benefits failed to mention the hand injury \u201clikely due to poor preparation\u201d constitute an enforceable award of benefits with respect to the hand injury? Having reviewed the statutory provisions governing the award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits and our cases interpreting them, we conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The senior claims examiner made her finding with respect to the hand injury in the course of addressing employer\u2019s application for a hearing pursuant to Commission Rule 1.4. According to the text of Rule 1.4, its requirements apply to \u201c[e]ach change in condition application filed by an employer under \u00a7 65.2-708 of the Code of Virginia....\u201d But we have previously held that Code \u00a7 65.2-708 applies only to the review of claims where there has already been an award of benefits; the statute does not create a procedure for granting new awards. <em>See Williams v. Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co., </em>18 Va.App. 569, 575, 445 S.E.2d 693, 697 (1994) (\u201cThis case arises pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-708, not Code \u00a7 65.2-704, as is asserted in claimant\u2019s brief. The Supreme Court has held that \u2018after the Commission has made its award and it has become final the procedure for review of disputes which may arise in connection with the award must be under [Code \u00a7 65.2-708].\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Manchester Board &amp; Paper Co. v. Parker, </em>201 Va. 328, 330, 111 S.E.2d 453, 455 (1959))). Because the commission has issued no award ordering compensation for employee\u2019s hand injury, the commission erred in finding that employer had the burden of raising the issue of causation in a hearing application pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-708.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The statutory procedures for enforcing the obligation to pay benefits to an injured employee under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act support this conclusion. An agreement between the parties in regard to compensation or in compromise of a claim for compensation becomes enforceable if the commission approves the agreement. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-701(A) (\u201cIf approved, the agreement shall be binding, and an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>compensation entered upon such agreement shall be for all purposes enforceable as provided by Code \u00a7 65.2-710.\u201d). <em>See also Strong v. Old Dominion Power Co., </em>35 Va.App. 119, 127, 543 S.E.2d 598, 602 (2001) (\u201cMoreover, without commission approval, a memorandum of agreement is null and void.\u201d). If the parties do not reach agreement, either may seek an award order from the commission by applying for a hearing. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-702, -704(A). If not reviewed in due time upon a petition for rehearing, or review by the full commission, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A), the award or ruling deciding the disputed issues raised at the hearing becomes \u201cconclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A). In short, <em>whether or not </em>the parties agree on the terms of compensation, the text of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides no procedure for obtaining an enforceable right to benefits without requesting an award from the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">There are two judicially created exceptions to the requirement that enforceable compensation awards must be obtained in accordance with the statutory procedures described above; but the record in this case does not support their application. The first of these exceptions is the doctrine of <em>defacto </em>awards. <em>See National Linen Service v. McGuinn, </em>5 Va.App. 265, 362 S.E.2d 187 (1987) <em>(en banc). </em>In <em>McGuinn, </em>the employer voluntarily paid compensation to employee for thirteen months, failed to contest that employee\u2019s injury was compensable, and failed to file the memorandum of agreement required by former Code \u00a7 65.1-93 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-701). <em>Id. </em>at 272-73, 362 S.E.2d at 191. This Court applied estoppel principles, holding that employee\u2019s reasonable reliance on employer\u2019s actions created an enforceable <em>de facto </em>award of benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">It is true that, in this case, employer did not expressly dispute employee\u2019s original claim for benefits alleging \u201cinjury to right hand and right knee.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>unclear about the existence of a fact even more important to the existence of reasonable reliance: the payment of compensation for employee\u2019s hand injury. The weekly sum paid to employee pursuant to the agreement to compensate him for the total incapacity caused by his knee injury\u201466 and two thirds percent of employee\u2019s pre-injury average weekly wage\u2014would have been the same whether the employer was paying benefits for the hand condition, the knee injury, or both. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-500(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Even without clear evidence of weekly payments, a <em>de facto </em>award might still be appropriate if employer consistently paid for medical care for employee\u2019s hand. The senior claims examiner\u2019s opinion states, correctly, that treatment notes in the record describe the progress of therapy for the hand. However, Dr. Evans, who treated employee\u2019s hand, noted on January 31, 2008 that: \u201c[employee] has just elected to bypass the workmen\u2019s compensation system and have the surgery done under his private insurance and let his attorney sort things out once his hand recovers.\u201d As early as February 19, 2007, only one week after the accident, Dr. Kahn\u2019s notes indicate that employee: \u201c[t]old Dr. Kahn about hand but was advised that it was separate injury and Dr. Kahn could not treat as part of the accident.\u201d Moreover, our prior published cases approving <em>de facto </em>awards each affirmed the commission\u2019s finding that a <em>de facto </em>award existed. <em>See Henrico (County of) Pub. Util. v. Taylor, </em>84 Va.App. 233, 236, 540 S.E.2d 501, 503 (2001); <em>Ryan\u2019s Family Steak Houses, Inc. v. Gowan, </em>32 Va.App. 459, 462, 528 S.E.2d 720, 721-22 (2000); <em>McGuinn, </em>5 Va.App. at 272-73, 362 S.E.2d at 191. In this case, the commission based its decision, not on a finding of a <em>de facto </em>award, but on the erroneous assumption that the employer had the burden of showing that the hand injury had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>not been caused by the accident. While there may be a future case in which it is appropriate to find a <em>de facto </em>award as part of a \u201cright result, wrong reason\u201d analysis, we are reluctant to do so for the first time in a case where the record is unclear on the question of payment, which is very important to the related question of reasonable reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The other exception is the commission\u2019s equitable power \u201cto do full and complete justice in every case.\u201d <em>Harris v. Diamond Construction Co., </em>184 Va. 711, 720, 36 S.E.2d 573, 577 (1946). This power allows the commission to set aside an award in the event of \u201cfraud, mistake or imposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Yet there is no evidence in the record as to why employee\u2019s hand injury was omitted from the agreement to pay benefits form. Thus, it would be speculative to find that the reason was fraud or mistake. The related doctrine of imposition \u201cfocuses on a party\u2019s or the commission\u2019s \u2018use of superior knowledge [of, or] experience with[,] the ... Act or use of economic leverage which results in an unjust deprivation\u2019 of benefits under the Act or an unjust application of the Act\u2019s provisions.\u201d <em>Overhead Door Co. v. Lewis, </em>29 Va.App. 52, 60, 509 S.E.2d 535, 538-39 (1999) (quoting <em>Butler v. City of Virginia Beach, 22 </em>Va.App. 601, 605, 471 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1996)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">In every case in which this Court or the Virginia Supreme Court has applied the doctrine of imposition, however, the commission either (1) could have exercised jurisdiction under the Act to render the requested result but did not formally obtain it due to the failure of a party to perform some act in a timely fashion or (2) actually exercised its jurisdiction under the Act to enter an award but later learned that the award was erroneous due to some misinformation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 60, 509 S.E.2d at 539. The record similarly fails to show that the award accepting the parties\u2019 agreement to pay benefits was erroneous due to misinformation; nor is there evidence that a failure to perform some act in a timely fashion has deprived the commission of jurisdiction. Finally, the medical evidence in the record does not clearly indicate that the denial of benefits for employee\u2019s hand problem has result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ed in \u201can unjust deprivation under the Act.\u201d For example, Dr. Evans opined that employee\u2019s Dupuytren\u2019s disease was exacerbated by the work-related accident, but according to Dr. Innis, \u201c[h]is Dupuytren\u2019s problem is unrelated to the work accident.\u201d Moreover, his carpal tunnel syndrome is classified as an \u201cordinary disease of life\u201d by Code \u00a7 65.2-401, which requires clear and convincing evidence, rather than a mere probability, that the disease arose in the course of the employment. Without a hearing or agreement on this question, we cannot say that the commission could have exercised its equitable powers to alter the agreement that the parties actually made.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In sum, the senior claims examiner made an unwarranted assumption that employee\u2019s right hand injury was <em>causally related </em>to the industrial accident. No award or agreement supported that conclusion. Moreover, that issue was never raised, or addressed, by the parties for her consideration. The commission compounded this error by placing on the employer, in contradiction to <em>Doane, </em>the burden of presenting medical evidence in their application showing the hand injury was \u201cpre-existing\u201d or was \u201cunrelated to\u201d the industrial accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We find as a matter of law that employer\u2019s evidence established probable cause that a change in condition occurred with respect to the compensable injury acknowledged in the parties\u2019 agreement to pay benefits. We, therefore, reverse the commission\u2019s decision and remand with instructions to place this case on the hearing docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-5\">. Though this case concerns an alleged refusal to cooperate with vocational rehabilitation as described in Code \u00a7 65.2-603 rather than a refusal of selective employment under former Code \u00a7 65.1-63 (currently Code \u00a7 65.2-510) as in <em>Doane, </em>the text of each statute provides that benefits be suspended during the period of such refusal unless such refusal was \"justified.\u201d Former Code \u00a7 65.1-63 also included similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>language at the time of the decision in <em>Doom. See Doane, </em>230 Va. at 41 n. 1,334 S.E.2d at 549 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\">. Employer\u2019s argument, i.e., that the agreement to pay benefits form signed by the parties and accepting only the knee injury as compensable operated as a denial of employee's earlier claim for compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>with respect to his hand injury, suggests that employer may have violated Commission Rule 4.1, which requires that: \"If the claim is denied the employer <em>shall </em>notify the employee and the Commission promptly in writing.\u201d However, the procedural posture of this case restricts the scope of our review to whether the commission erred in denying employer's hearing application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
