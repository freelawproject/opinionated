Davies, M.D., Eastern Virginia Medical School, EVMS Academic Physicians and Surgeons Health Care Foundation, and Ghent Family Practice (hereinafter collectively appellants) appeal from a ruling of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the commission) with respect to the claim of Latisha Woodard, administratrix of the estate of deceased infant Jaliyah N. Lee, rendered pursuant to the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act (the Act). Appellants contend the commission improperly concluded that if it found the infant sustained birth-related neurological injuries, it lacked jurisdiction under the Act to determine whether such injuries were caused by intentional or willful conduct of the appellants. They argue the commission erred in ordering that the claim based on willfulness be referred to the circuit court. Because the commission ruled only that the \u201cwillful\u201d portion of the claim would not be allowed to proceed before the commission and did not rule on the merits of the portion of the claim it held was properly before it\u2014whether the infant suffered a birth-related neurological injury caused by appellants\u2014we hold the commission\u2019s determination was not an appealable interlocutory order, and we dismiss the appeals without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">At Maryview Hospital on November 21, 2002, following a difficult labor, Latisha Woodard gave birth to infant Jaliyah Lee. The infant was placed on life support, and on December 2, 2002, Jaliyah was removed from life support and died, allegedly as a result of injuries sustained during birth. Woodard filed a motion for judgment against appellants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Portsmouth Circuit Court. The motion for judgment included allegations that appellants \u201cacted willfully, wantonly and recklessly in a grossly negligent and careless manner so as to evince a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others, including Jaliyah and her parents,\u201d and the motion sought compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Appellants responded that they were participating providers under the Act as defined in Code \u00a7 38.2-5001. Based on that status and pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-273.1, they moved to have the cause of action stayed in the circuit court and referred to the commission for purposes of determining whether the cause of action satisfied the Act, in the apparent hope of limiting Woodard to the remedies provided for under the Act, as set out in Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B). Woodard opposed the referral, arguing the exception of Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(C) for \u201cintentionally or willfully causing] or intending] to cause a birth-related neurological injury\u201d applied. As a result, she contended she was entitled to proceed with her civil suit in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Following argument on this issue, the circuit court ruled \u201cthe Commission has \u2018exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether an infant\u2019s claim lies within the purview of the Act[,]\u2019 <em>Berner v. Mills, </em>265 Va. 408, 411, 579 S.E.2d 159, 160 (2003),\u201d and that Code \u00a7 8.01-273.1 compelled it to refer the case to the commission for this determination as a result of appellants\u2019 requests for referral. The circuit court also concluded \u201c[Wood<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>ard\u2019s] assertion that [appellants] in this case acted willfully and wantonly is unavailing ... [and] is not enough to deprive the Commission of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">When the matter had been transferred to the commission, Woodard averred the commission lacked jurisdiction over both the wrongful death claim and the \u201cclaim that the injuries were the result of intentional or wilful [sic] and wanton acts of the [appellants].\u201d She asked the deputy to \u201cremove the matter\u201d from the commission\u2019s docket and \u201crefer [it] back to the circuit court for further adjudication with respect to the willful and intentional aspects of the case.\u201d The deputy denied the motion to the extent Woodard sought referral of the entire claim to the circuit court, but he granted \u201cthe portion seeking to refer the claim for injuries alleged to arise from [appellants\u2019] intentional or willful conduct.\u201d The deputy reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">The General Assembly has ... made it clear that the civil courts\u2019 jurisdiction no longer extends to claims for medical malpractice resulting in birth-related neurological injuries while the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to claims made that physicians and hospitals intentionally or willfully caused or intended to cause these injuries. The plain language of \u00a7 38.2-5002(0) contemplates this result, recognizing that if its preconditions, filing before a final decision is rendered [by the commission] under the Act and no receipt of benefits under the Act, are met, a plaintiff may proceed with an action [in circuit court] under the common law for an injury to an infant caused by intentional or willful conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In a review on the record, the commission unanimously affirmed what it referred to as the deputy\u2019s \u201cinterlocutory\u201d determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Appellants then noted these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">\u201c \u2018The Court of Appeals of Virginia is a court of limited jurisdiction.\u2019 Unless a statute confers subject matter jurisdie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>tion to that court over a class of appeals, [it] is without authority to review an appeal.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Lewis, </em>271 Va. 520, 524-25, 628 S.E.2d 314, 316-17 (2006) (quoting <em>Canova Elec. Contracting, Inc. v. LMI Ins. Co., </em>22 Va.App. 595, 599, 471 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1996)). Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-405(2) and (4), the Court of Appeals has appellate jurisdiction over any <em>final decision </em>of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and any <em>interlocutory decree or order </em>in such a matter involving the granting, dissolving, or denying of an injunction or <em>\u201cadjudicating the principles of a cause.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 17.1-405(4) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">A final decree is one \u201c \u2018which disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief that is contemplated, and leaves nothing to be done by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Erikson v. Erikson, </em>19 Va.App. 389, 390, 451 S.E.2d 711, 712 (1994) (quoting <em>Southwest Va. Hosps. v. Lipps, </em>193 Va. 191, 193, 68 S.E.2d 82, 83-84 (1951)). Because the commission ruled it \u201chas jurisdiction to entertain the portion of the claimant\u2019s claim for the decedent\u2019s [alleged] birth-related neurological injuries alleged to arise from the physicians^] and hospital\u2019s medical malpractice\u201d but has not held a hearing or made a decision resolving that portion of the claim, manifestly its ruling is an interlocutory order rather than a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">For an interlocutory order to be held to have \u201cadjudicat[ed] the principles of a cause,\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-405(4), as required for immediate appeal,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG\">the decision must be such that \u201c \u2018the rules or methods by which the rights of the parties are to be finally worked out have been so far determined that it is only necessary to apply those rules or methods to the facts of the case in order to ascertain the relative rights of the parties, with regard to the subject matter of the suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pinkard v. Pinkard, </em>12 Va.App. 848, 851, 407 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1991) (quoting <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>142 Va. 244, 252-53, 128 S.E. 524, 527 (1925)).... \u201c \u2018The mere possibility\u2019 that an interlocutory decree \u2018may affect the final decision in the trial does not necessitate an immediate appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Polumbo v. Polumbo, </em>13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Va.App. 306, 307, 411 S.E.2d 229, 229 (1991) (quoting <em>Pinkard, </em>12 Va.App. at 853, 407 S.E.2d at 342).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><em>Erikson, </em>19 Va.App. at 391, 451 S.E.2d at 712-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Applying these principles in <em>Alliance to Save the Mattaponi v. Virginia Marine Resources Commission, </em>43 Va.App. 724, 726, 601 S.E.2d 684, 685 (2004), we held that a circuit court\u2019s order denying a request for intervention is not an appealable interlocutory order. In <em>Lewis v. Lewis, </em>271 Va. 520, 526-28, 628 S.E.2d 314, 318 (2006), the Supreme Court held that, in a suit for divorce, an interlocutory order dismissing a cross-bill but leaving the original bill for adjudication is not an appealable order. In <em>City of Richmond-Fire &amp; Emergency v. Brandon, </em>32 Va.App. 787, 789, 531 S.E.2d 22, 22-23 (2000), we held that an order of one of the commission\u2019s deputies denying a request for issuance of a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>also was not an appealable interlocutory order because it did not \u201cadjudicate the underlying cause.\u201d We further noted that although <em>the commission </em>might have discretionary authority to conduct an interlocutory review of the evidentiary ruling of one of its deputies, the ruling was not an interlocutory decision appeal-able to the Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>Thus, in <em>Alliance, Lewis, </em>and <em>Brandon, </em>we lacked authority to consider the appeal. <em>See Alliance, </em>43 Va.App. at 726, 601 S.E.2d at 685, <em>cited with approval in Lewis, </em>271 Va. at 528 n. 5, 628 S.E.2d at 319 n. 5 (recognizing an adverse interlocutory adjudication may be the subject of an appeal from a <em>final </em>adjudication); <em>Brandon, </em>32 Va.App. at 789, 531 S.E.2d at 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Similarly, here, the commission\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the portion of the claim \u201cthat the [infant\u2019s] injuries were the result of intentional or wil[l]ful and wanton acts of the [appellants]\u201d was not an appealable order because it did not \u201cadjudicate the underlying cause.\u201d <em>Brandon, </em>32 Va.App. at 789, 531 S.E.2d at 22. Instead, the effect of the order was much like the denial of the motion to intervene in <em>Alliance, </em>the denial of the motion for issuance of a subpoena in <em>Brandon, </em>and the dismissal of the cross-bill in <em>Lewis. </em>In each of those cases, the court or commission had ruled that a particular claimant, claim or method of discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>would not be permitted as part of the underlying or primary claim, but the underlying claim had not been resolved. Similarly, here, the order appealed from determined only that the \u201cwillful\u201d portion of the claim would not be allowed to proceed before the commission; the commission made no ruling on the portion of the claim it held was properly before it\u2014whether Jaliyah suffered a birth-related neurological injury caused by appellants. \u201c \u2018The mere possibility\u2019 that the interlocutory decree \u2018[might] affect the [commission\u2019s] final decision\u2019 \u201d if it were reversed\u2014by requiring the commission to consider the claim of intentional or willful conduct\u2014\u201cdoes not necessitate an immediate appeal.\u201d <em>Polumbo, </em>13 Va.App. at 307, 411 S.E.2d at 229 (quoting <em>Pinkard, </em>12 Va.App. at 853, 407 S.E.2d at 342).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The commission ruled only that the \u201cwillful\u201d portion of Woodard\u2019s claim would not be allowed to proceed before the commission. The commission did not rule on the portion of the claim it held was properly before it\u2014whether the infant suffered a birth-related neurological injury caused by appellants. For this reason, we hold the commission\u2019s determination was not an appealable interlocutory order, and we dismiss the appeals without prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\n<em>Appeals dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\">.
