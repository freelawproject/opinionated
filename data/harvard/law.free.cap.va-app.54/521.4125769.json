On appeal, appellants contend that the circuit court erred in finding that (1) appellants failed to present facts sufficient to establish injury in fact and (2) appellants failed to establish a causal connection between the permitted activities and any alleged harm. In the alternative, appellants argue that they suffered a procedural injury sufficient to confer standing when VMRC \u201cabdicated its responsibility to address the impact of the Boatel\u2019s upland expansion.\u201d For the following reasons, we reverse the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">The facts relevant to this appeal are as follows. Appellants own approximately five acres of waterfront property on Milford Haven in Mathews County. Appellants\u2019 family has owned this property for many generations. Appellants\u2019 prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>erty is adjacent to a marina owned by Morningstar Marinas/Gwynn\u2019s Island LLC (\u201cthe Boatel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">At its regularly scheduled meeting on January 23, 2007, VMRC considered a permit application submitted by the Boatel\u2019s owner at the time, David Fitch.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Boatel sought permission from VMRC to use state-owned bottomlands pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-1205. Specifically, the Boatel requested authorization to (1) remove all existing fixed piers and construct four new floating piers of various lengths to support the dry stack storage operation, fueling, and sewage pump-out, (2) create eighteen wetslips and seven staging slips, and (3) dredge thirty-seven hundred cubic yards of subaqueous bottom material.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants opposed the permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">As part of its review of the Boatel\u2019s permit application, VMRC was presented with evidence by both those in support of and opposed to the proposed project. The evidence before VMRC included testimony, exhibits, and public comments from both the Department of Health and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. After considering all this evidence, VMRC voted to approve the Boatel\u2019s permit application. Appellants then appealed VMRC\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Before hearing the merits of appellants\u2019 appeal, the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on November 10, 2008, to determine whether or not appellants had standing to appeal VMRC\u2019s decision. Lois Biddison (\u201cBiddison\u201d) testified that her family has owned their property on Milford Haven for \u201cas long as records have been kept in Mathews.\u201d Biddison further testified that because of the dredging, \u201cboats leaving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>boatel ... tend[ ] to cut closer to our shore when they\u2019re going east to go out into the Bay, and they come closer to our shore and closer to the pier.\u201d As a result, appellants have \u201cexperienced two to three feet of wash on [their] shoreline since last year.\u201d Biddison also noted that the increase in shoreline wash affected both appellants\u2019 picnic area as well as the area where appellants launch their kayak. In addition, Biddison testified that appellants use their pier for swimming, crabbing, and fishing and indicated that because of the marina\u2019s expansion and the increase in boat activity in the water, she would not want her family swimming from the pier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Biddison also testified that muddy water from the Boatel\u2019s \u201cspoil site\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ran down a drainage ditch separating the two properties and created a \u201cbig flume of muddy water\u201d into Milford Haven. Biddison further testified that the drainage ditch had been on the property for over sixty years and that she had never seen this amount of muddy water travel through the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Robert C. Neikirk (\u201cNeikirk\u201d) was the environmental engineer who processed the Boatel\u2019s permit application and briefed VMRC on it. Neikirk testified on cross-examination that he assumed the project would result in increased boat traffic near appellants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">On November 20, 2008, the circuit court entered an order dismissing appellants\u2019 appeal with prejudice. The circuit court concluded that appellants lacked standing because they \u201cdid not present facts sufficient to establish injury in fact, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>did they establish a casual connection between the Boatel\u2019s permitted activities and any alleged harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Appellants now appeal that decision to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">It is important to note that \u201c[standing to maintain an action is a preliminary jurisdictional issue having no relation to the substantive merits of an action.\u201d <em>Andrews v. American Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Va. 221, 226, 372 S.E.2d 399, 402 (1988). Thus, the concept of \u201cstanding\u201d is not concerned with whether or not a party will ultimately prevail on the legal merits of an issue but rather with the ability of a party to seek redress through the courts in the first place by demonstrating sufficient connection to, and actual or potential harm from, the law or action challenged. The question of whether or not a litigant has standing is a \u201cquestion[ ] of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal.\u201d <em>Moreau v. Fuller, </em>276 Va. 127, 133, 661 S.E.2d 841, 845 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\"> Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F) sets forth the standing requirement for challenging a decision of VMRC. It provides that \u201c[a]ny person <em>aggrieved </em>by a decision of the Commission [VMRC] under this section is entitled to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (\u00a7 2.2-4000 et seq.).\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F) (emphasis added). Appellants argue that we should interpret the word \u201caggrieved\u201d in Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F) in the same manner as it is defined in Code \u00a7 62.1^44.29,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which concerns the standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>requirements to appeal a decision of the State Water Control Board. Although the two statutes do contain similar language, Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 specifically incorporates the criteria for establishing standing under Article III of the United States Constitution, while Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F) does not. Because \u201cwe presume that the legislature \u2018chose, with care,\u2019 the specific words of the statute,\u201d we do not reach the conclusion advocated by appellants. <em>Kane v. Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 371, 585 S.E.2d 349, 352-53 (2003) (quoting <em>Simon v. Forer, </em>265 Va. 483, 490, 578 S.E.2d 792, 796 (2003)). Had the General Assembly so intended, they would have included the same reference to Article III in Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F) as they did in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Though we disagree with appellants\u2019 contention as to the meaning of the word \u201caggrieved\u201d in Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F), that conclusion does not end our analysis. In <em>Bd. of Supervisors v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>268 Va. 441, 449-50, 604 S.E.2d 7, 11 (2004), the Supreme Court of Virginia discussed the meaning of the word \u201caggrieved\u201d as it pertains to standing. The Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018aggrieved\u2019 has a settled meaning in Virginia when it becomes necessary to determine who is a proper party to seek court relief from an adverse decision. In order for a petitioner to be \u2018aggrieved,\u2019 it must affirmatively appear that such person had some direct interest in the subject matter of the proceeding that he seeks to attack.... The petitioner \u2018must show that he has an immediate, pecuniary and substantial interest in the litigation, and not a remote or indirect interest.\u2019 ... Thus, it is not sufficient that the sole interest of the petitioner is to advance some perceived public right or to redress some anticipated public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>injury when the only wrong he has suffered is in common with other persons similarly situated. <em>The word \u2018aggrieved\u2019 </em>in a statute contemplates a substantial grievance and <em>means a denial of some personal or property right, legal or equitable, </em>or imposition of a burden or obligation upon the petitioner different from that suffered by the public generally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlP\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Comm\u2019n v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>231 Va. 415, 419-20, 344 S.E.2d 899, 902-03 (1986)) (emphasis added). To establish standing under this definition of \u201caggrieved,\u201d appellants were required to demonstrate that they possessed either \u201can immediate, pecuniary and substantial interest in the litigation\u201d or that they were denied, \u201csome personal or property right, legal or equitable,\u201d by VMRC\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>We hold that appellants produced sufficient evidence to establish standing under this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The evidence is uncontested that appellants own waterfront property adjacent to the Boatel. So situated, appellants\u2019 property also constitutes \u201criparian land,\u201d making appellants \u201criparian land owners.\u201d The final sentence of Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F) provides that \u201c[njothing in this subsection shall be construed to deprive a riparian landowner of such rights as he may have under common law.\u201d \u201c[Rjiparian rights ... \u2018are qualified property rights incident to the ownership of the soil through or by which the waters of a stream flow.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thurston v. City of Portsmouth, </em>205 Va. 909, 912, 140 S.E.2d 678, 680 (1965) (quoting <em>Hite v. Town of Luray, </em>175 Va. 218, 226, 8 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1940)). As such, \u201c[a] \u2018riparian right is property, and is valuable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>102 Va. 759, 771, 47 S.E. 875, 880 (1904)). <em>\u201cRiparian owners </em>have the right to make reasonable use of the water flowing past their land, and they <em>have a right to enjoy the recreational and aesthetic advantages that are conferred on such land adjoining a watercourse.\u201d State Water Control Bd. v. Crutchfield, </em>265 Va. 416, 427-28, 578 S.E.2d 762, 768 (2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In this case, appellants asserted facts sufficient to support their claim that their right to enjoy the recreational and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>aesthetic advantages of their waterfront property on Milford Haven as riparian landowners was adversely impacted by VMRC\u2019s decision to grant the Boatel\u2019s permit. Biddison testified that appellants have experienced an additional two to three feet of shoreline wash on their property as a result of boats passing closer to the shore through the new dredge cut. Biddison further testified that this increased wash has affected the area which appellants use to picnic and launch their kayak. Biddison also testified that the new dredge cut allows boats to pass closer to appellants\u2019 pier, which is used by appellants to swim, fish, and crab. Biddison indicated that because of the increased boat activity in the water, she did not want her grandchildren swimming from the pier. In addition, Biddison testified that muddy water from the Boatel\u2019s spoil site drained down a ditch on appellants\u2019 property and created a \u201cbig flume of muddy water\u201d in Milford Haven. In light of this evidence, we hold that appellants\u2019 rights as riparian landowners may have been adversely affected by VMRC\u2019s decision to grant the Boatel\u2019s permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Moreover, appellants have a direct and substantial interest in the subject matter of the litigation as the owners of adjacent or nearby property to the permitted activity. Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\"><em>When determining whether to grant or deny any permit for the use of state-owned bottomlands, </em>the Commission shall be guided in its deliberations by the provisions of Article XI, Section I of the Constitution of Virginia. In addition to other factors, the Commission shall also consider the public and private benefits of the proposed project and shall exercise its authority under this section consistent with the public trust doctrine as defined by the common law of the Commonwealth adopted pursuant to \u00a7 1-200 in order to protect and safeguard the public right to the use and enjoyment of the subaqueous lands of the Commonwealth held in trust by it for the benefit of the people as conferred by the public trust doctrine and the Constitution of Virginia. <em>The Commission shall also consider the project\u2019s effect on the following:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>1. Other reasonable and permissible uses of state waters and state-owned bottomlands;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">2. Marine and fisheries resources of the Commonwealth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">3. Tidal wetlands, except when this has or will be determined under the provisions of Chapter 13 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">4. <em>Adjacent </em>or <em>nearby properties;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">5. Water quality; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">6. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">(Emphasis added). Thus, subsection (4) of Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A) specifically requires VMRC to consider the effect of a proposed project on adjacent or nearby properties. Clearly appellants, who own or have a riparian interest in property adjacent to the Boatel, have a direct and substantial interest in this litigation simply by virtue of the fact that VMRC was required by statute \u201cto consider the project\u2019s effect\u201d on their property prior to granting the Boatel\u2019s permit. Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A). Given this statutory requirement, the Attorney General\u2019s argument to the contrary is illogical, and we hold that appellants qualify as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F) and \u201c[are] entitled to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (\u00a7 2.2-4000 et seq.).\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Because we hold that appellants presented sufficient evidence to establish that they were \u201caggrieved\u201d under Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F) and, thus, had standing to appeal the decision of VMRC, we need not address the issue of whether appellants suffered a procedural injury sufficient to confer standing. \u201cIn this case, as in all others, we seek to decide cases \u2018on the best and narrowest ground available\u2019 from the record.\u201d <em>Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 691, 702 n. 2, 653 S.E.2d 600, 603 n. 2 (2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the circuit court erred in finding that appellants lacked standing to appeal VMRC\u2019s decision to grant a permit to the Boatel. Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>reverse the circuit court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">.
