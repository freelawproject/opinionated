Appellant challenges these convictions on several grounds addressed below. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">\u201cOn appeal, \u201cwe review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)); <em>see Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004) (viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, \u201cas we must since it was the prevailing party in the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>So viewed, the evidence proved that appellant and his cousin traveled in a Chevrolet Trailblazer from New York City to the Northern Virginia area on September 20, 2005. Using his own credit card, appellant paid for a meal in Arlington County and for a hotel room in the City of Alexandria on the night of September 20. Appellant and his cousin checked out of the hotel before noon on the morning of September 21, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">At approximately 8:00 a.m. on September 21, appellant accessed a program file on his laptop computer, interfacing the computer with a \u201cremagger,\u201d a device that enables a person to read and write data to the magnetic strip on the back of a plastic card. It is unknown where appellant was when he accessed this program file. Throughout the day, appellant attempted to use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods and services in Alexandria, Arlington, and Fairfax County, and some of these attempts were successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">After 4:00 p.m. on September 21, appellant was stopped for speeding in Arlington County. The police officer discovered that appellant had an outstanding warrant in New Jersey and took appellant into custody. Appellant\u2019s cousin was permitted to leave on foot. A search of the Trailblazer yielded appellant\u2019s laptop, a thumb drive, and five compact discs, all of which contained stolen credit card information. In total, appellant possessed approximately 100 stolen credit card names and numbers. In addition, twelve credit cards were found in the vehicle, eleven with appellant\u2019s name on them, but only three cards had numbers encoded on the magnetic strip that matched the engraved number on the front of the credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">During appellant\u2019s pre-trial detention, the authorities recorded several phone conversations, mostly in Romanian, apparently discussing credit card fraud and credit card theft. Concerned about ongoing criminal activity, the authorities searched appellant\u2019s jail cell and retrieved \u201cforeign language stuff\u2019 and credit card sheets. The authorities attempted to avoid disturbing papers with the letterhead of appellant\u2019s attorneys, but appellant claimed that the seized materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>written in Romanian related to an ongoing federal investigation. Appellant claimed that he sought to negotiate a \u201cglobal settlement\u201d through his assistance with that investigation. Appellant acknowledged that this information was \u201cnot specific to the charges in Arlington County.\u201d After a hearing, the trial court rejected appellant\u2019s claims of Fourth and Sixth Amendment violations with respect to the warrantless jail cell search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">At trial, appellant argued that venue was improper on a number of charges, that the possession of burglarious tools charge should have been stricken, and that the Commonwealth presented insufficient proof that appellant, rather than his cousin, was the perpetrator of the offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rejected these arguments, and the jury convicted appellant of the aforementioned offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"A60\">A. Venue</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">1. Identity Theft (Case Number CR05-1243)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Appellant argues that venue was improper in Arlington County for the prosecution of an indictment for identity theft listing Iris Keltz as the victim. Appellant attempted to make a purchase using Ms. Keltz\u2019s credit card number at a store in Alexandria. He contends that <em>Meeks v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 798, 651 S.E.2d 637 (2007), controls here and precludes prosecution in the Arlington County courts. We find venue was proper in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">\u201cWhen venue is challenged on appeal, we determine \u2018whether the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient to support the [trial court\u2019s] venue findings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va. App. 459, 464-65, 658 S.E.2d 708, 710-11 (2008) (quoting <em>Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 36, 393 S.E.2d 599, 604 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>(1990)). The evidence in relation to venue proved appellant was arrested in Arlington County while he was in possession of Ms. Keltz\u2019s credit card number. Ms. Keltz was a resident of the State of New York and had not visited Arlington County. No evidence established that appellant newly accessed this number or newly used it in any particular manner while he was in Arlington County, but he continued to possess not only the stolen number while in Arlington but also the remagging device that he utilized to effect these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">\u201cVenue depends on the \u2018nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464, 658 S.E.2d at 711 (quoting <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>328 U.S. 699, 703, 66 S.Ct. 1213, 1216, 90 L.Ed. 1529 (1946)). For most crimes, venue is proper in the jurisdiction where <em>all </em>the elements of the completed crime were committed. <em>See Green v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 438, 448, 528 S.E.2d 187, 192 (2000) (finding the Commonwealth must generally establish venue with evidence that supports a strong presumption that all elements of the offense occurred within the selected venue). For prosecution of identity theft, however, the General Assembly enacted a special venue statute, which provides that \u201cthe crime shall be considered to have been committed in any locality where the person whose identifying information was appropriated resides, or in which <em>any part </em>of the offense took place, regardless of whether the defendant was ever actually in such locality.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) (emphasis added). Therefore, to satisfy Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D), the Commonwealth here needed to establish a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that any part of the offense took place in Arlington County. <em>See Green, </em>32 Va.App. at 448, 528 S.E.2d at 192 (noting that, under the general venue statute, the Commonwealth must establish a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that all elements of the offense occurred within the selected venue); <em>see also Meeks, </em>274 Va. at 803, 651 S.E.2d at 639 (construing Code \u00a7 18.2-198.1(i), the credit card theft venue statute, as requiring that the evidence establish a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that an \u201cact in furtherance\u201d of credit card theft occurred within the selected venue).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>To consider whether any part of the crime of identity theft occurred in Arlington County, we must look to its elements and the nature of the crime. Appellant was charged in case number CR05-1243 of committing identity theft pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">It shall be unlawful for any person, without the authorization or permission of the person or persons who are the subjects of the identifying information, with the intent to defraud, for his own use or the use of a third person, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">1. Obtain, record or access identifying information<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which is not available to the general public that would assist in accessing financial resources, obtaining identification documents, or obtaining benefits of such other person; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">2. Obtain goods or services through the use of identifying information of such other person....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If any part of this offense occurred in Arlington County, then venue was proper there.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Although the Virginia appellate courts have not previously addressed the venue provision in Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3, the Supreme Court has addressed a somewhat similar venue provision enacted for credit card theft. In <em>Meeks, </em>the Supreme Court considered Code \u00a7 18.2-198.1, which creates a specific exception to the general venue statute for the crime of credit card theft. The Court considered the elements of credit card theft and found such thefts are \u201ccompleted where the card or number is unlawfully fyken from its rightful owner or is received with knowledge that it has been taken and with the intent to use it, sell it, or transfer it.\u201d <em>Meeks, </em>274 Va. at 803, 651 S.E.2d at 640. The Court concluded that venue did not lie in Alexandria, where Meeks retained the credit card after she had stolen it elsewhere, as the act of taking the card (and thus the crime itself) was completed before she arrived in Alexan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>dr\u00eda. <em>Id. </em>at 803-04, 651 S.E.2d at 640. The Supreme Court overruled its prior opinion in <em>Cheatham v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 286, 208 S.E.2d 760 (1974), to the extent that <em>Cheatham </em>\u201cwrongly added the element of retention to credit card theft.\u201d <em>Meeks, </em>274 Va. at 803, 651 S.E.2d at 639; <em>see Cheatham, </em>215 Va. at 290, 208 S.E.2d at 763 (holding that the word \u201cwithhold,\u201d as used in the context of the credit card theft statute, \u201cimport[sj something more than mere retention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Appellant argues that <em>Meeks </em>controls in this case and, therefore, the trial court erred in finding venue in Arlington County. <em>Meeks </em>does provide guidance for the issue considered here. In a manner similar to the approach used by the Supreme Court in that case, we must also determine whether the identity theft had concluded prior to appellant\u2019s arrest in Arlington County. If the crime of identity theft concluded with the taking of the information, then no \u201cpart of the offense\u201d could take place after that taking. <em>See Meeks, </em>274 Va. at 803, 651 S.E.2d at 639-40. In such a situation, appellant\u2019s possession of the information in Arlington County would be after the completion of the crime, and so venue would not be proper in that county. However, if identity theft is a continuing offense such that parts of the offense can occur after the taking, then venue in Arlington County would be appropriate. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 803, 651 S.E.2d at 640 (finding Meeks completed the credit card theft in Fairfax County; therefore, venue for that crime did not lie in Alexandria where she used the card and was then arrested).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">a. The Continuing Nature of an Identity Theft Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Although <em>Meeks </em>does illustrate how an appellate court should approach this issue, its conclusion is not controlling on the significantly different facts and different statute involved here. Identity theft is not credit card theft. Despite its name, the completion of the crime of identity theft is not limited to a discrete moment in time marked by the unlawful taking or receiving of an individual\u2019s identifying information. Rather, identity theft can be committed by recording or accessing an individual\u2019s identifying information, actions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>continue after the initial obtaining of the information, or by obtaining goods through the use of the illegally obtained identifying information. Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Indeed, the very nature of identity theft is that, once an individual\u2019s identifying information is stolen, the individual\u2019s identity remains stolen by the perpetrator as long as the perpetrator possesses that information with the intent to defraud the victim for his own benefit or for the benefit of another unauthorized individual. The General Assembly, in enacting the identity theft statute, was aware of the extensive and often continuing harm done to a victim\u2019s finances\u2014and financial reputation\u2014resulting from identity theft. <em>Cf </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(E) (providing that a defendant convicted of identity theft may be held responsible for restitution including the cost of correcting errors or inaccuracies in the victim\u2019s credit report or other identifying information).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Therefore, we find that, although credit card theft is completed when the card is taken, identity theft continues after the identity is illegally taken from its lawful owner. As the Supreme Court of Washington explained in <em>State v. Leyda, </em>157 Wash.2d 335, 138 P.3d 610 (2006), when discussing units of prosecution, \u201c[OJnce the accused has engaged in any one of the statutorily proscribed acts against a particular victim, and thereby committed the crime of identity theft, the unit of prosecution includes any subsequent proscribed conduct, such as using the victim\u2019s information to purchase goods after first unlawfully obtaining such information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 138 P.3d at 616. Essentially, the Washington court classified identity theft as a continuing offense. <em>See id. </em>at 348, 138 P.3d at 618. Although not controlling, of course, the rationale expressed in <em>Leyda </em>resonates persuasively. The Washington court\u2019s description of the continuing nature of identity theft fits nicely with our description of a continuing offense as \u201c \u2018a continuous, unlawful act or series of acts set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force, however long a time it may occupy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morris, </em>51 Va.App. at 467, 658 S.E.2d at 712 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>(quoting <em>United States v. Midstate Horticultural Company, </em>306 U.S. 161, 166, 59 S.Ct. 412, 414, 83 L.Ed. 563 (1939)).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Virginia appellate courts have not specifically addressed the question of whether identity theft under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A) constitutes a continuing offense, but an Alabama case, <em>Ex parte Egbuonu, </em>911 So.2d 748 (Ala.Crim.App. 2004), is instructive. There, the Alabama court considered a statute nearly identical to the Virginia identity theft statute<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and held that \u201c[identity theft, by its definition, is a continuing offense that in most instances will occur in more than one county or even more than one state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 753. The view of the Washington and Alabama courts that classifies identity theft as a continuing offense comports with the holdings of numerous other state appellate courts that have addressed the issue. <em>See State v. Meza, </em>38 Kan.App.2d 245, 165 P.3d 298 (2007); <em>State v. Mayze, </em>280 Ga. 5, 622 S.E.2d 836 (2005); <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>246 Wis.2d 802, 633 N.W.2d 656 (2001). We hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3 likewise provides for a continuing offense rather than an offense that terminates with the taking of the identifying information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that appellant\u2019s theft of Ms. Keltz\u2019s identity in case number CR05-1243 commenced with his unlawful obtaining of Ms. Keltz\u2019s credit card number, included the act of recording and accessing the number, and continued beyond his attempted use of the credit card number at the store in Alexandria, until he was apprehended in Arlington still possessing the victim\u2019s identifying information. Our holding here recognizes that identity theft, by its very nature, is a continuing offense against the victim. Once an individual\u2019s identifying information is stolen, and the perpetrator possesses the victim\u2019s identifying information, the offense cannot conclude until the information is returned to the victim (in such a way that the perpetrator no longer retains it) or the perpetrator\u2019s fraudulent intent to use the identifying information no longer exists.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In case number CR05-1243, appellant committed several prohibited acts under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A), which comprised one continuing offense of identity theft against Ms. Keltz.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">b. Whether \u201cAny Part\u201d of the Continuing Offense Occurred in Arlington</p>\n<p id=\"Ato\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D), we still must determine whether there existed a strong presumption that \u201cany part\u201d of the continuing offense of identity theft occurred in Arlington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>County. Appellant argues that, even assuming identity theft is a continuing offense, the Commonwealth failed to establish the required strong presumption with respect to Arlington, because the Commonwealth proved only that he attempted to obtain goods or services with Ms. Keltz\u2019s identifying information in Alexandria, rather than Arlington. Appellant contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) required the Commonwealth to establish the strong presumption that he committed an act proscribed under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A)\u2014obtaining, recording, or accessing Ms. Keltz\u2019s identifying information, or obtaining goods and services through her identifying information\u2014while in Arlington. Without such a showing, appellant claims, no \u201cpart\u201d of the offense took place in Arlington under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D). We disagree with appellant\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We recognize, as the trial court recognized below, that the General Assembly enacted a \u201cvery broad\u201d special venue provision for identity theft offenses. Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) contrasts with, and is a notable exception to, the general venue statute providing that \u201cthe prosecution of a criminal case shall be had in the county or city in which <em>the offense </em>was committed.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-244 (emphasis added). <em>Green </em>illustrates the vast difference between the general venue provision in Code \u00a7 19.2-244 and the special identity theft venue provision in Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) at issue here. This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Green </em>is the only previously published appellate opinion in Virginia to mention the phrase \u201cany part of the offense\u201d\u2014 which is included in Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D), but does not appear in Code \u00a7 19.2-244\u2014in the context of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In <em>Green, </em>the defendant was convicted of several drug offenses in the City of Suffolk, including transporting one ounce or more of cocaine into the Commonwealth with the intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.01. <em>Green, </em>32 Va.App. at 441, 448, 528 S.E.2d at 188-89, 192. The evidence established that a package containing more than an ounce of cocaine entered Virginia, but was intercepted by a drug task force agent in the City of Newport News; by the time the defendant signed for the package in Suffolk, the authorities had removed all but one gram of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>442-43, 528 S.E.2d at 189. The defendant argued that venue for the Code \u00a7 18.2-248.01 offense was improper in Suffolk because the package did not contain at least one ounce of cocaine when it reached that city. <em>Id. </em>at 446\u201447, 528 S.E.2d at 191. The Commonwealth contended that venue was proper in Suffolk, because it was a place where \u201cany part of the offense was committed\u201d or, as applied to Code \u00a7 18.2-248.01, a jurisdiction where it could be shown that at least some of the drugs intended to be transported into Virginia had been passed. <em>Id. </em>at 447, 528 S.E.2d at 191. This Court rejected the'Commonwealth\u2019s contention, holding that venue in Code \u00a7 18.2-248.01 prosecutions (governed by the general venue statute, Code \u00a7 19.2-244) is proper only in jurisdictions \u201cwhere the required elements of the offense have been established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 528 S.E.2d at 192. We concluded that venue was improper in Suffolk on the Code \u00a7 18.2-248.01 charge because no evidence established that the completed transportation of one ounce or more of cocaine occurred in that jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 528 S.E.2d at 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Here, unlike in <em>Green, </em>the Commonwealth was permitted by Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) to demonstrate Arlington was an appropriate venue by establishing the strong presumption that <em>\u201cany part </em>of the [identity theft] offense\u201d of Ms. Keltz occurred in that county. (Emphasis added). This distinction is greatly significant here. Had Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) not existed, and had venue in this case instead been controlled by the general venue statute, the Commonwealth would have been required to establish the strong presumption of a completed offense in Arlington. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-244. Because Ms. Keltz was not an Arlington resident, the Commonwealth would have been required to establish the strong presumption that, with the intent to defraud, appellant obtained, recorded, or accessed Ms. Keltz\u2019s identifying information, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A)(1), or obtained goods or services through her identifying information, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A)(2), while in Arlington. Any one act of obtaining, <em>or </em>recording, <em>or </em>accessing the identifying information, <em>or </em>obtaining goods or services through the identifying information, with the requisite intent to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>fraud, could potentially have constituted a completed offense of identity theft, but to obtain venue in Arlington under Code \u00a7 19.2-244, the Commonwealth would have been required to demonstrate that this completed offense occurred in Arlington.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">This is appellant\u2019s position, except for his recognition of a clause in Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) that the defendant need not ever have been physically present in a locality for venue to be proper there. Appellant devotes much attention to this clause in his supplemental brief. He asserts that this one clause underscores the General Assembly\u2019s purpose for enacting the special venue provision for identity theft offenses, which, he claims, was to facilitate prosecutions of computer hackers with remote access to a victim\u2019s computer and, therefore, access to a victim\u2019s identifying information. Otherwise, appellant contends, the general venue standard of Cod\u00e9 \u00a7 19.2-244 is essentially unchanged for identity theft offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">However, the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) specifically for identity theft offenses, and that statute uses precisely the same \u201cany part of the offense\u201d language that was asserted by the Commonwealth in <em>Green, </em>but was rejected there because that was a case where venue actually was governed under Code \u00a7 19.2-244. Unlike in <em>Green, </em>the Commonwealth here was not required to establish the strong presumption that a <em>completed </em>identity theft occurred in Arlington in order to demonstrate Arlington was an appropriate venue under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D). If the General Assembly had intended to require such a showing, Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) would have specified that venue for identity theft offenses is proper in any locality \u201cwhere the person whose identifying information was appropriated resides, or the locality in which <em>[the offense </em>] took place, regardless of whether the defendant was ever actually in such locality.\u201d To require this demonstration under the actual language of Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>would essentially impose the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-244 on an identity theft proceeding and would, in effect, excise the \u201cany part of the offense\u201d language from Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D)\u2014which we, as an appellate court, of course, are not permitted to do. <em>See Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 630, 634, 652 S.E.2d 111, 113 (2007) (\u201cThis Court is not free to ignore language contained in a statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Instead, Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) required the Commonwealth here to establish the strong presumption that <em>any part </em>of the offense of obtaining, or recording, or accessing the identifying information, or obtaining of goods or services using that identifying information, occurred in Arlington\u2014whether or not appellant was ever physically in Arlington. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party in the trial court, the required strong presumption that any part of the identity theft offense against Ms. Keltz in case number CR05-1243 occurred in Arlington was established here.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument to the contrary,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the possession of a victim\u2019s identifying information with the intent to defraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the victim is <em>a part </em>of the continuing offense of identity theft. <em>Meeks </em>is again instructive. That case involved the credit card theft statute, which, like the identity theft statute, does not <em>expressly </em>prohibit the defendant from \u201cpossessing\u201d the victim\u2019s credit card or credit card number. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-192 (prohibiting, in pertinent part, the <em>taking, obtaining, </em>or <em>withholding </em>of a credit card or credit card number \u201cfrom the person, possession, custody or control of another without the cardholder\u2019s consent\u201d (emphasis added)). The Supreme Court observed in <em>Meeks </em>that, under its prior opinion in <em>Cheatham, </em>which <em>Meeks </em>overruled, \u201ca person could be charged with credit card theft in <em>every jurisdiction </em>entered while still <em>in possession </em>of the stolen credit card or number with the <em>intent </em>to use it.\u201d <em>Meeks, </em>274 Va. at 803, 651 S.E.2d at 640 (emphasis added). The overruling of <em>Cheatham </em>was necessary because, as discussed above, the crime of credit card theft concludes with the unlawful taking of an individual\u2019s credit card or credit card number.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In contrast, unlike credit card theft, which is completed in the locality where the card or number is unlawfully taken from its rightful owner or is received with knowledge that it has been taken and with the intent to use it, identity theft is a continuing offense, as discussed <em>supra. </em>The offense necessarily continues for as long as the perpetrator is in unlawful possession of the victim\u2019s identifying information with the intent to use the victim\u2019s identity in a fraudulent manner, and, therefore, possession of the identifying information with the intent to defraud must be considered a \u201cpart\u201d of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike on venue grounds, the trial court properly found that appellant possessed Ms. Keltz\u2019s identifying information (together with the equipment to record and access this information) while in Arlington County, up to and including the moment he was stopped for speeding in that county. Appellant clearly committed a part of the identity theft, the unlawful possession of Ms. Keltz\u2019s identifying information, in Arlington. In addition, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>court also found that appellant had the intent to defraud Ms. Keltz. The evidence established a strong inference that appellant intended to use Ms. Keltz\u2019s information to commit fraud when he possessed it in Arlington County on September 21, 2005, as illustrated by his attempted use of her credit card number earlier that same day, his continuing course of conduct on that day, and his retention of Ms. Keltz\u2019s information after his unsuccessful attempt to use it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A) includes the intent to defraud as an element of the crime of identity theft, and we find the evidence was also sufficient to infer appellant had that intent while he was in Arlington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Because appellant unlawfully possessed Ms. Keltz\u2019s identifying information and had the intent to defraud her while in Arlington County, we find the evidence sufficiently strong to presume that appellant committed a part of the offense of identity theft while in Arlington County. Accordingly, we conclude there was a strong presumption established that venue was proper in Arlington for the prosecution of case number CR05-1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">2. Credit Card Fraud (Case Number CR06-449)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Appellant also argues that venue was improper in Arlington County for the prosecution of an indictment for credit card fraud listing Gerald Kent as the victim. The credit card fraud offense occurred when Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>number was used to obtain a laptop computer at a Fairfax County computer store.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant contends that venue was improper in Arlington because the offense in case number CR06-449 was completed in Fairfax, and, he claims, there was no evidence that any act in furtherance of this particular offense occurred in Arlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">At the time of the offense in case number CR06-449, the special venue statute concerning credit card offenses read, \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 19.2-244, a prosecution for a violation of this article may be had in any county or city in which (i) <em>any act </em>in furtherance of the crime was committed or (ii) an issuer or acquirer, or an agent of either, sustained a financial loss as a result of the offense.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-198.1 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court, in considering the \u201cexpansive\u201d venue statute here, accepted the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that appellant\u2019s possession of Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number while in Arlington prior to the offense was \u201can act in furtherance of\u2019 the credit card fraud against Mr. Kent that occurred in Fairfax. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-198.1(i). Therefore, the trial court found that venue was proper in Arlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We must determine on appeal whether the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as the party that prevailed below, is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s venue findings. <em>Morris, </em>51 Va.App. at 464-65, 658 S.E.2d at 710-11. The Commonwealth was required to establish a strong presumption under Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014198. l(i) that an act in furtherance of the credit card fraud offense against Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Kent in case number CR06-449 occurred in Arlington. <em>See Meeks, </em>274 Va. at 803, 651 S.E.2d at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-195 lists the various means by which a defendant commits credit card fraud. Tracking the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-195(l)(a), the indictment in case number CR06449 alleged that appellant used Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number for the purpose of obtaining money, goods, or services and that appellant knew the card had been obtained in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-192 (the credit card theft statute) or was expired or revoked. Although the evidence proved that Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number was unlawfully and fraudulently used to obtain goods in Fairfax, venue here is not limited to the locality where the crime was completed, in the manner that venue is limited when Code \u00a7 19.2-244 applies. Instead, the special venue statute for credit card offenses was enacted \u201c[notwithstanding the provisions of the general venue statute.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-198.1. Pursuant to that special venue statute, we must determine whether there is a strong presumption that <em>any act </em>in furtherance of the charged credit card fraud offense here occurred in Arlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The phrase \u201cany act in furtherance of the crime\u201d has not yet been interpreted by Virginia\u2019s appellate courts in relation to a completed credit card fraud offense, but many cases have discussed acts in furtherance of an offense in other contexts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> An act in furtherance of the offense is a direct act toward the commission of an offense, <em>see Tharrington v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 491, 496, 346 S.E.2d 337, 340 (1986), and need not in itself even be criminal or unlawful, <em>see Hodge v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 351, 356, 374 S.E.2d 76, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>79 (1988). Under the facts before us here, we find that appellant\u2019s possession of Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number in Arlington prior to the credit card fraud offense was an act in furtherance of crime. In order to \u201cuse\u201d Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number in a fraudulent manner, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-195(l)(a), it is axiomatic that he was required to possess the credit card number. Appellant\u2019s possession of Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number while in Arlington, therefore, was a direct act toward his subsequent commission of the credit card offense in case number CR06-449.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">This finding is made clearer still by considering other means by which the Commonwealth may prove a defendant committed credit card fraud. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-195(l)(b), a defendant commits credit card fraud when he or she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATV\">[o]btains money, goods, services or anything else of value by representing (i) without the consent of the cardholder that he is the <em>holder </em>of a specified card or credit card number or (ii) that he is the <em>holder </em>of a card or credit card number and such card or credit card number has not in fact been issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8k\">(Emphasis added). In <em>Saponaro v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va. App. 149, 152, 655 S.E.2d 49, 50 (2008), we defined \u201cholder\u201d in the context of Code \u00a7 18.2-195(l)(b) as \u201cone <em>in possession </em>of the cardholder\u2019s credit card.\u201d (Emphasis added). Because the credit card fraud statute concerns both credit cards and credit card numbers, a defendant can also \u201chold\u201d a credit card number under Code \u00a7 18.2-195 by possessing the cardholder\u2019s credit card number, for instance, by inserting the credit card number in an electronic device that is in his possession. By possessing the credit card or credit card number, a defendant commits an act in furtherance of the offense of credit card fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Although appellant was charged and convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-195(l)(a), rather than Code \u00a7 18.2-195(l)(b), the nature of the offense is similar under both subsections. Rather than obtaining goods by fraudulently representing that he was the holder of the credit card, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-195(l)(b), appellant fraudulently used Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>goods, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-195(l)(a). Without possessing Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number, he could not have used the credit card number in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-195. Appellant\u2019s possession of Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number, therefore, was an act in furtherance of the credit card fraud offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Furthermore, appellant\u2019s possession of many stolen credit card numbers (including Mr. Kent\u2019s) must be viewed in the full context of his activities while he was in Virginia. Not only did appellant possess these credit card numbers, but, as the prosecutor argued in the trial court, he had also assembled a \u201cre-encoding shop\u201d inside his truck. Appellant held these stolen credit card numbers on his laptop, and he readily possessed the means to encode these credit card numbers on fabricated credit cards in order to make the fraudulent purchases. It was through these sophisticated means that appellant\u2014already in possession of Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number\u2014fraudulently used the credit card number in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-195. Appellant\u2019s possession of the stolen credit card number while in Arlington was clearly an act in furtherance of this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party below, we agree with the trial court that appellant\u2019s possession of Mr. Kent\u2019s credit card number in Arlington created the requisite strong presumption that an act in furtherance of this particular credit card fraud offense occurred in Arlington, as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-198.1(i). Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s credit card fraud conviction in case number CR06449.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">3. Credit Card Theft (Case Numbers CR05-1231 through CR05-1240, CR06-453 through CR06-469, and CR06752 through CR06-760)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Appellant belatedly argues that venue for all credit card theft charges did not lie in Arlington County. He did not raise the issue of venue in relation to the credit card theft charges at trial. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-244 (requiring that questions of venue be raised prior to the verdict). He did not raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>this issue in relation to the credit card theft convictions in his petition for appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:12(c) (\u201cOnly questions presented in the petition for appeal will be noticed by the Court of Appeals.\u201d). No exception applies to these requirements in Code \u00a7 19.2-244 or in Rule 5A:12; therefore, appellant\u2019s argument, made for the first time after the appeal was granted, is too late to permit review by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">B. Double Jeopardy (Case Numbers CR05-1241, CR06-452, CR05-1242, and CR06-451)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Appellant argues that his simultaneous convictions for identity theft (case number CR05-1241) and credit card fraud (case number CR06-452) were improper because the convictions punished him for the same act/offense twice in a single proceeding, in violation of the principles underlying double jeopardy protections. Appellant also argues that another set of simultaneous convictions, identity theft (case number CR05-1242) and credit card fraud (case number CR06-451), were improper for the same reason. We hold no violation of double jeopardy principles occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The test devised in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), governs our analysis. Under this test, appellate courts must determine \u201c \u2018whether each [offense charged] requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 196, 200, 539 S.E.2d 732, 734 (2001) (quoting <em>Blockburger, </em>.284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182) (brackets in original). If each offense requires, in the abstract, proof of an additional element, then double jeopardy protections do not apply and both convictions will stand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Here, it is clear that each charge constituted a separate crime, and neither conviction punished a lesser-included offense of the other. Stated broadly, the credit card fraud statute criminalizes the act of \u201cobtaining money, goods, services or anything else of value\u201d through the fraudulent use of a credit card or credit card number that was acquired either by means of credit card theft under Code \u00a7 18.2-192 or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>other fraudulent means. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-195. Identity theft, by contrast, involves the compromised security of several types of identifying information, including credit card numbers. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-186.8(C). Credit card fraud is committed by obtaining money, goods, services, or anything else of value, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-195, whereas identity theft can be committed by obtaining, recording, or accessing an individual\u2019s identifying information, or by obtaining goods or services through the use of the identifying information, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A). Furthermore, the amount of loss associated with credit card fraud is limited to the value of \u201call goods, services, and anything else of value actually furnished,\u201d <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-195(3), whereas the amount of loss associated with identity theft is not necessarily limited by the value of goods or services fraudulently obtained, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D). Therefore, several factors distinguish the two offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Although appellant accurately notes that he committed the respective crimes in a similar manner, this fact does not render the convictions improper. Under the <em>Blockburger </em>test, we examine \u201c \u2018the offenses charged in the abstract, without referring to the particular facts of the case under review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schwartz v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 407, 441, 611 S.E.2d 631, 648 (2005) (quoting <em>Coleman, </em>261 Va. at 200, 539 S.E.2d at 734). Viewed in the abstract, identity theft and credit card fraud are separate offenses punishable in a single criminal proceeding. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s convictions for identity theft and for credit card fraud were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">C. Possession of Burglarious Tools (Case Number CR06^440)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to strike a charge of possession of burglarious tools, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. The charge related to appellant\u2019s possession of electronic devices, such as the laptop and the remagging device, that he used to record and encode the victims\u2019 identifying information on the fabricated credit cards. Appellant contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-94 is not applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>ble to statutory offenses involving the credit card crimes for which he was convicted. Therefore, appellant contends that his conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-94 was improper.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">\u201cIf any person have in his possession any tools, implements or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny, upon conviction thereof he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-94. Therefore, Code \u00a7 18.2-94 prohibits the possession of a tool, implement or outfit \u201cwith the requisite intent\u201d to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny. <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 402, 408-09, 672 S.E.2d 894, 897 (2009) (en banc). If the Commonwealth failed to demonstrate this requisite intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny, then it would logically follow that the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed an offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The Commonwealth did not charge appellant with burglary, robbery, or larceny; however, the Commonwealth contends the evidence proved that appellant possessed the laptop and remagger device \u201cwith a larcenous intent to steal.\u201d Ample evidence established the inference that appellant intended to defraud his victims, but whether appellant intended to commit larceny is a separate matter. Larceny, a common law crime, is \u201cthe -wrongful or fraudulent taking of another\u2019s property without his permission and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property.\u201d <em>Britt v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 569, 574, 667 S.E.2d 763, 765 (2008). At no time during appellant\u2019s trial did the Commonwealth establish that he intended to commit common law larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 276, 281, 549 S.E.2d 624, 626 (2001), we considered whether two counts of credit card theft should have been merged with one count of petit larceny under the single larceny doctrine. In holding that the trial court appropriately declined to merge the three counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>into a single larceny, we reviewed the common law rule that only a credit card itself\u2014and not the line of credit it represented\u2014could be the subject of larceny. <em>Id. </em>at 281, 549 S.E.2d at 626. We held that the General Assembly enacted the credit card theft statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-192, with the intent to create \u201ca very distinct offense, different from and in abrogation of, the common law offense of larceny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, we held that petit larceny is not a lesser-included offense of credit card theft. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 549 S.E.2d at 626-27. It is clear under <em>Scott, </em>therefore, that credit card theft is a different offense than common law larceny. Thus, in proving appellant had the intent to commit credit card fraud, the Commonwealth did not also prove that he intended to commit common law larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">While appellant fraudulently obtained (or attempted to obtain) goods or services using stolen credit card numbers, these statutorily enacted offenses constituted different crimes than common law larceny. These offenses are also unlike the crime of obtaining money by false pretenses. A person who obtains money by false pretenses is deemed guilty of larceny, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-178, and multiple charges of obtaining money by false pretenses are appropriately merged under the single larceny doctrine, <em>see Millard v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 202, 206, 539 S.E.2d 84, 86 (2000). Here, the Commonwealth provides no real basis for its contention that appellant actually intended to commit common law larceny\u2014as opposed to the crime for which he was charged\u2014other than its claim that appellant vaguely intended \u201cto steal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Therefore, the Commonwealth failed to establish that appellant possessed the laptop and remagging device with the intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Consequently, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of burglarious tools and dismiss the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>D. Duplicity and Jury Unanimity (Case Numbers CR05-1241 and CR05-1242)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Appellant next argues that the indictments charging identity theft in case numbers CR05-1241 (involving Gerald Kent) and CR05-1242 (involving Iris Keltz) were duplicitous because the two indictments both alleged violations of both subsections of Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A), which appellant claims created two separate and unrelated offenses. Furthermore, appellant contends that, because the trial court did not compel the Commonwealth to elect one subsection of Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A) upon which to proceed, and because Jury Instruction 10 pertaining to these charges did not cure the alleged error, it was impossible to determine if the jury unanimously found him guilty using the same specific identity theft offense subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Turning first to appellant\u2019s argument with respect to Jury Instruction 10 and jury unanimity, the Commonwealth correctly points out that appellant failed to preserve the issue for appeal. Appellant never raised a jury unanimity contention in the trial court with respect to Jury Instruction 10, relating to identity theft. Although he did raise the issue of duplicity, and \u201c[jury] unanimity is closely related to the issue of duplicity,\u201d <em>United States v. Correa-Ventura, </em>6 F.3d 1070, 1081 (5th Cir.1993), the same objection or argument must be made at trial as the one presented on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Chase v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 194, 197, 555 S.E.2d 422, 424 (2001). Therefore, appellant\u2019s jury unanimity argument is defaulted under Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Moreover, we find no basis upon which to conclude that Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A) is susceptible to duplicitous prosecutions here. An indictment \u201cmay contain any number of counts charging the commission of a single offense, stated in different ways so as to meet the varying phases of proof that might be offered.\u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 850, 853, 183 S.E. 173, 174 (1936). Therefore, although Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A) may be violated in different ways, the Commonwealth may allege and prove any one or all of those methods in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>attempt to establish a defendant\u2019s guilt. Because identity theft is a continuing offense, the thefts here were related, not unrelated. <em>See Bragg v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 607, 615, 593 S.E.2d 558, 562 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">We find that the crimes described in Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A) stem from the same act of identity theft that appellant committed against the victim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s duplicity argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">E. Warrantless Jail Cell Search and Seizure</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Appellant argues lastly that the prison officials\u2019 pretrial, warrantless search of his jail cell, and the resulting seizure of the Romanian-language documents that he claims were prepared to assist in an unrelated federal matter, violated his Fourth Amendment protection against unlawful search and seizures and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201csociety is not prepared to recognize as legitimate any subjective expectation of privacy that a prisoner might have in his prison cell and that, accordingly, the Fourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches does not apply within the confines of the prison cell.\u201d <em>Megel v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 531, 535, 551 S.E.2d 638, 641 (2001) (citing <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 526, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3200, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984)). Citing <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>796 F.2d 20 (2d Cir.1986), appellant attempts to differentiate <em>Megel </em>and <em>Hudson </em>by arg-uing that those cases apply only to post-trial prisoners rather than to pre-trial detainees. However, in <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the United States Supreme Court upheld a room search rule against a Fourth Amendment challenge by pre-trial detainees. The Court in that case \u201csimply assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>pretrial detainee retained at least a \u2018diminished expectation of privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 525 n. 6, 104 S.Ct. at 3199 n. 6 (quoting <em>Bell, </em>441 U.S. at 557, 99 S.Ct. at 1883).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We see no need to address the distinction between pre-trial detainees and post-trial prisoners made by the Second Circuit in <em>Cohen, </em>because the documents under dispute here were never placed before the jury. The Commonwealth never even attempted to introduce any of these documents into evidence. Therefore, even assuming without deciding that the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment motion was error, any such error was, consequently, \u201charmless, and thus excusable,\u201d because it \u201cappears \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quinn v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 702, 719, 492 S.E.2d 470, 479 (1997) (quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)); see Code \u00a7 8.01-678.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Appellant also argues that his right to an attorney-client privilege under the Sixth Amendment was violated by the search and seizure of papers from his jail cell and that, therefore, this alleged violation requires dismissal of all his convictions. We again disagree with appellant, who essentially argues that the per se dismissal rule applies to his case and requires this result. \u201cThe per se [dismissal] rule represents a moral as well as a legal condemnation of such egregious and unequivocal conduct for which sanctions are imposed against the Government as punishment regardless of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Gartner, </em>518 F.2d 633, 637 (2d Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Here, we disagree with appellant\u2019s basic premise on his Sixth Amendment argument. Dismissal is rarely the appropriate remedy when faced with a violation of the right to counsel. <em>See United States v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 101 S.Ct. 665, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981). \u201cCases involving Sixth Amendment deprivations are subject to the general rule that remedies should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>on competing interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 101 S.Ct. at 668. The Supreme Court of the United States has explained, \u201c[T]he remedy characteristically imposed is not to dismiss the indictment but to suppress the evidence or to order a new trial if the evidence has been wrongfully admitted and the defendant [has been] convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365, 101 S.Ct. at 668. \u201cMore particularly, absent demonstrable prejudice, or substantial threat thereof, dismissal of the indictment is plainly inappropriate, even though the violation may have been deliberate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dismissal may only be appropriate where there is \u201ccontinuing prejudice\u201d which cannot \u201cbe remedied by a new trial or suppression of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. at 669 n.2. Logic would seem to dictate that dismissal would be even less appropriate as a sanction when, as here, the alleged misconduct related to an entirely different case, being prosecuted by a different sovereign\u2014the government of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Here, furthermore, the Commonwealth\u2019s seizure of the materials relating to the federal case\u2014assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that it even implicated the Sixth Amendment\u2014was not the result of egregious conduct and certainly did not prejudice appellant\u2019s defense. The trial court found the seized materials had no connection to these charges in Arlington, were not materials appellant intended to provide to his counsel in this case, and were in fact written with the intent to give to federal authorities. Given that the trial court\u2019s findings here were certainly not plainly wrong, dismissal of appellant\u2019s convictions, as he requests, simply is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and dismiss appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of burglarious tools in case number CR06-440, and we otherwise affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, and reversed and dismissed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\">. Previously, after earlier argument in this case, we dismissed appellant's appeal with respect to several convictions where he failed to list the case numbers corresponding to these convictions on his notice of appeal. However, we since granted appellant's petition for rehearing and his motion for delayed appeal, and so we withdrew our prior opinion in this case. Therefore, appellant\u2019s appeal of all convictions is presently before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\">.

The indictment in case number CR05-1243 substantially followed this language, with the addition that such conviction would constitute a second or subsequent conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\">.

The dissent states that identity theft cannot be classified as a continuing offense, because, whereas asportation is an element of the crime of larceny that can cause a larceny to be a continuing offense, no asportation generally occurs with identity theft so that asportation is not, and really cannot generally be, an element of identity theft. It is true that identity theft does not involve the taking of <em>physical </em>property from place to place. Rather, identity theft is the theft not of goods, but of one\u2019s own <em>identity, </em>in the form of certain qualifying personal identifying information. An individual such as Ms. Keltz is deprived of exclusive possession of her own identity from the moment the identifying infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>mation is illegally obtained with intent to defraud by the perpetrator until the perpetrator relinquishes the information or the victim is otherwise notified of the identity theft. As other state appellate courts holding that identity theft is a continuing offense have remarked, the unusual and highly sophisticated nature of the offense does not easily lend itself to familiar concepts involving the theft of mere chattel. <em>See Meza, </em>38 Kan.App.2d at 250, 165 P.3d at 302 (commenting that identity theft \"hardly qualifies as garden-variety theft\" as it is \u201cthe product of the Information Age\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\">. To illustrate the offense's pervasive and continuing nature, Ms. Keltz testified that she was surprised when the Arlington police notified her that the security of the particular credit card number at issue here\u2014as well as other credit card numbers illegally obtained by appellant\u2014had been compromised, because the physical credit card itself was in her wallet; furthermore, Ms. Keltz did not even realize her debit card number had also perhaps been compromised until the day she testified at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">. Otherwise, the Commonwealth would have been required to demonstrate that the victim resided in Arlington, which the parties agree was not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\">. Appellant insists that his possession of Ms. Keltz\u2019s identifying information in Arlington cannot constitute a \"part'' of the offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) if he did not commit a statutorily prescribed act there while possessing the identifying information. It bears repeating that a \"part\" of the offense for the purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) need not be the actual obtaining, recording, or accessing of a victim\u2019s identifying information, or the obtaining of goods or services using such information, since any one of these acts could constitute a complete offense when done with the intent to defraud. \"[W]e must assume that the General Assembly chose, with care, the words it used in enacting the statute,\u201d <em>Halifax Corp. v. First Union Nat'l Bank, </em>262 Va. 91, 100, 546 S.E.2d 696, 702 (2001), and, here, it is apparent that the General Assembly carefully inserted the words \"any part of the offense\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) so as to distinguish venue in identity theft cases from venue generally. Otherwise, prosecutions under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(A)(1), for instance, could be rendered futile for lack of an appropriate venue if no evidence established the precise locality where a victim\u2019s identifying information was obtained, recorded, or accessed by an identity thief equipped with remote computer access or otherwise on the move. The General Assembly, in its wisdom, enacted Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) to grant the Commonwealth necessary latitude in prosecuting a sophisticated identity theft crime such as appellant committed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\">. The dissent states that an appropriate analogy to this case would be an instance where a thief \u201dhappen[s] to drive through\u201d a county while still possessing the intent to deprive the victim of property, but while the stolen property is not in that county. In such a circumstance, the dissent notes, venue would not be proper in that county. Here, however, appellant both possessed Ms. Keltz's identifying information and had the intent to commit fraud while in Arlington County. Furthermore, the stricter standard for establishing that venue is appropriate in a larceny prosecution is not at issue here, given the enactment by the General Assembly of a venue statute applicable specifically to identity theft. As discussed above, the Commonwealth was required to establish only that any part of the offense of identity theft occurred in Arlington in order to establish that venue in Arlington was indeed proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">. After the fraudulent transaction at the Fairfax computer store, appellant purchased another laptop with Mr. Kent's credit card number, this time at a computer 'store in Arlington.

Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 36, 393 S.E.2d 599, 604 (1990)). \u201cThis may be accomplished by either direct or circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Normally, \u201cvenue is appropriate in any jurisdiction where the required elements of the offense have been established.\u201d <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 438, 449, 528 S.E.2d 187, 192 (2000). In cases involving violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3, the General Assembly has specifically determined where venue is proper. Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) provides that, in such cases, \u201c[t]he crime shall be considered to have been committed [1] in any locality where the person whose identifying information was appropriated resides, or [2] in which any part of the offense took place, regardless of whether the defendant was ever actually in such locality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The victim in this case, Iris Keltz (\u201cKeltz\u201d), did not reside in Arlington County at the time of the offense. Thus, in order to prove venue, the Commonwealth must have presented evidence creating a strong presumption that some \u201cpart of the offense\u201d took place in Arlington. Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3 defines the offense of identity theft as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">A. It shall be unlawful for any person, without the authorization or permission of the person or persons who are the subjects of the identifying information, with the intent to defraud, for his own use or the use of a third person, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">1. <em>Obtain, record or access </em>identifying information which is not available to the general public that would assist in accessing financial resources, obtaining identification documents, or obtaining benefits of such other person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">2. <em>Obtain </em>goods or services through the use of identifying information of such other person....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Therefore, for prosecution to be proper in Arlington County, the Commonwealth must show that Gheorghiu either (1) obtained, recorded or accessed Keltz\u2019s information in Arlington, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>or (2) that he used Keltz\u2019s information to obtain goods or services in Arlington. As the majority concedes, there is no evidence supporting either conclusion. Given that Ms. Keltz does not live in Arlington, the majority\u2019s concession would seem to be dispositive of the issue but, instead, the majority presents two alternative and quite novel reasons why venue was proper in Arlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The majority\u2019s first approach to finding venue to have been proper in Arlington is that Gheorghiu \u201cclearly committed a part of the identity theft, the unlawful possession of Ms. Keltz\u2019s identifying information\u201d in Arlington. Its secondary theory is that identity theft is a continuing offense and he possessed the credit card information while in Arlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Insofar as the majority\u2019s first holding is concerned, in my view the word \u201cpart\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3(D) is simply a synonym for the term \u201celement\u201d and, in context, it seems obvious to me that the General Assembly intended for venue to lie in any jurisdiction where it could be established that an act constituting an element of the offense occurred. Possession, though, is not an element of identity theft. Although possession is certainly incidental to the statutory elements, as it is with any number of offenses, possession is not itself an element of the offense. Had the General Assembly wished to punish the mere possession of someone else\u2019s identifying information, it certainly could have done so. However, it chose only to criminalize the acts of obtaining, recording, accessing, and using such information or obtaining goods or services through the use of such information. \u201cWhere the General Assembly has expressed its intent in clear and unequivocal terms, it is not the province of the judiciary to add words to the statute or alter its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>269 Va. 303, 313, 608 S.E.2d 901, 906 (2005). In the case of identity theft, the General Assembly has required that some \u201cpart of the offense\u201d occur in a locality in order for that locality to have jurisdiction. Because possession of the identifying information of another is not an element of identity theft, it is not \u201cpart\u201d of that offense and cannot, standing alone, provide a basis for venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Furthermore, and contrary to the holding of the majority, neither is identity theft a continuing offense that can be prosecuted in any jurisdiction where the offender travels while possessing stolen credit card information. Over a century ago, our Supreme Court explained the continuing offense doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">It has been a settled principle of the common law, from an early day, in England, that where property is stolen in one county, and the thief has been found, with the stolen property in his possession, in another county, he may be tried in either. This practice prevailed notwithstanding the general rule that every prosecution for a criminal cause must be in the county where the crime was committed. The exception to the general rule grew out of a fiction of the law, that, where property has been feloniously taken, <em>every act of removal or change of possession by the thief constituted a new taking and asportation </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-6\"><em>Strouther v. Commonwealth, </em>92 Va. 789, 791, 22 S.E. 852, 852 (1895) (citing <em>Cousins\u2019s Case, </em>29 Va. (2 Leigh) 708 (1830)) (emphasis added). Thus, in the case of a larceny, the continuing offense doctrine is predicated on the legal fiction that a new larceny occurs every time a thief moves stolen property. That legal fiction is appropriate because asportation is an element of larceny. By contrast, asportation is not an element of identity theft. There is no legal principle, fictional or not, that dictates that every movement by an identity thief constitutes a new offense of identity theft. Identity theft only occurs where and when someone fraudulently obtains, accesses, records or uses another person\u2019s identifying information. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3. While possession is necessarily incident to obtaining, accessing, recording or using identifying information, the crime is not complete upon the mere possession of the information because the elements of this particular crime require activity by the perpetrator that is active in nature rather than passive. Put another way,, while possession of identifying information may be a consequence of, or a predicate to, several of the required elements, standing alone it is not sufficient to constitute any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Here, in contrast to the continuing offense of common law larceny, <em>none </em>of the acts that constitute the statutory elements of the crime occurred in Arlington County, and the fact that Gheorghiu possessed Keltz\u2019s credit card information in Arlington does not change that.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, even if identity theft were a continuing offense, venue would still be improper in Arlington. The general rule of venue is that \u201cvenue is appropriate in any jurisdiction where the required <em>elements </em>of the offense have been established.\u201d <em>Green, </em>32 Va.App. at 449, 528 S.E.2d at 192 (emphasis added). A thief can be prosecuted in every county in which he carries the stolen property because every time he moves the stolen goods to a different jurisdiction, he commits all of the required elements of larceny\u2014taking and asportation with the intent to permanently deprive the lawful owner thereof. <em>Commonwealth v. Taylor, </em>256 Va. 514, 518, 506 S.E.2d 312, 314 (1998) (listing the elements of larceny). That larceny is a continuing offense does not mean that venue lies wherever a thief travels. Rather, venue is only proper where the thief travels <em>and </em>commits larceny, i.e., wherever he commits a new taking by continued asportation of the stolen goods to the detriment of the owner\u2019s right to possession.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>venue is proper only where Gheorghiu committed any \u201cpart of the offense.\u201d Here, Gheorghiu traveled through Arlington, but there is no evidence of any nexus whatever between any of the statutory elements of identity theft and Arlington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The majority\u2019s remaining basis for holding that venue was appropriate in Arlington County is that Gheorghiu traveled through Arlington while possessing the intent to \u201ccommit fraud.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3. Assuming without agreeing that the evidence proved that Gheorghiu possessed that intent while speeding through Arlington, merely having the intent to commit a crime is likewise insufficient to create venue for prosecution. Generally, in order for venue to he in a particular place, <em>\u201cthe </em>required <em>elements </em>of the offense\u201d must occur in that place. <em>Green, </em>32 Va.App. at 449, 528 S.E.2d at 192 (emphasis added). While intent to defraud must certainly be proven, a particular <em>mens rea </em>is not the gravamen of the crime of identity fraud. Thus, the nature of any continuing offense is that <em>all </em>of the required elements have occurred in each place where prosecution is sought. Even in light of the more relaxed standard for venue found in Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3, to hold that venue is proper wherever Gheorghiu intended to commit fraud, without more, would be akin to holding that venue is proper for possession with intent to distribute drugs wherever a person intends to distribute drugs, regardless of whether that person ever actually possessed drugs in that locale. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>666 F.2d 195, 200 (5th Cir.1982) (holding that venue for possession with intent to distribute is improper in Georgia because the defendant never actually or constructively possessed the drugs in Georgia, despite evidence that the defendant possessed the intent to distribute the drugs while he was in Georgia).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">For example, in a larceny prosecution, venue is proper in any locale where \u201cthe thief has been found, <em>with the stolen property in his possession.\u201d Strouther, </em>92 Va. at 791, 22 S.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>at 852 (emphasis added). That is so, because every time a thief moves the stolen goods, a new larceny occurs. If the thief were to steal a television in Arlington and then take it to his home in Alexandria, venue would be proper in both locations because the elements of larceny occurred in both locations. However, if the thief left the television in Alexandria and drove to Fairfax, he could not be prosecuted in Fairfax, even though he still had the intent to permanently deprive the rightful owner of the television. Fairfax would not be the proper venue because no larceny took place there. It is irrelevant that the thief happened to drive through Fairfax with a larcenous intent. To hold otherwise would be to conclude that a thief can be tried for larceny in any county or city in which he travels <em>regardless of whether he committed a larceny in that jurisdiction. </em>Today, the majority holds that Gheorghiu can be prosecuted for identity theft in Arlington even though he did not commit any \u201cpart of the offense\u201d in Arlington. Because such a holding would largely render meaningless the basic concept that the proper location for a criminal prosecution is the jurisdiction where the crime actually occurred, that is a holding in which I cannot join.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Simply put, the Commonwealth failed to present evidence that Gheorghiu committed any element of this particular offense of identity theft in Arlington County. Therefore, I would hold that the Commonwealth failed to prove that Arlington County was the proper venue for this charge and reverse the conviction on case number CR05-1243 and remand for a new trial in a proper venue if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">II. Credit Card Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Furthermore, though for different reasons, I cannot join the majority\u2019s opinion affirming Gheorghiu\u2019s conviction for credit card fraud pursuant to case number CR06-449, because I believe that the Commonwealth failed to establish venue by proving that Gheorghiu committed an \u201cact in furtherance\u201d of that crime in Arlington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>At the time of Gheorghiu\u2019s offense, Code \u00a7 18.2-198.1 provided that a prosecution for credit card fraud \u201cmay be had in any county or city in which (i) any act in furtherance of the crime was committed or (ii) an issuer or acquirer, or an agent of either, sustained a financial loss as a result of the offense.\u201d The majority holds that, by possessing Gerald Kent\u2019s (\u201cKent\u201d) credit card information in Arlington County, Gheorghiu committed an act in furtherance of the crime of credit card fraud. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The phrase \u201cact in furtherance of the crime\u201d has never been defined with respect to Code \u00a7 18.2-198.1. However, as the General Assembly was surely aware when they included those words in the statute, this phrase is a common term of art in the Commonwealth\u2019s jurisprudence relating to the crime of attempt. An attempt occurs when a person intends to commit a crime and commits \u201c \u2018any slight act done in furtherance of this intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parsons v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 576, 583, 529 S.E.2d 810, 813 (2000) (quoting <em>Siquina v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 694, 701, 508 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1998)). Under the law of attempt, the act in furtherance of the crime \u201cneed not be the last proximate act toward completion, but \u2018it must go beyond mere preparation and be done to produce the intended result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Siquina, </em>28 Va.App. at 701, 508 S.E.2d at 353). Thus, to constitute an act in furtherance, \u201c[tjhere must be some appreciable fragment of the crime committed, it must be in such progress that it will be consummated unless interrupted by circumstances independent of the will of the attempter, and the act must not be equivocal in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Siquina, </em>28 Va.App. at 701, 508 S.E.2d at 353). \u201cThe distinction is that preparation \u2018consists in devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of the offense and [ ] the attempt is a direct movement towards the commission after the preparations are made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashford v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 676, 682, 626 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2006) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>195 Va. 1107, 1111, 81 S.E.2d 574, 577 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Here, Gheorghiu was charged with using Kent\u2019s credit card number for the purpose of obtaining money, goods, or ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>vices, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-195. It is undisputed that Gheorghiu did not use Kent\u2019s credit card number while in Arlington County. The evidence proved that, while in Arlington County, Gheorghiu did nothing more than possess Kent\u2019s credit card number. Although I agree with the majority that, without possessing Kent\u2019s credit card or credit card number, Gheorghiu could not have committed that crime, based upon the substantial body of precedent that construes the phrase \u201cact in furtherance of the crime,\u201d I do not believe the General Assembly intended a different meaning in the context of Code \u00a7 18.2-198.1 and, thus, mere possession cannot be sufficient to establish venue in Arlington. In my view, merely holding the card in his possession is nothing more than \u201cdevising or ai\u2019ranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, possessing credit card information is merely a preparatory step and is not sufficient to constitute an act in furtherance of the crime. Adding strength to this analysis, as the majority notes, in 2008 the General Assembly expanded Code \u00a7 18.2-198.1 to allow for venue in any locality where a credit card number is \u201cpossessed with intent to\u201d commit credit card fraud. That addition to the venue statute is yet another clear indication that the General Assembly did not intend for possession to be sufficient to establish venue under the original statute in effect at the time of Gheorghiu\u2019s trial. Had the original statute allowed prosecution in any venue in which the accused merely possessed a stolen credit card number as the majority holds today, the 2008 amendment would have been entirely unnecessary.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">For the reasons stated, I join in the analysis and judgment of the majority on all issues presented except for those venue issues properly preserved for appeal which relate to identity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>theft, case number CR05-1243 and credit card fraud, case number CR06-449. I would reverse Gheorghiu\u2019s convictions for those offenses and remand those indictments for a new trial in an appropriate venue if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">. With respect to the issue presented regarding Gheorghiu's conviction for possession of burglarious tools, as the majority notes, the Attorney General offered no serious argument that, given our holdings in <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 402, 408-09, 672 S.E.2d 894, 897 (2009) (en banc); <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 276, 549 S.E.2d 624 (2001); and <em>Millard v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 202, 539 S.E.2d 84 (2000), the laptop and remagger could constitute ''implements, tools or an outfit\" to facilitate commission of the offense of larceny, as opposed to other possible statutory offenses, except to repeatedly assert that two of the statutory offenses Gheorghiu was charged with used the word \u201ctheft\" in their title and conceded that prosecution might have been more appropriate under Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014 196(l)(b) for criminal possession of credit card forgery devices (prohibiting the possession \"with knowledge of its character, machinery, plates or any other contrivance designed to reproduce instruments purporting to be credit cards ...\").</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">I agree entirely with the analysis and judgment of the majority in holding that the evidence presented was insufficient given the offense charged in the indictment. I am well aware that the Attorney General bears no responsibility for the charging decision in most criminal cases. However, I digress to emphasize this point because it aptly illustrates what this Court has observed with increasing frequency-\u2014either an inexcusable lack of awareness by many prosecutors of the existence of statutes that the General Assembly has seen fit to tailor to specific conduct or the failure of many of the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecutors to effectively review the appropriateness of the charges before presenting indictments to a grand jury. <em>See, e.g., Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 120, 141 n. 11, 676 S.E.2d 332, 343 n. 11 (2009) (en banc) (Humphreys, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b731-5\">. The majority cites to the Supreme Court of Washington in support of its claim that identity theft is a continuing offense. However, even under that court\u2019s analysis, Arlington would not be a proper venue for this crime. In the case the majority cites, the court specifically held that, in the case of identity theft, the \"unit o,f prosecution\u201d only includes \"subsequent proscribed conduct.\" <em>State v. Leyda, 157 </em>Wash.2d 335, 138 P.3d 610, 616 (2006). As previously noted, possession is not proscribed conduct under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">. The majority responds to this analogy by noting that Gheorghiu was not charged with larceny but rather with identity theft which \"does not involve the taking of physical property\u201d but rather \"of one\u2019s own identity.\" Whether this metaphysical approach to statutory construction is appropriate is a debate for another day. My point is simply that while a new larceny occurs when stolen property is carried from place to place, the same is not true of identity theft. The crime of identity theft was complete when Gheorghiu obtained Ms. Keltz's identifying information. Though he would have committed a new offense of identity theft each time he accessed that information or obtained goods or services using it, the plain language of the statute makes it clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the offense of identity theft is not committed continuously simply by virtue of the continued possession of identifying information, whether it was stored on a computer or simply committed to memory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">. I recognize that the 2008 amendment would arguably permit Gheorghiu to be retried for credit card fraud in Arlington County since statutory amendments that are procedural in nature are prospective from their enactment and not from the date of the offense. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 1-239. Nonetheless, at the time of the trial in the case before us, Arlington County was not the proper venue and I see no principled reason to adopt a \"no harm, no foul\u201d approach to the analysis of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
