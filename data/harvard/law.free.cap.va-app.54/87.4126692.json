For the following reasons, we reject husband\u2019s instant challenge to the spousal support award, and affirm the trial court. We also award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to wife in defending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">I. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">A. Spousal Support</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Our review of the spousal support award is governed by familiar principles. The trial court has \u201c \u2018broad discretion\u2019 \u201d in the decision to award spousal support. <em>Fadness v. Fadness, </em>52 Va.App. 833, 845, 667 S.E.2d 857, 863 (2008) (quoting <em>Brooks v. Brooks, </em>27 Va.App. 314, 317, 498 S.E.2d 461, 463 (1998)). That includes the \u201cnature, amount and duration\u201d of the award. Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) (listing thirteen factors for consideration). In making that determination, the trial court \u201c \u2018must consider all the factors enumerated in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E),\u2019 \u201d <em>Fadness, 52 </em>Va.App. at 846, 667 S.E.2d at 863 (quoting <em>Miller v. Cox, </em>44 Va.App. 674, 679, 607 S.E.2d 126, 128 (2005)), and set forth \u201cfindings or conclusions identifying the [Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) ] factors ... that support the spousal support award,\u201d <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em>50 Va.App. 189, 196, 648 S.E.2d 314, 317 (2007). The court is not required, however, \u201cto quantify or elaborate exactly what weight or consideration it has given to each of the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Woolley v. Woolley, </em>3 Va.App. 337, 345, 349 S.E.2d 422, 426 (1986); <em>see Miller, </em>44 Va.App. at 679, 607 S.E.2d at 128; <em>Bruemmer v. Bruemmer, </em>46 Va.App. 205, 210, 616 S.E.2d 740, 742 (2005) (both quoting <em>Woolley </em>for this principle).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>When the trial court has duly considered the Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) factors, \u201c \u2018its determination \u201cwill not be disturbed except for a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Fadness, 52 </em>Va.App. at 845, 667 S.E.2d at 863 (quoting Brooks, 27 Va.App. at 317, 498 S.E.2d at 463 (quoting <em>Dodge v. Dodge, 2 </em>Va.App. 238, 246, 343 S.E.2d 363, 367 (1986))). Our standard for establishing such error is a showing that the court\u2019s exercise of its broad discretion was \u201c \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Northcutt v. Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 196, 571 S.E.2d 912, 914 (2002) (quoting <em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 194-95, 480 S.E.2d 792, 794 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Furthermore, in conducting this review, we will view the evidence in the light most favorable to wife, the prevailing party below, granting her the benefit of any reasonable inferences. <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). \u201cThat principle requires us to \u2018discard the evidence\u2019 of [husband] which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by [wife] at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\n<em>(i) Manner of Reconsideration of Wife\u2019s Spousal Support</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The trial court originally awarded wife spousal support in the amount of $5,000 per month, following a two-day evidentiary hearing. In his first appeal, husband challenged the award on grounds that, <em>inter alia, </em>the court failed to make written findings and conclusions identifying the factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) supporting the award, as required. We agreed, reversing the trial court and remanding the case \u201cfor reconsideration of the award based upon the existing record and in keeping with [our] opinion.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>50 Va.App. at 196, 648 S.E.2d at 317. The trial court subsequently entered an \u201cAddendum to Final Decree\u201d (the \u201caddendum\u201d) in which the court set forth in detail its findings and conclusions supporting its spousal support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">In this appeal, husband argues the trial court disregarded our mandate on remand, requiring that the award again be set aside on procedural grounds. The trial judge, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>husband, \u201cdid not hold a hearing or even a joint telephone conference;\u201d \u201cdid not hear from both parties\u2019 attorneys\u201d; and \u201cdid not review the record.\u201d Instead, husband asserts, the trial judge \u201csimply accepted [wife\u2019s] proposed decree preserving the level of spousal support [at $5,000 per month].\u201d We disagree with this assessment of the trial court\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">First, the trial court expressly states in the addendum that it \u201creconsidered the award of spousal support based upon the existing record and [in] keeping with [this Court\u2019s prior decision].\u201d It is well established that \u201c \u2018trial courts speak only through their orders and ... such orders are presumed to reflect accurately what transpired.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 430, 435 n. 2, 578 S.E.2d 758, 761 n. 2 (2003) (quoting <em>McMillion v. Dryvit Systems, Inc., </em>262 Va. 463, 469, 552 S.E.2d 364, 367 (2001)). Second, a formal hearing was not required on remand in order for the trial court to comply with the mandate from this Court. Third, the trial court did, in fact, grant the parties an opportunity to submit proposed written findings of fact and conclusions of law to assist in its reconsideration of the spousal support award; but husband failed to do so. Fourth, nothing in this Court\u2019s mandate required the trial court to award a different amount of support on remand; and the fact the amount of the award remained the same does not compel the conclusion that the court failed to reconsider the case. <em>See Miller, </em>44 Va.App. at 678-84, 607 S.E.2d at 128-31 (finding no abuse of discretion where trial court awarded same amount of spousal support after reversal and remand of equitable distribution award). Husband\u2019s contention that the trial court failed to comply with our mandate on remand is thus without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\n<em>(it) Depletion of Wife\u2019s Assets to Maintain Her Standard of Living</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Second, husband argues the record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding number 15 of the addendum that wife would lack sufficient funds to maintain her standard of living throughout her lifetime if she were to spend the income from assets received pursuant to the division of marital property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>prior to age 65.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Husband\u2019s assertion notwithstanding, this finding is supported by the testimony of Luther G. Entsminger, Jr., an expert in financial planning. Entsminger explained that he prepared financial projections using wife\u2019s assets (retirement and non-retirement) capable of producing income, her expected income on those assets, and her monthly expenses based on her current standard of living. Under the first projection, wife would be required to start using that income at age 60 (wife was 59$ years old at the time of the hearing), and would begin experiencing \u201cshortfalls\u201d at age 74, \u201cmean[ing] that she would not have enough money to sustain [her] lifestyle.\u201d Furthermore, according to Entsminger, \u201c[wife] would run out of money if she had a long life.\u201d Only under Entsminger\u2019s second projection, with wife beginning to use the income for monthly expenses at age 65, would she avoid such \u201cshortfalls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\n<em>(in) Expected Rate of Return on Wife\u2019s Assets</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">Third, husband argues the record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding number 14 of the addendum that wife could reasonably expect a four percent rate of return on her assets. Instead, husband argues, the evidence established that wife\u2019s rate of return would be eight percent. The trial court, however, was clearly referring to wife\u2019s \u201creal rate of return\u201d of four percent, based on evidence of an estimated eight percent return, less a deduction for inflation at an annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>rate of four percent. Indeed, both parties\u2019 financial experts calculated wife\u2019s estimated real rate of return on her assets to be at or near four percent, after adjusting her expected return downward for inflation. Thus, the evidence supported the court\u2019s finding that wife could reasonably expect a four percent rate of return on her assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\n<em>(iv) Wife\u2019s Spousal Support Award Compared to Her Proven Needs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Fourth, husband argues the support award of $5,000 per month was excessive when measured against wife\u2019s proven needs. By \u201cproven needs,\u201d husband is referring to the monthly sum required for wife to maintain her standard of living enjoyed during the marriage. In making this argument, husband does not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that wife \u201cneeded $6,224 per month to maintain the standard of living ... she enjoyed during the marriage, which does not include taxes she will have to pay on any income she receives.\u201d Rather, husband frames the question as solely a matter of \u201chow much spousal support will it take for [wjife to net $6224 per month.\u201d His answer is that \u201cthe proper level of spousal support in this case is $3,871.\u201d This figure, according to husband, is the sum required for wife to achieve a monthly net income of $6,224 after accounting for wife\u2019s income from her income producing assets, and her tax liability. Thus, husband argues, the trial court erred by awarding $1,129 more in monthly spousal support than was needed for wife to maintain her standard of living (i.e., in awarding $5,000 per month, rather than $3,871 per month).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Husband\u2019s argument is premised on his erroneous assertion that the only purpose of spousal support is to maintain the dependant spouse in the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage. This then leads to husband\u2019s erroneous contention that, in this case, a sum sufficient for allowing -wife to maintain her standard of living enjoyed during the marriage constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>a cap or limit on the amount of spousal support the trial court could award.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Under Code \u00a7 20\u2014107.1(E)(2), \u201c[t]he standard of living established during the marriage,\u201d is, indeed, a factor the trial court must consider \u201c[i]n determining the nature, amount and duration\u201d of a spousal support award. But it is only one of thirteen such factors enumerated under subsection E for the court\u2019s consideration, some economic and some non-economic, with number thirteen being an open-ended directive that \u201cthe court shall consider ... [s]uch other factors ... as are necessary to consider the equities between the parties.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E)(13). <em>See Theismann v. Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. 557, 573, 471 S.E.2d 809, 817 (rejecting wife\u2019s argument that her spousal support award was inadequate even though it would not allow her to maintain the standard of living she enjoyed during the marriage and husband could afford to pay more), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>23 Va.App. 697, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996). Thus, no one factor is dispositive. And as we have stated regarding the non-economic factors under subsection E, they are \u201cnot amenable to a dollar-for-dollar consideration, such as the duration of the marriage and the non-monetary contributions of the parties to the marriage.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>44 Va.App. at 686 n. 5, 607 S.E.2d at 132 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Here, the trial court made numerous findings of fact relative to the various Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) factors. Those findings are supported by the evidence, as viewed in the light most favorable to wife, and, in turn, support the trial court\u2019s spousal support award. As the court found, the parties were married for thirty-seven years, during which time wife \u201cmade substantial and significant non-monetary contributions throughout the marriage by being a full-time wife and mother and caring for the needs of [husband] and the parties\u2019 three children,\u201d excepting the first three years of marriage. During those three years, wife worked full-time to support the family while husband was in medical school. In \u201cdevot[ing] herself to the well-being\u201d of husband and the children, wife \u201csacrificed her nursing career.\u201d Wife \u201cmanaged the household budget and lived in such a manner that the parties were able to accumulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>significant assets and save for their retirement.\u201d The parties, in fact, \u201cregularly saved substantial sums\u201d for retirement, and husband \u201ccontinues to save substantial sums for his retirement.\u201d Husband also \u201chas sufficient income to refrain from spending his retirement assets,\u201d earning in excess of $170,000 per year from wages alone. Accordingly, husband is \u201cfinancially able to pay the spousal support award.\u201d At fifty-nine years old at the time of the evidentiary hearing, wife had received no education or training, for purposes of employment, in thirty-four years, and it was \u201cunrealistic to expect [her] to acquire the skills necessary to improve her earning capacity at her age.\u201d The parties had approximately the same amount of separate property upon the division of the marital estate. Finally, as addressed above, the trial court also found that wife could expect a four percent rate of return on her income producing assets, that she would lack sufficient funds to maintain her standard of living throughout her lifetime if she were limited to income from her assets before reaching age 65, and that she needed $6,224 per month to maintain the standard of living she enjoyed during the marriage, which did not include her tax liability on any income she would receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Based on these facts, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in awarding wife $5,000 per month in spousal support\u2014even if she needed only $3,871 per month in support in order for her to achieve a monthly net income of $6,224, and thereby enable her to maintain her marital standard of living. Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) authorizes the trial court to enter an award of spousal support in an amount greater than\u2014or otherwise results in the dependant spouse receiving income in an amount greater than\u2014the economic marital standard of living. <em>See Miller, </em>44 Va.App. at 686 n. 5, 607 S.E.2d at 132 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">As aptly stated recently in <em>In the Matter of Gardner and Gardner, </em>212 Or.App. 148,157 P.3d 320, 324 (2007):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">[A] marital dissolution is more than the mere liquidation of an economic partnership; it involves the calibration of multiple socio-economic objectives with respect to which trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>courts have a range of reasonable discretion to fashion an equitable outcome. <em>See ... Haguewood and Haguewood, </em>292 Or. 197, 206, 638 P.2d 1135 (1981) (\u201c[A] marital dissolution often requires the achievement of certain social as well as financial objectives which may be unique to the parties.\u201d). Thus, depending on the circumstances, there often can be more than one overall economic solution that would withstand an appeal from a dissolution judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The trial court\u2019s economic solution to these multiple objectives in the instant case, as reflected in the spousal support award it fashioned, withstands our review because it was neither plainly wrong nor without evidence to support it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">B. Appellate Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Both husband and wife request an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in connection with this appeal. We have concluded that husband\u2019s appeal is without merit as to all issues presented. Accordingly, we direct the trial court on remand to award wife the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees she incurred in defending this appeal. <em>See Miller, </em>44 Va.App. at 688, 607 S.E.2d at 133; <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996); <em>Gottlieb v. Gottlieb, </em>19 Va.App. 77, 95, 448 S.E.2d 666, 677 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s award of spousal support to wife, but remand for an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs to wife incurred in defending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-14\">. This Court reversed the first award, and remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration of wife's spousal support. <em>See Robinson v. Robinson, </em>50 Va.App. 189, 196, 648 S.E.2d 314, 317 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\">. As explained in footnote 5, <em>infra, </em>we address husband's fifth argument in our analysis of arguments two through four.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\">. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E)(1) and (2), the \"obligations, needs and financial resources of the parties\u201d and their \"standard of living established during the marriage\u201d are among the factors the court must consider in determining the \"nature, amount and duration\u201d of an award of spousal support. Accordingly, the trial court must consider any income the parties\u2019 assets are able to produce. <em>See Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 139, 480 S.E.2d 760, 767 (1997). It is also well established, however, that the court may not consider the corpus of a monetary sum derived from the distribution of the marital estate as income to the receiving spouse. <em>Ray v. Ray, 4 </em>Va.App. 509, 513-15, 358 S.E.2d 754, 756-57 (1987); <em>see generally </em>Peter N. Swisher, Lawrence D. Diehl, and James R. Cottrell, <em>Family Law: Theory, Practice, and Forms </em>\u00a7 9:9, at 313-15 (2008). Here, most of wife\u2019s assets were acquired from a division of the marital estate, the majority of which were monetary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">. Husband\u2019s ability to pay the spousal support award is not at issue. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\">. For husband's final challenge to the spousal support award, he essentially reasserts a basic aspect of arguments two through four above by contending, without specifics, that the trial court did not \"consider properly\u201d the income available to wife. He then cites, at length, authority requiring the trial court \"to consider the income produced by the property awarded in the dissolution [of marriage] when it makes a spousal support award.\u201d As indicated above, wife\u2019s income from her assets, including marital assets distributed in the divorce, was the very subject of the trial court\u2019s findings (i) that wife would lack sufficient income from her assets to maintain her standard of living throughout her lifetime; (ii) that wife could reasonably expect a four percent rate of return (i.e., income) on her assets; and (iii) that based on, <em>inter alia, </em>wife\u2019s return on her assets and her proven need for $6,224 per month to maintain her standard of living (not including her tax liability), she was entitled to a spousal support award of $5,000 per month. Thus, for the reasons set forth in our analyses of husband's arguments two through four above, we find no merit in husband\u2019s argument number five.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
