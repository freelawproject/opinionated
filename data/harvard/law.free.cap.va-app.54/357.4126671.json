Sanford was convicted by the trial court of <em>forcible </em>sodomy (cunnilingus), accomplished through the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>victim\u2019s mental incapacity, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1(A)(2). Sanford does not argue that the evidence is insufficient to establish the act of sodomy. Rather, he maintains the evidence is insufficient to establish that incapacity. We disagree and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Presented with a challenge that the evidence is insufficient, as here, we \u201cpresume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u201d and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (2002). This presumption recognizes that the \u201ctrial judge\u2019s major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004) (citation omitted). Thus, an appellate court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original and citation omitted). Our review does not authorize us to \u201creweigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007). Rather, the appropriate appellate inquiry is \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maxwell v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 437, 442, 657 S.E.2d 499, 502 (2008) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">FACTS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The female victim is sixteen years old and lived with her mother in Washington, D.C. The mother asked the child\u2019s father, Sanford, if the victim could stay with him for two to four days in Alexandria, Virginia. He agreed, and it was during this time period when the act of cunnilingus took place. When the victim returned home, she told her mother what had happened,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whereupon the mother called the police and took the victim to the hospital. As noted, there is no challenge to the act of sodomy. Accordingly, we recite only those facts necessary for resolution of the issue raised, that is, the mental capacity of the victim. Neither the victim nor the defendant testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Dr. Gloria Morote qualified as an expert clinical psychologist. From her examination,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> she concluded the victim had an IQ of 46, which she described as \u201cvery, very low\u201d and \u201ccloser to the severe mental retardation range than the mild retardation range.\u201d Her other assessments included the following: \u201c[I]n terms of verbal and visual memory functions, they are both in the impaired range, below the first percentile rank\u201d; with respect to decision speed, \u201c[I]t was below three years and four months ... [t]hat was the floor of the test ... [t]hat was the lowest score she could get.\u201d The victim\u2019s \u201c[s]cores in terms of thinking ability, her thought processes, the visual motor speed ... visual attention were ... [all] ... four years old ... [and] ... there was no score lower than that.\u201d Finally, with respect to the victim\u2019s non-verbal social reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ing, that is, as Dr. Morote described it, her <em>\u201cability to assess cause-effect relationships in social interaction ... </em>her score there was zero ... the lowest.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Incorporating the above assessments with an interview with the child\u2019s mother, Dr. Morote evaluated the victim\u2019s adaptive skills. She defined the same as: \u201c[cjommunication skills, functional academics, health and safety, leisure, self-care, social [and] home living----\u201d The victim\u2019s score was 49, \u201cwhich is consistent with the IQ score____\u201d That score, Dr. Morote opined, demonstrated that the victim \u201ccannot live independently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The victim\u2019s mother testified her daughter attends St. Coletta\u2019s of Greater Washington, a charter special education school. Regarding her adaptive functioning, she cannot read or write, though she can copy letters and recognize some numerals. She can, with help, dress herself and perform basic hygiene (brushing her teeth, etc.) when reminded to do so, but she is unable to wash or brush her hair. Her mother gives her birth control pills, but describes them to the victim only as vitamins. The victim cannot be left alone, either within or without the house, and requires constant adult supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The mother testified she has told the victim about sex, in a general sense, advising her to wait \u201cuntil she gets older ... [to be] ... thinking about having babies.... \u201d However, the mother specifically stated she had never explained the physical act of sexual intercourse, the use of prophylactics or other methods of birth control, or the existence of sexually transmitted diseases. Further, the transcript includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">Q. Have you ever educated her on oral sex?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">Katrice Ashton, a social worker at St. Coletta\u2019s, described the goal of the school to teach functional academics and \u201clife skills.\u201d She testified that the victim could count from 1 to 25. She cannot read or write, but can copy a letter of the alphabet. She recognizes units of currency but cannot quantify them. She is \u201csometimes\u201d able to tell time. They are attempting to teach her the meaning of symbols on signs, to enable her to cross a street safely. She needs prompting to wash her hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>or brush her teeth. The victim \u201cwould love to play with stuffed animals all day if she could.\u201d She likes to pretend that she is Ms. Ashton\u2019s mother, and calls that teacher her \u201cdaughter.\u201d The victim has never had any sex education classes. For a period following the incident, the victim remained mute at school, refused to walk on her own, and pretended she was an animal, making various \u201canimal noises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Summarizing the victim\u2019s adaptive skills, Ms. Ashton testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">Q. What level of supervision does [the victim] require?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">A. She requires constant supervision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Detective Desiree Maxwell of the Alexandria Police Department interviewed the defendant. Detective Maxwell testified that the defendant told her he had only known the victim since she was a pre-teenager. He acknowledged, nonetheless, he knew the victim could not read or write, barely knew her numbers, had been told by her mother she was mentally retarded, agreed with the characterization that she acted \u201cas about a five-year old,\u201d and put her clothes on backwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Though denying other sexual acts, he admitted he had performed cunnilingus on the victim. He claimed the victim was \u201ctalking about having babies in her tummy and boyfriend and girlfriend and being married.\u201d He maintained \u201c[s]he would come on to [me] ... asked [me] if [I] wanted to be her baby\u2019s daddy....\u201d Finally, he told the detective that the victim entered his bedroom wearing only a T-shirt just prior to the time the act of sodomy was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">It is his statements to Detective Maxwell, coupled with the testimony of the mother, summarized above, that the defendant maintains negate the substantiality of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence to prove the mental incapacity of the victim to understand the nature or consequences of sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">In <em>Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 332, 457 S.E.2d 382 (1995), we reversed a rape conviction based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>mental incapacity. The victim was sixteen, mentally aged 10.4 years, with an IQ between 58 and 70. She was in the eighth \u25a0 grade at a public school. She could read and write, recording the defendant\u2019s telephone number in her address book. On the day of the offense, she left her mother a note advising she was going to a mini-mart (where by agreement she purposely and surreptitiously met defendant). She could be left home alone, could travel and go shopping alone at a local mall, and, according to her mother, could take care of herself. She had had sex education classes at public school, and she understood that one could become pregnant or get AIDS <em>as a consequence </em>of sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In reversing, we noted that a fact finder may not \u201cinfer from proof of general mental incapacity or mental retardation or an IQ range or mental age\u201d <em>alone </em>that a victim lacks mental capacity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 346, 457 S.E.2d at 389. Rather, \u201cA person suffers from a \u2018mental incapacity\u2019 within the meaning of the statute, if he or she has a mental \u2018condition\u2019 that \u2018prevents\u2019 the person from being able to \u2018understand\u2019 <em>either </em>the \u2018nature\u2019 <em>or \u2018consequences\u2019 </em>of engaging in sexual intercourse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344, 457 S.E.2d at 388 (second emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We adopted the definition of \u201cconsequence\u201d from <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>at page 482: \u201c \u2018something that is produced by a cause or follows from a form of necessary connection or from a set of conditions: a natural or necessary result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In short, IQ or mental age alone, while evidence of mental incapacity, does not necessarily establish that incapacity, within the meaning of the statute. Thus, the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>wealth did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim in <em>Adkins, </em>though possessing limited IQ and a mental age less than her physical age, further did not understand either the nature or consequences of the sexual act. Indeed, the evidence demonstrated that she, in fact, had that understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 593, 478 S.E.2d 713 (1996), we again reversed a rape conviction based upon mental incapacity. The victim was educable mentally retarded. We noted, however, that the record showed that her achievement \u201c[sjcores in communication, daily living skills and socialization domains were all above the mentally retarded range, with a strength in socialization skills, achievement, overall adaptive behavior falling well within the low average range.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 597, 478 S.E.2d at 714. These are generally described as \u201cadaptive skills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">It is the confluence of IQ (or mental age) <em>and </em>adaptive skills that are relevant to the establishment of mental incapacity. As one commentator has noted: \u201cIntellectual functioning is measured by the intelligence quotient (TQ\u2019), which is obtained using standard intelligence tests.... Adaptive functioning includes an individual\u2019s social skills, communication skills, daily living skills, personal independence, and self sufficiency.\u201d Elizabeth J. Reed, <em>Criminal Law and the Capacity of Mentally Retarded Persons to Consent to Sexual Activity, </em>83 Va. L.Rev. 799 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Initially, we note that a \u201cfact finder is not required to believe all aspects of a defendant\u2019s statement or testimony; the judge or jury may reject that which it finds implausible, but accept other parts which it finds believable.\u201d <em>Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 92, 428 S.E.2d 16, 24 (1993) (citation omitted). As we held in <em>Marable v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 505, 509-10, 500 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1998): \u201c[Tjhe fact finder is entitled to disbelieve the self-serving testimony of the accused and to conclude that the accused is lying to conceal his guilt.\u201d In accord with these principles, then, the trial court was at liberty to reject the defendant\u2019s statements to Detec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>tive Maxwell as to the circumstances preceding the act of sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Here, there is no question but that the victim is mentally retarded; her IQ is 46, her verbal, memory, and decisional functions are those of a four year old.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">That being said, we address the victim\u2019s adaptive functions\u2014what Dr. Morote described as \u201cCommunication skills ... health and safety, leisure, self-care, social [and] home living\u201d and what we characterized in <em>White </em>as \u201ccommunication, daily living habits and socialization domains.\u201d Dr. Morote testified the adaptive skills score was 49, \u201cconsistent with the IQ score----\u201d The victim, Dr. Morote stated, \u201ccannot live independently.\u201d The victim, according to Ms. Ashton, \u201crequires constant supervision.\u201d The victim, consistent with her mother\u2019s testimony, cannot be left alone, within or without her home. This contrast between the victim\u2019s adaptive functioning, and those set forth in <em>Adkins </em>and <em>White </em>above, is striking, and telling.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">As quoted above, Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3) defines mental incapacity as the inability to understand \u201cthe <em>nature </em>or <em>consequences </em>of the sexual act involved.\u201d (Emphasis added). Here, unlike <em>Adkins </em>or <em>White, </em>the sexual act is cunnilingus, not intercourse. While it is conceivable the victim could understand that sexual intercourse\u2014even without understanding the mechanics of that act\u2014could produce a baby, her mother specifically denied that she had ever discussed oral sex with her child, that is, the <em>nature </em>of that act. Furthermore, Dr. Morote testified that with respect to the victim\u2019s \u201cability to assess cause-effect relationships in social interaction\u201d that is, the <em>consequences </em>of such interaction, \u201cher score was zero ... the lowest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the victim lacked the mental capacity to understand the nature or consequences of the unchallenged act of sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\">. The trial court found Sanford not guilty of three indictments charging forcible sodomy (\u00a7 18.2-67.1(A)(2)) (fellatio), carnal knowledge (\u00a7 18.2-361), and indecent liberties (\u00a7 18.2-370.1). Sanford was also convicted of aggravated sexual battery (\u00a7 18.2-7.3(A)(3)) but Sanford's petition for appeal was denied with respect to that conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\">. We see no need to identify the mother or the victim by name. We do note, however, that their surname is not the same as the defendant's.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\">.

In her written evaluation, introduced as Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibit 2, Dr. Morote noted that the victim during her interview did not know her last name, her full address, the name of her school, or the current day, month or year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\">.
