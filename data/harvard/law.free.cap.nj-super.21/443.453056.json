J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahh\">In the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation the workman-petitioner was awarded $4,150 for partial permanent disability and an attorney\u2019s fee of $600 was allowed the workman\u2019s attorney. The workman appealed. Because the accident happened outside the State, the review was in the Appellate Division and the cause did not go to the County Court for a new trial in the ordinary course. The Appellate Division found that the award of $4,150 made in the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation should be increased. <em>Monaco v. Albert Maund, Inc., </em>17 <em>N. J. Super. </em>425 (1952). The workman\u2019s counsel then moved before the Appellate Division for the allowance of a reasonable counsel fee \u201cfor services rendered on the appeal pursuant to <em>Buie </em>5:2-5\u201d and the Appellate Division ordered its mandate amended to provide \u201cthat counsel for the appellant be allowed a counsel fee of $400 for services rendered on this appeal * *</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">When the record was returned to the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, the deputy director calculated the additional medical expense and compensation in accordance with the rulings of the Appellate Division at $4,054.10. The workman\u2019s attorney moved therein for the allowance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>an additional attorney\u2019s fee based on the additional award of $4,054.10 obtained on the appeal. The deputy director concluded that the award of the $400 counsel fee made by the Appellate Division under <em>Rule </em>5 :2-5 for the \u201cservices rendered on the appeal\u201d included a fee based upon the additional award of $4,054.10, and for this reason denied the motion. The deputy director erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><em>R. 8. </em>34:15-64, as amended <em>L. </em>1945, c. 74, \u00a7\u201916, authorizes the allowance to the successful party in the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation of \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, not exceeding twenty per cent of the judgment * * It was by virtue of this authority that the deputy director allowed the $600 attornej\u2019 fee based on the original award to the workman of $4,150. If this award of $4,150 to the workman had been reduced on appeal to the Appellate Division, the original award of the $600 attorney fee would have to be reduced in the judgment as entered, if it exceeded the statutory maximum of twenty per cent of the award as reduced. <em>Hopler v. Hill Oily Goal &amp; Lumber Co., </em>7 <em>N. J. Super. </em>24 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), affirmed 5 <em>N. J. </em>466 (1950). Likewise, if the Appellate Division orders an increase in the award to the workman, the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation is authorized to increase the original award of attorney\u2019s fee based on the amount of the workman\u2019s award, as finally determined, so long as it is kept within the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Prior to the amendment of Rule.5:2-5 on January L, 1952, there was no provision for the allowance of any counsel fee for services rendered on appeal in a case such as this where the accident happened outside the State and the appeal was directly from the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation to the Appellate Division. However, if the accident happened inside the State, the County Court was and is authorized to allow to the prevailing party on appeal \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d for services rendered on appeal in the County Court, the Appellate Division and the Supreme Court. <em>Rule </em>5:2-5; <em>R. 8. </em>34:15-67 (as amended <em>L. </em>1945, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>c. </em>97, \u00a7 1). To correct the inequity then existing, under which the successful appellant in an out-of-State accident case could not receive any allowance for services rendered on appeal, <em>Rule </em>5:2-5 was amended on January 1, 1952, to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">\u201cWhen the original appeal from the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation is to the Appellate Division, the Appellate Division may, in its discretion, allow a reasonable counsel fee to the prevailing party on appeal, for his services in the Appellate Division of the Superior Court and the Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">This amendment provided for the allowance of a counsel fee for services rendered on the appeal, but such fee is separate and distinct from any attorney fee allowance based on the amount of the award. <em>Cf. Sunkimat v. Senger Coal &amp; Ice Corp., </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>103 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948); <em>Bondar v. Simmons Co., </em>20 <em>N. J. Super. </em>147 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1952). The latter fee in such a case is under the control of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation and any increase or decrease in such fee because of change in the workman\u2019s award on appeal must be made by the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation. Consequently, the $400 counsel fee awarded in this case by the Appellate Division for services rendered on the appeal could not have included any allowance to the workman\u2019s attorney as attorney\u2019s fee based on the amount of the increased award.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The order dismissing petitioner\u2019s application to reopen the judgment entered March 21, 1952, is reversed; the judgment entered March 21, 1952, is reopened and the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation ordered to reconsider petitioner-appellant\u2019s application for an additional counsel fee based on the additional award allowed by the Appellate Division.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
