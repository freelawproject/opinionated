This delinquency is jurisdictional. <em>In re </em>Pfizer, 6 <em>N. J. </em>233 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">However, an order granting or denying an application to inspect the books and records of a party is distinctly interlocutory in its nature and is not appealable without leave of this court first had and obtained. <em>Rule </em>4:2-2(&amp;).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Assuming that the order in respect to the refusal to grant the preliminary injunction is appealable as of right <em>(Rule </em>4:2-2), it too is interlocutory. Moreover it is immediately apparent that no proof was submitted to the court to warrant the imposition of the restraint desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In any aspect of the present appeal the merits of the alleged cause of action are not properly before us for primary determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Por the foregoing reasons the order sought to be reviewed by this appeal will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
