Green challenges the enhancement of his sentence for creating a substantial risk to the life of a minor and for committing perjury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The district court did not clearly err by enhancing Green\u2019s sentence for creating a substantial risk to the life of his children. A defendant is subject to a six-level increase of his offense level if his crime involved manufacturing methamphetamine and \u201ccreated a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor.\u201d United States Sentencing Manual Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(13)(D). Even if Green\u2019s children were not present during the manufacturing of methamphetamine, the children faced a substantial risk of harm from volatile precursor materials that Green had stored in a shed near his trailer and from noxious fumes that would penetrate any porous surface inside his trailer where, according to a cohort, Green manufactured methamphetamine about once a week. In fact, when officers entered Green\u2019s trailer, the smell of ammonia was so overwhelming that they broke doors and windows to ventilate the trailer. Green had used screws to seal the doors and windows and, in so doing, blocked escape routes otherwise available to his children in the event of an emergency. Green created conditions around his home that were hazardous to the life of his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">The district court also did not clearly err by enhancing Green\u2019s sentence for perjury. A defendant faces a two-level increase in his offense level if he \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the ... prosecution\u201d of his crime. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. The district court was entitled to find that Green offered \u201cfalse testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent\u201d to mislead jurors about his involvement in the manufacture of methamphetamine. <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). After law enforcement officers and cohorts testified about Green\u2019s possession of precursor materials and use of his home to manufacture methamphetamine, Green testified incredibly that he was not aware of the drug paraphernalia found in his bedroom, he did not allow methamphetamine to be manufactured in his trailer, and he did not notice the smell of ammonia in his trailer on the day of the search. Green argues that the district court failed to \u201cmake a specific finding\u201d of perjury, but the district court found that Green\u2019s false testimony \u201cwas designed to send the jury in a direction away from the true facts of this case and ... to mitigate Mr. Green\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">We AFFIRM Green\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
