In 2000, she filed an application with the Department of Homeland Security seeking asylum, withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT), based on membership in a particular social group, religion, and political opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Perkeci alleged that her family had a well-founded fear of persecution in Albania because the family was the target of a \u201cblood feud.\u201d According to Perke-ci, in Albanian culture, if a person kills another, the victim\u2019s family has the right to kill a male member of the perpetrator\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">At a hearing before an IJ in 2004, Per-keci testified that her husband and son were at risk of being killed in Abania because of an ongoing blood feud that began in 1940 when a member of a neighboring family, Gjet Ndrecca, killed a member of Perkeci\u2019s husband\u2019s family. She testified that in 1997 she and her husband received threats from the Ndrec-ca family and reported the situation to the police, which did nothing. She also reported the threats to the Albanian Committee for Reconciliation, which could not persuade the Ndrecca family to agree to a resolution. The IJ found Perkeci\u2019s testimony credible and granted her asylum application, concluding that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution if she returned to Abania because her family constituted a particular social group targeted by the blood feud.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">In 2009, the BIA reversed the IJ\u2019s decision, concluding that although a \u201cfamily may, in some contexts, constitute a particular social group\u201d because family membership is an immutable characteristic that indicates a close bond, the Perkeci family did not constitute a particular social group because no evidence indicated that any segment of Abanian society other than the Ndrecca family viewed the Perkeci family as visible or cohesive or sought to harm its members. The BIA remanded the case to an IJ to permit Perkeci to apply for voluntary departure and \u201cany other relief\u2019 for which she was eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">On remand, Perkeci again asserted asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims for relief, arguing that circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>stances had changed and that now women and girls were targeted in blood feuds. In an oral decision, the IJ relied on the reasoning in the BIA\u2019s 2009 decision and denied Perkeci\u2019s applications. Perkeci appealed to the BIA, and the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision denying Perkeci\u2019s application for relief. This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA]\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s opinion, so we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. We review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and review factual determinations under the highly deferential substantial evidence test, affirming the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84. We will only reverse a finding of fact where the record compels it, and not where it merely supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">An asylum applicant must meet the INA\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee\u201d, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1), which includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALC\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality,... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Thus, to meet the definition of \u201crefugee,\u201d the applicant must, \u201cwith specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Further, to receive withholding of removal, an alien \u201cmust show that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of\u2019 one of the statutory factors. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This standard is more stringent than the well-founded fear standard for asylum; thus, if an applicant is unable to meet the well-founded fear standard he is unable to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">We conclude that the record does not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusions that Perkeci failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her membership in a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d Whether a group constitutes a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo, </em>but we also give deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the INA. <em>I.N.S. v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424-25, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999). We must ask whether the INA \u201cis silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue\u201d at hand and, if so, we must determine \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The INA is silent as to whether a family targeted by a blood feud may constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d eligible for relief. Thus, we must determine whether the BIA reasonably construed the INA to conclude that the Perkeci family, as targets of a blood feud, did not constitute a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. We hold that the BIA\u2019s construction was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In <em>Castillo-Arias v. United States Attorney General, </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2006), we adopted the BIA\u2019s formulation of \u201cparticular social group\u201d set forth in <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 211 (B.I.A.1985). <em>Acosta, </em>as construed by <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>mandates two considerations in determining whether a group constitutes a \u201cparticular social group\u201d: immutability and social visibility among the country\u2019s society at large. <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1194, 1197-98. We emphasized that the category \u201cshould not be a \u2018catch all\u2019 for all persons alleging persecution who do not fit elsewhere,\u201d noting that the intent of Congress was not to permit individuals to obtain relief \u201cby defining their own \u2018particular social group.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The BIA\u2019s decision in this case is a reasonable application of the principles set out in <em>Acosta </em>and <em>Castillo-Arias. </em>The BIA found that there was no evidence showing that the Perkeci family, as targets of a blood feud, were sufficiently visible to Albanian society as a whole to constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA. The BIA also emphasized that recognizing the Perkeci family as a particular social group \u201cwould be tantamount to defining the group by the instance of harm that is inflicted against it,\u201d reflecting the same concerns articulated in <em>Castillo-Arias. </em>Because the BIA applied the principles set forth in Castillo-Arias and Acosta, we find that the board\u2019s construction of the INA was permissible. Accordingly, we deny Perkeci\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-8\">. The applications of Ndue, Kristjana, and Aldo Perkeci, Perkeci\u2019s husband and children, are derivative of Perkeci's asylum application. Accordingly, any discussion of Perkeci\u2019s claims is also applicable to those of her family members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\">. The BIA also denied Perkeci\u2019s motion to remand her case to the IJ for consideration of new documents, and her application for relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Perkeci does not challenge the denial of her CAT claim at all, and she only mentions the new documents she sought to introduce once, claiming that the BIA \"ignored\u201d them. Because Perkeci does not clearly assert these challenges before this court, she has abandoned these claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that passing references to issues are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b265-15\">.Perkeci did not raise religion or political opinion before the IJ or BIA and does not raise them here. She has therefore abandoned these arguments. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
