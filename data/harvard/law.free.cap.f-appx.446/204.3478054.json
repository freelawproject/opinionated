After discovery, the City filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. Dudley then filed this appeal making three principal arguments: (1) that she established a prima facie case of retaliation; (2) that summary judgment was inappropriate because the record contains sufficient evidence to cast doubt on whether the City\u2019s non-retaliatory explanations for its actions are legitimate; and (3) that the district court did not draw all reasonable inferences in her favor because it accepted unsworn statements as evidence against her, yet refused to consider an unsworn statement as evidence against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">After the City promoted Dudley from court magistrate to court clerk/magistrate, she learned that her salary did not increase to the same level as those of similarly situated employees. Believing the reason for this disparity was race discrimination, Dudley filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She alleges that after she filed this EEOC charge her immediate supervisor, Judge Phillip Sanchez, retaliated by suspending her, reprimanding her, denying her a pay increase, ordering her to attend a training session, and encouraging citizens to file complaints against her. Dudley then filed a second EEOC complaint alleging retaliation in violation of Title VII, which is the only claim she has asserted in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">In its motion for summary judgment, the City contended that Dudley could not show a causal connection between the first EEOC complaint and the adverse employment actions. It also proffered non-retaliatory reasons to justify Judge Sanchez\u2019s actions, claiming among other things that Dudley was insubordinate, was the subject of several citizen complaints, made personal long-distance phone calls while at work, and failed to use the City\u2019s time-keeping system properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">The district court granted summary judgment to the City, concluding Dudley did not establish a prima facie case of retaliation. It also reasoned that, even if Dudley had satisfied her initial burden, she did not create a factual issue regarding whether the City\u2019s non-retaliatory justifications were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standard as the district court and viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, </em>516 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cA moving party is entitled to summary judgment if the nonmoving party has \u2018failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parks v. City of Warner Robins, </em>43 F.3d 609, 612 (11th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Title VII makes it unlawful to discriminate against employees on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). It also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who oppose \u201cunlawful employment practice[s]\u201d or who make charges against an employer during \u201can investigation, proceeding, or hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We use the burden-shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), when a plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence to establish a Title VII retaliation claim, as Dudley does here. <em>See Brown v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>597 F.3d 1160, 1181 (11th Cir.2010). The plaintiff first bears the burden of establishing the three prongs of a prima facie case of retaliation. She must show that \u201c(1) [s]he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2)[s]he suffered a materially adverse action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Howard v. Walgreen Co., </em>605 F.3d 1239, 1244 (11th Cir. 2010). Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to \u201cproffer a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Olmsted v. Taco Bell Corp., </em>141 F.3d 1457, 1460 (11th Cir.1998). If the employer succeeds, the plaintiff must then show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reason for the adverse action is \u201ca pretext for prohibited, retaliatory conduct.\u201d <em>Id.; see also McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1375 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">For simplicity, we will assume that Dudley can establish a prima facie case of retaliation. The City\u2019s burden, then, is to proffer a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its adverse actions. It has provided several, including time-keeping errors, citizen complaints, insubordination, and poor job performance. It also claims that Dudley took on an intern without permission and incurred unauthorized overtime. To survive summary judgment, Dudley must present sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the validity of these non-retaliatory reasons in the mind of a reasonable juror. <em>See Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 976 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Dudley has offered only conclusory allegations of pretext in her attempt to rebut the City\u2019s non-retaliatory justifications. She has not challenged the City\u2019s claim that it received complaints about her work performance. Nor does she deny making time-keeping errors. In fact, Dudley concedes that some of the City\u2019s explanations are true, admitting that she took on an intern without permission and incurred unauthorized overtime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To survive sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>mary judgment, Dudley must create a genuine issue of material fact both as to whether the City\u2019s reasons are false and as to whether \u201cdiscrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). She has done neither. Instead, Dudley admitted that some of the reasons are true and provided no specific evidence that would \u201callow a factfinder to disbelieve [the City\u2019s] proffered explanation for its actions.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1532 (11th Cir.1997); <em>cf. Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc) (\u201cA plaintiff is not allowed to recast an employer\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons or substitute his business judgment for that of the employer. Provided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Dudley\u2019s final argument is that the district court failed to draw all reasonable inferences in her favor because it did not consider the unsworn statement of a citizen who asserted that Judge Sanchez told her to put her complaint in writing when it ruled on the City\u2019s summary judgment motion. Unsworn statements do not meet the requirements of Rule 56, so the district court could not \u2014 and properly did not\u2014 rely on the content of the citizen\u2019s statement. <em>Carr v. Tatangelo, </em>338 F.3d 1259, 1273 n. 27 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Nor did the district court violate this rule when it considered the City\u2019s other proffered evidence of citizen complaints against Dudley. The district court did not rely on the <em>content </em>of any unsworn citizen complaint; it considered only the <em>existence </em>of such grievances as evidence that Judge Sanchez had a non-retaliatory reason for his actions. That purpose is valid, and Dudley did not dispute the existence of citizen complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">. Dudley attempts to rebut the City\u2019s non-retaliatory justifications by claiming that she consistently received positive evaluations from Judge Sanchez before her first EEOC filing but received a negative evaluation after the filing. She claims that this reversal establishes pretext. But Dudley neither submitted evidence of the performance evaluations nor raised this argument before the district court, so we will not consider it further. See <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>340 F.3d 1219, 1228 n. 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>(llth Cir.2003) (\"Arguments not raised in the district court are waived.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
