Wendall Jermaine Hall, a prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>brought suit against Richard Marvez, the plumbing supervisor at Dade Correctional Institute, where Hall was incarcerated. Hall\u2019s claims, made pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, allege that Marvez violated his Eight and Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing to repair Hall\u2019s non-operational sink. The district court granted Marvez\u2019s motion for summary judgment; Hall now appeals. Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-17\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Andujar v. Rodriguez, </em>486 F.3d 1199, 1202 (11th Cir.2007). Hall submitted a work request form to the warden on February 25, 2010, explaining that the sink in his cell lacked running water. The next day, the warden told Hall that a work order had been submitted to the plumber. However, the sink was not repaired for thirty days. During that time period, Hall also made a direct verbal request to Marvez to have the sink repaired. Hall contends that Marvez\u2019s\u2019s failure to repair the sink was deliberate, and alleges that as a result of spending a month without running water in his cell, he suffered from a number of health issues, including dental problems and dehydration. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>record reflects that Hall had other sources of water: three times a day he was permitted one cup of water or juice with his meal in the mess hall, and he had access to a shower where he was permitted to brush his teeth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hall also had access to and received medical care during the thirty day period, but was never diagnosed with dehydration.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Hall brought suit against Marvez, alleging that Marvez had violated his Eight and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He sought monetary damages from Marvez and an injunction to order the Department of Corrections to repair his sink. Hall filed a motion for summary judgment; Marvez filed a motion for summary judgment as well, asserting a qualified immunity defense. The district court denied Hall\u2019s motion and granted Marvez\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Hall appeals only the grant of Marvez\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court order granting summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. <em>Whittier v. Kobayashi, </em>581 F.3d 1304, 1307 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). The purpose of the qualified immunity defense is to \u201cprotect government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Youmans v. Gagnon, </em>626 F.3d 557, 562 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The defense ensures that officers are on notice that their conduct is unlawful before they are subjected to suit. <em>Id. </em>Because qualified immunity is not a mere defense to liability, but rather an immunity from suit, \u201cit is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\u201d <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Once a defendant raises a qualified immunity defense, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing (1) \u201cthat the defendant committed a constitutional violation,\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the law governing the circumstances was already clearly established at the time of violation.\u201d <em>Youmans, </em>626 F.3d at 562 (citation omitted). \u201c[W]e are free to consider these elements in either sequence and to decide the case on the basis of either element that is not demonstrated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">We choose first to examine the \u201cclearly established\u201d law element of Marvez\u2019s qualified immunity defense. This requires us to consider \u201cwhether it would be clear to a reasonable [official] that his conduct was unlawful in the situation [the defendant official] confronted.\u201d <em>Brosseau v. Haugen, </em>543 U.S. 194, 199, 125 S.Ct. 596, 599, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004) (per curiam) (citation omitted). \u201cThe unlawfulness of a given act must be made truly obvious, rather than simply implied, by the preexisting law.\u201d <em>Youmans, </em>626 F.3d at 563 (citation omitted). Therefore, we ask: would it be obvious to the plumbing supervisor in a prison that refusing for a month to repair a prisoner\u2019s non-operational sink would amount to a violation of that prisoner\u2019s Eight or Fourteenth Amendment rights? We find that it would not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>A prison official violates the Eighth Amendment by showing deliberate indifference to substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 828, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1974, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). To establish a substantial risk of serious harm, the condition complained of must be \u201cextreme\u201d and must pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to a prisoner\u2019s future health or safety. <em>Chandler v. Crosby, </em>379 F.3d 1278, 1289-90 (11th Cir.2004). Hall asserts that Mar-vez was aware of his requests for sink repair, but makes no allegations that Mar-vez knew of any of Hall\u2019s health problems that allegedly resulted from the faulty sink. We do not find that it would be obvious to a prison plumber that a failure to make repairs of a prisoner\u2019s sink for a month would equate to an Eight Amendment violation, especially when the prisoner was known to have access to water and health care services.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Because Hall has failed to rebut Mar-vez\u2019s qualified immunity defense, we find that the district court properly granted Marvez\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\">. Hall chose not to use the shower to brush his teeth, however, because he believed that the shower was contaminated with \"green bacteria.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\">. It is unclear whether Hall intended to assert independent Fourteenth Amendment due process claims, or if he merely referenced the Fourteenth Amendment in its capacity to make the Eight Amendment applicable to the state. If Hall did intend to make due process claims, he has not alleged any facts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>would rise to the level of a due process violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AYI\">. Claims concerning <em>post-conviction </em>prison conditions are covered by the Eighth Amendment; the Fourteenth Amendment only governs conditions of confinement <em>prior </em>to conviction. <em>See Hamm v. DeKalb Cnty., </em>774 F.2d 1567, 1571-72 (11th Cir.1985). Therefore, all of Hall's allegations about his living conditions are considered in the context of his Eight Amendment rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
