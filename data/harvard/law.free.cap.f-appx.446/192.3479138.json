The procedural history of the case (prior to the litigation of appellants\u2019 fee application in the district court) is set out in <em>Beta Upsilon Chi Upsilon Chapter v. Machen, </em>586 F.3d 908 (11th Cir.2009). <em>Machen </em>was appellants\u2019 appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying appellants\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction. Although we ultimately dismissed the appeal on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>that appellees\u2019 conduct in affording appellants relief they sought rendered moot the controversy and thus the appeal, we noted that an administrative panel of this court had granted, in the form of an injunction pending appeal, the relief the district court had denied them.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">The panel issued the injunction after considering four factors: (1) whether the movant was likely to prevail on the merits of its appeal; (2) whether, if the injunction did not issue, the movant would suffer irreparable harm; (3) whether, if the injunction issued, any other party would suffer substantial harm; and (4) whether an injunction would serve the public interest. <em>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>975 F.2d 1488, 1492 (11th Cir.1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">586 F.3d at 914-15, n. 9. Appellees contend, here, that we should affirm the district court on the ground that granting appellant\u2019s fee application was a discretionary call and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the application. Whether we review the district court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion or <em>de novo, </em>we would be hard pressed, in the light of this court\u2019s statement in note 9, to hold that district court got it right. Appellants are prevailing parties under \u00a7 1988 and, thus, are entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. The district court\u2019s order denying the fee is therefore VACATED and the case is REMANDED with the instruction that the court award appellants\u2019 the \u00a7 1988 relief they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
