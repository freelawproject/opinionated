The district court sentenced Jaimes to 292 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Jaimes first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment in light of the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act of 201, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. Jaimes\u2019s voluntary and unconditional guilty plea waived any challenge to the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment. <em>See United States v. Brice, </em>565 F.2d 336, 337 (5th Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Sealed Appellant, </em>526 F.3d 241, 242 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Next, Jaimes contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on a finding that his Texas conviction for possession with intent to manufacture and deliver cocaine was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Jaimes correctly concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 717 (5th Cir.2007), but he argues that <em>Ford </em>was wrongly decided. One panel of this court may not overrule the decision of a prior panel in the absence of en banc decision or a superseding Supreme Court decision. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b742-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
