He argues that the district court should have ordered the government to file a motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for his substantial assistance. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">Kilpatrick pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement, under which he agreed to cooperate fully with the government in other investigations and \u201cto testify, subject to a prosecution for perjury or making a false statement, fully and truthfully before any federal court proceeding or federal grand jury in connection with the charges in this case and other matters.\u201d The government agreed to consider whether any cooperation completed before sentencing qualified as substantial assistance such that a motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, for a sentence below the statutory minimum pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(e), or both would be warranted. Kilpatrick understood that the government retained the sole discretion to determine whether to file a substantial assistance motion, and he agreed not to challenge its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>At his plea colloquy, Kilpatrick was placed under oath. The magistrate judge reviewed Kilpatrick\u2019s agreement to cooperate with the government and the government\u2019s agreement to consider whether such cooperation warranted the filing of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The magistrate emphasized that the government, not the court, would determine whether Kilpatrick\u2019s cooperation amounted to substantial assistance. Furthermore, the magistrate explained that Kilpatrick could not challenge a decision by the government not to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kilpatrick testified that this information was clear to him, and he pleaded guilty. The district court accepted the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">At the sentencing hearing, Kilpatrick, through counsel, noted that he was cooperating in a state court trial that had been continued several times. The government stated that it would not consider filing a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion until Kilpatrick\u2019s cooperation was complete. The court continued the sentencing hearing. Before the sentencing continued, the court held a hearing to review, in part, whether the government planned to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The government stated that it did not intend to do so because Kilpatrick had perjured himself while testifying in the state court trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">When the sentencing recommenced, Kil-patrick argued, through counsel, that he had cooperated by testifying in a codefen-dant\u2019s trial and in a state court trial. He believed that he had cooperated fully and that the government should have filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Kilpatrick then addressed the court, stating that he had testified truthfully in the federal case. As to the state court case, he had sold the defendant powder cocaine, and he testified as such. However, the state had wanted him to testify that he sold the defendant crack cocaine because the defendant had been found with crack cocaine. Kilpatrick had cooperated, and when the government refused to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, he believed that it violated the plea agreement. The government was refusing to file the motion based on what happened in the state court case. The government stated that it agreed that Kilpatrick had testified truthfully in his codefendant\u2019s federal trial. It did not file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, however, because it believed that Kilpatrick had perjured himself in the state court trial. It based that opinion on Kilpatrick\u2019s written statements, his state court trial testimony, and jail call recordings in which Kilpatrick had \u201cessentially bragged\u201d that he had sunk the state court case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The court began its analysis by interpreting the plea agreement, noting that Kilpatrick had testified truthfully in the federal case. The court stated that it was possible that Kilpatrick was obligated to cooperate in state prosecutions under his plea agreement, pointing to the section in the agreement where Kilpatrick agreed \u201cto fully cooperate with the United States in the investigation and prosecution of other persons.\u201d However, it was unsure what the government\u2019s interest was in state prosecutions. Thus, although it was \u201cquestionable\u201d as to whether Kilpatrick had fully cooperated as required by the plea agreement, the court did not \u201chave enough facts to make a finding as to whether\u201d he was obligated to testify truthfully in the state case. Therefore, the court had to consider the law governing plea agreements and the government\u2019s refusal to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">The court then stated that Eleventh Circuit precedent did not require the government to exercise good faith in deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>whether to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Rather, the government was only prohibited from considering a constitutionally impermissible ground. There was no showing that the government acted in bad faith or that it based its decision on constitutionally impermissible grounds in this case. The court thus denied Kilpatrick\u2019s request for specific performance. Kilpatrick then addressed the court, arguing that after he had testified in his codefendant\u2019s federal trial, the government had not filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. He had told his attorney that he did not want to testify in the state court case. The court stated that it would not change its ruling because the government was not obligated to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The court then sentenced Kilpa-trick to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 1, 2, 8, and 5, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether the government breached a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir.2004). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the government may file a motion informing the court that the defendant provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another individual. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. If the government files such a motion, the court may impose a downward departure under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>The government has the power, but not a duty, to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). A district court may review the government\u2019s decision not to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion only if it \u201cwas based on an unconstitutional motive,\u201d such as \u201cthe defendant\u2019s race or religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. The government also may not refuse to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for reasons not rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844. The defendant, however, must make more than \u201cgeneralized allegations of improper motive\u201d to obtain relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Where a plea agreement merely required the government to consider filing a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the district court reviewed that provision with the defendant and ensured that the defendant understood the provision, and there was no evidence that the government did not consider the defendant\u2019s assistance, we declined to analyze the government\u2019s decision using principles of contract interpretation because the government did all that it had promised to do. <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1499 n. 2 (11th Cir.1993). In <em>Forney, </em>we also declined to consider whether the government\u2019s decision was made in bad faith because the defendant had not raised the issue before the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 1500. Specifically, at his sentencing hearing, he did not assert that the government made its decision based on an unconstitutional or discriminatory ground. <em>Id. </em>at 1500 n. 3. Furthermore, where the government promised to consider filing a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, as opposed to promised to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the government\u2019s decision was \u201cnot reviewable for arbitrariness or bad faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1502 n. 5 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Here, the court correctly declined to order the government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The government considered whether Kilpatrick\u2019s cooperation amounted to substantial assistance, which was all that it was required to do under the plea agreement. According to the plea agreement and Kilpatrick\u2019s testimony, he understood that whether the government would file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was solely within its discretion. Moreover, under <em>Forney, </em>we need not review the government\u2019s decision using principles of contract interpretation. Like in <em>Forney, </em>Kilpatrick\u2019s plea agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ment only required the government to consider filing a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the magistrate reviewed that provision of the plea agreement with Kilpatrick and ensured that he understood the provision, and there is no evidence that the government did not consider whether Kilpatrick\u2019s assistance amounted to substantial assistance. <em>See id., </em>9 F.3d at 1499 n. 2. Therefore, we decline Kilpatrick\u2019s request to analyze the government\u2019s decision using principles of contract interpretation because the government did all that it promised to do. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Next, we decline to consider Kilpa-trick\u2019s argument that the government made the decision not to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion in bad faith. Like the defendant in <em>Forney, </em>Kilpatrick did not argue at sentencing that the government based its decision on an unconstitutional or discriminatory ground. <em>See id. </em>at 1500 n. 3. Rather, he argued that the government impermis-sibly based its decision on his actions in a state court case even though his plea agreement only required him to testify truthfully in federal proceedings. Nonetheless, Kilpatrick is not entitled to relief. The court found that the agreement could be broad enough to include the state prosecution, pointing to that part of the plea agreement where Kilpatrick agreed \u201cto fully cooperate with the United States in the investigation and prosecution of other persons.\u201d In fact, Kilpatrick himself first brought to the court\u2019s attention his cooperation in the state case, apparently seeking consideration of that cooperation from the government in connection with the potential \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The government then replied that it would not consider filing a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion until Kilpatrick\u2019s cooperation was complete. Finally, Kilpa-trick has not made a specific allegation that the government based its decision on an unconstitutional ground, such as his race or religion. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Kilpatrick\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\">. On appeal, the government does not argue that this provision in the plea agreement pre-eludes Kilpatrick's appeal of its decision not to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
