Eckhoff argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Eckhoff to a term of imprisonment at the low end of the advisory guideline range. Eckhoff persuaded a 16 year old girl to transmit repeatedly live video footage of her naked body. Later, Eckhoff attempted to convince the girl to delete from her computer the messages and pictures sent from Eckhoff and to tell federal investigators that Eckhoff had not seen her naked. Eckhoff also induced two sisters, when they were between the ages of 15 and 17, each to email photographs of themselves in sexually explicit poses and to participate in sexually explicit online conversations. Investigators discovered on Eckhoffs computer more than 600 images of child pornography, including images that Eckhoff had downloaded from a child pornography website that portrayed children in bondage and being assaulted sexually. At sentencing, the district court acknowledged Eckhoffs lack of prior criminal record, his \u201cimmaturity\u201d and \u201cdifficulty in having social relationships,\u201d and the care he had provided for his parents, but the district court found those factors were outweighed by Eckhoffs decision to \u201cmanipulate\u201d for years his victims for his \u201cown sexual gratification\u201d and \u201cliterally destroy ... their lives\u201d to the point that one victim \u201c[e]onsidered suicide.\u201d The district court reasonably determined that a sentence of 262 months of imprisonment was necessary to address the seriousness of Eck-hoffs offenses, provide adequate punishment, protect the public, and deter future similar crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We reject as preposterous Eckhoffs argument that he deserved a lesser sentence because he \u201c[njever me[t] with any of [his] victims in person[ ] or ... [had] sex with any of the alleged victims.\u201d Eckhoffs sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We AFFIRM Eckhoffs sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
