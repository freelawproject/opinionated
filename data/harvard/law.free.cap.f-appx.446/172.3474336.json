After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part Adrien\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">A. Prior Convictions and Notice to Appear</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">In 2004, Adrien, a native and citizen of Haiti, was paroled into the United States. In 2005, his status was adjusted to that' of a lawful permanent resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">By 2009, Adrien accumulated a number of criminal convictions, including two convictions for fleeing and eluding a police officer, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 316.1935(a); a conviction for burglary of an unoccupied conveyance, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 810.02(4)(B); and a conviction for third degree grand theft, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 812.014(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-17\">In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging Adrien with re-movability, pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), for being convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal conduct. Subsequently, the DHS filed a second charge of removal, alleging that Adrien was removable, pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), for being convicted within five years of admission of a crime involving moral turpitude, and for which a sentence of one year or longer could have been imposed. At an initial hearing, Adrien admitted the factual allegations in the second charge in the NTA and conceded removability as an alien who was convicted of a crime of moral turpitude within five years of admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>B. Application for Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">In February 2010, Adrien filed an application for withholding of removal under the INA and CAT. Adrien alleged he feared harm or mistreatment if returned to Haiti because the Haitian government detains all criminal deportees upon arrival in Haiti, and Adrien, as an American deportee, would be singled out for exceptionally harsh treatment in a Haitian prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Either Adrien or the government submitted this documentary evidence: (1) Adrien\u2019s criminal history showing his aforementioned criminal convictions; (2) a New York Times article discussing the collapse of Haiti\u2019s mental health system after the 2010 Haitian earthquake; (3) Adrien\u2019s medical records from his time in DHS detention, showing his diagnosis of psychosis and his receipt of psychotic medication; (4) a U.S. Department of State 2009 Human Rights Report on Haiti (\u201c2009 Country Report\u201d); and (5) a U.S. Department of State 2008 Human Rights Report on Haiti (\u201c2008 Country Report\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">C. Removal Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">At a March 2010 removal hearing, Adrien testified that he had \u201cmental problems\u201d for which he was taking medication and had received psychiatric treatment. Adrien sometimes heard voices, saw images and felt depressed. The voices told Adrien to kill himself because \u201cthey need[ed][him] to come and live with them.\u201d As a result, the IJ continued removal proceedings to allow evidence of Adrien\u2019s mental condition to be gathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">At a June 2010 removal hearing, Adrien testified that he began having mental problems in Haiti, that he was bipolar and had trouble answering questions and that he saw images, including images of his deceased father trying to kill him. Adrien believed that if he returned to Haiti he would suffer, and perhaps die, because Haiti does not have facilities to help people with his problems. If he were put in jail, Adrien would not be given food or water, and he had no one in Haiti who could bring food and water to him. The prison also would not have medical facilities to treat him.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">D.IJ\u2019s Order</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">The IJ found Adrien removable as a criminal alien, pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(i), (ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), (ii), denied Adrien withholding of removal under the INA, but granted withholding of removal under CAT. As to withholding of removal under the INA, the IJ determined that Adrien failed to establish that he would be persecuted on account of his mental illness. The IJ explained that the fact that life would be difficult for Adrien in Haiti because he would not be able to get medical care was not a ground for withholding of removal under the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">With regard to withholding of removal under CAT, the IJ noted that Adrien presented a \u201cdifficult case because we don\u2019t know what is going on in Haiti.\u201d The IJ pointed to the newspaper article, which indicated that, since the earthquake, mentally ill people were \u201cbeing left to fend on their own.\u201d The IJ found that the 2009 Country Report was outdated, and that, because DHS had halted removals to Haiti after the earthquake, it was \u201cnot even clear that [the Haitian government] would detain criminal deportees.\u201d The IJ concluded that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jean-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>Pierre v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>500 F.3d 1315 (11th Cir.2007), established that severe mental problems combined with detention in Haitian prison \u201cmay be enough to meet the standard [under CAT].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The IJ found that Adrien has \u201cmental problems\u201d and takes \u201canti-psychotic medicine.\u201d Citing <em>Jean-Pierre, </em>the IJ stated that \u201cpeople with mental problems are treated harshly by the authorities in [Haitian] prisons. One of the reasons is that in Haiti you have voodoo. They believe that people are possessed.\u201d The IJ noted that Adrien\u2019s medical records indicated that he engaged in anti-social behavior, heard voices and saw people trying to kill him. The IJ stated that Haitian prison officials \u201cdon\u2019t have the medicines to give\u201d the mentally ill and that Adrien might act up without medication. Acknowledging that the \u201cdecision [was] hard to make in a vacuum,\u201d the IJ decided to \u201cerr on the side of humanitarianism\u201d and found that Adrien had met the standard for withholding of removal under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">E. BIA\u2019s Decision Vacating the IJ\u2019s Order</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Adrien did not appeal the IJ\u2019s decision. The government, however, appealed the IJ\u2019s grant of withholding of removal under CAT. Among other things, the government argued that (1) Adrien failed to show he would be subject to torture in Haiti or any nexus between his mental illness and being subject to torture, and (2) the IJ had misapplied <em>Jean-Pierre.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">The BIA sustained the government\u2019s appeal, vacated the IJ\u2019s grant of withholding of removal under CAT, and reinstated the IJ\u2019s removal order. Because the IJ did not make a credibility determination, the BIA presumed Adrien was credible. The BIA also found that the IJ\u2019s findings of fact \u2014 that Adrien was mentally ill and that treatment for mental illness in Haiti was not available \u2014 were not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the BIA determined that the IJ \u201cconcluded, incorrectly, that [Adrien] was eligible for protection under the Convention Against Torture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">The BIA explained that the IJ had \u201cstrung together a series of suppositions about what might be the situation in Haiti once the country [was] sufficiently stabilized for deportations to resume.\u201d Specifically, the IJ assumed that Adrien would come in contact with Haitian authorities even though there was no evidence that Adrien would be arrested or kept in jail as a criminal deportee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The BIA concluded that the IJ improperly relied on <em>Jean-Pierre </em>as evidence that all mentally ill people will be tortured in Haiti and that <em>Jean-Pierre </em>instead stands for the general proposition that each applicant must prove that he will be singled out for torture. Accordingly, the BIA concluded that Adrien had not met his burden to show it was more likely than not that he personally would be tortured by the Haitian gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ernment \u201cbecause he did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be detained and would be singled out for torture.\u201d Adrien filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">A. Jurisdiction to Review CAT Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">On appeal, Adrien argues that the BIA erred in vacating the IJ\u2019s order granting him withholding of removal under CAT.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, Adrien argues that his evidence showed he more likely than not would be subjected to torture if he were returned to Haiti. We conclude, however, that we lack jurisdiction to review Adrien\u2019s CAT claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Under the INA, federal courts lack jurisdiction to review final orders of removal \u201cagainst an alien who is removable by reason of having committed\u201d a crime involving moral turpitude, except to the extent the alien raises \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), (D) 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D). Where such a criminal alien raises a constitutional claim or question of law, we do not have jurisdiction to review the factual determinations made by the IJ or the BIA, but we retain jurisdiction to review the application of those undisputed facts to a legal standard. <em>Jean-Pierre v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>500 F.3d 1315, 1320-22 (11th Cir.2007). Thus, we have jurisdiction to review a claim that a particular set of facts meets the legal definition of torture under CAT. <em>Id. </em>at 1322. But, we lack jurisdiction to review \u201cthe administrative fact findings of the IJ or the BIA as to the sufficiency of the alien\u2019s evidence and the likelihood that the alien will be tortured if returned to the country in question.\u201d <em>Singh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Adrien admits he is an alien removable by virtue of his prior convictions for crimes involving moral turpitude. As such, we have jurisdiction only to the extent Adrien raises a colorable constitutional claim or a question of law. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), (D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D). Adrien argues, like the alien in <em>Singh, </em>that his evidence was sufficient to show that he more likely than not will be tortured in Haiti. Thus, Adrien does not raise a constitutional claim or a question of law. <em>See Singh, </em>561 F.3d at 1281 (explaining that an alien who \u201cmerely argues that he showed that it was more likely than not that he would suffer torture upon return to Jamaica\u201d does not fall under the \u201cconstitutional claim or question of law\u201d exception in INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)). Accordingly, we dismiss Adrien\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction to the extent he challenges the BIA\u2019s finding that he failed to show a likelihood that he would be tortured.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">B. BIA\u2019s Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Adrien also argues that the BIA erroneously vacated the IJ\u2019s order using a <em>de novo </em>standard of review rather than a clear error standard. We retain jurisdiction to review this legal question. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">Contrary to Adrien\u2019s argument, the BIA did not err in conducting a <em>de novo </em>review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>of whether Adrien met his burden of proof for CAT relief. Although the BIA must review an IJ\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), it \u201cmay review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of [the IJ] de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). In interpreting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3), the BIA has concluded that it reviews <em>de novo </em>the IJ\u2019s \u201capplication of a particular standard of law to those facts\u201d and may \u201cconclude that the foundation for the [IJ\u2019s] legal conclusions was insufficient or otherwise not supported by the evidence of record.\u201d <em>In re A-S-B-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 493, 496, 497 (BIA 2008) (applying <em>de novo </em>review to whether alien established future persecution for purposes of withholding of removal under INA); <em>see also H-L-H- &amp; Z-Y-Z- </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 209, 212-13 (BIA 2010) (applying <em>de novo </em>review to whether alien established future persecution for purposes of asylum).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Here, the BIA accepted Adrien\u2019s testimony as credible and concluded that the IJ\u2019s fact findings were not clearly erroneous. The BIA concluded that these adjudicated facts were insufficient to establish eligibility for CAT relief because there was no evidence that Haitian officials were likely to detain Adrien at all after the earthquake and thus it was speculation whether Adrien would likely be subjected to conditions in a Haitian prison that amounted to torture. We find no error in the BIA\u2019s application of <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\">. Although the 2009 Country Report was prepared on March 11, 2010, it did not address the January 12, 2010 earthquake in Haiti.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">. The 2009 Country Report indicated that due to widespread poverty and a shortage of public services, people with physical and mental disabilities were severely disadvantaged in Haiti. However, there were no reports of discrimination by the government against the disabled or of abuse in mental health facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\">. According to the 2008 and 2009 Country Reports, repatriated Haitians were detained \"upon their return for approximately two weeks.\u201d The 2009 report described this detention as \"administrative quarantine\u201d for returning citizens who \"had local criminal charges pending or when local family members could not be located.\u201d The Haitian government was trying to improve these returnees\u2019 release time to ten days or less. Although Adrien claimed he has no family in Haiti, he has not claimed, much less proved, that he has local criminal charges awaiting him in Haiti.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">. To the extent Adrien\u2019s opening brief challenges the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for withholding of removal under the INA and argues that he showed a pattern or practice of persecution of the mentally ill by Haitian jail officials, Adrien failed to exhaust this claim with the BIA, and we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b204-16\">.
