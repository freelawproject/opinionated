Borneo argues that the BIA erred in denying her motion to reconsider because the harassing incidents she suffered in her home country of Venezuela rose to the level of persecution and occurred on account of a protected ground. She also argues that the record compels a conclusion that she would likely be persecuted and tortured upon return to Venezuela.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). A motion for reconsideration \u201cshall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)). However, a \u201cmotion that merely republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place gives the tribunal no reason to change its mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201cmerely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law1 as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">To the extent Borneo seeks to challenge the BIA\u2019s initial order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT protection, we lack jurisdiction to review her claims, as she had not filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s original decision. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5) (\u201c[A] petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals ... shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">As to the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration, we discern no abuse of discretion. In her motion to reconsider, Borneo did not specify any errors of fact or law that occurred in the BIA\u2019s original order dismissing her appeal. Rather, Borneo raised essentially the same arguments as she did in her initial appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision, namely that the BIA had failed to cumulatively consider incidents of harassment that she faced in Venezuela. Restating the same arguments gave the BIA no reason to change its mind on reconsideration, and failure to specify errors of fact or law in the initial order will preclude a successful motion to reconsider. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329. Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion, and we deny Borneo\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
