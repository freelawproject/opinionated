After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">On appeal, Gutierrez challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Section 2L1.2 increases a defendant\u2019s offense level by sixteen levels if the defendant was deported following a felony conviction for \u201ca drug trafficking offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). The district court concluded that Gutierrez\u2019s 1997 conviction under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a) was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Generally, courts use a \u201c \u2018categorical\u2019 approach\u201d to determine whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for purposes of a sentencing enhancement. <em>United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1273 (11th Cir.2006). Under this approach, the court looks to the fact of conviction and the statutory elements of the offense. <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1328 (11th Cir.2010). However, when the state statute covers conduct broader than the offense described in the guidelines such that the conviction may or may not qualify for the enhancement and the judgment is ambiguous, the court uses a \u201c \u2018modified categorical approach.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1336. This approach allows the court to look at certain judicial documents, approved in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), such as the plea transcript and the charging documents, to ascertain whether the prior conviction qualifies the defendant for the enhancement. <em>United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">As to Gutierrez\u2019s 1997 conviction, the California statute makes it a crime if a person \u201ctransports, imports into this state, sells, furnishes, administers, or gives away,\u201d certain controlled substances, or \u201coffers to\u201d or \u201cattempts to\u201d do so. Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a). The Information for Gutierrez\u2019s 1997 conviction, to which Gutierrez pled no contest, alleges in four separate counts that Gutierrez committed the crime of \u201cSALE OR TRANSPORTATION OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE\u201d when he \u201cdid willfully and unlawfully transport, import into the State of California, sell, furnish, administer, <em>and </em>give away, and offer to transport, import into the State of California, sell, furnish, administer, <em>and </em>give away and attempt to import into the State of California <em>and </em>transport a controlled substance, to wit, COCAINE.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In other words, Gutierrez\u2019s Information used the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d in listing the acts constituting the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">Gutierrez argues that under either the categorical approach or the modified categorical approach, the district court could not have categorized his 1997 conviction as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d because the California statute includes crimes, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>as transporting drugs, that do not fall within \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of drug trafficking offenses. Because Gutierrez raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 842 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 272, 175 L.Ed.2d 183 (2009). \u201cA plain error is an error that is obvious and is clear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWithout precedent directly resolving [the] claim, ... the district court\u2019s alleged error is not \u2018obvious\u2019 or \u2018clear under current law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(finding no plain error where neither this Circuit nor the Supreme Court had decided the issue and there was a circuit split).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Here, Gutierrez cannot show plain error for several reasons. First, neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has addressed whether the \u201ctransportation\u201d of drugs under the California statute constitutes a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)\u2019s sixteen-level enhancement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Other circuits have concluded that it does not and thus have resorted to the modified categorical approach to determine whether the defendant\u2019s conviction qualifies. <em>See United States v. Castellanos-Barba, </em>648 F.3d 1130, 1132-33 (10th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Medina-Almaguer, </em>559 F.3d 420, 422 (6th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Garcia-Medina, </em>497 F.3d 875, 877 (8th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">Second, even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that transporting drugs under the California statute is not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d and look to Shepard-approved materials under the modified categorical approach, Gutierrez pled no contest to an Information that charged him with importing, selling, furnishing, administering and giving away cocaine in addition to transporting it. Even Gutierrez agrees that some of these offenses charged in his Information fall within \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">Instead, Gutierrez argues that, regardless of the wording of his Information, he pled guilty to violating the California statute in the disjunctive. Gutierrez points to the transcript of his plea hearing, in which the state court referred to the charged offenses as the \u201csale <em>or </em>transportation of a controlled substance,\u201d i.e., using the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d when it asked Gutierrez how he pled to each count in the Information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gutierrez contends that the plea transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201cactually demonstrates quite clearly that [he] entered a plea of no contest to charges of sale OR transportation of a controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The transcript does not show that Gutierrez entered a disjunctive plea. Gutierrez pled no contest to violating \u00a7 11352 as it was alleged in each count of his Information. The fact that the state court also referred to the crime by its common, shorthand name \u2014 the sale or transportation of a controlled substance \u2014 did not make his plea a disjunctive plea. The transcript and record as a whole indicates Gutierrez entered a conjunctive plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Finally, neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has addressed whether and when a defendant\u2019s guilty plea to a charge stated in the conjunctive (like Gutierrez\u2019s) admits all the elements in the charge. Other circuits that have addressed the issue are split. <em>See United States v. Torres-Romero, </em>587 F.3d 1155, 1158-59 (10th Cir.2008) (concluding that for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)\u2019s sixteen-level enhancement, defendant admitted to all the acts charged in the indictment, which included selling, distributing <em>and </em>possessing a controlled substance in violation of a Colorado statute); <em>Garcia-Medina, </em>497 F.3d at 877-78 (concluding that charging document that tracked the language of California\u2019s \u00a7 11352(a), but listed the offenses in the conjunctive, was \u201csufficient to satisfy the \u2018drug trafficking\u2019 definition of section 2L1.2\u201d); <em>but see Young v. Holder, </em>634 F.3d 1014, 1020-22 (9th Cir.2011) (concluding, in the immigration context, that alien\u2019s prior guilty plea to an information charging him in the conjunctive with violating California\u2019s \u00a7 11352(a) did not constitute an admission to committing every act listed in the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Given that there is no precedent in this Circuit or the Supreme Court directly resolving the issue, the alleged error, if there was one at all, was not clear or obvious under current law. Thus, the district court did not plainly err in concluding that Gutierrez\u2019s prior \u00a7 11352(a) conviction was a drug trafficking offense and applying \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)\u2019s sixteen-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Gutierrez also argues that the imposition of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)\u2019s sixteen-level enhancement violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. Gutierrez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). We are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-10\">. Gutierrez\u2019s Information and the transcript of his plea hearing were not part of the record in the district court. This Court granted the government\u2019s unopposed motion to supplement the record and to take judicial notice of these two documents related to Gutierrez's 1997 conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">. The commentary defines a \"drug trafficking offense\u201d as an offense \u201cthat prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of,., a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iv) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\">.
