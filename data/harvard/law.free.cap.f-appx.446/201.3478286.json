Vergara argued that Coca-Cola infringed on his copyright interest in his Spanish adaptation of a song that Coca-Cola used in its advertising. The district court ruled that Vergara had assigned his copyright interest in the adaptation to Universal Music Latin America, which in turn had assigned its rights to the adaptation to Coca-Cola. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-23\">As part of its advertising campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament, Coca-Cola enlisted recording artist K\u2019naan to create a new version of his song \u2018Wavin\u2019 Flag.\u201d Coca-Cola had the new version, the \u201cCelebration Mix,\u201d sung in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>different languages by local artists and K\u2019naan. To create the Celebration Mix, Coca-Cola obtained rights from the owners of both the sound recording and the musical composition of \u201cWavin\u2019 Flag.\u201d \u201cThe sound recording is the aggregation of sounds captured in the recording while the song or tangible medium of expression embodied in the recording is the musical composition.\u201d <em>Saregama India Ltd. v. Mosley, </em>635 F.3d 1284, 1289 n. 18 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Coca-Cola contacted Jose Puig of Universal Music Latin America to produce a Spanish version of the Celebration Mix. Puig sought advice from Rafael Artero of Universal Music Publishing Group to select a songwriter. Artero recommended that Puig employ Vergara, who had a contract with Universal Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In November 2009, Puig and Artero called Vergara, who agreed to adapt the song. According to Vergara, Artero said he would \u201ccarry out the normal procedure as he would in any song in order to claim [Vergara\u2019s] rights and register the work.\u201d Vergara knew that he would have to negotiate to obtain an interest in the adaptation, but Vergara had \u201cwritten hundreds of songs\u201d and adapted one song, and \u201cno publishing house or author [had] ever denied [him] that right.\u201d In the past, \u201cwhenever Vergara [had] requested ... rights there [had] always been a dialogue with the other party and an agreement ... reached without any problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In one evening, Vergara adapted the Celebration Mix into Spanish. Vergara sent to Puig the lyrics and a \u201cdemo\u201d musical recording that combined the lyrics with the Celebration Mix. Coca-Cola approved Vergara\u2019s adaptation, and Vergara produced the recording of the Spanish Celebration Mix. Vergara delivered his finished product to Puig in December 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Vergara sent the Universal Group an invoice for $6,000 for his production work, and in January 2010, Universal Group began negotiating with the owners of the musical composition to obtain an \u201cadapter\u2019s share\u201d of the profits for Vergara. In February 2010, iTunes Mexico began selling the Spanish Celebration Mix, but iTunes did not credit Vergara for the Spanish lyrics and adaptation. When the owners of the musical composition refused to give an adapter\u2019s share to Vergara, he threatened to file a lawsuit to enforce his copyright interest in the adaptation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Puig and Vergara negotiated a settlement. On March 4, 2010, Vergara emailed Puig and Artero \u201cto repeat and reaffirm the terms [that Vergara and Puig had] discussed.\u201d Vergara stated that \u201ca door [had] always [been] left open for requesting from the original authors a percentage for the adaptation\u201d and had he known \u201cthat such a possibility did not exist,\u201d he \u201cwould have never considered making said adaptation.\u201d Vergara stated that his \u201conly demand\u201d was that his \u201cname as an adapter ... [was listed] every time the name of any composer of [the Spanish Celebration Mix] [was] shown, ... along with ... production credits.\u201d Vergara told Puig to \u201cconsider [the adaptation] a Work for Hire with no economic compensation\u201d other than \u201cone dollar.\u201d On March 5, 2010, Puig emailed Vergara that he could \u201ccount on the credits on the track\u201d and that Puig was \u201cresending [Vergara] the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">On March 4, 2010, Universal Group assigned its copyright interests in the adaptation to Coca-Cola. In the contract, Universal stated that it had acquired the copyright from Vergara. The second clause of the contract provided that \u201cUniversal ... assigned] and transferred] [to Coca-Cola] title to the musical work in Spanish of Wavin\u2019 Flag, produced [by] Mr. Rafael Vergara, who in turn assigned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>copyrights to such musical arrangement to Universal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Puig mailed Vergara contracts that did not comply with Vergara\u2019s requests for credit for his work. On March 8, 2010, Vergara sent to Puig an email stating that Vergara was \u201crevok[ing]\u201d his \u201cproposal\u201d of March 4, 2010. Vergara stated that his \u201cproposal was clear and it was just that, a proposal.\u201d That same day, Puig responded that he had failed to \u201creview the contracts\u201d and he would do so \u201cright away and make any necessary changes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In May 2010, Vergara filed a complaint for injunctive relief and monetary damages against Coca-Cola. The district court temporarily enjoined Coca-Cola from advertising, selling, distributing, or disseminating the Spanish Celebration Mix unless it attributed credit to Vergara as the adapter of the song. This Court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by issuing the preliminary injunction. <em>Hermosilla v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>No. 10-12894 (11th Cir. Mar. 25, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The district court later granted a summary judgment in favor of Coca-Cola. The district court ruled that Vergara entered a contract to assign his copyright interest in his adaptation to Universal. The district court found that \u201cVergara agreed to sell his rights to the lyrics for a dollar so long as he receive[d] credit for his contribution\u201d and Puig accepted that condition of sale on behalf of Universal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The district court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of Coca-Cola because the record establishes without dispute that Vergara assigned his copyright interest to Universal. Under Florida law, parties enter a contract when \u201cthere was a definite proposal by one party which was unconditionally accepted by the other.\u201d <em>Webster Lumber Co. v. Lincoln, </em>94 Fla. 1097, 115 So. 498, 504 (1927). To make this determination, a reviewing court must \u201cplace itself in the situation of the parties, and from a consideration of the surrounding circumstances, the occasion, and apparent object of the parties, ... determine the meaning and intent of the language employed.\u201d <em>Underwood v. Underwood, </em>64 So.2d 281, 288 (Fla.1953) (internal quotation marks omitted). Ver-gara stated in his email on March 4, 2009, that his \u201conly demand\u201d to assign his copyright interest was that he receive credit as the adapter and producer. Puig \u201cunconditionally accepted\u201d that condition in his email on March 5, 2009, in which he told Vergara to \u201ccount on the credits on the track.\u201d Puig\u2019s acceptance on behalf of Universal was effective to create a contract with Vergara because it \u201cmatch[ed] the terms of [his] offer.\u201d <em>Gillespie v. Bodkin, </em>902 So.2d 849, 850 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005). The two emails were \u201cso connected with each other that they may be fairly said to constitute ... a complete contract.\u201d <em>Webster, </em>115 So. at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">That Vergara and Universal intended to execute a \u201csubsequent formal, written contract, does not denote that they did not intend to be bound immediately by their ... written negotiations.\u201d <em>Lifecare Int\u2019l, Inc. v. CD Med., Inc., </em>68 F.3d 429, 436 (11th Cir.1995). Their emails do not contain any language from which \u201cconflicting legal inferences ... could be drawn regarding the expressed intent of the parties so as to alter the legal effect of the undisputed facts of [an] offer [by Vergara], acceptance, and communication of that acceptance\u201d by Puig. <em>Citizens Bank of Perry v. Harlie Lynch Constr. Co., </em>426 So.2d 52, 54 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1983). Vergara argues, for the first time, that Puig lacked authority to contract on behalf of Universal Group, but we have \u201crepeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>court.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Coca-Cola.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
