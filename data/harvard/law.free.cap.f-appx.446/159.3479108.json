Clark argued that, despite rendering substantial assistance to the government, the government refused to file a Rule 35(b) motion as punishment for his earlier decision to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court can compel the government to file a substantial assistance motion. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993). Generally, the government has the power, but not the duty, to file a motion to reduce sentence when a defendant has provided substantial assistance to the government. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.2008). The government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion can be reviewed by the district court, and the district court can grant relief, only if it finds that the government\u2019s refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive, such as race or religion. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">In this case, the district court properly denied Clark\u2019s motion to compel the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion. This is so because, even assuming that <em>Wade </em>prohibits the government from retaliating against defendants who exercise their constitutional right to proceed to trial, Clark failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing\u201d that the government harbored such a motive. <em>See United States v. Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d 958, 961 (11th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
