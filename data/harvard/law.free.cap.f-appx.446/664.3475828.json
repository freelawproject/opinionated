The bankruptcy court determined that although Moody received a discharge of a debt incurred by her spouse, the debt survived against after-acquired community property because her husband was independently denied a discharge of the same debt. We agree and affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-19\">This is a bankruptcy dispute over a loan made by Appellee Henry Muller to Irving Moody, the husband of Appellant Pellie Moody (\u201cthe Muller debt\u201d or \u201cthe debt\u201d). Irving Moody failed to repay the Muller debt as promised, so Muller sued him in Louisiana state court, taking a judgment against him. Then, in 1998, Irving Moody filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in the Eastern District of Louisiana, but the bankruptcy court denied him a discharge of the Muller debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-20\">After her husband\u2019s failed attempt to discharge the Muller debt, Pellie Moody filed her own bankruptcy case \u2014 this one under Chapter 13 \u2014 in the Eastern District of Louisiana. She, too, sought a discharge of the Muller debt. Over Muller\u2019s objection, the bankruptcy court allowed Pellie Moody to include the debt in her reorganization plan, which the court then confirmed. Pellie Moody thus received a discharge of the Muller debt where her husband could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-21\">Years passed, and in August of 2008, Muller resumed efforts to collect on the debt, seeking specifically to garnish Irving Moody\u2019s wages. Pellie Moody responded by reopening her Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, moving to enforce the discharge. The bankruptcy court denied her motion, holding that although the debt was discharged as to Pellie Moody as an individual, it survived as against after-acquired community property because her husband had been denied a discharge of the same debt. Pellie Moody appealed this judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>ment to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, which affirmed. She now seeks relief from this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\u201c \u2018We review a district court\u2019s affirmance of a bankruptcy court decision by applying the same standard of review to the bankruptcy court decision that the district court applied.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, we review for clear error the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact, and we review de novo its conclusions of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Two interrelated provisions of the Bankruptcy Code address the situation before us today, where two spouses filed individually for bankruptcy but only one received a discharge of a particular obligation. In general, where a debtor spouse receives a discharge of the other spouse\u2019s debt, her discharge bars creditors from recovering the debt against after-acquired community property. Section 524(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">A discharge in a case under this title operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or an act, to collect or recover from, or offset against, property of the debtor of the kind specified in section 541(a)(2), [which includes the debtor\u2019s interest in community property], of this title that is acquired after the commencement of the case, on account of any allowable community claim.... <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">However, \u00a7 524(b) provides a crucial exception to this rule. The debtor spouse\u2019s discharge will not bar creditors from proceeding against after-acquired community property where the other spouse was himself denied a discharge of the same debt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArN\">Subsection (a)(3) of this section does not apply if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-12\">(1)(A) the debtor\u2019s spouse is a debtor in a case under this title, or a bankrupt or a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Act, commenced within six years of the date of the filing of the petition in the case concerning the debtor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-13\">(B) the court does not grant the debt- or\u2019s spouse a discharge in such case concerning the debtor\u2019s spouse.... <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmL\">In other words, to the extent that the debtor\u2019s spouse \u201chas been denied a discharge previously ..., the debts of that spouse will survive against after-acquired community property.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">The bankruptcy court correctly determined that the Muller debt survived against after-acquired community property in light of \u00a7 524(b). Within six years of the commencement of his wife\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding, Irving Moody sought and was denied discharge of the Muller debt in his own Chapter 7 proceeding. Thus, while there is no question that Pellie Moody received a discharge of the Muller debt, her discharge does not enjoin Muller from garnishing Irving Moody\u2019s wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">Pellie Moody argues that we should find the \u00a7 524(b) exception inapplicable because her husband <em>could have </em>received a discharge of the Muller debt in a hypothetical Chapter 13 proceeding (despite having been denied a discharge in his <em>actual </em>Chapter 7 proceeding). We reject this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>argument as contrary to the statute\u2019s unambiguous terms: \u00a7 524(b) exempts from \u00a7 524(a)(3)\u2019s discharge protections an obligation that was previously held nondis-chargeable as to the debtor\u2019s spouse in a separate proceeding, period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute makes no exception for a situation where the spouse was denied a discharge but could have received one had he chosen to file under a different chapter of the Code. Because the terms of the statute are plain and unambiguous, our sole function is to enforce it according to its terms as provided by Congress.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We thus decline to adopt Pellie Moody\u2019s countertextual reading of \u00a7 524(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Pellie Moody also contends that principles of res judicata barred the bankruptcy court from holding that \u00a7 524(b) allows the Muller debt to survive against after-acquired community property. We disagree. Moody argues that the bankruptcy court ruled on the same issue now before us when it overruled Muller\u2019s objection to including the Muller debt in her Chapter 13 plan. But this is not so. The bankruptcy court\u2019s earlier ruling confirmed that the Muller debt could be included in Pellie Moody\u2019s reorganization plan and discharged with respect to Pellie Moody. The question before us today is not whether Pellie Moody received a discharge of the Muller debt. Rather, our question is the legal effect of her discharge. That issue is squarely controlled by \u00a7 524 of the Code, which \u201cspells out ... what it means for a debt to be discharged.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Pellie Moody\u2019s reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. </em>Espinosa,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to support her res judicata argument is misplaced. That case dealt with an entirely different issue than the one before us. There, the bankruptcy court discharged a student loan, which are nondischargeable under Chapter 18 without an adversary proceeding and a finding of \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the debt- or.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After the discharge, the student-loan creditor commenced efforts to collect on the debt, and Espinosa moved to enforce the discharge order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The creditor, in turn, filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4), seeking to set aside the discharge as void. The Supreme Court held that the judgment discharging the student-loan debt was erroneous but not \u201cvoid,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> so it could not be set aside under Rule 60(b)(4). Here, by contrast, the bankruptcy court did not hold that the prior order discharging the Muller debt as to Pellie Moody was void. Rather, it held that, despite Pellie Moody\u2019s individual discharge, under \u00a7 524(b), the Muller debt survived as against after-acquired community property. Thus, the bankruptcy court\u2019s holding below was not barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">For the reasons stated herein, we AFFIRM the judgment of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b693-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
