Gregg argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Gregg\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Gregg argues that the district court erroneously \u201cimpos[ed] ... a prison term to promote [his] rehabilitation,\u201d <em>see Tapia v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2391, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011), but the district court stated that it was \u201cnot sure that the sentence should take into account the need for training or education,\u201d and it did not \u201cbase[] [Gregg\u2019s] sentence on [that] impermissible factorf ],\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009). The district court reasonably determined that Gregg should receive a \u201chigh sentence\u201d based on the \u201cserious\u201d nature of his \u201carmed bank robbery\u201d; his \u201cdistressing personal history consisting of a continuous, repeated, practically nonstop life of crime from a very young age of 12\u201d; his inability to \u201clive outside an institutional setting respectful of other rights to liberty, ... security, ... [and] to own property\u201d; and the need to deter him from future similar crimes. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">We AFFIRM Gregg\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
