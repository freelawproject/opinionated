California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Sma-di has filed a response. To the extent that Smadi contends that his guilty plea was due to \u201cscare tactics\u201d or made under coercion and duress, the record is insufficiently developed to permit consideration of such a claim. <em>See United States v. Corbett, </em>742 F.2d 173, 176-78 (5th Cir.1984). Smadi may raise such a claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>at 178 n. 11. Likewise, the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Sma-di\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; such a claim generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Smadi\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, Sma-di\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel is DENIED, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
