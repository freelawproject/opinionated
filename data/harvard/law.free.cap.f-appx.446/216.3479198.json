The district court concluded that Boyle\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was barred by the sentence appeal waiver in his plea agreement. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-24\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AyA\">A. Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b245-25\">In 2003, Boyle pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b)(1)(C). Boyle\u2019s plea agreement contained a sentence appeal waiver in which Boyle waived his \u201cright to appeal defendant\u2019s sentence, directly or collaterally, including the filing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition, on any ground ... except for an upward departure by the sentencing judge, a sentence above the statutory maximum, or a sentence in violation of the law apart from the sentencing guidelines.\u201d Boyle acknowledged in the plea agreement that his statutory maximum sentence was twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">During the plea hearing, a magistrate judge reviewed with Boyle, <em>inter alia, </em>the terms of the plea agreement. The magistrate judge pointed out the sentence appeal waiver. The magistrate judge then asked Boyle whether he understood that he was waiving his right to appeal the sentence \u201cdirectly or collaterally, including a waiver of [Boyle\u2019s] right to file what is referred to as a 2255 petition\u201d and reviewed the exceptions to the sentence appeal waiver. Boyle responded that he understood. The magistrate judge found that Boyle had entered his guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily and filed a report (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommending that the district court accept Boyle\u2019s plea. The district court adopted the R &amp; R without objection from Boyle and accepted Boyle\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">B. 2003 Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the Pre-sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended that Boyle be classified a career offender based on Boyle\u2019s two prior felony convictions for (1) carrying a concealed firearm and (2) possession of cocaine with intent to sell or deliver. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (2003) (designating a defendant a career offender if he, <em>inter alia, </em>has \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense\u201d); <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding that the offense of carrying a concealed firearm was a crime of violence under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)). Because of Boyle\u2019s career offender status, his offense level rose from level 10 to level 32. After a 3-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Boyle\u2019s total offense level was 29. With a criminal history category of VI, the PSI calculated the applicable guidelines range as 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">At the 2003 sentencing, Boyle did not object to the career offender enhancement or to any of the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations. The district court imposed the career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1, resulting in a guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed a 151-month sentence. Boyle did not file a direct appeal of his sentence in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">C. Section 2255 Motion in 2008</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">In April 2008, in <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), this Court concluded that the offense of carrying a concealed firearm was not a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1\u2019s career offender enhancement. Prior to <em>Archer </em>and as noted earlier, carrying a concealed weapon was a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.1\u2019s career offender enhancement. <em>See United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998). In Archer, this Court determined that our precedent had been undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). <em>See Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">In August 2008, Boyle filed this \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his career offender designation based on <em>Archer.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ment moved to dismiss Boyle\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that Boyle\u2019s <em>Archer </em>claim: (1) was barred by the collateral appeal waiver in Boyle\u2019s plea agreement; (2) was untimely under \u00a7 2255(f)(1) because it was not filed within one year of his 2003 conviction becoming final; (3) was not cognizable under \u00a7 2255; and (4) was procedurally defaulted because he did not raise it at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In response, Boyle asserted that he \u201cis not and does not contest the validity of his deal with the government; nor does he challenge the legality of his appeal waiver clause.\u201d Instead, Boyle argued that, although he now challenged his career offender designation in light of Archer, his claim also implicated the Due Process Clause. As such, Boyle contended his \u00a7 2255 claim was cognizable under \u00a7 2255 and fell within the collateral appeal waiver\u2019s \u201cviolation of law apart from the sentencing guidelines\u201d exception. Boyle claimed his \u00a7 2255 motion was timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(3) because it was filed it within one year of <em>Begay, </em>which announced a substantive change in the law. Finally, Boyle argued that he could not procedurally default his claim based on <em>Archer </em>because he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of being a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">On September 15, 2009, the district court dismissed Boyle\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, concluding it was barred by Boyle\u2019s collateral appeal waiver. The district court rejected Boyle\u2019s argument that his \u00a7 2255 claim fell within the \u201cviolation of law apart from the sentencing guidelines\u201d exception. Specifically, the district court stated that <em>\u201cArcher </em>does nothing more than interpret the Guidelines in a new albeit a different and important way,\u201d and \u201cneither <em>Archer </em>or any Supreme Court precedent upon which <em>Archer </em>relied was predicated upon any new rule of constitutional interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Boyle filed this appeal. The district court granted Boyle\u2019s request for a Certification of Appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Among the considerations that the defendant may offer as part of his plea agreement is the waiver of his right to appeal his sentence, provided that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Howle, </em>166 F.3d 1166, 1168 (11th Cir.1999). An appeal waiver may waive the right to appeal difficult, debatable legal issues and even blatant legal error. <em>Id. </em>at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Under the terms of Boyle\u2019s sentence appeal waiver, Boyle cannot collaterally attack his sentence through a \u00a7 2255 motion. Boyle\u2019s sentence appeal waiver contained an exception for claims that the sentence was \u201cin violation of a law <em>apart from the sentencing guidelines.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Reading the sentence appeal waiver and exception together, Boyle (1) waived his right to argue in a direct or collateral appeal that the sentencing court misapplied the guidelines, but (2) preserved his right to argue that his sentence violated the Constitution or some other law. Thus, to the extent Boyle\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion claims that, in light of <em>Archer, </em>the district court erroneously applied the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement in the guidelines, that issue is barred by Boyle\u2019s sentence appeal waiver in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Boyle contends that his \u00a7 2255 motion is not barred by his sentence appeal waiver because his claim based on <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer </em>also implicates the Due Process Clause and thus falls within the \u201cviolation of a law apart from the sentencing guidelines\u201d exception to the sentence ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>peal waiver.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Boyle\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion raises a due process claim that falls within the exception in his plea agreement, Boyle never challenged his career offender status in the district court or on direct appeal. Thus, his due process-career offender claim is barred and the district court\u2019s dismissal was proper for the reasons discussed in our recent decision in <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2011). <em>See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that we may affirm a district court\u2019s judgment \u201con any ground that finds support in the record\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In <em>McKay, </em>this Court concluded that a \u00a7 2255 movant procedurally defaulted his challenge to his career offender designation by failing to advance such a claim on direct appeal. <em>See McKay, </em>657 F.3d at 1191-93. McKay, like Boyle, was classified as a career offender based in part on a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon. <em>Id. </em>McKay did not object to his career offender enhancement at sentencing and did not file a direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>After this Court decided Archer, McKay filed a \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his career offender designation. <em>Id. </em>at 1194-95. The district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion on the ground that McKay\u2019s \u201cGuidelines misapplication claim was not cognizable under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">On appeal, this Court affirmed the denial of McKay\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on procedural default grounds, \u201cleaving] for another day the question of whether this type of claim is cognizable under \u00a7 2255 in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1195. The Court rejected McKay\u2019s argument that his \u201cactual innocence\u201d excused his procedural default. <em>Id. </em>at 1198-99. The Court stated that \u201cfor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>purposes of the actual innocence exception, \u2018actual innocence\u2019 means <em>factual </em>innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197 (quotation marks omitted). The Court explained that McKay\u2019s claim was not one of factual innocence, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">McKay makes the purely <em>legal </em>argument that he is actually innocent of his career offender sentence because his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon should not have been classified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines. McKay does not even suggest, because he cannot, that he did not actually commit the crime of carrying a concealed weapon. In other words, he makes no claim of <em>factual </em>innocence of the predicate offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1199. Thus, the Court concluded that \u201ceven if the actual innocence exception were to extend to the noncapital sentencing context (a question we need not decide), this exception would not apply to McKay\u2019s claim of legal innocence and thus could not excuse his procedural default.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Here, it is undisputed that Boyle did not file a direct appeal of his sentence. Boyle argues, like McKay, that his \u201cactual innocence\u201d excuses his procedural default. However, Boyle does not contend that he is factually innocent of the underlying offense of carrying a concealed weapon. Rather, Boyle argues that his conviction is legally insufficient to constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. As such, under <em>McKay, </em>the actual innocence exception does not apply to Boyle\u2019s claim. Thus, Boyle procedurally defaulted any due process claim relating to his designation as a career offender.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">In sum, we conclude that, to the extent Boyle\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion raised a guidelines calculation error, it is barred by his sentence appeal waiver. To the extent Boyle\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion raised a due process claim not barred by his sentence appeal waiver, Boyle procedurally defaulted that claim by not raising it in a direct appeal of his sentence. For these reasons, the district court properly dismissed Boyle\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-16\">. In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">. Boyle\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion does not allege a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel or appellate counsel with respect to his career offender designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b248-5\">. For the first time on appeal, Boyle raises the following new arguments: (1) Boyle\u2019s collateral appeal waiver is invalid and unenforceable because it was not knowingly and voluntarily made; (2) Boyle\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claim falls within the upward departure exception to the collateral appeal waiver because Boyle is not a career offender under Archer; and (3) there was a mutual mistake regarding his status as a career offender, absent which he would have been able to attack his sentence. Because Boyle did not raise these arguments in the district court, we decline to address them. <em>See Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1282 (11th Cir.2006) (refusing to address an argument raised for the first time in a federal prisoner's appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition); <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (stating in a \u00a7 2255 context that \"issues not raised below are normally deemed waived\u201d). Likewise, we decline to address Boyle's argument, raised for the first time in his reply brief, that his collateral appeal waiver is unenforceable because it results in a miscarriage of justice. See <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that issues not raised in the initial brief on appeal are deemed waived); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5) (requiring issues to be raised in initial briefs).</p>\n<p id=\"ADd\">Furthermore, to the extent Boyle now claims his sentence appeal waiver is invalid, in the district court Boyle affirmatively asserted that he \"is not and does not contest the validity of his deal with the government; nor does he challenge the legality of his appeal waiver clause.\u201d In other words, Boyle not only failed to raise the issue of the validity of his sentence appeal waiver in the district court, he arguably invited the district court to conclude that the appeal waiver was valid. <em>See United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that we are precluded from reviewing an issue raised on appeal if it was waived through invited error). In any event, the record refutes that his invalidity claim because the district court covered the relevant points in its colloquy about the sentence appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1351 (11th Cir.1993) (explaining that the government establishes that a defendant waived his appeal rights knowingly and voluntarily, when it shows that \"the district court specifically questioned the defendant concerning the sentence appeal waiver during the Rule 11 colloquy\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\">. Alternatively, Boyle asserts that his claim falls under the cause and prejudice exception to the procedural default rule. <em>See McKay, </em>657 F.3d at 1196 (stating that, under the cause and prejudice exception to the procedural default rule, the movant must show cause for failing to raise the \"error on direct appeal <em>and </em>actual prejudice from the alleged error\u201d). Because Boyle did not assert this ground in the district court, we do not address it. <em>See Tannenbaum, </em>148 F.3d at 1263.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
