Upon a review of the record, we deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-18\">Abreu entered the United States in July 2007 on a non-immigrant visa. In April 2008, Abreu filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>lief, based on nationality, political opinion, and membership in a social group. In the application, Abreu argued that she had organized and participated in events against the government and, as a result, had been persecuted by pro-government groups. The most serious claim in Abreu\u2019s application was that she had been raped and almost killed during an encounter with \u201cChavista\u201d students at her university. In her application, Abreu noted that she had an Italian passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">After a hearing on the merits, the IJ denied Abreu\u2019s application. In his oral decision, the IJ made an adverse-credibility determination based, in part, upon the fact that Abreu\u2019s initial application for asylum stated that she had been \u201craped and almost killed,\u201d but that she had amended her application to indicate that she was \u201calmost raped and almost killed.\u201d Abreu acknowledged the inconsistency, but claimed, due to her limited English comprehension, that she did not realize until ten days before the hearing that the application was incorrect and that she amended her application as soon as she realized the mistake. But the IJ also noted that Abreu\u2019s testimony regarding this incident was very general and lacked specific dates. The IJ further determined that even if her application and testimony were credited, she had not established persecution within the meaning of the INA. Finally, the IJ noted that before granting relief, he would also have required Abreu to establish whether she had dual citizenship in Italy and could resettle there because she had an Italian passport and her grandparents resided there.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Abreu appealed the decision to the BIA on the ground that she had \u201cpresented a valid and coherent political asylum-based case.\u201d The BIA affirmed, concluding that there was no clear error in the IJ\u2019s credibility findings that: (1) Abreu\u2019s testimony was not sufficiently detailed, consistent, or believable; and (2) Abreu failed to amend her asylum application with respect to her initial claim that she had been \u201craped and almost killed\u201d until ten days before the hearing, despite admitting that the English translation of the application was read to her in Spanish. The BIA determined that Abreu\u2019s summary contention in her brief that she \u201cbelieved\u201d that she provided a coherent and plausible account was not a sufficient basis on which to disturb the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. Based on this determination, the BIA declined to address Abreu\u2019s other arguments regarding persecution. The BIA also concluded that Abreu had not demonstrated an entitlement to withholding of removal or CAT relief. Abreu then filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA explicitly agreed with several findings of the IJ, we may review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ as to those issues. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010). We review factual determinations, which include credibility determinations, under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006). We must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). We will view \u201cthe record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, to conclude that a finding of fact should be reversed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>we must determine that the record \u201ccompels\u201d reversal. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">An applicant for asylum must meet the INA\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). This definition includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Thus, to meet the definition of \u201crefugee,\u201d the applicant must, \u201cwith specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain her burden of proof without corroborating evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1255. Conversely, if the applicant relies solely on her testimony, an adverse-credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an application. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). When the IJ makes an adverse-credibility finding, the applicant must demonstrate that the decision was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Pursuant to the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13 \u00a7 101,119 Stat. 302, for applications filed after May 11, 2005, a credibility determination may be based on the totality of the circumstances, including: (1) the demeanor, candor, and responsiveness of the applicant; (2) the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account; (3) the consistency between the applicant\u2019s written and oral statements; (4) the internal consistency of each statement; and (5) the consistency of the applicant\u2019s statements with other record evidence, including country reports. INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). An adverse-credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">Abreu argues the IJ erred in his adverse-credibility determination because she provided a coherent account and answered the questions posed to her with conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The United States responds that the IJ and BIA made their adverse-credibility determinations on numerous and substantial inconsistencies and that Abreu\u2019s credibility argument on appeal is \u201cvague.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">Here, specific, cogent reasons supported the adverse-credibility determination. Although Abreu offered a tenable explanation for the inconsistency between her testimony and her asylum application \u2014 that the application was translated incorrectly \u2014 that explanation does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>compel a conclusion that Abreu was otherwise credible. <em>See Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that although applicant offered a reasonable explanation for inconsistencies in her testimony, it did not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination). And although Abreu did amend her application to clarify that she was \u201calmost raped and almost killed,\u201d her hearing testimony merely indicated that she was \u201cinappropriately touched.\u201d Because this testimony relates to the heart of Abreu\u2019s claim, we find that the IJ did not abuse its discretion in finding that she was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Finally, the BIA declined to address any other arguments relating to the merits of Abreu\u2019s persecution claim, in light of its credibility determination. Accordingly, Abreu\u2019s arguments on appeal as to whether she demonstrated persecution, including whether the IJ engaged in improper speculation that she could relocate within Venezuela or resettle in Italy, are outside the scope of this court\u2019s review and should not be addressed. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1232 n. 4 (refusing to address the merits of a persecution claim because the IJ\u2019s decision was based on an adverse-credibility determination). Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss the petition in part, and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-11\">. As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination as to Abreu\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief because Abreu did not argue these claims before the BIA, notwithstanding that the BIA addressed them <em>sua sponte. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\">. Abreu\u2019s also argues on appeal that the IJ erred in his adverse-credibility determination because he failed to consider corroborating evidence, specifically the country report, declarations, and voting records. But because Abreu did not raise this argument before the BIA, it has not been exhausted and we will not consider it here. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
