In their petition, the Petitioners sought review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), dated May 19, 2010, denying their motion to reopen the BIA\u2019s previous decision, dated February 20, 2009. The BIA\u2019s February 2009 decision affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of the Petitioners\u2019 application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1231, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. In their <em>pro se </em>brief on appeal, the Petitioners challenge only the BIA\u2019s February 2009 decision affirming the denial of their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. They make no reference to their motion to reopen or to the BIA\u2019s May 2010 denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-19\">We review our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). We do not have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal if the petition for review is not filed within that deadline because \u201cthe statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is mandatory and jurisdictional, [and] it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>(11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">While we liberally construe briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants, <em>Lorisme v. I.N.S., </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444 n. 3 (11th Cir.1997), \u201c[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned,\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Because the Petitioners did not file their petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s order denying their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, we do not have jurisdiction to consider the merits of that decision. And because the Petitioners make no argument concerning their motion to reopen in their opening brief, they have abandoned the issue. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
