Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001), which rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to the felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77, 81-82 (5th Cir.1988), which held that a conviction under \u00a7 922(g) does not require proof that the defendant knew that the firearm in his possession had an interstate nexus and that he was a felon. In addition, Hall presents arguments that he concedes are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Rose, </em>587 F.3d 695, 705-06 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1915, 176 L.Ed.2d 387 (2010), which held that <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009) did not alter the proof required in a \u00a7 922(g)(1) case. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b713-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
