(\u201cRacetrac\u201d) purchased from Ace American Insurance Company (\u201cACE\u201d). Race-trac was sued by two individuals who claim they suffered personal injuries as a result of exposure to Racetrac\u2019s gasoline products. When ACE refused to cover Race-trac for those claims, Racetrac sought a declaratory judgment, claiming that the policies covered their excess liability. The district court found that Racetrac failed to state a claim for declaratory relief upon which relief may be granted and dismissed Racetrac\u2019s complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court found that the pollution exclusion clause in the policies precluded coverage. Racetrac now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">After carefully reviewing the record and the district court\u2019s order, we conclude that the court properly granted the motion to dismiss. The pollution exclusion provision in the policies expressly excludes coverage for injuries caused by \u201cany substance if such substance has, or is alleged to have, the effect of making the [air] impure, harmful, or dangerous,\u201d including the air within a structure. As the district court correctly found, Racetrac seeks coverage for the injured employees\u2019 claims that \u201callege that the gasoline vapor, and specifically the toxic benzene contained in it, made the air they inhaled impure, harmful, and dangerous, which resulted in their claimed physical injuries.\u201d Such claims fall squarely within the policies\u2019 pollution exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">We also agree with the district court that the pollution exclusion does not violate Georgia public policy since the liability insurance policies at issue are primarily intended to provide Racetrac with coverage for the countless other risks associated with operating convenience stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
