Rebollar-Zuarez challenges, for the first time, the lack of factual findings about the need for, or his ability to pay, his fine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The district court did not plainly err by failing to make findings of fact to support its decision to order Rebollar-Zuarez to pay a fine that was substantially below the recommended amount of $7,500 to $75,000. The district court was required to impose a fine unless Rebollar-Zuarez \u201cestablish[ed] that he [was] unable to pay and [was] not likely to become able to pay any fine.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5E1.2(a) (Nov. 2010). The presentence investigation report provided that Rebollar-Zuarez might \u201cbe able to pay a lower fine\u201d than the recommended amount based on his steady employment from 2004 to 2010 during which he had earned between $8 an hour and $100 a day, opened a joint savings account with his \u25a0wife, and purchased a home in Mexico. Rebollar-Zuarez, by \u201cfailing] to object to [those] allegations of fact in [his] [presen-tence report,] admitted] those facts for sentencing purposes,\u201d <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006), and the district court was entitled to rely on Rebollar-Zuarez\u2019s admission to impose the $500 fine. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 666 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">We AFFIRM the fine imposed on Re-bollar-Zuarez.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
