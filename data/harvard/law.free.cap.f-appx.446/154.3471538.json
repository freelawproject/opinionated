On appeal, Fanfair argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen because it failed to consider pertinent evidence, chiefly his sworn affidavit, indicating that he had failed to receive notice of the 2003 hearing. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">Where, as here, the BIA issues its an opinion affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) ruling \u201cfor the reasons cited to therein,\u201d we will review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s orders. <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir.2009) (reviewing the IJ\u2019s decision to the extent that the BIA found that its reasoning was supported by the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). The BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad, and review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are considered \u201cconclusive unless a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003). In the context of a motion to reopen, whether an alien received sufficient notice of his removal hearing is a finding of fact. <em>See Contreras-Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>462 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2006) (granting petition for review and remanding for the BIA to consider in the first instance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>whether petitioner received a sufficient notice of hearing before being removed in absentia).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Ordinarily, if an alien fails to appear for an asylum hearing, his application will be denied. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.2(c)(3)(ii). But an alien may move to reopen proceedings at any time if his unexcused absence and the subsequent entry of an in absentia removal order resulted from a failure to properly notify him of the hearing and \u201cthe failure to appear was through no fault of the alien.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). .</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Service by mail is a proper form of notice. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(c). \u201cDue process is satisfied so long as the method of notice is conducted in a manner reasonably calculated to ensure that notice reaches the alien.\u201d <em>Dominguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>284 F.3d 1258, 1259 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). An alien bears an affirmative responsibility to keep the agency informed of his correct, current address. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a); <em>Dominguez, </em>284 F.3d at 1260. Given this duty, \u201cnotice to the alien at the most recent address provided by the alien is sufficient notice,\u201d justifying an in absen-tia removal. <em>Dominguez, </em>284 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Here, the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determinations that Fanfair\u2019s affidavit, standing alone, was inadequate to demonstrate improper service was neither arbitrary nor capricious. As the records shows, immigration officials detained Fanfair upon his arrival in the United States in 2003 and notified him that his application for asylum had been referred to an IJ. Following release, the agency served Fanfair with a notice of an asylum hearing, scheduled for May 2003, by mailing it to the address it had on file for him: \u201c2 Stephens Ct., Brooklyn, N.Y. 11226-7514.\u201d Fanfair did not attend his hearing, and an IJ accordingly ordered him removed in absentia. In 2010, Fanfair filed the present motion to reopen his asylum proceedings before the IJ, on the grounds that he never received the 2003 notice of hearing, and provided a sworn affidavit indicating that the address he provided to immigration officials included an apartment number, whereas the notice of hearing included no such number.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">However, both the BIA and IJ properly concluded that this affidavit was uncorroborated. While the address listed in the notice of hearing could be explained by agency officials\u2019 erroneous omission of an apartment number, Fanfair submitted no corroborating statement from his uncle that they lived together at that address at the time of his hearing. Indeed, he did not submit any evidence, beyond his self-serving statement, to show that \u201c2 Stephens Court\u201d even had apartments, much less that he actually lived in \u201cApt. 1.\u201d It would not have been difficult for Fanfair to do so: by his own admission, he had been sentenced to probation for larceny in New York, which would have required him to produce an accurate, current address to his probation officer, who could then have submitted court records or served as an additional witness. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 65.10(3)(a) and (c) (requiring as a mandatory condition of probation that a probationer make himself available to a probation officer at \u201chis place of abode\u201d and report any change of address).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Further supporting the soundness of the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decisions was the fact that they were based not only on Fanfair\u2019s evidence, but also on evidence in the available record that he did not submit, some of which tended to undermine his claim. In particular, Fanfair was personally served in 2003 with both a notice of referral and a notice of an earlier asylum hearing. These notices expressly provided warnings that if he did not appear for his asylum hearing, he risked receiving an in absentia order of removal. Fanfair did not maintain \u2014 and the record does not reflect \u2014 that he ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>contacted agency officials to check on the status of his proceedings following his release. Rather, he waited until February 2010 to file a motion to reopen. Taking into consideration that Fanfair could file a motion at any time regarding improper notice, and assuming it to be true that he did not know about the removal order until he was detained in 2009, the significant lapse without any proactive interest in his pending immigration proceedings nonetheless detracts from his allegation that the notice of appear was sent to the wrong address to begin with. Even assuming arguendo that Fanfair\u2019s supporting evidence made his claim a \u201cclose question,\u201d when we consider his affidavit against the contrary evidence, the BIA and IJ were not compelled to conclude that Fanfair\u2019s affidavit was sufficient to overcome the presumption that the agency sent the notice of hearing to the right address. <em>See Lonyem, </em>352 F.3d at 1340. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
