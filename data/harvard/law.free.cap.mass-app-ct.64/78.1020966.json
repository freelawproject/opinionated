Her land lies within one of the three historic districts (the Hancock-Clarke Historic District) established in the town by St. 1956, c. 447 (the Act). In 2000, she sought a certificate of appropriateness from the town\u2019s historic districts commission (commission) for improvements to her driveway and yard that she had largely already constmcted. The commission denied her application, and Warner sought judicial review of its decision under \u00a7 10 of the Act. In 2003, a Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>judge, acting on the commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment, entered a final judgment affirming the commission\u2019s decision. Warner appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The improvements at issue are these: first, a gravel driveway extension of a paved driveway that runs from Hancock Avenue parallel to the rear line of Warner\u2019s lot,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the purpose of the extension being to provide additional parking; second, a low, railroad-tie retaining wall, topped by a cast iron rail fence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> separating the gravel extension from Warner\u2019s yard; and, third, cedar fencing for a compost pile located between the end of the gravel extension and the back comer of the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We mention, by way of background, that this was not Warner\u2019s first encounter with the commission. In 1994 and 1995, she received certificates of appropriateness for major improvements to the same property. These included rebuilding and enlarging a passageway from her house to a bam, extending the driveway from Hancock Street around the barn and out to Hancock Avenue (thus forming a paved segment that Warner has lengthened by the gravel extension), creating a parking cut-out off the Hancock Avenue segment of the driveway to accommodate off-street parking, and repainting the house, bam, and shutters with a new, agreed-upon color scheme. By 2001, the commission had come to quarrel with Warner\u2019s execution of the work authorized in 1994-1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Lexington\u2019s was one of the earliest of the Commonwealth\u2019s historic district statutes, being preceded, so far as we know, only by St. 1955, c. 616, which created the Historic Beacon Hill District in Boston. The purpose of the Act was to protect \u201chistoric buildings, places and districts through the development of appropriate settings for said buildings, places and districts and through the maintenance of said buildings, places and districts as landmarks of historic interest.\u201d St. 1956, c. 447, \u00a7 1. The role of the commission is to police the construction, alteration, and demolition of visible buildings and structures within the defined district, including changes of color and post<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ing of signs. In particular \u00a7 9 of the Act, as applied to Warner\u2019s application, required the commission to \u201cpass upon . . . [t]he appropriateness of exterior architectural features of . . . structures to be erected within the historic districts whenever such features are subject to view from a public street, way, or place.\u201d St. 1956, c. 447, \u00a7 9(a)(1). Warner acknowledged that the gravel drive extension, the railroad-tie retaining wall and cast iron rail fence, and the cedar fence proposed for the compost area were all at least \u201cslightly visible\u201d from Hancock Avenue, thus establishing the necessity of a certificate of appropriateness to proceed with the work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal Warner does not argue that the wall, the two fences, and the gravel driveway extension are not \u201cstructures\u201d within the commission\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of appropriateness for a project involving \u201cexternal architectural features,\u201d the commission is required by the statute to conduct a public hearing (St. 1956, c. 447, \u00a7 8) and to render a determination on the application within a specified time. In making its determinatian, the commission is required to \u201cconsider, among other things, the historic value and significance of the building or structure, the general design, arrangement, texture, material, and color of the features, sign or billboard involved and the relation of such factors to similar factors of buildings and structures in the immediate surroundings.\u201d St. 1956, c. 447, \u00a7 9(a)(4), third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>par. Where a project is deemed generally inappropriate, the commission is directed to consider whether a \u201cfailure to approve an application will involve a substantial hardship to the applicant and whether such application may be approved without substantial detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of this act.\u201d St. 1956, c. 447, \u00a7 9(a)(4), second par. Then, \u201c[i]n the case of disapproval of an application for a certificate of appropriateness,\u201d the commission is required to \u201cnotify the applicant in writing, <em>setting forth therein the reasons for its </em>determination,\u201d and it \u201cmay make recommendations to the applicant with respect to appropriateness of design, arrangement, texture, material, color, and similar factors\u201d (emphasis supplied). St. 1956, c. 447, \u00a7 9(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Here, the commission\u2019s notice of determination, after a brief introduction describing the application, consisted of five dis-positive paragraphs. The first three described the failure of Warner and her husband to complete satisfactorily the work done under the 1994-1995 certificates of appropriateness. The painting of the bam was incomplete. The cupola had been left a different color from the bam itself. The slate roof remained in a state of disrepair. Shutters removed from the house during the repainting had never been put back, and, indeed, Warner, despite assurances to the commission that the shutters would be rehung, had removed most of the hardware necessary for rehanging. Neighbors were complaining of peeling paint. The commission stated in its determination that \u201cthe Warners had never completed their original project. All Certificates of Appropriateness clearly state that upon completion of construction, the work is expected to be kept in good condition; clearly this was not the case with the bam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The remaining two dispositive paragraphs of the notice of determination, set out below,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> relate that the commission considered the various factors that the Act, as quoted above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>directed it to consider. This it does largely by reciting the statutory language; missing are explanations of how those statutory factors bore on their denial of the certificate, the <em>reasons, </em>in effect, for their determination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The Superior Court, in reviewing the adequacy of the decision of a historic district commission, applies \u201ca standard of review analogous to that governing exercise of the power to grant ordinary special permits,\u201d taken from the zoning context. <em>Gumley </em>v. <em>Board of Selectman of Nantucket, </em>371 Mass. 718, 719 (1977). See <em>Marr </em>v. <em>Back Bay Architectural Commn., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 679, 682-683 (1987). A \u201cdecision of the commission cannot be disturbed . . . \u2018unless it is based on a legally untenable ground, or is unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gumley </em>v. <em>Board of Selectman of Nantucket, supr</em>at 723, quoting from <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Duxbury, </em>369 Mass. 512, 515-516 (1976). The judge should conduct a two-step inquiry. First, the judge should determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the decision, on its face, is \u201cinsufficient in law to warrant the commission\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Marr </em>v. <em>Back Bay Architectural Commn., supra </em>at 683. If so, the decision \u201cshould be annulled without further ado unless the court, in the exercise of its discretian, chooses to request a supplemental statement of the commission\u2019s reasons before any further proceedings are had.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Compare Ford, Judicial Review in Zoning Variances Cases &amp; Related Matters, 61 Mass. L.Q. 24 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"Aru\">\u201cIf the commission\u2019s decision appears to be based on a legally tenable ground, the court must then consider whether the reasons given are \u2018warranted by the evidence\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Marr </em>v. <em>Back Bay Architectual Commn., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 684. \u201cThe court is obliged to take evidence and make findings of fact on this branch of the inquiry.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Focusing on this principle, Warner argues, with some plausibility, that the judge could not properly affirm the commission\u2019s decision without first affording her the de nova review of the facts called for by \u00a7 10 of the Act. We do not reach this contention because, in our view, the commission\u2019s decision failed the first prong of the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"Atf\">The principal and recurring focus of the factual portion of the commission\u2019s decision was the failure to complete the 1994 and 1995 improvements. To the extent that the commission relied on that failure, it erroneously \u201cinject[ed] criteria not found in the enabling act. . . or in the by-law.\u201d <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dover, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 148, 156 (1977) (discussing zoning by-law and enabling act). Accord <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservatian Commn. of Reading, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 571 (1996). The balance of the commission\u2019s decision consisted of paraphrasing statutory language, without making specific findings. Mere repetition of statutory language does not adequately support the commission\u2019s decision. See <em>Wolfson </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co., </em>357 Mass. 87, 89-90 (1970); <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>362 Mass. 290, 298 (1972); <em>Delgaudio </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Medford, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 850, 850-851 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"A4f\">The commission\u2019s finding that the improvements would kill neighbors\u2019 trees appears to be logically relevant in applying the hardship exception and the substantial detriment criterion. St. 1956, c. 447, \u00a7 9(a). The commission failed otherwise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>link harm to neighboring trees to a statutory factor. Historic district commission decisions affirmed by this court have clearly explained the project\u2019s impact on enumerated statutory factors such as historic character or neighborhood context. See <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Old King's Highway Regional Historic Dist. Commn., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 573 (1981) (radio tower did not fit with low physical profile of surrounding structures and with historical context); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Old King's Highway Regional Historic Dist. Commn., </em>397 Mass. 609, 612 (1986) (vinyl siding would diminish historic significance of property, cause deterioration of the structure, and set detrimental precedent for neighborhood); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Old King's Highway Regional Historic Dist. Commn., </em>421 Mass. 612, 616 (1996) (home with three-car garage and outbuilding would overwhelm small lot, be out of keeping with massing and organization of neighborhood homes, and appear incongruous from street).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We conclude that the commission\u2019s decision was facially deficient. There is no need for the Superior Court to engage in an evidentiary hearing beyond establishing the record of the decision of the commission. The court may annul the decision or, in its discretion, request a supplemental statement of the commission\u2019s reasons. <em>Marr </em>v. <em>Back Bay Architectural Commn., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\"> Neither the existing paved driveway nor the gravel extension abuts the rear lot line; a photograph shows a buffer of lawn, bushes, and trees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\"> Wamer represents that the cast iron fence has been on the property for many decades from the early 1900\u2019s, apparently in another location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b102-16\"> Wamer argues that the \u201cextent [to which] the work is subject to view from a public street\u201d is a disputed issue of fact, precluding summary judgment; but we understand the materiality of the issue relates not to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction but only to the reasonableness of its determination that the work was not appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-21\"> The concession is, we think, correctly made. Walls and fences have been held to be \u201cstructures\u201d within the coverage of historic district statutes, see <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Hill Architectural Commn., </em>421 Mass. 570, 581 (1996); and the definitions section of the general historic districts enabling act, G. L. c. 40C, \u00a7 5, explicitly includes \u201cfence[s], wall[s], terrace[s], walk[s] or driveway[s]\u201d as \u201cstructures.\u201d We recognize that the General Law, enacted by St. 1971, c. 359, \u00a7 1, and its predecessor act, St. 1960, c. 372, was enacted after the Lexington historic districts act; but it has been held that \u201cwhere we interpret path-breaking legislation in the historic-preservation field, we should not be quick to infer large differences from subsequent legislative fine tuning and refinement of statutory language.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Hill Architectural Commn., 421 </em>Mass. at 581.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> \u201cAt the conclusion of the hearing, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 447, Acts of 1956, as amended (\u2018Act\u2019), the Commission unanimously determined that the requested driveway extension almost to the property line ... as well as the retaining wall and iron pipe fence over same, were not appropriate for the purposes of the Act. The Commission determined that failure to approve the application would not involve substantial hardship to the Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>plicant, owing to conditions especially affecting the property at 30 Hancock Street but not affecting the historic district generally. Even if substantial hardship owing to said conditions were shown, which it was not, the Commission determined that approval of the above items could not be given without substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of the Act and without substantial detriment to the public good, especially to the neighboring properties and Hancock Avenue properties, in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u201cIn summary, the Commission, in reaching its unanimous determination, considered the applicant\u2019s proposal for the driveway extension, railroad-tie retaining wall with the iron pipe railing over it, including, size, general design, arrangement, texture and materials. The Commission considered the approved bituminous concrete driveways maintained by the Applicant at this location, including and especially the size of same, considered generally the building lot and the buildings themselves, including the historical value and significance of the buildings, and the Commission took into account the relation of all said conditions to other properties in the immediate surroundings. Prior to reaching its unanimous decision, the Commission recommended that the homeowners finish the original renovation of the house: including rehanging the shutters, repairing the bam and repainting it and also finishing the painting of the cupola. The Commission also stressed the point that enlarging the parking area parallel to Hancock Street almost to the property line, where there is a \u2018dump\u2019 for composting and workmen\u2019s trash, would compact the land to an extent that the roots of the large trees belonging to the neighbors along that area would be cmshed and thus starved, thereby killing the trees in a few years time. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\"> The sole articulation of a reason is the final sentence relating to parked cars endangering neighboring trees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
