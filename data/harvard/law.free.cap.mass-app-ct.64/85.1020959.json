In the late 1990\u2019s, the plaintiffs moved into newly constructed homes adjacent to the ninth hole of the course. After moving into their homes, both plaintiffs discovered that errant golf balls struck by golfers playing the course came onto their properties with alarming frequency, and after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a mutually acceptable resolution with the defendants, the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>sought injunctive relief and damages in the Superior Court. After a trial without a jury, a judge of that court concluded that the defendants\u2019 operation of the golf course did not support the plaintiffs\u2019 nuisance claim, denied the requested relief, and directed entry of judgment dismissing the complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the recurrent entry by golf balls onto the plaintiffs\u2019 properties constitutes a continuing trespass, we conclude that the trial judge erred in denying injunctive relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Hennessy </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>265 Mass. 559, 561 (1929); <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Quaboag Country Club, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 534, 538 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\"><em>Background. </em>There appears to be little dispute concerning the facts. We summarize the trial judge\u2019s findings, adding occasional references to undisputed trial testimony where it serves to illustrate or amplify the judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-16\">Both plaintiffs\u2019 homes are within a residential subdivision known as Columbine Estates. The subdivision was developed independently of Middlebrook and is unrelated to it. Amaral purchased her home from the subdivision developer; Pray purchased a lot in the subdivision and constructed her home thereafter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-22\">As noted earlier, Middlebrook is a private golf club that the defendants have owned since 1981. There are 120 members in the club. Approximately 40,000 rounds of golf are played on the course in aggregate during the course of a year. Middle-brook is a nine hole course, and par is thirty-five.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-27\">The plaintiffs were aware before purchasing their properties that the properties were adjacent to the ninth hole of the golf course. Both, in fact, had played the Middlebrook course once at some time before their purchase. Amaral is a regular golfer and a member of a golf club in Massachusetts and another in Florida, but is not a member of Middlebrook. Pray does not play golf on a regular basis, but her husband does; like Amaral, Pray\u2019s husband is a member of a golf club but is not a member of Middlebrook.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-36\">Before she purchased her home, Amaral asked the realtor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>who showed her the house whether golf balls often came onto the property and was assured it was not a problem. After moving into her home, however, Amaral discovered that golf balls frequently came onto her property, often followed by golfers hoping to retrieve them. To remedy the latter intrusion, Amaral replaced a degraded barbed wire fence with a six foot high chain link fence. That helped deter the entries by golfers, but not their errant shots. During a weekend of good weather in golfing season, up to a dozen balls typically come onto Amaral\u2019s property. At trial, Amaral brought with her six plastic buckets, each containing approximately 300 golf balls she had retrieved from her yard during the five years she had occupied her home. Amaral testified that in addition to those 1,800 balls, she had given many others away, and had used others to play herself. Five window screens were damaged by balls that hit her house, and one large window was broken; the defendants reimbursed Amaral for the cost of replacing the window screens but refused her request for the $945 she paid to replace the broken window. Other balls have hit the siding of the house and a deck attached to the rear of the house. One ball landed on the hood of her mother\u2019s car while it was parked in Amaral\u2019s front driveway, and while Amaral, her mother, and her son were standing nearby; the ball left a dimpled dent in the car\u2019s metal hood. On another occasion when Amaral was not home, Fray\u2019s husband observed a golf ball strike Amaral\u2019s home so hard that it triggered the burglar alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Though no person has yet been struck by a golf ball on Amaral\u2019s property, the fear of being struck has a significant effect on Amaral\u2019s use and enjoyment of her yard. Amaral restricts her son\u2019s use of the yard for play to an area on the side of her house away from the ninth tee. She seldom uses the rear deck. She contracts with a landscaping company for maintenance of her yard; the members of the landscaping crew wear hard hats while working in her yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Before constructing their home, the Prays staked out the site of the proposed house on the ground. They decided to relocate the house to a different portion of the lot when they discovered, on a visit to the site, that a significant number of golf balls had accumulated since the preceding day on the ground in the spot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>where their bedroom was to be located.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Fewer balls come onto Fray\u2019s property than onto Amaral\u2019s, but the number is nonetheless significant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Despite the preconstruction relocation of their house, one ball struck the side of the Prays\u2019 master bedroom. On another occasion, a ball struck Fray\u2019s husband while he was on the roof of their home. Balls land with some regularity in the Prays\u2019 backyard swimming pool; Pray accordingly requires her two children to wait until after dusk to use the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">After the plaintiffs raised concerns with the defendants about the number of golf balls coming onto their properties, the defendants made various adjustments to the ninth hole in an effort to ameliorate the problem. They eliminated one tee location, installed signs instructing golfers to \u201caim left,\u201d planted trees on the right side of the fairway, and allowed the grass along a portion of the right side of the fairway to grow longer. Those changes have decreased the number of balls entering the plaintiffs\u2019 properties, but not significantly. The parties discussed installing netting along the side of the course at shared expense, but ultimately abandoned that approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The present case is strikingly similar to <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Quabog Country Club, Inc., </em>353 Mass. at 536. In <em>Fenton, </em>the plaintiffs purchased a home on land abutting a golf course that had been in operation for many years. Errant golf shots deposited an average of 250 balls per year on the plaintiffs\u2019 land, with a high of 320 balls during one year. <em>Ibid. </em>The report of the case includes description of broken windows, near misses, and one direct hit on one plaintiff over a span of thirteen years preceding the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 537. The defendant country club erected a twenty-four foot high fence, which reduced but did not eliminate the problem. The court affirmed the master\u2019s finding of a continuing trespass, for which an injunction was appropriate. See <em>id. </em>at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">To a similar effect is <em>Hennessy </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>265 Mass. at 560. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In that case, baseballs persistently left the defendant\u2019s baseball field and landed on the plaintiff\u2019s property, causing damage. <em>Ibid. </em>The court held that the acts of the defendant\u2019s invitees \u201cwere acts of trespass in so far as they were direct invasions of the property; and they were a nuisance, when not a trespass, because the consequence of them was to deprive the plaintiff of the exclusive right to enjoy the use of her premises free from material disturbance and annoyance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"ASF\">The defendants attempt to distinguish <em>Fenton </em>on two grounds. First, the defendants observe that, prior to purchasing the property next to the golf course, the <em>Fenton </em>plaintiffs were \u201cnot familiar with the details of the game of golf.\u201d 353 Mass. at 536. By contrast, the present plaintiffs (or, in the case of Pray, her husband) are experienced and knowledgeable golfers. Second, shortly before suit commenced, the defendant country club in <em>Fenton </em>added a sand trap to the hole adjacent to the plaintiffs\u2019 property, which exacerbated the problem. See <em>id. </em>at 537. By contrast, the defendants contend, they have done nothing to exacerbate the problem and have taken some steps, albeit without particular success, to reduce the number of balls entering upon the plaintiffs\u2019 properties. The distinctions are immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"A4h\">The fact that the defendants have not worsened the condition, and have taken modest steps to correct it, does not pose a particular contrast with the circumstances in <em>Fenton. </em>The <em>Fenton </em>defendant erected a fence twenty-four feet high in an effort to stop the flight of golf balls onto the plaintiffs\u2019 property, a more significant and effective measure than any steps the defendants have taken in the present case. See 353 Mass. at 538. Moreover, in <em>Fenton, </em>in describing the facts supporting the plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to injunctive relief, the court reviewed the encroachment of golf balls over the entire period of the plaintiffs\u2019 ownership of the abutting property (and not merely of the brief period following placement of the sand trap), and the injunctive order endorsed by the court prohibited the propulsion of golf balls onto the plaintiffs\u2019 property, and did not merely require the removal of the recently added sand trap.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 538-539.</p>\n<p id=\"AoH\">The fact that the present plaintiffs were more familiar with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the game of golf than the <em>Fenton </em>plaintiffs prior to their respective purchases is similarly unavailing. By invoking the plaintiffs\u2019 prior awareness of the risk of encroaching golf balls, the defendants wish us to weigh in their favor the balancing factor, applicable in assessing whether an activity constitutes a private nuisance, of the priority in time as between the party claiming nuisance and the alleged offender. See <em>Escobar </em>v. <em>Continental Baking Co., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 104, 109 (1992), quoting from Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 88, at 630 (5th ed. 1984). In common parlance, a plaintiff in such circumstances is sometimes described as \u201ccoming to a nuisance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110. While the factor is not dis-positive in deciding whether an activity constitutes a nuisance, see <em>Pendoley </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>345 Mass. 309, 310 (1963), it weighs heavily in determining whether a plaintiff is entitled to relief. See <em>Escobar, supra </em>at 110. However, we need not determine whether the various factors applicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 nuisance claim weigh in favor of their request for relief because such factors do not affect the right to relief on a claim of trespass.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is, in other words, no cognate notion of \u201ccoming to a trespass,\u201d and the continuing and frequent invasion of golf balls from the defendants\u2019 course onto the plaintiffs\u2019 properties, resulting from the ordinary conduct by the defendants\u2019 members of the golfing activity for which the defendants intend the course to be used, constitutes a continuing trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">According to Prosser, the distinction between the torts of trespass and nuisance is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201cthat trespass is an invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the exclusive possession of his land, while nuisance is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>interference with his use and enjoyment of it. The difference is that between walking across his lawn and establishing a bawdy house next door; between felling a tree across his boundary line and keeping him awake at night with the noise of a rolling mill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1E\">Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 87, at 622. The Restatement expresses the distinction in similar terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqM\">\u201cA trespass is an invasion of the interest in the exclusive possession of land, as by entry upon it. ... A nuisance is an interference with the interest in the private use and enjoyment of the land, and does not require interference with the possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 821D comment d (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"AV2\">That the regular and frequent nonpermissive propulsion of physical objects onto an adjacent property constitutes a continuing trespass is adequately illustrated by <em>Fenton, supra, </em>and <em>Hennessy, supra. </em>See <em>Sheppard Envelope Co. </em>v. <em>Arcade Malleable Iron Co., </em>335 Mass. 180, 187 (1956). In such circumstances, an injunction prohibiting the continuing trespass is the appropriate remedy. See <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>361 Mass. 91, 92 (1972), citing <em>Sheppard Envelope Co. </em>v. <em>Arcade Malleable Iron Co., supra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Akc\">To the extent that the ordinary use of the defendants\u2019 golf course requires land beyond the course boundaries to accommodate the travel of errant shots, it is incumbent on the defendants to acquire either the fee in the additional land itself, or the right to use the additional land for that purpose. The defendants assert no claim of right to use, occupy, or propel golf balls onto the plaintiffs\u2019 properties, and we accordingly see no reason why the plaintiffs should be required to suffer such intrusion merely because the defendants commenced operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of the course before the plaintiffs arrived on the scene,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or because it would be difficult or burdensome for the defendants to confine their use to the boundaries of their own property. See <em>Goulding </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>422 Mass. 276, 278-279 (1996). The record includes the trial testimony of an expert in golf course design, who suggested that the problem of golf balls traveling onto the plaintiffs\u2019 properties could be eliminated if the ninth hole were shortened, changing the hole from a par four to a par three. While we decline to direct a particular means by which the defendants must achieve the goal, we observe that the burden of modifying the hole does not in our view rise to the level of hardship indicated by the Restatement as sufficient (accompanied by other extenuating circumstances) to relieve a defendant of the obligation to eliminate a continuing trespass.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The classic example of such a case is set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 941 comment c, at 583:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-11\">\u201cThe defendant has recently completed a twenty-story office building on his lot. The work was done by reputable engineers and builders, and they and the defendant all acted in good faith and with reasonable care. It is, however, found that from the tenth floor upward the wall on the plaintiff\u2019s side bulges outward and extends over the fine. The extent of the encroachment varies at different points, the maximum being four inches.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The judgment of dismissal is reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a new judgment, declaring that the projection of golf balls from the defendants\u2019 property onto the plaintiffs\u2019 properties constitutes a continuing trespass, and enjoining the trespass. We leave for the Superior Court the determination of the precise form of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"APq\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-37\"> The judge did not address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of trespass.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b108-38\"> The plaintiffs do not assert on appeal that they are entitled to damages, and we accordingly consider any claim for damages waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b108-40\"> Amaral moved into her home in 1998; Pray moved into her home in 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> The Prays sought and obtained a variance to allow the house to be built in the new site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\"> Though Fray\u2019s home is located nearer the ninth tee than is Amaral\u2019s, Amaral\u2019s property is nearer the ordinary landing distance of a drive off the ninth tee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"AZG\"> The court speculated about the possibility that the problem might be alleviated by relocating the sand trap to a different specified location, but it neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>prescribed that solution nor intimated that it would be a sufficient response for the defendant to reduce the number of intruding golf balls to the number preceding installation of the trap. <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Quabog Country Club, Inc., </em>353 Mass. at 539.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b112-11\"> Though the defendants argue that the plaintiffs did not assert a claim for trespass in the trial court, paragraphs 14 and 15 of the complaint allege as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">\u201c14.

For a discussion of such circumstances, see <em>Goulding </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>422 Mass. 276, 277 n.3 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b114-19\"> The defendants do not assert that they have acquired prescriptive rights to use the plaintiffs\u2019 properties for the deposit of golf balls, and examination of the record reveals that the earliest date in evidence on which the defendants\u2019 property was used as a golf course was less than twenty years before the complaint was filed. We express no view on whether frequent and regular propulsion of golf balls from a course onto adjacent land would support a claim of prescriptive rights. Though the golf course use in <em>Fenton, supra, </em>appears to have continued for more than twenty years before the complaint in that case, no claim of prescriptive rights appears to have been asserted in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b114-29\"> The trial judge\u2019s memorandum of decision expressed concern that such a modification would alter the course from a regulation golf course to a course without an identity as either a par three course or a regulation course. We note that the record includes evidence that the course at Quaboag Country Club, as modified following the opinion in <em>Fenton, supra, </em>plays to a par of thirty-four. The record here is inconclusive on the question whether alterations to another hole could safely add a stroke to par to make up for any loss resulting from modification of the ninth hole.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
