L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L, and possession of a firearm without a valid firearm identification (FID) card, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A). In his appeal, the defendant contends that guns stored in an unlocked bedroom closet within a locked bedroom are \u201csecured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>in a locked container,\u201d as required by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L. He also claims that (1) the licensing authority\u2019s failure to notify him of the denial of his license renewal application entitled him to assume that his expired license remained valid; (2) G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(12), does not provide an affirmative defense, but rather puts the burden on the Commonwealth to prove that his expired license was not valid; and (3) the trial judge erred in failing to give a requested instruction that the law requires an applicant for an FID card to be notified in writing of the denial of his application. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\"><em>Summary of facts and proceedings. </em>At trial, the defendant filed motions for required findings of not guilty both at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of all of the evidence. In our review of the denial of his motions for required findings of not guilty, we determine whether the evidence, viewed \u201ctogether with permissible inferences from that evidence [and] in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\u201d was sufficient to satisfy the jury that all of the essential elements of the crime existed beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>440 Mass. 396, 400 (2003). \u201cThe relevant question is whether the evidence would permit a jury to find guilt, not whether the evidence requires such a finding.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lydon, </em>413 Mass. 309, 312 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>401 Mass. 745, 747 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The defendant was friends with Debra Mayemik and her husband, both of whom worked for him in exchange for lodging in his home. Mayemik\u2019s son, seventeen year old Stephen Fish, also came to five in the house. The defendant did not permit Fish, who had his own bedroom, to be alone in the house or to have access to any bedroom other than his own. The defendant was home on August 19, 2001, when he discovered that several rifles he owned (as well as other items of value) were missing from his bedroom closet where he stored them, leaning against the wall in the comer behind his clothes. The closet was not equipped with a lock. When he was not at home, the defendant barricaded the closet door with boxes and other items and locked his bedroom door. That door was fitted with a knob lock that could be locked from inside the room. Mayemik had an identical lock on her bedroom door, which she opened from the outside by inserting a bobby pin into the hole in the knob.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>The defendant told Fish\u2019s mother of the theft, and she immediately called the police. One of the responding officers accompanied the defendant into his bedroom to determine how many guns were stolen. Upon observing where the guns were kept, the officer informed the defendant that his firearms were improperly stored as they did not have trigger locks and were not stored in a \u201cgun-securing cabinet\u201d or in a properly secured room. Fish returned home during the investigation and admitted to the theft of the guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Asked by the officers whether he had an FID card, the defendant said he did, but had not picked it up from the police station. Because his FID card had expired, the defendant had applied for a new card on January 5, 2000, some nineteen months before the date he discovered that his guns were stolen. He had received a canceled check for his application fee. There was testimony from the officer in charge of processing firearms license applications that the defendant\u2019s application had been denied at some point, but written notice of the denial had not been sent to the defendant. There was no evidence of the date of the denial, but as of August 19, 2001, the date of the offense, the defendant had not received notice of denial and had not inquired about the status of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Improper storage of a firearm. </em>The defendant argues that his bedroom was a container within the meaning of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L, and that he was not in violation of the statute because the bedroom door was locked. The defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute ignores the requirement that a container must not only be \u201clocked\u201d but also \u201csecure.\u201d Section 131L, inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 47, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-7\">\u201c(a) It shall be unlawful to store or keep any firearm . . . in any place unless such weapon is <em>secured in a locked container </em>or equipped with a tamper-resistant mechanical lock or other safety device, properly engaged so as to render such weapon inoperable by any person other than the owner . . .\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">The phrase \u201csecured in a locked container\u201d is not defined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWhen a statute does not define its words we give them their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). The Legislature\u2019s intent may be ascertained \u201cfrom all [the statute\u2019s] words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor C., </em>432 Mass. 635, 640 (2000), quoting from <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass. 324, 326 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Read in its entirety, the statutory scheme governing gun control evinces a legislative purpose \u201cto prevent the temptation and the ability to use firearms to inflict harm, be it negligently or intentionally, on another or on oneself.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 518, 523 (1980). As we have had occasion to observe, \u201c[t]he goal of firearms control legislation in Massachusetts is to limit access to deadly weapons by irresponsible persons\u201d and the Legislature has adopted a wide range of methods \u201cto accomplish this goal, including ... the imposition of serious penalties for infractions of the firearms control laws.\u201d <em>Ruggiero </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 258 (1984). We note as well that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 123, inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 19, requires firearms dealers to give written warning to gun purchasers and to \u201cconspicuously post at each purchase counter ... in bold type not less than one inch in height [the following]: \u2018IT IS UNLAWFUL TO STORE OR KEEP A FIREARM, RIFLE, SHOTGUN OR MACHINE GUN IN ANY PLACE UNLESS THAT WEAPON IS EQUIPPED WITH A TAMPER-RESISTANT SAFETY DEVICE OR IS STORED OR KEPT IN A <em>SECURELY LOCKED </em>CONTAINER\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>The use of the word \u201csecured\u201d in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L, comports with its use in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 123, and indicates that the container must not merely be locked, but securely locked. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 522, quoting from <em>Libby </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R.R., </em>273 Mass. 522, 525-526 (1930) (statute is to be interpreted so that \u201cno clause, sentence or word shall prove superfluous, void or insignificant if by any other construction it may be made useful and pertinent\u201d). The Connecticut Supreme Court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilchinski, </em>242 Conn. 211 (1997), interpreting a similar statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defined the word \u201csecure\u201d to mean \u201cto \u2018hold fast,\u2019 to \u2018tie down,\u2019 to \u2018put beyond hazard of losing,\u2019 or \u2018inviolable,\u2019 \u201d as well as \u201cto reheve from exposure to danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224-225, quoting from Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 2053 (1963). That court concluded that the only logical definition of \u201csecure\u201d in the context of the statute was \u201cone that focuses both on preventing minors from gaining access to guns and on preventing them from being able to misuse the weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">We likewise conclude that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L, requires guns to be maintained in locked containers in a way that will deter all but the most persistent from gaining access. Even a door locked with a key is not secure if the key is hanging next to the lock. Assuming the defendant\u2019s bedroom to be a container, and further that it was locked at the time of the theft,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant was in violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L, because the lock was easily defeated by anyone with access to a bobby pin and did not prevent ready access by anyone other than the lawful owner. Because the evidence supports a finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>room was not a securely locked container, denial of the defendant\u2019s motions for a required finding of not guilty was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">2. <em>Invalid FID card. </em>\u201c[A] qualified individual may lawfully possess a firearm\u201d if he has obtained an FED card or is exempt from this requirement. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 428 (1981). Under the law of the Commonwealth, the \u201c[a]bsence of a license is not an \u2018element of the crime\u2019 \u201d of possessing or carrying a firearm in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(h). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403, 406 (1977). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, post </em>854, 860-862 (2005). See also G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 7 (\u201cA defendant in a criminal prosecution, relying for his justification upon a license ... or authority, shall prove the same; and, until so proved, the presumption shall be that he is not so authorized\u201d). The burden is thus on a defendant to come forward with evidence that he possesses a valid license. Until he does, the presumption remains in effect that he was not licensed and \u201cno issue is presented with respect to licensing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that it was the Commonwealth\u2019s burden, pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(12), \u201cto disprove [the defendant\u2019s] entitlement to an FID card at the time of the incident.\u201d General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 129B(12), inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 29, as in effect on the date of the offense, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 10 of chapter 269, any person in possession of a non-large capacity rifle or shotgun whose firearm identification card issued under this section is invalid for the sole reason that it has expired, but who shall not be disqualified from renewal upon application therefor under this section, shall be subject to a civil fine . . . and the provisions of said section 10 of said chapter 269 shall not apply . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">This statute does not alter the Commonwealth\u2019s burden or change the elements of the crime of which the defendant was charged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. at 406. Rather \u00a7 129B(12) provides an affirmative defense to the criminal charge of possession of a firearm without a valid FID card; as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>such, it is only when a defendant has produced evidence sufficient to raise the affirmative defense that it becomes the \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s burden to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense was unavailable to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, supra </em>at 862 (construing similar language in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 [m]). The defendant makes no claim that he produced evidence sufficient to raise the affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The defendant further argues that he reasonably relied on a canceled check to act as a substitute for an FID card in the absence of written notice that his license had been denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He asserts that the canceled check was a \u201creceipt\u201d for payment of the application fee. Passing the question whether a canceled check may constitute the type of receipt contemplated by the statute \u2014 which does not define the term,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but does require that \u201c[u]pan revocation or suspension [of an FID card], the licensing authority shall take possession of such card and receipt for fee paid for such card,\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(4) \u2014 we think such reliance is misplaced. The defendant had been denied renewal, though he was not so informed, and being \u201cdisqualified\u201d is the only basis upon which an application for renewal may be denied under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(1). Therefore, the defendant was not entitled to a renewed FID card and no receipt for fee paid could serve as a valid substitute for the FID card in these circumstances. G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s claim that evidence to convict was lacking because the failure to give him notice of the denial of his application<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> established that he did not have the \u201cmens rea\u201d required for the offense under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(h). The denial of his application was not an essential element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>crime that the Commonwealth was required to prove. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 938, 940 (1988) (\u201c[T]here is nothing in the statute or case law that states that knowledge of the suspension of the license to carry firearms is an essential element of the crime to be proved by the Commonwealth\u201d). See <em>McQuoid </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>556 F.2d 595, 598 (1st Cir. 1977) (\u201cTo convict under section 10|7z], it need not be shown that the accused knew of the necessity of a license [or] that he possessed criminal scienter . . .\u201d [emphasis omitted]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-9\"> None of the defendant\u2019s guns was so equipped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-10\"> Although our courts have not interpreted the phrase \u201csecured in a locked container,\u201d we have said that the \u201cusual and natural meaning\u201d of \u201ca container is \u2018a receptacle (as a box or jar) or a formed or flexible covering for the packing or shipment of articles, goods or commodities\u2019 . . . ; and a receptacle is \u2018one that receives and contains something.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 518, 523 n.3 (1980), quoting from Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 491, 1894 (1971). We assume, without deciding, that a bedroom may constitute a container for purposes of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b872-5\"> Connecticut Gen. Stat. \u00a7 29-37\u00cd (2003) provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cNo person shall store or keep any loaded firearm on any premises under his control if he knows or reasonably should know that a minor is likely to gain access to the firearm . . . unless such person (1) keeps the firearm in a securely locked box or other container or in a location which a reasonable person would believe to be secure . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\"> We think the jury might have inferred from the evidence that the defendant, who testified that he locked the bedroom door when he was not at home, was at home when Fish took the guns. The defendant also testified that he had informed his insurance company that he did not see any sign of forced entry and that he assumed that Fish had simply walked into the bedroom to steal the guns. The conviction might have been upheld on the ground that the room was not locked. Because it was not argued, we do not base our decision on this view of the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\"> General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 129B(12), as in effect at the time of the offense, provides in relevant part: \u201cPending the issuance of a renewed firearm identification card, a receipt for the fee paid, after five days following issuance, shall serve as a valid substitute . . . unless the applicant is disqualified.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b874-8\"> Compare G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(7), as in effect prior to St. 2004, c. 150, \u00a7 4 (prescribing that FED card be \u201cin a standard form provided by the executive director of the criminal history systems board and shall contain an identification number, name, address, photograph, fingerprint, place and date of birth, height, weight, hair color, eye color and signature of the cardholder,\u201d among other things).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b874-9\"> General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 129B(3), as in effect at the time of the offense, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>\u201cThe licensing authority . . . shall, within 40 days from the date of application, either approve the application and issue the license or deny the application and notify the applicant of the reason for such denial in writing . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The defendant was, however, entitled to obtain judicial review under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(5), \u201cwithin 90 days after the expiration of the time limit in which the licensing authority is required to respond to the applicant,\u201d if he did not receive notice as required by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b875-8\"> Because we conclude that the defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge that his application had been denied does not constitute a defense to the charge of possession of a firearm without a valid FID card in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A), we also reject his claim that the trial judge improperly refused to give a requested jury instruction that it is the licensing authority\u2019s obligation, under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(3), to notify applicants in writing of the denial of their application for an FID card.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
