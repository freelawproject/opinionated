Local 2071, International Association of Firefighters (union), and the town of Bellingham (town) were directed to interest arbitration by the JLMC under St. 1977, c. 730, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1987, c. 589, \u00a7 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>A panel of arbitrators decided that the town should be required to depart from its current ten and fourteen hour shift schedule and adopt a twenty-four hour shift.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claiming invasion of managerial prerogative, and contending that the shift issue is nonarbitrable, the town commenced the present action, styled as a complaint to vacate or modify an arbitration award pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12. A Superior Court judge allowed the union\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling that the appropriate judicial review process was pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, rather than G. L. c. 150C. The town appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Statutory framework. </em>Section 1 of St. 1977, c. 730 (act), created the JLMC by adding \u00a7 4A to St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 2. The act has been amended since, the last material change (for present purposes) having been made by St. 1987, c. 589, \u00a7 1. As the Supreme Judicial Court has summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201cSection 4A established a Joint Labor-Management Committee with responsibility for collective bargaining negotiations involving municipal police officers and firefighters. That committee may order disputes to be submitted to binding arbitration \u2018in accordance with the standards, provisions and limitations\u2019 of \u00a7 4 of St. 1973, c. 1078.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\"><em>Massachusetts Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 236 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The JLMC exists within the State Departments of Labor and Workforce Development,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but is not subject to its jurisdiction. See \u00a7 4A(l)(a)(i) of the act, as amended through St. 1987, c. 589, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With the apparent aim of avoiding strikes and other job actions in the public safety sector, \u00a7 4A invests the JLMC with exclusive jurisdiction and extraordinary dispute resolution powers in police officer and fire fighter labor disputes over which, in its discretion, it has assumed jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See \u00a7 4A(2), (3)(a). These powers include, once the JLMC has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>determined that \u201cthere is an apparent exhaustion of the processes of collective bargaining which constitutes a potential threat to public welfare,\u201d the power to order the parties to \u201cany form of arbitration\u201d of \u201call or any issue in dispute.\u201d \u00a7 4A(3)(a). The power to order arbitration thus derives from the JLMC\u2019s governing statute, and not \u2014 as in a conventional labor or commercial dispute \u2014 from the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Section 4A limits, to some degree, the issues that may be arbitrated. The limitations in \u00a7 4A(3)(o) are different with respect to police officer and fire fighter matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Tc\">\u201c[T]he scope of arbitration in police matters shall be limited to wages, hours, and conditions of employment and shall not include the following matters of inherent managerial policy: the right to appoint, promote, assign, and transfer employees; and . . . the scope of arbitration in firefighter matters shall not include the right to appoint and promote employees. Assignments shall not be within the scope of arbitration; provided, however, that the subject matters of initial station assignment upon appointment or promotion shall be within the scope of arbitration. The subject matter of transfer shall not be . . . within the scope of arbitration, provided however, that the subject matters of relationship of seniority to transfers and disciplinary and punitive transfers shall be within the scope of arbitration. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act to the contrary, no municipal employer shall be required to negotiate over subjects of minimum manning of shift coverage, with an employee organization representing municipal police officers and firefighters. Nothing in this section shall be construed to include within the scope of arbitration any matters not otherwise subject to collective bargaining under the provisions of [G. L. c. 150E].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Section 4A(3)(a) also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cAny decision or determination resulting from the mechanism or procedures determined by the [JLMC] if supported by material and substantive evidence on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>whole record shall be, subject to the approval by the legislative body of a funding request as set forth in this section, binding upon the public employer and employee organization, as set forth in [G. L. c. 150E], and may be enforced at the instance of either party or the [JLMC] in the superior court in equity . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Section 4A(4) states, \u201cThe provisions of [G. L. c. 30A], unless otherwise provided, shall apply to the [JLMC].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">2. <em>Facts and procedural background. </em>The town and the union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement covering the period July 1, 1999, to June 30, 2002. Negotiations for a successor agreement were unsuccessful. Among other issues, the parties could not agree on the union\u2019s request to introduce twenty-four hour shifts in place of ten and fourteen hour shifts. The JLMC exercised jurisdiction in the matter and ordered the parties to binding arbitration before a panel and certified the issues to be arbitrated, which included work schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The town notified the JLMC and the arbitration panel that it did not consider the shift issue arbitrable as it was a core management right that came under the category of \u201cassignments\u201d of fire fighters, which was specifically excluded from the realm of issues arbitrable under the JLMC statute. The arbitration panel received documentary evidence and heard testimony from witnesses. The JLMC issued its arbitration award on December 29, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">On January 22, 2004, the town filed a complaint in Superior Court, styled as a complaint to vacate or modify an arbitration award, relying on G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12, and asserting that the arbitration panel \u201cexceeded [its] powers\u201d or \u201cawarded upon a matter not submitted to [it]\u201d when it decided the twenty-four hour shift issue. Again taking the position that the determination of shifts is a core management right that is not arbitrable, the town argued that the arbitration award should be vacated or modified by removing the portion of the award relating to the shift issue. The town did not explicitly assert in its complaint that the JLMC improperly certified the issue of work schedules for arbitration, but rather that the arbitration panel lacked the authority to decide it. The town did not name the JLMC as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>defendant, did not serve the JLMC with the complaint, and has not made the JLMC a party to these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The union moved to dismiss the complaint, and the judge, in his May 27, 2004, memorandum and order for judgment allowing the union\u2019s motion, characterized the town\u2019s complaint as \u201ca frontal assault on the JLMC\u2019s order that \u2018work schedules\u2019 be arbitrated.\u201d He did not make a substantive determination as to the arbitrability of the shift issue. Instead, he concluded that the town\u2019s complaint should be dismissed because it was improperly brought under c. 150C, and that, considering the language of the act, the proper route to review was G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. The judge also stated that \u201c[pjlainly, the agency ought to be a party,\u201d and noted that \u201c[hjad the case been brought under Chapter 30A, the JLMC would be a party, and its administrative record would be before the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">As to C.150C, the judge ruled that it applies only to <em>\u201cagreements </em>to arbitrate, and to arbitrations carried out pursuant to such agreements,\u201d and that because the act \u201cimposes arbitration on the parties to labor disputes having particular ramifications for public safety, irrespective of agreement,\u201d the arbitration in the case could not be considered to be pursuant to an agreement to arbitrate. Finally, noting that the thirty-day deadline for commencing an action under c. 30A, \u00a7 14(1), had passed, the judge ruled that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The act contains no specific provision for judicial review of JLMC certification of issues for arbitration or of arbitration awards. The town argues that review is available under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7\u00a711 and 12. The union argues, and the Superior Court judge decided, that G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, is the proper route for review. In an amicus brief, the JLMC argues that the proper avenue for appeal is an action in the nature of certiorari under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. We hold that neither c. 150C nor c. 30A is applicable to arbitration ordered by the JLMC, and that c. 249, \u00a7 4, is.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">By its express terms, c. 150C applies to agreements to arbitrate and to arbitrations carried out pursuant to such agreements. G. L. c. 150C \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1959, c. 546, \u00a7 1 (stating that the chapter applies to \u201c[a] written agreement or a provision in a written agreement between a labor organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>. . . and an employer ... to submit to arbitration any existing controversy . . . between parties to the agreement\u201d). The act, in contrast, imposes arbitration on the parties to labor disputes having particular ramifications for public safety, irrespective of agreement. The town\u2019s claim that it voluntarily agreed to arbitration on all issues except the twenty-four hour shift, within the meaning of an agreement to arbitrate under c. 150C, is unpersuasive. The town did not agree to arbitrate; it was ordered to do so by the JLMC pursuant to the JLMC\u2019s statutory power.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The town cites two cases for the proposition that review of a JLMC arbitration award may be had through c. 150C. The first, <em>Marlborough Firefighters, Local 1714, I.A.F.F., AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Marlborough, </em>375 Mass. 593 (1978), was not decided under c. 150C, but rather under a special act; moreover, the underlying action in that case was commenced before \u00a7 4A was enacted and thus before the JLMC came into existence. The second, <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen's Assn., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 74 (1999), does not make clear how the matter came before the court for review, and unlike the instant action, the JLMC was made a party defendant. Neither case supports the town\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The judge reasoned, and the union argues, that c. 30A, \u00a7 14, is the proper route for review in this case because the act states that \u201c[t]he provisions of [G. L. c. 30A], unless otherwise provided, shall apply to the [JLMC].\u201d \u00a7 4A(4). The text of c. 30A, \u00a7 14, makes clear, however, that review under that section is only appropriate following an adjudicatory proceeding. The town\u2019s appeal in this case is not of an adjudicatory proceeding of the JLMC.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The JLMC made its determination of impasse in its role essentially as an investigatory fact finder. The JLMC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>authority was both directed and limited for determination whether there existed \u201can apparent exhaustion of the processes of collective bargaining which constitutes a potential threat to public welfare.\u201d \u00a7 4A(3)(a). The JLMC\u2019s hearing was not a forum for determination of the \u201clegal rights, duties or privileges\u201d of either the town or union members. See <em>Collective Bargaining Reform Assn. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>436 Mass. 197, 202-204 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The proper vehicle for seeking judicial review in this case is an action in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. Under that statute the standard of review may vary according to the \u201cnature of the action for which review is sought.\u201d <em>Forsyth Sch. for Dental Hygienists </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Dentistry, </em>404 Mass. 211, 217 (1989). See <em>Police Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Personnel Administrator of the Dept. of Personnel Admin., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 362 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 1017 (1996) Applying that flexible standard in the JLMC context, the JLMC order referring a matter to arbitration should be reviewed for error of law, see <em>id. </em>at 363, while the substance of an arbitration award, if challenged, should be subject to review (under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4) under the standard set out in the act, i.e., to determine whether the award was \u201csupported by material and substantive evidence on the whole record.\u201d \u00a7 4A(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The town brought its complaint under the wrong statute, but did state, with sufficient clarity, its substantive concern with the shift issue. The judge dismissed the complaint upon an incorrect authority \u2014 quite understandably, inasmuch as the proper avenue for judicial review of an arbitration award by the JLMC, under a somewhat esoteric statute, had not been addressed by our appellate courts. Judicial resolution of the substantive shift issue is significant to the parties, and we are not inclined to foreclose that review, at this point, in these circumstances. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Manuel, </em>428 Mass. 527, 532 (1998), citing <em>Lambley </em>v. <em>Kameny, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 277, 280 (1997). \u201cWe have long held that pleadings are to be treated \u2018according to their nature and substance\u2019 rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>their technical form.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>393 Mass. 318, 322-323 (1984), quoting from <em>Fabrizio </em>v. <em>U.S. Susuki Motor Corp., </em>362 Mass. 873, 873 (1972). See <em>Menage </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>187 Mass. 470, 473-474 (1905); <em>Essex Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Averill, </em>321 Mass. 68, 70 (1947); <em>Kilroy </em>v. <em>O'Connor, 324 </em>Mass. 238, 239-240 (1949). Accordingly, we remand this action to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, with instruction that the complaint be construed as an action pursuant to the certiorari statute, and that the town implead the JLMC as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Among other issues to be resolved on remand is ripeness for certiorari review, in that an action under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, does not become available until it is clear that there are no further possible proceedings before the JLMC. See <em>Reidy </em>v. <em>Acting Director of Civil Serv., </em>354 Mass. 760, 760 (1968). A unique feature of the act is that an arbitration award loses its binding nature without approval by the municipal legislative body of a request to fund such an award. See \u00a7 4A(3)(a). If a funding request is rejected, the act provides for return of the matter \u201cto the parties for further bargaining.\u201d \u00a7 4A(3)(a). The record does not reflect whether the twenty-four-hour shift issue required funding and, if so, whether the Bellingham town meeting approved an appropriate funding request.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The judgment of dismissal is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> The panel also decided other issues (e.g., wages and clothing allowance) that are not questioned in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\"> We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by the JLMC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-10\"> Formerly known as the Executive Office of Labor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b469-11\"> Hereinafter, we will refer to \u00a7 4A of the act as amended through St. 1987, c. 589, \u00a7 1, as \u201c\u00a7 4A.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b469-13\"> The parties may jointly or individually petition the JLMC for the exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>of jurisdiction and for the determination of the apparent exhaustion of the process of collective bargaining. See \u00a7 4A(2)(c). The record does not indicate any petition in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b473-11\"> The town\u2019s argument in its motion for reconsideration that the provisions of c. 150C should apply because the parties reached an impasse under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9, is unavailing. The act clearly states that c. 150E, \u00a7 9, applies to disputes involving fire fighters only \u201cif the [JLMC] declines to exercise jurisdiction over the dispute or fails to act within thirty days of receipt of the petition on jurisdiction.\u201d \u00a7 4A(2)(c). Here, the JLMC exercised jurisdiction; thus, c. 150E, \u00a7 9, does not apply. Neither the issue nor the motion for reconsideration is before the court; therefore, we do not further discuss either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b473-12\"> An adjudicatory proceeding is defined in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, as \u201ca proceeding before an agency in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of specifically named persons are required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>constitutional right or by any provision of the General Laws to be determined after opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
