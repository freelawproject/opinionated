L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, and as amended by St. 1979, c. 106.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More precisely, we determine whether, because of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>a lot that was once buildable due to a local by-law exemption from minimum lot size requirements remains buildable, even after the repeal of that local grandfather exemption. We conclude that c. 40A, \u00a7 6, protects the right to build on lots that conformed to existing dimensional requirements rather than lots that were only buildable due to a grandfather exemption to those dimensional requirements. In sum, c. 40A, \u00a7 6, does not grandfather local by-law grandfather provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">This appeal arises from a decision of the zoning board of appeals (board) of Orleans (town) that the property located at 13 Priscilla Road (locus) and owned by Stuart Rothman<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> constitutes a buildable lot. The plaintiffs, abutters and abutters to abutters to the locus,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appealed from the board\u2019s decision and the Land Court reversed. We affirm the decision of the Land Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">To address the merits of the case, it is first necessary to examine the history of the locus, the applicable zoning by-laws, and the current language of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. The locus, originally shown as lot 12 on a 1915 plan of land, contains approximately 8,000 square feet and has approximately eighty feet of frontage. The locus was held in common ownership with one or more adjoining lots from 1949 to 1970. On March 25, 1970, Alein Morrill conveyed the locus to Llewellyn S. Owen, and the locus came into ownership separate from all adjoining lots for the first time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The locus was conveyed to Rothman on November 2, 2001, for approximately $300,000. Despite intervening transfers, the locus was not held in common ownership with any adjacent lot between the 1970 conveyance to Owen and Rothman\u2019s purchase in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The town first adopted a zoning by-law in 1954. At that time, \u00a7 5.1 of the by-law, governing lot size, required a minimum of 15,000 square feet in area and a minimum frontage of 100 feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>but contained an exemption allowing one building to be erected on any lot that, \u201cat the time this by-law is adopted, either is separately owned or contains five thousand [5,000] square feet.\u201d Such exemptions historically have been referred to as \u201cgrandfather\u201d provisions. See <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 758 (1985). Although not separately owned at the time the zoning by-law was adopted, the locus qualified for the exemption by virtue of its size, 8,000 square feet. In 1961, the by-law was amended, increasing the minimum lot size to 20,000 square feet and 120 feet of frontage but retaining the same exemption. In 1971, after the locus came into separate ownership, the town deleted the by-law\u2019s grandfather provision and replaced it with a provision allowing development for \u201csingle residential use\u201d provided that the lot or parcel complied \u201cwith the specific exemptions of Sections 5A and 7A of Chapter 40A of the General Laws.\u201d In 1973, the by-law was further amended, increasing the minimum lot size to 40,000 square feet and minimum frontage to 150 feet but retaining the exemption for lots that complied with the specific exemptions of \u00a7\u00a7 5A and <em>7A </em>of c. 40A of the General Laws. In 1978, the by-law was amended to replace the references to \u00a7\u00a7 5A and 7A with a reference to c. 40A, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The current version of the by-law is \u00a7 164-22A(1), and it retains an exemption for lots that comply with \u201cthe specific exemptions of [G. L. c.] 40A, \u00a7 6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The applicable provisions of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, appear in the first two sentences of the fourth paragraph, which provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\u201cAny increase in area, frontage, width, yard, or depth requirements of a zoning ordinance or by-law shall not apply to a lot for single and two-family residential use which at the time of recording or endorsement, whichever occurs sooner was not held in common ownership with any adjoining land, conformed to then existing requirements and had less than the proposed requirement but at least five thousand square feet of area and fifty feet of frontage. Any increase in area, frontage, width, yard or depth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>requirement of a zoning ordinance or by-law shall not apply for a period of five years from its effective date or for five years after January [1, 1976], whichever is later, to a lot for single and two family residential use, provided the plan for such lot was recorded or endorsed and such lot was held in common ownership with any adjoining land and conformed to the existing zoning requirements as of January [1, 1976], and had less area, frontage, width, yard or depth requirements than the newly effective zoning requirements but contained at least seven thousand five hundred square feet of area and seventy-five feet of frontage .. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Prior to Rothman\u2019s purchase of the locus, the town\u2019s building commissioner issued two letters, one dated October 13, 1999, addressed to counsel for Rothman\u2019s predecessor in title and the other dated October 19, 2001, addressed to Rothman, each concluding that the lot was buildable under the grandfather provision of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On March 18, 2002, however, the building commissioner issued a letter to Rothman reversing his earlier position. On appeal, the board \u201cconsidered the language of [G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6,] and construe[d] the term \u2018then existing requirements\u2019 in the first sentence of the fourth paragraph to include all of the provisions of the lot area regulations,\u201d including the grandfather provision. It held that \u00a7 164-22A(1) exempts the locus from the current by-law\u2019s minimum lot size requirement and permits the erection of one single-family dwelling on the lot. A judge of the Land Court, on cross motions for summary judgment, determined that the board had acted beyond its authority, and Rothman appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We first consider whether the first or second sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., applies to the locus. In determining whether a lot conforms to the \u201cnot held in common ownership\u201d requirement of the first sentence of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., we look \u201cto the most recent instrument of record prior to the effective date of the zoning change.\u201d <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. at 762. Because the locus became separately owned in 1970, before the restrictive zoning change eliminating the grandfather provision, the first sentence of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., applies to the locus.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We next determine whether the locus \u201cconformed to then existing requirements\u201d as those terms are used in the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par. Looking at the date the locus came into separate ownership, <em>Tsagronis </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 55, 61 (1992), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 415 Mass. 329 (1993), the \u201cthen existing\u201d dimensional requirements were those contained in the 1961 bylaw, as in effect on March 25, 1970. While requiring a minimum area of 20,000 square feet and 120 feet of frontage, the 1961 by-law contained the grandfather provision exempting lots containing 5,000 square feet at the time of the adoption of the by-law. The issue this court confronts for the first time is whether the locus \u201cconformed\u201d with the \u201cthen existing\u201d dimensional requirements by virtue of the grandfather provision contained in the local zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In <em>Ferzoco </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Falmouth, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 986, 986-987 (1990), the issue of the interplay of local grandfather clauses and G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., was presented, albeit in regard to lots held in common ownership, thereby requiring an interpretation of the second sentence of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par. The plaintiffs there argued that they met the \u201cexisting zoning requirements,\u201d as that term is used in the second sentence, because in 1976 their lots were grandfathered from the minimum lot size requirements. We held that \u201cneither lot conformed to the zoning requirements,\u201d as qualifying for the exception to the minimum lot size requirements \u201cis not the manifest meaning of the expression \u2018[conformed to the] <em>existing </em>zoning <em>requirements\u2019 . . . Id. </em>at 987. We further concluded that the Legislature did not intend \u201cto pile one grandfather[] [clause] upon another.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">With one caveat, it would appear that the holding in <em>Ferzoco </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Falmouth, supra, </em>could be simply extended to apply to the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., as well. The relevant language requiring conformance is strikingly similar, and there is no reason why the concept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>of conformance in the second sentence would have a different meaning with regard to local grandfather clauses than in the first sentence. Furthermore, in neither sentence did the Legislature make reference to local grandfather provisions or other exceptions to minimum lot size requirements. In a dictum in our rescript opinion in <em>Ferzoco </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Falmouth, supra, </em>however, we drew a cryptic distinction, suggesting that it was \u201cespecially\u201d clear that grandfathered lots were not conforming in sentence two when the language of sentence two was contrasted with the language in sentence one. Upon further reflection, we discern no such distinction. The differences in terminology are of no substantive import on this issue, but rather merely the product of the sentence structures themselves and the fact that the second sentence addresses the fixed date of January 1, 1976, and the first sentence addresses \u201cthen existing\u201d differing dates dependent upon the timing of actions discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Further support for our consistent treatment of the repeal of local grandfather clauses in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., is provided by <em>Tsagronis </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. at 61, which involved the interpretation of the first sentence in a related context. There the grandfathering protection on which the owners relied arose from a temporary zoning suspension contained in a prior grandfather provision of the Zoning Act, not from the provisions of a local zoning bylaw. In essence, <em>Tsagronis </em>presented the question whether the first sentence of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., grandfathered a prior grandfather clause of the Zoning Act. Adopting a similar analysis in this context, we held that the \u201c \u2018then existing requirements\u2019 were the more demanding dimensional requirements, not those requirements as temporarily suspended.\u201d <em>Tsagronis </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. at 61. We also rejected the landowner\u2019s attempt to \u201cparlay one dispensation into entitlement to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In sum, we conclude that conformance with the \u201cthen existing requirements\u201d refers to the minimum dimensional requirements contained in a zoning by-law, not to those requirements as exempted by the grandfather provision of the by-law. <em>Ferzoco </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Falmouth, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>987. See <em>Tsagronis </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, supra </em>at 61.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Rothman also argues that we should give deference to the board\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its own by-law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Livoli </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals of Southborough, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 923 (1997); <em>Building Commr. of Franklin </em>v. <em>Dispatch Communications of New England, Inc., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 709, 713 (2000); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Chatham, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 356 n.11 (2001). Of course, the town was and is free to adopt a more generous grandfather provision that would allow prior exemptions to be given effect. See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeal of Cambridge, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 631, 632-633 (1988), quoting from <em>Inspector of Bldgs. of Burlington </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>320 Mass. 207, 209 (1946) (G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, \u201cprescribes the minimum of tolerance that must be accorded\u201d nonconformities). The town, however, did not draft a by-law provision that expressly grandfathered prior exemptions to its minimum dimensional requirements. Instead, the town simply incorporated by reference the provisions of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, and then misinterpreted them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We owe no deference to the board\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of c. 40A, \u00a7 6. Compare <em>DeGrace </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Harwich, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 135-136 (1991) (where town simply incorporated by reference statutory language rather than adopting more stringent controls, local authority is bound by definitions contained in the statute and Department of Environmental Quality Engineering order).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The judgment of the Land Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-16\"> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 718 (8th ed. 2004) defines a grandfather clause as \u201c[a] provision that creates an exemption from the law\u2019s effect for something that existed before the law\u2019s effective date; specif., a statutory or regulatory clause that exempts a class of persons or transactions because of circumstances existing before the new rule or regulation takes effect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> Rothman took title to the property as managing partner of R.S.

That claim was not made below and relies on materials not before us. As a result, we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\"> Sections 5A and 7A were the sections of G.

These letters apparently reflected a change in an earlier interpretation; the board\u2019s decision that the locus constituted a buildable lot states that town counsel previously had opined, in 1978, that the locus was not buildable, and a prior owner\u2019s application for a variance to build on the locus had been denied in 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\"> Our interpretation is also consistent with the objective underlying G.
