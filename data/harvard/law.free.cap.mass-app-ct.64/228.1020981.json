At the eventual trial on their personal injury complaint, the Baileys submitted medical bills and records certified pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, and each testified to the circumstances of the incident, the course of Mrs. Bailey\u2019s medical treatment, her resulting pain and discomfort, and the losses they both sustained during the approximately four years since the accident. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>did not present a medical expert witness to testify that the injuries claimed by Mrs. Bailey were, \u201cwith a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u201d a consequence of the defendants\u2019 negligence. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence was sufficient, notwithstanding the lack of a live expert witness. The defendants appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">1. <em>The evidence. </em>Mr. Bailey was driving and had stopped at a red light. The ambulance struck the Bailey vehicle and pushed it into a truck that was in front of them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon impact, Mrs. Bailey went forward and backward, striking her head twice on the headrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">On the day of the accident, Mrs. Bailey sought medical treatment at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates (Harvard Vanguard), her principal healthcare provider.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> X-rays were taken, and she was diagnosed with a \u201cwhiplash injury with left-sided muscle spasm in her neck\u201d and provided with a neck collar brace, as well as the prescription medications Flexeril and Motrin. She sought further care on December 13, 1997, and was examined for musculoskeletal and low back pain. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) was performed. On December 22, 1997, complaining of considerable pain, as well as pain and paresthesias down her arm and into her thumb, she was seen by her own physician, Dr. Lee Younger, who concluded that she suffered from low back pain and sciatic pain. Mrs. Bailey had a further appointment with Dr. Younger on January 28, 1998, where he noted that there was \u201cstill back and neck pain following MVA [motor vehicle accident] 12/10.\u201d Dr. Younger referred her to physical therapy, which she undertook, but her symptoms remained, and she further consulted with Dr. Younger on March 4, 1998. Dr. Younger explained to the Baileys that \u201cit was not unusual after whiplash injuries of rather minor nature to have very prolonged symptoms [that] can go on for months or longer.\u201d Dr. Younger referred Mrs. Bailey to the neurology department where she was seen on March 11, 1998, by Dr. Andrew Herzog, a neurologist, who diagnosed Mrs. Bailey with \u201cleft-sided C-6 and L-5 radiculopathies [,] secondary to whiplash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>injury sustained on 12/10/97.\u201d Dr. Herzog prescribed further conservative treatment. He saw Mrs. Bailey again on May 13, 1998, when he noted an improvement of her symptoms and prescribed further medication for the \u201cburning dysesthesia in the scapular region.\u201d On July 8, 1998, Dr. Herzog reported that her left shoulder and neck were burning, and prescribed additional medication. Mrs. Bailey continued treatment with Dr. Herzog in October, 1998, and January, 1999. Despite various medications and treatment options, her symptoms persisted. On January 13, 1999, Dr. Herzog noted flare-ups of her symptoms, and concluded that they were \u201cattributable to her accident of about 14 months ago.\u201d Mrs. Bailey was referred to acupuncture, and to the pain management clinic at her healthcare facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-16\">On June 20, 2000, Dr. Younger diagnosed Mrs. Bailey with chronic pain syndrome and stated, \u201cUnfortunately her neck, shoulder and back pain have not remitted in spite of the full spectrum of both orthodox and alternative therapies. ... I told her that nobody really understands why, after a relatively minor injury, people often have years of debilitating pain. I told her to expect this to eventually bum out, but that it could take another two to three years.\u201d Dr. Younger noted that her pain had a \u201cneuropathic quality to it.\u201d When her pain continued, she returned to see Dr. Younger on March 29, 2001, at which time she was referred to an orthopedic doctor who examined her on May 7, 2001, and noted an impression of \u201cchronic neck pain.\u201d Mrs. Bailey attended a neck pain school administered by Haryard Vanguard in June, 2001. She returned to Dr. Herzog in October, 2001, and after further unsuccessful treatment, was referred to Dr. Naila Moghul, a physician in the pain management department at Harvard Vanguard. On May 14, 2002, Dr. Moghul\u2019s impression was that \u201cMs. Bailey suffers from chronic muscle spasm that initially began at the time of the motor vehicle accident in 1997 . . . .\u201d Dr. Moghul changed Mrs. Bailey\u2019s regimen and referred her for further physical therapy and massage therapy. At the physical therapy evaluation on June 25, 2002, Mrs. Bailey was \u201cfound to have signs and symptoms consistent with chronic neck and upper back pain with some weakness.\u201d By October, 2002, the regimen that Mrs. Bailey was following, along with the medication prescribed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Dr. Moghul, had helped to alleviate, although not eliminate, Mrs. Bailey\u2019s symptoms. At the time of trial, Mrs. Bailey continued to have ongoing pain, but was able to better manage that pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In addition to medical records that contained the evidence in the preceding two paragraphs, Mrs. Bailey testified to her various medical treatments and consultations as well as her use of several varieties of pain medications and muscle relaxants. She testified to her good health prior to the accident, and freedom from the painful symptoms that she later experienced constantly from the date of the accident to the time of trial. She testified to regular gym activities (including aerobic exercise) several times a week, with her husband, prior to the accident, and her total inability to continue those activities afterwards. She also testified to other limitations after the accident, including physical play activities with her grandchildren, intimate relations with her husband, and driving herself to work. In addition, she experienced lack of sleep, crying at night, restraints on mobility (including housework), an inability to lift, and constant pain. Mr. Bailey\u2019s testimony mirrored, to a slightly lesser degree, the testimony of his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The defendants presented Dr. Robert Pennell, a board certified orthopedist, who had examined Mrs. Bailey in February, 1999. He testified to his examination of her medical records, her history as she had recited to him, his training and experience, his physical examination of her, and his conclusions. Among his conclusions was that Mrs. Bailey was consciously or deliberately manipulating results of the examination, feigning her symptoms and their importance. He testified that her recitation of pain and symptoms \u201cdid not make sense from a physiological] standpoint. From a logical orthopedic or neurologie sense, it did not make sense.\u201d He testified to his opinion that as of one and one-half years from the time of her accident the consequences had \u201cresolved . . . disappeared. She was cured, nothing left from it.\u201d He testified that \u201cbased on the examinations that [he had] conducted and based on [his] review of all the medical records [as of February, 1999], [he formed] an opinion . . . [that] any injuries [Mrs. Bailey] might have received in [the] accident had been resolved.\u201d He testified \u201c[t]hat she made a full recovery from any possible injury she might have suffered in the accident of December 10, 1997.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>Prior to the commencement of trial, at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, and during the charge conference, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs could not produce sufficient evidence of causation without a live medical expert testifying. Prior to trial the defendants argued that a treating physician\u2019s opinion of causation, even if contained in the medical records introduced under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, was insufficient without a live witness testifying, \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u201d that Mrs. Bailey suffers the condition explicitly complained of, and that the condition is caused by the defendants\u2019 negligent action. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the defendants, arguing in support of their motion for directed verdict, acknowledged that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, allows medical records to be admitted (as they were in this case), but asserted that there is nonetheless a requirement of live testimony from a medical expert \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d that there is a relationship between the defendants\u2019 actions and Mrs. Bailey\u2019s medical condition. The defendants claim that the medical records here do not contain the necessary opinion, in any case. During the charge conference, the defendants\u2019 attorney reiterated that the causal connection between negligence and the injury must be the subject of testimony by \u201ca medical expert who comes in here and says to a reasonable degree of medical certainty these damages or these injuries that this person is claiming are connected to this accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The judge instructed, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201cEven if you find that the defendants were negligent, they are not hable to the plaintiff unless their negligence caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201cTo meet this burden, the plaintiff need only show that there is a greater likelihood or probability that the harm complained of was due to causes for which the defendants were responsible than from any other cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">\u201c[T]he plaintiff is not required to show the exact cause of her injuries or to exclude all possibility that they resulted without the fault of the defendants. What the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>plaintiff must show by expert testimony presented here in court either live or through medical records is that the harm was more likely due to the defendants\u2019 negligence than to some other cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The judge appears to have decided that some quality of expert opinion testimony was necessary in this case on the issue of causation; that the opinion was expressed in Mrs. Bailey\u2019s medical records, without the necessity of a live witness or the words \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d; and that the records in this case contained sufficient medical opinion to permit the jury to make a plaintiffs\u2019 finding. We agree with the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The defendants first argue that there are no appellate decisions declaring whether an expert opinion on causation may be proved through a \u00a7 79G submission, without a live witness, and that the live witness should be required. The defendants rely upon <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 643 (1991); <em>Gompers </em>v. <em>Finnell, </em>35 Mass App. Ct. 91 (1993); and <em>Lally </em>v. <em>Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 317 (1998). However, we do not find these cases to support their argument. The theory of causation in <em>Lally </em>is more complicated than in the present case. In <em>Lally, </em>the plaintiffs sought to prove that a child\u2019s spinal injury during a traffic accident was exacerbated by a design defect in the automobile in which he was riding. <em>Lally </em>v. <em>Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 322. Proof of exacerbation or aggravation of injuries is more likely to require expert testimony. See <em>id. </em>at 324-325.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Moreover, unlike the present case, in <em>Lally, </em>\u201call the medical testimony, including that of the plaintiffs\u2019 own expert, tended to <em>refute the plaintiffs\u2019 theory </em>of causation\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 322. Thus, the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201ca single, reluctant acknowledgment [by the expert] cannot be construed as his expert opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that [the] injury was caused by an impact with a narrow, rigid edge such as the glove box door,\u201d see <em>id. </em>at 323-324, has little bearing on the issues in the present case, where the plaintiffs submitted numerous physicians\u2019 statements in the medical records supporting their theory of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Stein, supra, </em>and <em>Gom</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>pers </em>v. <em>Finnell, supra, </em>is similarly misplaced. Those cases stand for the proposition that expert opinion in medical records admitted pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, must be made by a physician who examined or treated the patient. <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 646 (statute is \u201cinapplicable to the report of a physician who neither examined nor treated the plaintiff\u201d). <em>Gompers </em>v. <em>Finnell, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 93 (\u201cNothing in [the statute] authorizes <em>one not a physician or dentist to </em>offer an expert opinion that a patient\u2019s physical symptoms resulted from a particular accident or incident\u201d [emphasis supplied]). In the instant case there is no dispute that the evidence in the medical records pertaining to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries came from the doctors who treated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Section 79G of chapter 233 provides that authenticated bills, reports, and records \u201cshall be admissible as evidence of the fair and reasonable charge for such services [to a person injured] or the necessity of such services or treatments, the diagnosis of said physician . . . , the prognosis of such physician <em>..., the opinion of such physician ... as to proximate cause of the condition so diagnosed, </em>[and] the opinion of such physician ... as to disability or incapacity, if any, proximately resulting from the condition so diagnosed ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). The statute also provides that \u201c[n]othing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the right of any party to the action to summon, at his own expense, such physician ... or agent of such hospital or health maintenance organization or the records of such hospital or health maintenance organization for the purpose of cross examination with respect to such bill, record and report or to rebut the contents thereof, or for any other purpose, nor to limit the right of any party to the action or proceeding to summon any other person to testify in respect to such bill, record or report or for any other purpose.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In this case the defendants did not claim that the records were improperly admitted; rather, they claimed that the records did not contain a reliable expert opinion as to causation and that it was the plaintiffs\u2019 burden to produce a live expert as part of their proof. We do not read the statute or the cases cited by the defendants as requiring a live witness. To the extent the defendants complain that none of the treating physicians identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>fled in the records was available for live cross-examination, the responsibility for calling them as witnesses lies with the defendants. The statute clearly allowed the defendants to summon treating physicians for live testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The defendants next argue that an expert medical opinion in this case must include the formulaic phrase \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d The defendants provide no Massachusetts case authority, however, identifying the specified language as requisite to an expert opinion on causation. While the court in <em>Lally </em>v. <em>Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 324-325, spoke explicitly about the necessity for expert medical testimony on highly technical medical issues, such as injury causation and enhancement of injury to the spine resulting in paraplegia, neither the <em>Lally </em>opinion nor the cases cited there indicate a requirement that an expert, assuming that an expert is necessary, must use the identified words. In fact, we have determined in the medical malpractice context that an expert\u2019s recitation of \u201cmagic words\u201d is not required, so long as the expert\u2019s opinion is expressed with sufficient firmness and clarity. See <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Bixon, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 639, 644-645 (1987) (\u201calthough in expressing their opinions as to the consequences of the defendant\u2019s conduct none of the medical experts used the words \u2018to a reasonable medical certainty,\u2019 we do not think the absence of this precise terminology renders those otherwise firm opinions on the issue of causation insufficient as matter of law\u201d); <em>Rahilly </em>v. <em>North Adams Regional Hosp., 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 714, 718 n.6 (1994) (holding that plaintiff\u2019s expert need not state his opinion in formulaic terms); <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 106, 111 (1997) (same); <em>Lambley </em>v. <em>Kameny, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 277, 287 (1997) (\u201cIt was not required of [the expert] to state his opinion as to [the defendant\u2019s] perceived deficiencies in any particular form or by use of any magic words\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Finally, the defendants argue that the medical records submitted in this case did not contain sufficient medical opinion to permit the jury to make a plaintiffs\u2019 finding. Persistently, the defendants focus their argument on the language \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d They highlight the language of treating physicians as contained in the records. They note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Dr. Younger\u2019s June 22, 2001, medical record states that the accident \u201cpresumably set . . . off [the chronic pain syndrome]\u201d and Dr. Moghul\u2019s May 14, 2002, statement that she \u201cfeel[s that] Mrs. Bailey suffers from chronic muscle spasm that initially began at the time of the motor vehicle accident in 1997 and subsequently grew in intensity to involve her entire upper back.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants note Dr. Herzog\u2019s <em>impression, </em>on March 11, 1998, that \u201cMs. Bailey has left-sided C-6 and L-5 radiculopathies secondary to whiplash injury sustained on 12/10/97.\u201d They note Dr. Moghul\u2019s May 14, 2002, <em>impression </em>that \u201cMs. Bailey suffers from chronic muscle spasm that initially began at the time of the motor vehicle accident in 1997 . . . .\u201d These statements by Mrs. Bailey\u2019s treating physicians are at least as compelling as the live testimony of the expert in <em>Andrade </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>358 Mass. 786, 787-788 (1971), which \u201cwas sufficient to establish the causal connection between the . . . accident and the plaintiff\u2019s disability.\u201d There, in response to the judge\u2019s questions as to his medical opinion, the expert stated, \u201cI firmly believe that this accident had something to do with her hand.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We hold that the medical records in this case contain sufficient expert opinion on causation t\u00f3 the extent that such expert opinion is required in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The judge was correct in denying the motion for directed verdict. The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence in this case was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> The defendants have stipulated as to liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b251-10\"> The medical evidence in this and the succeeding full paragraph is taken from Mrs. Bailey\u2019s medical records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b258-5\"> The defendants in their brief relax their vehement insistence upon the \u201creasonable degree\u201d language, suggesting that \u201cother like terms\u201d would suffice for opinion that the accident was a cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\"> We also express our view, by way of dictum, that the injuries complained of by Mrs. Bailey, regardless of denomination, are not so highly technical as to require greater specificity in causation by way of expert opinion. She suffered injuries in an automobile accident, and thereafter experienced chronic pain that she did not have before the accident. Causation is, fairly, a matter of degree, and clearly there are cases involving medical issues where no expert opinion whatsoever would be necessary to establish legal causation. See <em>Lovely\u2019s Case, </em>336 Mass. 512, 516 (1957) (no expert testimony required where causal relationship between alleged negligence and claimed injury is within \u201cgeneral human knowledge and experience\u201d); <em>Haggerty </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>344 Mass. 136, 139 (1962), quoting from <em>Cyr </em>v. <em>Giesen, </em>150 Me. 248, 252 (1954) (medical malpractice cases \u201cwhere the negligence and harmful results are sufficiently obvious as to lie within common knowledge\u201d do not require expert testimony); <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Tranfaglia, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 664, 666-667 (2003) (\u201cWhen the causal link is one that may be inferred from the evidence already received, the finder of fact does not need help from an expert\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
