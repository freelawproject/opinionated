When the police began their investigation by speaking with the other driver, the defendant became impatient and told the officers that he could not wait. Despite being directed to remain at the scene, the defendant engaged his vehicle and prepared to leave. One of the officers pronounced the defendant under arrest for disorderly conduct and used the handle of his weapon in an unsuccessful attempt to break the defendant\u2019s car window, prompting the defendant to flee and lead the officers on a high-speed chase. Eventually, the defendant was apprehended and charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>weapon, to wit, an automobile (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A[h]), three counts of assault and battery on a police officer (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D), resisting arrest (G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B), disorderly conduct (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53), and failure to stop for a police officer (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress, claiming that the police had no justification for detaining and pursuing him, and therefore, any evidence of his conduct after leaving the scene was subject to the exclusionary rule. A judge of the Superior Court agreed and allowed the defendant\u2019s motion. On the Commonwealth\u2019s interlocutory appeal, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s motion should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><em>Background. </em>After hearing the testimony of three police witnesses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the motion judge found the following facts. On the morning of August 28, 2002, the defendant telephoned the State police to report that, while driving on Route 146, he had just been forced off the road and assaulted by the driver of a truck. Although the defendant became upset and belligerent when the dispatcher asked him for information, he provided his name, telephone number, and social security number.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The dispatcher sent Trooper Robert Johnson to respond, telling him that it was an emergency because the defendant claimed to be an assault victim. The truck driver also called the police at approximately the same time, thus prompting the arrival of Officer Scott LaPlante of the Sutton police department. Both Johnson and LaPlante first spoke with the truck driver for approximately five to ten minutes. During this time, neither police officer approached or communicated with the defendant, who remained seated in his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Eventually, the defendant got out of his vehicle, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have all day for this.\u201d He made his way toward the officers and the truck, walking along the outside or just inside Route 146. Johnson directed the defendant to stay in his car and said that he would be with him shortly, to which the defendant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have all day. I\u2019ll leave and go home.\u201d Johnson then told the defendant, \u201cDon\u2019t leave because we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>investigating, and you have motor vehicle infractions.\u201d Although the defendant had yet to be interviewed, Johnson was considering giving him a citation for the civil infraction of changing lanes, or charging him with operating to endanger, a misdemeanor that had occurred outside the officer\u2019s presence and thus was not an arrestable offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Contrary to Johnson\u2019s instruction, the defendant got back in his vehicle and started to engage it. Johnson responded by approaching and telling the defendant that he was under arrest for being a disorderly person; however, the judge expressly discredited that the officers observed conduct satisfying the elements of this offense. The judge found that Johnson knew that he had not seen such conduct and informed the defendant that he was under arrest only to keep him at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Even though the defendant had just been told that he was under arrest, he prepared to drive away. Johnson then removed his loaded handgun from his holster, grabbed it by the barrel and, using the handle as a hammer, attempted to break the window of the defendant\u2019s car. Johnson testified that, in the past, he had broken numerous windows in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The defendant drove off at a high rate of speed. The two police officers got into their vehicles and chased the defendant for several miles at the speed limit of sixty-five miles per hour or higher, on what was a busy four-lane highway. Neither officer discontinued the chase even after they saw the defendant switching lanes at high speed. Rather, Johnson accelerated and passed the defendant, intending to use \u201cstop sticks\u201d to deflate his tires. When the defendant saw Johnson\u2019s vehicle pass him, he crossed the fifty-foot wide grassy median strip and entered traffic in the opposite direction. The officers did likewise. On three different occasions, the defendant crossed the median strip with the officers following behind him.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The defendant finally came to a stop after a third police officer was called and cut the defendant off by using his police cruiser. However, the defendant did not immediately exit his car as ordered by the police; instead, he stayed inside and spoke on his cellular telephone. Johnson and LaPlante positioned themselves on opposite sides of the defendant\u2019s vehicle and smashed its front side windows. Then, each of the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>inserted a canister of mace or pepper spray into the car and sprayed the defendant\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">While this was happening, the defendant\u2019s vehicle was still moving slowly forward, there was glass everywhere inside the vehicle, and the defendant remained in his seat with his seatbelt fastened as the car traveled five to ten feet before coming to a halt. When the defendant yelled into his telephone that he was being beaten, Johnson shoved his firearm into the defendant\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On these facts, the motion judge concluded that even if the police had reasonable suspicion to detain the defendant and conduct a threshold inquiry, Johnson lacked probable cause to arrest the defendant for disorderly conduct or any other crime and used disproportionate force in attempting to keep the defendant at the scene. The judge also noted, in an endorsement denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for reconsideration, that \u201cthe Commonwealth should not be allowed to rely on the results of an improper police chase which never should have begun.\u201d Because, in the judge\u2019s view, the police pursuit of the defendant was unjustified, she suppressed all evidence, including police observations, obtained as a result. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 789 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>We apply the requisite standard of review, accepting the motion judge\u2019s findings of fact absent clear error, but independently reviewing the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions of law and the application of constitutional principles to the facts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>433 Mass. 669, 671-672 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Whatever one may think about the wisdom of the police response to the defendant\u2019s actions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> evidence of the defendant\u2019s departure and its aftermath was not required to be suppressed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The conflicting reports of a serious incident on the highway created reasonable suspicion for the responding officers to conduct a threshold inquiry of both the defendant and the truck driver. Although the defendant was kept waiting for five or ten minutes, the police were pursuing their investigation, and this length of time was not unreasonable in the circumstances. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>425 Mass. 572, 583-584 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laaman, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 354, 364, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 834 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Then, despite the fact that the inquiry was not complete, and contrary to Johnson\u2019s direction, the defendant started to leave the scene. By doing so, he violated G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 25, which mandates that persons operating a motor vehicle submit to uniformed police when signaled to stop. The police therefore had probable cause to arrest him. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In these circumstances, there was no basis to apply the exclusionary rule to suppress police observations of the defendant\u2019s conduct after he left the scene. Indeed, even if the defendant\u2019s flight had been precipitated by police actions that violated his constitutional rights, his failure to stop would have been an independent unlawful act that \u201cbroke the chain of causation and dissipated the taint of [any] prior illegality.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 245 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mock, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct., 276, 284-285 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 332, 337 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The statutory requirement that motorists stop for police brooks no exception \u2014 even for a driver who reasonably believes that police detention is unjustified. If there is no legitimate basis for the stop, the driver\u2019s recourse is not through flight with its attendant risks to others, but through the orderly judicial process. Here, the defendant\u2019s reckless efforts to elude the police, including multiple lane changes and three U-tums across the median strip of a busy highway, well illustrate the public safety concerns that underlie the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Our decision is limited to the application of the exclusionary rule. The result is only to allow the Commonwealth to rely upon evidence, including police observations, obtained after the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the officer\u2019s instruction to stop. We do not consider whether the defendant has a defense to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>any of the charges against him based upon the actions of the police, since the viability of any such defense necessarily will depend upon the evidence adduced at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreira, </em>388 Mass. 596, 602 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, supra </em>at 342-343.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is vacated, and a new order shall enter denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\"> The judge heard from the State trooper who received the defendant\u2019s telephone call, as well as the trooper and police officer who reported to the scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\"> The record does not indicate that the police had reason to believe that the defendant was armed or dangerous, nor does it reveal whether the officers were in compliance with any applicable policies and procedures concerning high speed chases. The motion judge was of the opinion that it was possible (and preferable) for the police to apprehend the defendant later using information that the police already had obtained, rather than attempting to keep him on the scene by breaking his car window with a loaded weapon and pursuing him in a high speed chase down a busy highway.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
