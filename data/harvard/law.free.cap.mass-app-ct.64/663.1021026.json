Palriwala, and awarded two million dollars on their claim for quantum meruit damages; the trial judge, concluding that this special verdict was in conflict with the jury\u2019s finding that a contract existed between Gauri S. Palriwala and Satya and Sushila, which had not been breached, ordered judgment to issue in favor of the defendant. Judgment entered dismissing the claims of the plaintiffs Mahesh Palriwala and his wife Rekha, based on the jury\u2019s findings that a contract existed between them and Gauri S. Palriwala that had not been breached, and also that Mahesh and Rekha were not entitled to recover damages under a theory of quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The defendant asserts as a preliminary matter that the plaintiffs\u2019 notice of appeal was timely filed only as to Mahesh. As we will discuss, we think that it was timely as to all four plaintiffs. We conclude that the jury followed the trial judge\u2019s instructions and agree with Satya and Sushila that the special verdict in their favor on their claim for quantum meruit damages finds support in the evidence and is not inconsistent. We therefore reverse the order that judgment enter in favor of the defendant on the quantum meruit based claims of Satya and Sushila. We affirm the judgments in favor of the defendant on the claims of Mahesh and Rekha.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">1. <em>Summary of proceedings. </em>The plaintiffs, Satya and Sushila Palriwala, together with their son Mahesh and his wife, Rekha Palriwala, brought suit in Superior Court against Bijay Palriwala, the executor of the estate of Bijay\u2019s father (and Satya\u2019s brother), Gauri S. Palriwala (referred to here and in the pleadings as \u201cGS,\u201d by which he was known during his lifetime). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>gist of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in their verified complaint is that they had each provided a variety of services, over a period of years, as requested by GS \u2014 a wealthy businessman who became increasingly more disabled from the effects of childhood polio \u2014 who promised them housing and that they would be taken care of financially if they left their homes and employment in India to come to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The complaint alleges that, on the strength of GS\u2019s promises, Satya and his wife, Sushila, moved to Massachusetts in 1979, where Satya began employment with Asiatic, one of GS\u2019s businesses; Satya and Sushila lived with GS in his apartment and took care of all of GS\u2019s needs until 1982, when they returned to India. Asked by GS to return, they did so in 1984 and provided services as requested until GS was hospitalized in October, 1992. In 1989, in reliance upon similar promises, Mahesh and Rekha left India and joined Mahesh\u2019s parents in providing services to GS. It is alleged that GS died in 1996 without making good on his promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Counts I through V of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint were dismissed, upon the parties\u2019 reported settlement of those claims, before the jury began their deliberations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury returned answers, which are considered special verdicts, on the two remaining counts against the estate: a breach of contract claim (Count VI), alleging the existence of an agreement that the plaintiffs \u201cwould move to the United States and work for and take care of GS in return for his providing for them financially,\u201d specifically $500,000, as well as a home; and a separate claim for quantum meruit recovery (Count VII), seeking \u201cthe reasonable value of [the plaintiffs\u2019] services rendered to the decedent in reliance on his promise that he would provide for them if they left India and came to Massachusetts to work for him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>care for his personal needs.\u201d The complaint does not specify that Counts VI and VH were pleaded in the alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Following a five-day trial, the jury reported answers to eighteen questions that had been agreed to by the parties and submitted to the jury on a joint special verdict form.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Questions one through thirteen govern the plaintiffs\u2019 contract and quantum meruit claims. The jury found that there were contracts between GS and the plaintiffs, but that there had not been a breach.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the question, \u201cAre the plaintiffs Satya N. and Sushila Palriwala entitled to recover damages under a theory of quantum meruit,\u201d the jury responded \u201cYes.\u201d As to damages under this theory the jury responded, \u201cTwo Million Dollars plus attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Concerning the entitlement of Mahesh and Rekha to quantum meruit damages, the jury answered that they were not entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">After the jury were dismissed, the plaintiffs filed a proposed form of judgment based on the special verdict in favor of Satya and Sushila on the claim of quantum meruit recovery. The defendant filed a motion seeking a judgment in his favor on both the contract and quantum meruit counts, arguing that the special verdict that a contract existed that had not been breached was inconsistent as matter of law with the special verdict that Satya and Sushila were entitled to quantum meruit damages for services that had been the subject of the contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial judge agreed and allowed the motion, noting: \u201cUnder the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>as pied ... the finding that a contract existed between the parties precludes a finding for plffs on quantum meruit.\u201d A judgment entered dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action on the merits. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that only Mahesh filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\"><em>The notice of appeal. </em>The notice of appeal at issue was filed on January 4, 2002, within thirty days from the date judgment entered on December 6, 2001. The notice sets forth as the parties appealing, \u201cMahesh Palriwala, et al./Plaintiffs.\u201d The defendant claims that because the notice did not also specifically name Satya, Sushila, and Rekha, it failed to give proper notice as to them, pursuant to Mass.R.App.P. 3(c), as appearing in 430 Mass. 1602 (1999) (notice \u201cshall specify the party or parties taking the appeal\u201d), and that, consequently, this court lacks jurisdiction over the unnamed parties\u2019 appeal. In the circumstances of this case, we think the notice sufficiently specified all four plaintiffs as appealing from the judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">We have held that the specificity requirement of role 3(c) is met if the notice, no matter how inartful, \u201cgives fair notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the specific individual or entity seeking to appeal.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport </em>v. <em>DeCarolis, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 351 (1992), quoting from <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>487 U.S. 312, 318 (1988). In <em>DeCarolis, </em>we held that a notice was sufficient despite the arguably deficient caption designating the appellant as \u201cLoyd M. Starrett, et ais,\u201d where the body of the notice referred to \u201cLoyd M. Starrett, et ais., the above-named Plaintiffs\u201d and, \u201cLOYD M. STARRETT, et ais. as they are member[s] of the ROCKPORT ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS by their attorney,\u201d appeared over the attorney\u2019s signature line. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport </em>v. <em>DeCarolis, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Here, the notice, \u201cMahesh K. Palriwala, et al./ Plaintiffs,\u201d is identical to the caption used by the trial court in its judgment which refers (in the body of the judgment) by name to each of the four plaintiffs; the form of judgment had been proposed by the defendant. Additionally, the body of the notice refers to the \u201cplaintiffs\u201d and is signed: \u201cPLAINTIFFS, By their attorneys.\u201d The attorneys listed are the same attorneys who filed the complaint on behalf of Satya, Sushila, Mahesh, and Rekha, and represented all four plaintiffs throughout the proceedings below. From these circumstances we think that it would be readily apparent to the defendant that \u201cet al.\u201d and \u201cplaintiffs\u201d refer to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>four plaintiffs in the original complaint. Thus, \u201c[t]he body of the notice . . . makes plain\u201d who the appellants are. <em>Deveau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 425 n.10 (2001).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">This case is unlike <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>487 U.S. at 317-318, where the term \u201cet al.\u201d was held not to satisfy the specificity required by Fed.RA.P. 3(c) (1979). The named plaintiff in that case, Torres, was one of sixteen plaintiffs who had intervened in a complicated employment discrimination suit against the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 313. The notice of appeal contained the caption \u201cet al.,\u201d while the body of the notice named fifteen out of the sixteen plaintiffs, leaving out Torres. <em>Id. </em>at 317. See also <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Beverly Hosp. Corp., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 913, 914 n.2 (1999) (where action commenced in Superior Court named five other individuals as plaintiffs but the notice of appeal named only Joseph Garland; therefore, he was considered the only appellant). Unlike in <em>Torres </em>or <em>Garland, </em>here there was no significant omission of an appealing party in the body of the notice. The notice gave \u201cfair notice of the specific individual or entity seeking to appeal,\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Oakland Scavenger Co., supra </em>at 318, and served, in the circumstances of this case, as the functional equivalent of naming each of the parties to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\"><em>The special jury verdict. </em>The parties jointly proposed the questions on the special verdict form that were submitted to the jury pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 49(a). As was discussed in <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 800 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">\u201cUnder rule 49(a), the jurors return answers to each question or each issue submitted to them. The jurors do not return a general verdict. The answers to the questions or issues submitted are considered a special verdict consisting of \u2018a statement of facts the jury have found from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the judge determines the appropriate judgment.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licciardi, </em>387 Mass. 670, 675 (1982).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Of particular relevance to this case is the principle that, \u201c[i]f the jury\u2019s answers can be harmonized, they must be resolved so as to harmonize them.\u201d <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, supra. </em>See <em>McCue </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>371 Mass. 659, 664 (1976), quoting from <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Petzelt, </em>311 F.2d 601, 603 n.10 (7th Cir. 1962) (\u201c \u2018every reasonable intendment in favor of the general verdict should be indulged in an effort to harmonize\u2019 that verdict with the jury\u2019s answers to the special questions\u201d). Indeed, if there is an inconsistency and the answers \u201ccannot be harmonized with the evidence and the instructions,\u201d <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, supra </em>at 800-801, the jurors must, if they have not been discharged, be instructed to reconsider their answers; if they have been discharged, \u201ca new trial is required because it is the jurors\u2019 constitutional responsibility to resolve the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 801.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The defendant correctly notes that, where a valid contract covers the subject matter of dispute, \u201cthe law need not create a quantum meruit right to receive compensation for services rendered,\u201d <em>Boswell </em>v. <em>Zephyr Lines, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 241, 250 (1993), but his claim that the special verdicts are inconsistent assumes that the contract and the quantum meruit based damages covered the same services provided by Satya and Sushila.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\u201cIn determining whether there is an inconsistency in the jury\u2019s answers, the answers are to be viewed in the light of the attendant circumstances, including the pleadings, issues submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ted, and the judge\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">We first consider \u201c[t]he questions submitted to the jury . . . in light of the instructions given by the judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802. The judge thoroughly instructed the jury on the elements necessary to their findings on the breach of contract and quantum meruit claims and gave companion instructions to the special jury verdict form. Nowhere in her thorough and detailed instructions did the judge inform the jury that the two claims were with respect to the same services performed by the plaintiffs, or that a finding that a contract existed, which had not been breached, would preclude recovery on the basis of quantum meruit. Rather, the instructions given by the judge and those stated on the special verdict form, when viewed in the light of the parties\u2019 presentation of the case to the jury, conveyed that the action involved two counts upon which the plaintiffs could recover if the elements as to each count were met by the evidence. The jury followed the instructions regarding completion of the form and answered only those questions they were instructed to answer. See <em>Technical Facilities of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryerson &amp; Son, Inc., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 605 (1987) (where jury followed instructions in answering questions and \u201cthere is a very reasonable view of the evidence which harmonizes the answers,\u201d special verdicts are not inconsistent). Cf. <em>Service Publications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goverman, </em>396 Mass. 567, 573 n.8 (1986) (\u201cTo constitute inconsistent verdicts, it must be shown that the verdicts are based on inconsistent findings of fact\u201d). Compare <em>Kavanaugh </em>v <em>Greenlee Tool Co., </em>944 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1991) (\u201c[I]t was unnecessary for the [trial] court to attempt a conventional reconciliation of the inconsistent verdicts\u201d where \u201c[a]ll of the alleged inconsistencies in the special verdicts stem from the jury\u2019s failure to comply with the written instructions on the special verdict form <em>and </em>with the companion explanations given in the charge to the jury\u201d (emphasis original).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">After answering the questions relating to the existence of a contract between GS and Satya and Sushila,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the jury proceeded, as instructed, to answer question six: \u201cAre the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>plaintiffs Satya N. and Sushila Palriwala entitled to recover damages under a theory of quantum meruit?\u201d They were to answer this question regardless whether they found that a contract existed which had not been breached. The jury\u2019s response to question six was \u201cyes.\u201d They then were directed to question seven, which asks the amount of damages under the theory of quantum meruit (the jury answered \u201ctwo million dollars plus attorney\u2019s fees\u201d), and eight, which asks \u201chow much of the damages ... are awarded for the period from 1979, when the plaintiffs Satya N. and Sushila Palriwala first came to the United States, through 1984, when they returned to India.\u201d The jury answered that none of the damage award was for this period. Based on the foregoing, \u201cwe do not perceive any inconsistency between the jury\u2019s answers, or between their answers and the judge\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>DiBenedetto </em>v. <em>Com</em>monwealth, 398 Mass. 395, 400 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The special verdicts may also be harmonized with the evidence. \u201cWhere there is a view of the case that makes the jury\u2019s answers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be resolved that way.\u201d <em>McCue </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>371 Mass. at 664, quoting from <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ellerman Lines, Ltd., </em>369 U.S. 355, 364 (1962) (harmonization rule avoids \u201ccollision with the Seventh Amendment\u201d). The jury\u2019s view as reflected in their special verdicts (that the case involved contracts for certain services for which there was no breach; but, for the period from 1984 through 1992, services had been rendered by Satya and Sushila, which were not the subject of the contract, entitling them to compensation) finds ample support in the evidence. \u201c \u2018To constitute inconsistent verdicts, it must be shown that the verdicts are based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>inconsistent findings of fact. . . .\u2019 But there is a very reasonable view of the evidence which harmonizes the answers.\u201d <em>Technical Facilities of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryerson &amp; Son., Inc., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 605, quoting from <em>Service Publications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goverman, </em>396 Mass. at 573 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We summarize the facts the jury reasonably could have found to support the existence of distinct services entitling the plaintiffs to potential recovery under both counts of the complaint. Satya and Sushila were living in Calcutta, India, when, beginning in 1976, GS began asking his brother if he and his wife would come to the United States to live with him and take care of him personally, and also to help him in his business, the Asiatic Company; he promised to \u201ctake care of\u201d them if they did so. In communications with Satya, GS asked that he help with the family business in return for salary, healthcare coverage, and housing. In a separate conversation with Sushila regarding his failing health, GS said he needed her to take care of him because his health was failing and no one, including his son and daughter-in-law, was available to help him.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In 1979, Satya and Sushila moved to the United States, where they lived with GS in his two-bedroom apartment in Boston (later moving to a condominium in Cambridge). Satya worked at the Asiatic Company dining the day and was paid a salary of some $25,000 per year, with occasional year-end bonuses; Asiatic also provided health-insurance benefits for Satya and his wife. This was evidence that could have supported the special verdict that a contract existed, pursuant to which Satya agreed to work at the Asiatic Company in exchange for a salary, healthcare benefits, and housing, which he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">There was also evidence that Sushila, and to a lesser degree Satya, provided companionship and extensive personal care services for GS, initially for the period 1979 to 1982. They continued, upon their return to the United States in 1984, to provide these services \u2014 but more extensively and to a degree that was more demanding than before because of OS\u2019s deteriorating health \u2014 until GS was hospitalized in 1992. Sushila ran errands for GS and performed household chores, including grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning OS\u2019s bedroom and bathroom, as well as the rest of the apartment dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ing the day while GS was at work. GS usually left the house for Asiatic\u2019s offices just before noon each day. Before he left, Sushila prepared and served GS his breakfast and also prepared OS\u2019s lunch. On his return to the apartment, GS would spend a long time in the bathroom, emerging for dinner at 10:00 p.m., when Sushila would serve the dinner she had prepared, cutting up his salad for him, then serving soup and bread that she also had made, followed by vegetables prepared to his liking. After doing the dishes, Sushila nightly fixed a hot water bottle for GS to take to bed with him when he retired near midnight. As his health worsened, Sushila\u2019s chores increased. She helped him dress himself and eventually had to help him to the bathroom, often during the middle of the night. At one point she was required to give him his medicine every half hour. GS had a baby monitor installed in his room so that he could call Satya and Sushila in their room whenever he needed help. When home health care aides were eventually hired, Sushila would assist them in providing care for GS. When GS traveled to conventions, Satya and Sushila accompanied him, staying in the same room; they shopped at grocery stores and prepared foods he wanted to eat, such as fresh fruit, which Sushila would cut up for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">When Satya came home from work in the evening, he attended to the task of responding to telexes sent to GS from vendors around the world, taking dictation from GS, and transmitting the responses to a telex machine, a task that often took two or more hours nightly. Satya also assisted GS with his personal needs, taking medicines from the medicine cabinet and bringing GS to various doctors and physical therapy appointments. S\u00e1fya accompanied GS on his shopping trips, assisted Sushila with the household chores, and generally was on call to provide assistance to GS until GS retired for bed at night; as OS\u2019s health grew worse, Satya would attend to him during the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\u201cIt is for the jury to sort out conflicting inferences that are possible from conflicting evidence. It was error to conclude that there was no rational basis for the verdict.\u201d <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 494, 504 (2003). See <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>423 Mass. 652, 659 (1996), quoting from <em>Corsetti </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>v. <em>Stone Co., </em>396 Mass. 1, 21 (1985) (The judge is not to \u201cassess witness credibility or the weight of the evidence, but seek to determine whether there is truly \u2018but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable men could have reached\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The fact that the jury returned a different answer with respect to Mahesh and Rekha\u2019s entitlement to recovery under a theory of quantum meruit is not inconsistent with our conclusion that the jury\u2019s verdicts are capable of being harmonized.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, we think this reflects the jury\u2019s understanding of the case as involving distinct sets of services that could form the basis of recovery under both counts. Likewise, the jury found services rendered by Satya and Sushila from 1984 to a point in 1992 were subject to quantum meruit recovery, distinguishing these from contracted for services rendered for the period from 1979 to 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\"><em>Dismissal of claims by Mahesh and Rekha. </em>Mahesh and Rekha seek a new trial on the ground that their expert\u2019s testimony was wrongly excluded. They claim that the expert would have testified that \u201cassets of a Hindu joint family are held in common by all members, but are managed by the patriarch who has the duty to ensure that each family member gets his due,\u201d and that this testimony would have assisted the jury in understanding the cultural background of the parties and would have explained \u201cwhat OS\u2019s promises of adequate compensation\u201d meant in the Hindu joint family context. The exclusion of expert testimony was a matter within the trial judge\u2019s discretion. See <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>380 Mass. 372, 384 (1980); <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 449 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>We reverse the trial court\u2019s order for judgment dismissing the quantum meruit claims as to the plaintiffs, Satya and Sushila. We affirm the judgment insofar as it dismisses the claims of Mahesh and Rekha and the defendant\u2019s counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\"> The defendant filed counterclaims against Satya and Mahesh, all of which were dismissed pursuant to the jury\u2019s special verdicts. The defendant filed a cross-appeal from the dismissal of his counterclaims, but his brief does not state the nature of his challenges on appeal and advances no arguments as to any issues related to the dismissal of his counterclaims. We therefore treat as waived any challenges to the verdict that might have been made. See Mass.R. A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See also <em>Wescott </em>v. <em>Henshaw Motor Co., </em>275 Mass. 82, 86 (1931); <em>Shedlock </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>442 Mass 844, 866 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b687-6\"> Count I sought a declaration and Counts II through V asserted claims against the defendants Palriwala Corporation, trustee, and Palriwala India Foundation, regarding the use, occupancy, and ownership of a condominium unit located at the Esplanade condominium complex in Cambridge, in which Mahesh and his family had resided. The claims were to be dismissed in exchange for a payment to the plaintiffs in the amount of $125,000. Before the jury had rendered their special verdicts, counsel and the trial judge discussed whether this sum would be offset against any possible award of quantum memit damages, but agreed that a determination was premature. No determination of this issue appears of record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> The questions were submitted pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 49(a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974), which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">\u201cThe court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact. . . . The court shall give to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b688-9\"> Although, as we shall discuss, the jury heard evidence that each of the four plaintiffs performed distinct services, the complaint made no distinction among the four individuals, whereas the special questions treated Sushila and Satya as one group and Mahesh and Rekha as a second group. This may be due, at least in part, to the fact that under one view of the case that the plaintiffs sought to present, the \u201cplaintiffs lived as a Hindu joint family.\u201d See discussion, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b688-10\"> The defendant attempts to characterize the special verdicts as \u201cadvisory findings,\u201d and therefore not inconsistent. He suggests that the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>instructed the jury to answer all of the questions on the special verdict form (rather than instructing that, if they answered \u201cno\u201d to the question whether the contract had been breached, they should not proceed to the next question regarding quantum meruit recovery), only to avoid a new trial in the event of a reversal on appeal. The record does not support the view that the questions were advisory. See also Mass.R.Civ.P. 39(c), 365 Mass. 802 (1974): \u201cIn all actions <em>not triable of right by a jury, </em>the court, except where otherwise provided by law, may upon motion frame issues of fact to be tried by a jury\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b689-16\"> Even if the defendant is correct, there is another ground for permitting the plaintiffs to bring this appeal. The plaintiffs filed a motion on March 1, 2002, to amend the notice of appeal by adding the names of Satya, Sushila, and Rekha, that was allowed by a judge of the Superior Court. However, the motion was filed outside of the thirty-day extension period for filing in the Superior Court. See Mass.R.A.R 4(c), as amended, 378 Mass. 929 (1979). Instead of acting on the motion, the Superior Court judge should have transferred it to the Appeals Court where, pursuant to Mass.R.A.R 14(b), as amended, 378 Mass. 939 (1979), the Appeals Court or a single justice thereof may, for good cause shown, enlarge the time for filing the notice up to one year from the date of judgment. \u201cWithin that year, a party whose name was incorrectly omitted from a notice of appeal may obtain relief from an appellate court upon a showing of good cause, including an indication that he is raising a substantial appellate issue.\u201d <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 345, 348 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>A single justice of this court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for an order dismissing the appeal of Satya, Sushila, and Rekha, in effect allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend the original notice that had been filed within a year of the judgment. That the single justice order issued more than a year after the entry of judgment does not alter the fact that the motion was timely if deemed to have been filed in the Appeals Court. Cf. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Manns, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 485, 490-493 (1992) (appeal timely where it was claimed within one-year period during which single justice of this court had the authority to allow a late appeal). As we said in the <em>Jones </em>case, where the parties lodged an appeal in the wrong court: \u201cIn such a situation the appeal is not necessarily to be regarded as a nullity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490. Rather, \u201cin a proper case, on a showing of excusable neglect and a meritorious appeal, ... the Appeals Court, acting under \u2018the broad powers of the appellate courts\u2019 with respect to appeals, . . . should be able to order a pending appeal transferred to the Appeals Court in a case where this court has jurisdiction to entertain it.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 490-491. We think that where a motion to enlarge is filed in the wrong court (like an original appeal claimed in the wrong court), \u201c[w]e can treat the single justice\u2019s order as one under rule 14(b), because its plain intent was to enable the [plaintiffs] to bring to this court their appeal from the order of dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493 n.11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\"> In <em>Deveau, </em>we observed: \u201cThe notice of appeal in its caption identified the parties filing it as \u2018Paul Deveau, et al.\u2019 the same caption apparently employed by the parties in pleadings before the board. The body of the notice, however, makes plain that the appellants are the seventeen nonresident appellants who filed board petitions.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">We have reviewed the notice of appeal in that case and note that it refers, in the body, to \u201cseventeen (17) \u2018nonresident\u2019 Appellants who filed petitions with Docket Nos. 215231-215277,\u201d but does not set forth the names of any appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\"> The defendant\u2019s motion, purporting to be filed pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 58(a), as amended, 371 Mass. 908 (1977) (\u201cupon a special verdict under Rule 49(a), . . . the court shall promptly approve the form of the judgment\u201d), was, in effect, a challenge based on an asserted inconsistency in the special verdicts; because it was not filed until after the jury had been dismissed, the motion should not have been allowed. See <em>Holder </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 214, 219 (1985) (challenge to apparent inconsistency in special verdicts must be made prior to dismissal of the jury). See also <em>Service Publications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goverman, </em>396 Mass. 567, 573 (1986); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States Steel Corp., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 104 (1987) (although jury answers were inconsistent as matter of law, challenge was not timely and motion for new trial was properly denied). The issue was not raised; we therefore consider whether the jury\u2019s answers resulted in inconsistent special verdicts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\"> To question 1, \u201cWas there a contract between [GS] and the plaintiffs Satya N. and Sushila Palriwala,\u201d the jury answered \u201cYes.\u201d The form instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>that on a \u201cYes\u201d answer the jury should proceed to answer question No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Question 2 asks whether there were two separate contracts \u2022\u2014 one from 1979 through 1984, and another from 1986 through OS\u2019s hospitalization \u2014 or a continuous contract from 1979. The jury answered \u201cNo,\u201d meaning \u201cthat there was a continuous contract from 1979.\u201d Question 2 instructed, \u201cproceed to Question No. 3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">To Question 3, \u201cwas this contract(s) breached?\u201d the jury answered \u201cNo.\u201d The form directed the jury to question 4 (regarding damages) if they answered \u201cyes,\u201d but if the answer is \u201cNo,\u201d they were to \u201cproceed to question No. 6\u201d regarding entitlement to damages under a theory of quantum meruit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\"> Based on the evidence, the jury could have found that Mahesh and Rekha provided far fewer services during an abbreviated time'frame, and that the services were different in scope than what had been provided by Satya and Sushila. Mahesh and Rekha did not move to Massachusetts until 1989, where they lived in a separate apartment and were parenting two children; there was no evidence that Mahesh worked for GS after working all day at Asiatic; Rekha, who attended college full-time, was less available than Sushila to provide services for GS. The evidence also reflects that Mahesh and Rekha received compensation for these services, in addition to compensation that was paid in exchange for Mahesh\u2019s work at Asiatic: GS paid private school tuition for Mahesh and Rekha\u2019s daughter and college tuition for Rekha; he gave them the use of vehicles; and, on OS\u2019s authorization, Mahesh transferred $100,000 to himself from OS\u2019s bank account.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
