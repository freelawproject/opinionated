L. c. 254, \u00a7 9,] <em>within thirty days of the commencement of the action, </em>or such lien shall be dissolved\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5, as amended by St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 7. The instant case raises the issue of the enforceability of a mechanic\u2019s lien when the unpaid materials supplier filed its complaint in the appropriate registry within eight days of commencing its action but registry officials failed to record it until forty-four days after the action had been commenced. We hold that the lien was not dissolved but could be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><em>Background. </em>National Lumber Company (National), a Massachusetts corporation, is a supplier of lumber and other building materials. In December, 2001, Joseph J. Lombardi and Joseph R. Lombardi, doing business as JAG Builders (JAG), established a Une of credit with National, and in March of 2002 they executed a written contract with National for the purchase of materials that JAG required for use in construction work at the property of Thomas J. Blume, Jr., and Maureen Blume in Walpole. Between April and August, 2002, National sold a significant quantity of lumber and building materials to JAG on credit. JAG ultimately failed to pay National $15,788.65 therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In order to secure payment for the materials it had provided, National sought a mechanic\u2019s hen pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4, against the Blumes\u2019 real property. On September 25, 2002, National had a notice of contract recorded with the Norfolk County registry of deeds (registry), and on November 16, 2002, the registry recorded National\u2019s sworn statement of claim. On November 26, 2002, National filed a complaint in the Wrentham District Court to enforce its lien. On December 4, 2002, National served the Blumes with a summons and a copy of its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">On December 3, 2002, National sent a copy of the complaint, with appropriate recording fees, by Federal Express to the registry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During December of 2002, the procedure at the registry, upon receipt of any package sent by Federal Express, was to open the package immediately and review it to determine if it was in proper form. If it was not in proper form, the registry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>would return it to the sender; if it was in proper form, the registry would set it aside for recording. Federal Express delivered the complaint and recording fee to the registry on December 4, 2002, at 9:57 a.m. Murphy\u2019s Law, however, then intervened. Substantial increases in the registry\u2019s filings, combined with significant reduction in its personnel, created serious delays in the registry\u2019s recording of documents during that very period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even though registry officials received (and signed for) National\u2019s complaint on December 4, 2002, it was not recorded until January 9, 2003, fourteen days beyond the statutory time period. According to the affidavit of a registry official, had National arranged for the complaint (and the appropriate filing fee) to be hand-delivered to the recording clerk on a nonholiday weekday between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., it would have been recorded that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The Blumes filed an application in the District Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 15A(c) and <em>(d), </em>to discharge National\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien on the ground that National had failed to record an attested copy of its complaint in a timely manner, so that its lien was to be deemed dissolved. The District Court denied the Blumes\u2019 application. Upon the request of the parties, the matter was reported to the Appellate Division, which affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Blumes\u2019 appeal to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Discussion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A mechanic\u2019s lien is not a common-law right but a creature of statute, which \u201ccompels strict compliance in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>to obtain relief.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Mullen Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Lore, </em>404 Mass. 750, 752 (1989). See <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>436 Mass. 638, 642, 644 (2002). The statutory framework, set forth in G. L. c. 254, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., specifies the procedures for establishing and enforcing a mechanic\u2019s lien in detail. \u201cAlthough not every procedural mistake is fatal . . . failure to comply normally results in dissolution of the hen, . . . or in failure of the hen to attach.\u201d <em>Mullen Lumber Co., </em>404 Mass. at 752-753. See <em>Ng. Bros. Constr., </em>436 Mass. at 642. There is no dispute that National complied with G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5, governing enforcement of a hen, in all respects except for the requirement that \u201c[a]n attested copy of the complaint. . . shall be . . . recorded . . . within thirty days of the commencement of the action, or such hen shall be dissolved.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">It is common ground that the statute requires that the complaint be recorded (after filing with the registry) within thirty days of the commencement of the action. The disputed question is whether the unilateral inaction of the registry in failing to record a complaint admittedly in its possession well within the thirty-day period (in the proper form and accompanied by the proper fees) necessarily dissolves a party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>mechanic\u2019s lien under \u00a7 5. The Blumes argue that the plain meaning of the statute mandates that the complaint had to be recorded within thirty days in any event and that National\u2019s failure to take steps to verify that the complaint was in fact so recorded is fatal to its lien.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They assert that the statute has to be read to require anyone seeking to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien either to deliver the complaint in hand or, alternatively, to follow up any mailing by monitoring the recording of the complaint to insure that recording actually takes place within thirty days, regardless of the practicality, or even the possibility, of these courses of action. We are not persuaded, however, by their contentions, entirely aside from our disinclination to \u201cread into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">There can be no dispute that a party seeking to perfect a mechanic\u2019s lien is not physically capable of recording the document itself. That is the job of the registry, as G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5, itself makes clear by specifying that the attested complaint \u201cshall be . . . recorded as provided in [\u00a7 9]\u201d of c. 254. Section 9 in turn provides (see note 7, supra) that \u201cthe register [of deeds] . . . shall record\u201d all documents required by c. 254 to be placed in his custody \u2014 an official duty reinforced by G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 30, which provides that \u201c[a] 11 liens . . . and notices . . . and instruments . . . filed as provided for in this chapter, shall be recorded by the register of deeds.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>inserted by St. 1953, c. 406, \u00a7 1. The register also has the responsibility for timely recording. See G. L. c. 36, \u00a7 14 (\u201cEach register shall keep a book . . . [and] shall enter therein, in the order of receipt, all deeds and instruments left for record, . . . noting . . . the day, hour and minute when received . . . and every deed or instrument shall be considered as recorded at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the time so noted\u201d); G. L. c. 36, \u00a7 26 (\u201c[The register] shall, within twenty-four hours after a deed or other instrument which he is by law required to record has been left for record, cause . . . [the relevant information to be entered] in the appropriate index . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Legislative recognition that the lien holder who files the document (i.e., leaves it to be recorded) is not the person responsible for actually, physically recording it is also reflected in the voice of the verb forms used in \u00a7 5. In order to commence the process of enforcing his lien, the lienholder himself must take action (he \u201cshall bring his action,\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 318); however, the final step of perfecting the lien is not imposed on him as an active duty but is, rather, expressed passively \u2014 an attested copy of the complaint \u201cshall be . . . recorded\u201d \u2014 and the immediately following reference to \u00a7 9 unmistakably identifies the register as the actor obligated to perform the recording, not the lien creditor. See <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 133 (1949) (statutes to be interpreted in accordance with general rules of grammatical construction); <em>Rowley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., </em>438 Mass. 798, 802 (2003) (statute to be construed \u201c[u]sing standard rules of . . . grammar\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Moreover, such a reading of \u00a7 5 is \u201cthe only construction of the statute \u2018in harmony with common sense and sound reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen. </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 410, 415 (1983), quoting from <em>Johnson's Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 746 (1945). The only way a private party could actually cause or effect the act of recording would be by the wholly impractical (given the statutory time constraint) procedure of commencing a civil action in the nature of mandamus under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5, to compel the register to perform his ministerial duty. See <em>Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>374 Mass. 230, 233 (1978) (\u201cstatutes embodying procedural requirements should be construed, when possible, to further the statutory scheme intended by the Legislature without creating snares for the unwary\u201d); <em>EMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>433 Mass. 568, 574 (2001) (procedural statutes should be construed \u201cin a way that comports . . . with contemporary notions of . . . fundamental fairness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>National was required by G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5, to present an attested copy of the complaint to the registry with the appropriate fee so that it could be recorded within the thirty-day statutory period. This it did. There is no dispute that the registry received the complaint and recording fee on December 4, 2002, at 9:57 a.m., eight days after National had commenced its action. National was not required by the statute to file the complaint personally with the registry or to follow up on its mailed filing in person or by telephone.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Compelling a hen claimant to deliver its complaint in hand would impose an unreasonable requirement \u2014 particularly on those with offices remote from the registry or needing to make many lien filings on a regular basis \u2014 that is unsupported by the statute or by case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">A private party generally will not be penalized for an official\u2019s failure to perform his or her duty, so long as that party has taken whatever action is required by law to discharge its obligations. See <em>Orne </em>v. <em>Barstow, </em>175 Mass. 193, 196 (1900) (\u201cAs the petitioners [seeking to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien] did all that they could do, or were bound to do [by tendering the required paper and fee to the register within the statutory thirty-day period, to be recorded], the register\u2019s conduct [in refusing to accept the tendered paper] did not affect their rights\u201d); <em>L.L. Brown Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. </em>Works, 330 Mass. 496, 501 (1953) (failure of the registry of deeds to comply with all of the recording requirements of G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 63, did not invalidate the order of taking); <em>King </em>v. <em>Stephens, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 919, 920 (1980) (entry of two deeds out of sequence did not constitute a cloud on the record title when \u201cthe recording grantee has done all that he can do\u201d), quoting from 6 Powell, Real Property par. 918, at 298.2 (Rohan ed. 1979). Cf. <em>Konover Mgmt. Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Auburn, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 319, 326 (1992) (noting \u201cthe strong presumption that a public official will perform honestly and impartially and will properly discharge the duties of her office in the public interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Although it did not involve the mechanic\u2019s lien statute, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>find instructive on this issue the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s analysis in <em>L.L. Brown Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, supra. </em>The department of public works there sought to take by eminent domain three parcels of land. <em>Id. </em>at 497-498. The department sent two certified copies of the order of taking to the registry of deeds with instructions to record one copy in the registry and to file the other copy in the registered land division. <em>Id. </em>at 498. The registry received the order of taking in a timely manner and stamped the materials \u201cReceived for record\u201d and \u201cFiled.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The assistant recorder, however, failed to enter the order of taking on the daily sheet of the land registration records, as was required, and failed to enter a memorandum on the appropriate certificate of title or in any land registration record, until approximately two months later. <em>Id. </em>at 499-500. The issue for the court was whether the order of taking was filed and registered on the earlier or later date, a question of significance for the department, as a finding of the later date would invalidate the order of taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The court held that the taking was filed and registered on the earlier day, observing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">\u201cIt is the duty of the assistant recorder to comply with the statutes when a paper is offered for filing and registration. If the party presenting a paper, in this case the department, does all that is required of it to cause the paper to be filed and registered, there is no further obligation on such party to follow up or supervise the performance by the assistant recorder of his official duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 501. Similarly, in <em>King </em>v. <em>Stephens, supra, </em>we considered the question \u201c[w]hether the recording of the two deeds out of sequence constitutes a cloud on record title.\u201d 9 Mass. App. Ct. at 920. In concluding that there was \u201cgood and clear record title,\u201d we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">\u201cA deed is considered to be recorded when it is noted by the recording officer as having been received for recording, if the recording officer \u2018places upon it his certificate that it has been so received, even though he afterwards fails in his duty by recording it inaccurately ... or even by altogether suppressing it from the records, yet in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>contemplation of law the whole world has constructive notice of it, just the same as if it had been accurately copied in full upon the records.\u2019 <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>146 Mass. 610, 612 (1888).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><em>King </em>v. <em>Stephens, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Here, having presented the attested copy of the complaint to the registry for filing well within the statutory thirty-day period, National did everything it reasonably could to achieve the requisite recording, was not obligated to follow up or supervise the performance by registry officials of their duty to record the instrument in a timely manner, could properly presume that those officials would perform their duties in accordance with their statutory obligations, and did not lose its lien as a result of those officials\u2019 failure or neglect of duty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\n<em>Decision and order of the Appellate Division affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> National sent the complaint by letter dated December 2, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> Also because of the increased workload and staff reduction, it was virtually impossible at that time (according to a registry official\u2019s affidavit) to contact the registry by telephone, or even in person, to ascertain the status of a recording.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> The Appellate Division held that National had \u201ccomplied with all of its statutory obligations and had neither the duty nor ability to actually \u2018record\u2019 documents with the Registry,\u201d which alone had the statutory obligation and authority to record instruments filed with it. It rejected as an absurd and unreasonable reading of the statute the Blumes\u2019 assertion that everyone seeking to perfect a mechanic\u2019s lien had the obligation either to file in person at the registry or to follow up a mailed filing in some fashion to ensure timely recording.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\"> The only issue raised and joined below with respect to the Blumes\u2019 application to discharge National\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was whether an attested copy of National\u2019s complaint had been timely recorded, i.e., within thirty days of the commencement of the action. That was also the only issue addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and decided by the Appellate Division on the Blumes\u2019 appeal from the District Court judge\u2019s denial of their application. To the extent the Blumes attempt to argue here, essentially on their second appeal, that the complaint was also not timely \u201cfiled,\u201d we need not address the argument. See <em>Royal Indent. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 87-88 (1977); <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>391 Mass. 333, 335 (1984); <em>Amherst Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 850, 852 (1986); <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Springfield St. Ry. Co., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 912, 913 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> At the same time, our courts have acknowledged the remedial purpose underlying the statute: \u201cto provide security to contractors, subcontractors, laborers, and suppliers for the value of their services and goods provided for improving the owner\u2019s real estate.\u201d <em>Hammill-McCormick Assocs. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>399 Mass. 541, 542-543 (1987). The purpose of the filing and notice requirements in the statute is to \u201cprotect the owner and others with an interest in the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\"> Section 5 qualifies the recording requirement by the words \u201cas provided in [\u00a7 9]\u201d of c. 254. The latter section provides that \u201c[a]ny notice or any statement provided for in this chapter shall remain in the custody of the register and be open to public inspection. He shall record it in a book kept therefor, but the items of the account, except the total amount claimed due, may be omitted from the record.\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> As usual when interpreting a statute, we focus initially on the actual language used. See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983). \u201cWhere the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent,\u201d <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 285 (1996), and \u201cthe courts enforce the statute according to its [plain] wording,\u201d <em>Weitzel </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Cos., </em>417 Mass. 149, 153 (1994), unless such construction will lead to consequences that are \u201cabsurd or unreasonable,\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982), because we assume that the Legislature intended to act reasonably. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> Not only was National not required so to follow up, but the affidavit from the first assistant registrar also made plain that it was \u201chighly impracticable and improbable\u201d to contact the registry by person or by telephone to inquire about the status of a recording because of the registry\u2019s heavy workload and reduced staff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\"> Although we need go no further for the purpose of our decision, we observe that the underlying objective of the recording aspect of the statute was not thwarted in the instant circumstances. See <em>Golden </em>v. <em>General Builders Supply LLC, </em>441 Mass. 652, 659-60 (2004) (\u201cThe statute is intended to ensure \u2018that an enforcement action may readily be identified through routine title searching procedures,\u2019 . . . and it accomplishes that objective by requiring that an attested copy of the enforcement complaint be recorded within thirty days of its filing with the court\u201d). There was no suggestion of any third party being prejudiced or misled by lack of notice during the fourteen days that the complaint did not appear on the registry\u2019s books. Compare <em>L.L. Brown Paper Co., </em>330 Mass. at 502. Further, the property owners never disputed that they had timely notice of National\u2019s lien, having been served with the complaint on December 4, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
