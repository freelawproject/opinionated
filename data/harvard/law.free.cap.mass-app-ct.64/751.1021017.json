The claims arose from a collision between Pritzky\u2019s car (Pritzky drove; Capone and Kenney were passengers) and one driven by Dennis Dimeo. Dimeo\u2019s policy (with another insurer) provided liability coverage of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>accident. The three plaintiffs settled with Dimeo\u2019s insurer for $38,000, having first sought Safety\u2019s approval for a settlement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The Pritzky policy with Safety carried underinsured motorist limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. The judge accepted Safety\u2019s contention that the plaintiffs forfeited any claim they may have had for underinsured motorist coverage by settling with Dimeo\u2019s liability insurer for less than the Dimeo policy limit (i.e., $40,000). The judge relied on <em>Gleed </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>418 Mass. 503 (1994). In that opinion the court stated that \u201can insurer is not obligated to pay its insured underinsured motorist benefits until the amount of the insured\u2019s damages exceeds the automobile insurance policy limits of those legally responsible for the insured\u2019s injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510. The judge interpreted <em>Gleed </em>to mean that \u201cwhere the insured chooses to settle with a tortfeasor for less than the liability limits, he loses his right to collect underinsurance benefits from his own insurance company even if his damages are greater than the amount of the settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-20\">This is a misreading of <em>Gleed. </em>The plaintiff in <em>Gleed </em>had no claim on his underinsured motorist coverage, not because the settlement failed to exhaust the bodily injury liability limits of the responsible persons\u2019 policies (the responsible owner\u2019s limit was $25,000, the responsible driver\u2019s was $100,000, and settled with both for a total of $25,000), but because the plaintiff\u2019s bodily injury damages ($77,000, as determined by an arbitrator) were more than fully covered by the policies of the responsible driver and the owner. \u201cThe [underjinsurer is required to pay only for damages in excess of the tortfeasor\u2019s total liability coverage, and not for \u2018damages [that go] uncompensated because the insured has chosen to settle with the tortfeasor for less than the liability limits.\u2019 \u201d <em>MacInnis </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>403 Mass. 220, 227 n.13 (1988), quoting from <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Clothier, </em>338 N.W.2d 256, 261 (Minn. 1983). The plaintiff in <em>Gleed </em>was not underinsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 case stands differently. Unlike <em>deed, </em>where an arbitrator had determined the plaintiff\u2019s bodily injury damages to be $77,000, there has been no determination here of actual damages which, for purposes of decision, we must assume will exceed $40,000. By settling with Dimeo\u2019s insurer for $38,000, $2,000 less than Dimeo\u2019s liability coverage, the plaintiffs have forfeited at most<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> only that $2,000. The settlement could not prejudice Safety, whose only concern was with damages in excess of $40,000 (i.e., Dimeo\u2019s policy limit, as contrasted with the amount Dimeo\u2019s insurer paid). See <em>Gleed </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>418 Mass. at 510; G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L(2), as amended by St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 46.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Under the terms of the Safety policy, the dispute must be submitted to an arbitrator for determination of both liability (of Dimeo) and damages (of at least Pritzky and Capone).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judgment must be vacated and a new judgment entered allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 application for an order to proceed to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-36\"> The record does not show whether Safety gave its approval. Lack of such approval would go to the question whether Safety was prejudiced by the plaintiffs\u2019 having released Dimeo. See <em>MacInnis </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>403 Mass. 220, 223 (1988). Safety did not raise the issue of prejudice in its opposition to the application for arbitration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b775-11\"> The plaintiffs in their brief and oral argument in this court waived any claim to the $2,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b775-12\"> General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113L(2), provides, in relevant part, that there is coverage where the \u201cbodily injury liability bond amount or policy limit [of the responsible motorist] is less than the policy limit for [under]insured motor vehicle coverage [of the insured\u2019s policy] and is insufficient to satisfy the damages of persons insured thereunder and only to the extent that the [under-]insured motor vehicle coverage limits exceed said limits of bodily injury liability subject to the terms of the policy.\u201d The Pritzky policy states that the \u201cinjured person has a claim under [his underinsured motorist coverage] when the limits for automobile bodily injury liability insurance covering the owners and operators of the legally responsible autos are: (1) [l]ess than the limits for [the underinsured motorist coverage of the insured\u2019s policy]; and (2) [n]ot sufficient to pay for the damages sustained by the injured person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b775-13\"> Safety raised a contention in the Superior Court that Kenney could not collect on Pritzky\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage for the additional reason that he had his own policy to which he could look for such coverage. The judge did not reach the issue, and the parties do not argue it in this court. Accordingly, we do not reach the issue. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), 367 Mass. 921 (1975). This is an issue that should be resolved by the judge prior to the reference to arbitration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
