Rubeck, was convicted by a jury of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, in the Northampton District Court. She appeals, claiming that her counsel was ineffective in not requesting a jury instruction concerning the right of a parent to use reasonable force to discipline a child for the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the child\u2019s welfare. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">The incident giving rise to the complaint occurred in the waiting room of the Valley Medical Group in Florence. Rubeck, accompanied by her two year old son, drove a friend, Colleen Barber, to a medical appointment. While in the waiting room, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Rubeck\u2019s son began to misbehave. From the evidence, the jury could have found as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The child was \u201crunning around and jumping up and down and whining.\u201d Rubeck responded by yelling at the child, grabbing him, pulling him over to her and yelling in his face, saying such things as \u201cshut up, be quiet, sit down.\u201d The child responded, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna\u201d and made other \u201cwhiny\u201d statements. Rubeck put her foot on the child\u2019s foot, pulled him toward her and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop it now, we\u2019re going out to the car, and you\u2019ll be there, alone, with me.\u201d The child immediately became quiet and \u201clooked afraid.\u201d The child then resumed jumping and running; Rubeck responded by grabbing the child by the collar and yanking him toward her while saying, \u201cShut up, stop it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Rubeck then grabbed the child by the arms, shook him, and threw him down into the chair, a distance of \u201ca couple of feet.\u201d The child was thrown \u201cwith force that you don\u2019t use on a child that age,\u201d in a manner that was \u201ctoo aggressive for a two year old.\u201d The child was crying. Rubeck was yelling in a voice that became progressively louder. She appeared frustrated with the child and \u201cout of control.\u201d Patients waiting to be seen asked medical personnel at the office to intervene. Rubeck took the child outside. The police were called and responded, taking statements from several witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In Rubeck\u2019s defense, her friend, Barber, denied that Rubeck hit the child or threw the child into the chair, and stated that when Rubeck put the child in the chair, \u201cHe would get up and start acting out again, and throwing papers up in the air. . . . He just kept saying, \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to sit, Mommy.\u2019... He said no. He kept saying no, when Mommy kept saying, \u2018okay, come on, sit.\u2019 \u201d Barber further testified that Rubeck was not yelling but, rather, was \u201ctalking in a normal voice.\u201d On cross-examination, Barber denied the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Rubeck \u201cforcefully put [the child] in the chair. Threw him in the chair,\u201d stating, \u201cNo, she did not . . . she . . . put him in the chair. She didn\u2019t throw him. She said, \u2018okay, . . . here, sit.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u201cA defendant seeking a new trial based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel bears the burden to establish both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>prongs of the familiar test articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974): (i) \u2018whether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u2019; and (ii) \u2018whether [such ineffectiveness] has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 757, 760 (2002). If an alleged failure by counsel to request a jury instruction does not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, then there can be no basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 654 n.4 (2001). Failure to request the instruction did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The Legislature has not chosen to recognize or approve a parental right to use force in disciplining a child, and we know of no case in Massachusetts that specifically recognizes such a right, although there are allusions to this parental right in orneases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>445 Mass. 1003, 1004 (2005). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O'Connor, </em>407 Mass. 663, 667 (1990), the court discussed such a right, noting, however, that, as of that time, \u201c[n]o Massachusetts decision or statute grants parents or others a right to use reasonable force in disciphning a child.\u201d The court noted other jurisdictions where a common-law principle, that a parent or one standing in loco parentis is \u201cjustified in using reasonable force on the child \u2018for the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the child\u2019s welfare,\u2019 \u201d is recognized. <em>Id. </em>at 667-668, quoting from <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>State, </em>283 Md. 115, 126 (1978), and citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Rigler, </em>266 A.2d 887, 889 (Del. Super. Ct. 1970); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>452 A.2d 360, 362 (D.C. 1982); <em>People </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>130 Ill. App. 2d 933, 936-937 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Black, </em>360 Mo. 261, 268 (1950); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pittard, </em>45 N.C. App. 701, 703 (1980). Mpre recent cases have confirmed the existence of the common-law rule in some States. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>351 Ill. App. 3d 684, 688 (2004). On the civil side, the defense is also recognized. See <em>ibid., </em>quoting from Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 147(1), at 265 (1965) (\u201cA parent is privileged to apply such reasonable force . . . upon his child as he reasonably believes to be necessary for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>proper control, training, or education\u201d). Neither the validity of the defense nor its parameters were decided by the court in <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>however, as the defendant there did not make a threshold showing that he held the status of either a parent or one acting in loco parentis. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O'Connor, </em>407 Mass. at 668-669.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In an early decision, the court made oblique reference to the use of force to \u201csupport . . . the rightful authority of the father,\u201d but in that case, without further discussion, concluded that the jury could find that actions taken by the father and others to remove his daughter, then dying of consumption, from the place where she was living, were \u201cexcessive and unjustifiable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>121 Mass. 66, 69 (1876).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The right of parents to use reasonable force to discipline their children was most recently discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>442 Mass. 554, 568 n.11 (2004). There, the defendant complained that no instruction had been given regarding a parent\u2019s \u201cprivilege to use reasonable force when disciplining her children.\u201d The court held that, because the mother\u2019s abuse of her young children was so extreme that her actions could not possibly come within any privilege, no such instruction was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Social Servs., </em>430 Mass. 385, 387-388, 395 (1999), the court ruled that a parent\u2019s spanking of a nine year old child with a leather belt, delivering one or two (and no more than five) blows to the child\u2019s fully clothed buttocks in a nonviolent and controlled manner and not in anger, and leaving slightly pink marks with no bruising, combined with an explanation of the reason for the punishment and expressions of caring, did not constitute abuse as defined in the regulations of the Department of Social Services as set out in 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.00 (1996). The court noted that the regulations, promulgated pursuant to authority granted in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5 IB(8), \u201cclearly draw a line between permissible physical discipline and prohibited abuse,\u201d as the regulations clearly specify the types of physical injuries that may not be inflicted on children. <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Social Servs., </em>430 Mass. at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Instruction 3.15 of the Massachusetts Superior Court Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Practice Jury Instructions (1st Supp. 2003) proposes a jury instruction stating that \u201c[a] parent, or one acting in the position of a parent and who has assumed the responsibilities of a parent, may use reasonable force to discipline (his/her) minor child. However, a parent may not use excessive force as a means of discipline or chastisement.\u201d As to those who are not parents, but are only \u201cacting in the position of a parent,\u201d there are a variety of statutes and regulations that specifically prohibit or severely curtail the use of force as a means of discipline. See, e.g., G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37G(a) (corporal punishment of pupils in public schools prohibited); 102 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.10 (1997) (written policy of group day care or school age child care program licensee shall prohibit \u201cspanking or other corporal punishment of children\u201d); 102 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.12 (1997) (\u201cspanking or other corporal punishment\u201d must never be used to guide behavior of children in family child care and large family child care homes); 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.191 (1999) (\u201c[cjorporal punishment, including spanking,\u201d is prohibited at recreational camps for children); 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.14 (1995) (any intervention for behavior modification of mentally retarded persons that involves physical contact such as spanking, slapping, or hitting must follow special certification requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Against this backdrop, we conclude that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 299 (2002), the instruction was warranted. Here, her friend\u2019s testimony, that Rubeck did not hit or yell, talked in a normal voice, only placed her hands on the arm of the child, and put him in the chair, rather than throwing him, supports a possible conclusion that Rubeck acted reasonably in disciplining her child and bringing him under control.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">It is nonetheless arguable that the use of physical chastisement for preservation of discipline might never be justified in the case of a child of two years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, there was evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Rubeck did not use reasonable force in a calm, nonviolent and controlled manner to train or educate her two year old child, but rather that she screamed, yelled and used unreasonable force, that she was frustrated and out of control, and that the use of force escalated and continued as Rubeck grew more angry and frustrated. And, as noted, there was evidence that she stepped on her child\u2019s foot, pulled him toward her and threatened him, and grabbed him by the collar and \u201cyank[ed]\u201d him in toward her while telling him to \u201cshut up.\u201d There was further evidence that witnesses became so alarmed when Rubeck threw the child into the chair that the office medical staff was asked to intervene. Several witnesses characterized the force used as more than reasonable, and \u201cforce that you don\u2019t use on a child that age.\u201d Concern rose to the level of calling the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">While we are constrained to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to Rubeck, we conclude, nevertheless, that the omission of the jury instruction did not result in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. In closing argument, defense counsel argued forcefully that Rubeck\u2019s actions were justified as a parent trying to exercise control over her child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge charged that, in order to prove assault and battery, the Commonwealth had to show that Rubeck touched the child \u201cwithout having any right or excuse to do so.\u201d The omitted instruction, that a parent may use \u201creasonable force\u201d but not \u201cexcessive force\u201d to discipline her child, is essentially an elaboration of the \u201cright or excuse\u201d that was included in the judge\u2019s charge. As given, the instruction included all the elements of the charged offense, and did not have the effect of shifting the burden of proof to the defendant. Thus, there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zaccagnini, </em>383 Mass. 615, 616, 618 (1981). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Colon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>52 Mass. App. Ct. 725, 731 (2001) (substantial risk of miscarriage of justice where essential element of charged offense omitted from jury instructions). Counsel was thus not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> \u201cThe use of physical force [in chastisement] by a parent is privileged only when it is used for the \u2018training or education of the child or for the preservation of discipline.\u2019 (Restatement, Torts 2d, \u00a7 151 [(1965)].) When the child does not have the capacity to understand or appreciate the correction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>value of the training, education or discipline is lost upon him and, therefore, the parental privilege of the use of physical force is negated.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Matter of Rodney C., </em>91 Misc. 2d 677, 680-681 (N.Y. Fam. Ct. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\"> Rubeck does not claim error in failing to request the instruction based on physical contact necessary to restrain the child from interfering with others in the waiting room or to prevent him from engaging in dangerous conduct. In any event, counsel\u2019s argument and the judge\u2019s charge would adequately cover any such physical contact here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
