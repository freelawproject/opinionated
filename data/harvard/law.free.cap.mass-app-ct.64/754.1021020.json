L. c. 91, \u00a7 18, and 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.17(1) (2000). Waterside and the department filed a joint motion to dismiss, claiming that the plaintiffs lacked standing. An administrative law judge issued a recommended final decision, allowing the joint motion to dismiss, and also issued a recommended ruling denying reconsideration of that decision, both of which became final by the approval of the department\u2019s commissioner. Claiming errors of law in the final agency decision, the plaintiffs sought certiorari<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and declaratory relief, and review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), but a judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings and affirmed the decision of the department. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">As noted by the administrative law judge, \u201cG. L. c. 91 charges the Department with protecting the Commonwealth\u2019s interests in its harbors, tidelands, and waters and with acting as a steward of the public\u2019s interest in those lands.\u201d See G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 2; 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.01(2) (2000). The license the plaintiffs oppose is for a nonwater-dependent use<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> pursuant to G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18. That section also provides that a \u201cperson aggrieved by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>decision by the department to grant a license . . . shall have the right to an adjudicatory hearing in accordance with chapter thirty A.\u201d G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18, as amended by St. 1983, c. 589, \u00a7 26. Extensive regulations, not challenged by the plaintiffs, define \u201caggrieved person\u201d and contain other provisions relevant to the determination of standing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">\u201cAggrieved Person means any person who, because of a decision by the Department to grant a license or permit, may suffer an injury in fact, which is different either in kind or magnitude, from that suffered by the general public and which is within the scope of the public interests protected by [G. L.] c. 91 and c. 21A.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.02 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"AYy2\">The persons who have the right to an adjudicatory hearing are listed in 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.17(1) (2000) and include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-16\">\u201c(b) any person, aggrieved by the decision of the Department to grant a license or permit who has submitted written comments within the public comment period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-17\">It is conceded that the plaintiffs fulfilled all applicable procedural requirements, and the only issue before us is whether the plaintiffs are aggrieved persons under the Waterways Act, G. L. c. 91. Accordingly, we do not discuss their substantive claims in opposition to the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-18\">The plaintiffs rely on the following claims of harm to confer standing: (1) as abutters they will suffer an injury that is different in kind or magnitude from that suffered by the general public and that is within the scope of the public interest protected by c. 91; (2) the hotel will block the view of the tide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>lands they enjoy from their private offices, and will also impede their view as they travel to their offices and around the waterfront, an area they travel more frequently than the general public; and (3) the project will create severe traffic problems and will result in parking on the abutters\u2019 property because there will be people unable to find parking in public spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">There was no error in rejecting these claims as conferring standing. Abutters do not receive special status for purposes of standing under the regulations. Rather, for persons in the circumstances of the plaintiffs, standing depends on whether they are persons aggrieved as defined in 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 9.02 and 9.17(1)(b), quoted above. <em>In the Matter of Lipkin, </em>2 DEP Rep. 249, 250 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The plaintiffs fare no better on the claims concerning interference with their views of the tidelands. While the impact on their views from their private offices differs in kind or magnitude from that of the general public, the administrative law judge correctly ruled that this is not an interest that the statute protects. Rather, the statute protects for water-dependent purposes the public\u2019s interest in views from public places, such as parks and esplanades. See note 7, <em>supra, </em>quoting from 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.12(2)(a); 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.51(2) (2000), a portion of which is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>While accepting the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true, the administrative law judge rejected, as matter of law, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that their more frequent travel in the waterfront area differs in kind or magnitude from that of the general public.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Such a determination (i.e., that seeing the view more frequently because of workplace proximity to the proposed project is, as matter of law, not a difference in kind or magnitude of injury within the meaning of 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.02) is not an \u201cinterpretation [that] is patently wrong, unreasonable, arbitrary, whimsical or capricious.\u201d The determination is, hence, not to be disturbed. <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>431 Mass. 9, 17 (2000), quoting from <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Envtl. Quality Engr., </em>398 Mass. 404, 414 (1986).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">As the department and the Superior Court correctly ruled, the plaintiffs\u2019 third claim of injury, traffic and parking problems, did not state a protected interest. The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.51(1) (2000), set forth in part in the margin, is misplaced.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The consideration of \u201ctraffic flows and parking needs\u201d in developing the project must only be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>into account to prevent conflict in operation between the users of facilities of private tenancy and \u201cthose of any water-dependent facility which reasonably can be expected to locate on or near the project site.\u201d Assuming, contrary to the contention of Waterside, that the project includes facilities of private tenancy (e.g., the offices in the Atkinson building, see note 5, <em>supra), </em>the plaintiffs are not protected against traffic and parking problems, as the plaintiffs\u2019 property is not a water-dependent facility. Nor is there anything in the record suggesting that the plaintiffs alleged to the administrative law judge that they are likely participants in \u201cany water-dependent facility which reasonably can be expected to locate on or near the project site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The plaintiffs, presumably in an effort to show that the present decision of the department was arbitrary or capricious, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), argue that the decision was inconsistent with previous cases of the department, specifically, <em>In the Matter of Town of Hull, </em>2 DEP Rep. 160 (1995); <em>In the Matter of Pamet Harbor Yacht Club, Inc., </em>6 DEP Rep. 11 (1999); and <em>In the Matter of Cambridge Research Park, LLP, </em>7 DEP Rep. 66 (2000). The administrative law judge analyzed each of the cases and found them to be consistent with the present decision. We have read these cases, all of which involve water-dependent petitioners, and consider that they may reasonably be distinguished from this case and are not inconsistent with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>13</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b777-6\"> The Department of Environmental Protection decided not to issue the license until the resolution of an appeal by the plaintiffs of the local zoning approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\"> The project, which is to replace a structure used as a flea market, also includes, inter alla, a restaurant, a building (Atkinson building) with retail space on the first floor and offices on the two upper floors, associated parking, roadways, and pathways.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\"> On appeal, the plaintiffs have not pursued their certiorari claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\"> A definition of water-dependent uses was added to G.

Regs. \u00a7 9.12(1) (2000), any project not classified as a water-dependent project or accessory to such a project shall be classified as a nonwater-dependent project. Although Waterside\u2019s license covered some water-dependent uses, the department treated the whole project as nonwaterdependent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b778-31\"> The administrative law judge noted that the citation to G.

As before, I assumed the [plaintiffs\u2019] allegations to be true. However, I rejected their claim because their injury is no different in kind or magnitude from that of the general public.
