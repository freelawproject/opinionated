Civ.R 60(b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), in October, 2001, which was allowed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse on the grounds that the filing of the motion was not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>Procedural facts. </em>The complaint in this matter was filed on November 21, 1997. The plaintiff alleged, in general terms, that he had lent various large sums of money to the defendant over time, which the defendant had failed to repay. The defendant was duly served and failed to file an answer or otherwise plead. As a result, the court issued an order defaulting the defendant on April 15, 1998. The plaintiff\u2019s request to assess damages was heard on July 15, 1998. An attorney filed an appearance on behalf of the defendant and a motion to continue the hearing on assessment of damages, stating that he had not had adequate time to review the claims and investigate the matter to determine the full extent of the defendant\u2019s defenses. That motion was denied after a hearing and the hearing on assessment of damages proceeded. As a result, damages were assessed and a final default judgment was entered on July 17, 1998, against the defendant in the amount of $494,050.65 with interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No appeal was taken from any action of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">On November 25, 1998, the plaintiff\u2019s motion to charge a trustee process defendant was allowed. The plaintiff obtained an execution on January 6, 1999. On February 19, 1999, the plaintiff sent the defendant a letter telling him he planned to vigorously pursue collection of the judgment. The defendant had become embroiled in an unrelated domestic relations matter and filed financial statements in the Probate and Family Court that reflected the debt represented by the default judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">On February 28, 2001, the plaintiff instituted supplementary process proceedings in the Brookline Division of the District Court Department to collect on the default judgment. The court ordered the defendant to pay certain amounts in the course of that proceeding, totaling approximately $32,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">On October 4, 2001, the defendant\u2019s attorney filed a \u201cMotion to Remove Judgment and/or Request for Independent Action.\u201d There was some skirmishing over the right to file additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>papers in support of and in opposition to the motion during October, 2001. Eventually the defendant obtained the services of a new law firm and succeeded in filing additional papers in support of his motion to vacate judgment. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate on February 26, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\"><em>Other facts and contentions. </em>The defendant, a physician, first met the plaintiff, an attorney, in 1987. The defendant retained the plaintiff for an unrelated legal matter involving a landlord-tenant dispute. The plaintiff soon learned about the defendant\u2019s diamond mining business (business) in the Democratic Republic of Congo. On January 23, 1989, the plaintiff lent the defendant $7,000 for housing expenses. The plaintiff began to send the defendant large amounts of money for purposes related to the business. The first large payment occurred on February 28, 1989, when the plaintiff wired the defendant $125,000. One month later, on March 22, 1989, the parties signed a contract drafted by the plaintiff, interpretation of which is at the heart of the appeal relating to the entry of summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Throughout 1989, the plaintiff continued to send money to the defendant and pay for his travel expenses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In November, 1989, the plaintiff and the defendant had a meeting during which, according to the plaintiff, the defendant said he would pay the plaintiff $500,000. The defendant allegedly continued to make promises to pay the plaintiff until December, 1996, but the promises did not materialize into payment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the defendant failed to pay the plaintiff, the plaintiff assisted the defendant on other unrelated legal matters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the meantime, the plaintiff wrote the defendant three letters, dated August 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>1990; March 11, 1994; and January 4, 1997, registering his disappointment at the defendant\u2019s failure to pay him and his plans to take appropriate legal action if payment was not forthcoming. On November 21, 1997, the plaintiff filed a verified complaint in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>In order to justify relief under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b), the party seeking relief must show not only that relief is justified under the rule but also that relief was sought in a timely way. See <em>Parrell </em>v. Keenan, 389 Mass. 809, 815 (1983). The time within which relief must be sought depends in turn on the grounds upon which relief is justified.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, if relief is sought for reasons falling under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(l)-(3) it must be sought within one year. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b) (\u201cThe motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons [1], [2], and [3] not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken\u201d). If relief is sought under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), it must be sought within a \u201creasonable time.\u201d <em>Struett </em>v. <em>Arlington Trust Co., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 152, 155-156 (1986). See <em>Marderosian </em>v. <em>Shamshak, </em>170 F.R.D. 335, 338-339 (D. Mass. 1997) (reasonable time under rule 60[b][6] may be more or less than one-year period established for filing under rule 60[b][l]-[3]).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, there is one other principle at work. If the claim falls within rule 60(b)(l)-(5), it cannot also be characterized as \u201cany other reason justifying relief\u201d under rule 60(b)(6) in order to extend the time from one year to a \u201creasonable time.\u201d <em>Chavoor </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>383 Mass. 801, 805-806 (1981). Rule 60(b)(6) cannot be used as a false cover in order to avoid the one-year time limitation appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>cable to the reasons stated in rule 60(b)(1)-(3). See <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. at 815 n.7 (\u201c[t]he reason for relief set forth in Rule 60[b][l] cannot be the basis for relief under Rule 60[b][6]\u201d); <em>Tibbitts </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 729, 734 (1989) (\u201ctime limits on a [b][l] or [b][3] motion may not be extended by the expedient of bringing it under [b][6]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Thus, we must analyze the grounds upon which relief from judgment is sought in this case. If those grounds fall within Mass.R.Civ.R 60(b)(l)-(3), the relevant time period is one year. If the grounds are alleged to be under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), the relevant time is a \u201creasonable time,\u201d but grounds that fall under rule 60(b)(l)-(3) cannot be characterized as falling under rule 60(b)(6) in order to extend the relevant time from one year to a \u201creasonable time.\u201d <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. at 814-815. Furthermore, the court will analyze the facts to determine whether the claim for relief is based on rule 60(b)(1)-(3) and will not be bound by the characterization of the claim by the moving party. <em>Honer </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 291, 294 (1999) (\u201c[cjourts may determine whether and under what section relief might be granted; the label attached to the motion is not dispositive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In the present case, the gravamen of the defendant\u2019s claim to be entitled to relief from the default judgment is that the plaintiff lulled him into not defending the claim. He relies more particularly on the fact that he was in an attorney-client relationship with the plaintiff and consequently relied on advice he received from the plaintiff not to answer the complaint or mount any defense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This is clearly an allegation of \u201cmisconduct of an adverse party,\u201d which brings this case squarely under rule 60(b)(3).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Tibbitts </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 731; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number><em>Honer </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. at 294. Thus, Mass.R. Civ.R 60(b)(6) does not apply and the one-year time limit operates.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Unless some other principle intervenes, the defendant\u2019s failure to bring his motion within one year of the entry of the default judgment requires that the motion be denied. Cf. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Worcester Redev. Authy., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 454, 462 n.10 (2001), quoting from <em>Peak </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transit Authy., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 729 (1985) (rule 60[b][1] motion brought within one year of judgment after rescript, which resulted in an affirmance without change, was not timely because \u201cdate of judgment is the date judgment originally entered in the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\"><em>Excuse for not acting within one year of default judgment. A </em>strict reading of Mass.R.Civ.R 60(b)(3) would require the defendant\u2019s motion to be denied as not brought within one year of the default judgment. See <em>Struett </em>v. <em>Arlington Trust Co., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 155-156. Yet, the essence of the misconduct alleged was the misuse of the plaintiff\u2019s position as attorney for the defendant, albeit in other unrelated matters, which not only induced the defendant not to answer the complaint but also induced the defendant to abandon, at least initially, his request to remove the default or to provide a defense to the amount of damages that should be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that he was lulled into inaction by the plaintiff\u2019s conduct past February, 1999, when the plaintiff sent a strongly worded letter asserting his intention to collect on the default judgment. The defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>own financial statements filed thereafter in the domestic relations case clearly acknowledge his understanding of the debt, its magnitude, and its reality. Cf. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Worcester Redev. Authy., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. at 461 (record demonstrates that relevant facts and law \u201cwere known or knowable\u201d by the parties). February, 1999, is far more than one year prior to October 4, 2001, when the defendant filed his motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus any tolling argument that might find life under analogous legal doctrines<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> would not yield relief for the defendant on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">\u201cA motion under Rule 60 is addressed to the trial judge\u2019s judicial discretion, and is generally not reviewable except for a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Civil Procedure, at 1071 (LexisNexis 2004). See <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. at 815; <em>Tai </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 220, 224 (1998). A judge does not have discretion to extend the strict time limits prescribed by the rule. See <em>Chavoor </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>383 Mass. at 803 (the <em>\u201cone-year time limit </em>cannot be extended\u201d). Thus, the usual discretion afforded to a judge\u2019s assessment of the merits of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>claim to be relieved from judgment does not operate where the issue is, as here, one of law, i.e., the consideration of what time limits govern the filing of a motion under rule 60(b)(l)-(3). See <em>id. </em>at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\"><em>Other arguments. </em>The defendant proposes that we review this matter on the footing of an \u201cindependent action.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While abolishing many forms of action previously used to vacate a judgment, rule 60(b) permits the court to hear an independent action based upon its inherent equity power. Although rule 60(b) specifies no time limitation for relief, presumably the concept of reasonableness applies. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Civil Procedure, at 1074; <em>Sahin </em>v. <em>Sahin, </em>435 Mass. 396, 400-401 (2001). Similar to a rule 60(b)(6) motion, an independent action may not be used to avoid the strict one-year time limit applied to claims that actually fall within reasons stated in rule 60(b)(1)-(3). See <em>id. </em>at 401. We see no basis for an independent action in the allegations brought forth in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Similar to independent actions, rule 60(b) also permits, without time limits, an action alleging fraud on the court. <em>Winthrop Corp. </em>v. <em>Lowenthal, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 183 (1990). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The allegations relating to the plaintiff\u2019s actions in this case do not sink to the level required to find fraud on the court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate judgment is reversed and the original judgment for the plaintiff is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-17\"> Subsequently, the defendant prevailed on a motion for summary judgment.

On January 3, 1995, the plaintiff helped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>obtain the defendant\u2019s green card from the lawyer for the defendant\u2019s ex-wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\"> Rule 60(b) states: \u201cOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; ... (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;... (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\"> Massachusetts courts construe the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure similarly to the parallel Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201cabsent compelling reasons to the contrary or significant differences in content.\u201d <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. at 815 n.8, quoting from <em>Rollins Envtl.

App. Ct. 426, 428 n.7, 432 (1979) (discussing what neglectful conduct of an attorney will be excusable and setting forth factors to consider under rule 60[b][l] motions); <em>Honer </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>48 Mass.

There, the defendant police chief was represented at a jury trial of a wrongful discharge claim by the same attorney who represented the town, a codefendant. <em>Id. </em>at 337. The attorney failed to bring out at trial that he had advised the chief that the discharge of the plaintiff was appropriate, which testimony could have exonerated the chief but not the town. <em>Id. </em>at 338. The \u201cwrongdoing\u201d was not, thus, that of an adverse party but of defendant\u2019s own counsel in the lawsuit in question, who was also counsel for a potentially adverse party.

The doctrine embraces only that species of fraud which does, or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery can not perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication. A party seeking to demonstrate fraud on the court must prove the most egregious conduct involving a corruption of the judicial process itself. Examples are bribery of judges, employment of counsel to \u2018influence\u2019 the court, bribery of the jury, and the involvement of an attorney (an officer of the court) in the perpetration of fraud. Conduct such as nondisclosure to the adverse party or the court of facts pertinent to the matter before it, without more, does not constitute fraud on the court for proposes of setting aside a judgment under rule 60(b).\u201d <em>Sahin </em>v. <em>Sahin, </em>435 Mass. at 405-406 (quotations and citations omitted).
