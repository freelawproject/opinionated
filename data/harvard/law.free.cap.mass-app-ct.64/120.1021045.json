The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief on a preliminary and permanent basis. Their request for preliminary injunctive relief was consolidated with a jury-waived trial on the merits; the trial judge declared the regulation invalid and, in essence, permanently enjoined the town from enforcing the regulation. The town now appeals, claiming that the judge erred in declaring the regulation invalid because it is rationally related to the protection of public health and safety. We agree and vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AACg\"><em>Background. </em>The town is located on the western side of the Wachusett Reservoir, which supplies water to the greater Boston area through the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority (MWRA) and is managed and maintained by the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aef\">In the early 1990\u2019s, the MDC conducted and commissioned several studies of the watershed area, revealing significant water quality problems in the brook tributary to the reservoir. The studies recommended the development of a sewer system that would service certain areas of West Boylston generating wastewater that was not adequately serviced by septic systems. Additional studies of the watershed and of groundwater pollutian were conducted through the late 1990\u2019s and into 2002, assessing whether property in certain areas of the town could be brought into compliance with Title 5 septic system regulations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or would require connection to the sewer system.</p>\n<p id=\"AVO\">At town meetings in October, 1995; May, 1997; and October, 1997, town residents voted to borrow money, assess betterments, establish a mechanism for collecting unpaid sewer fees, establish a board of sewer commissioners, and offer low interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>loans for the upgrade of septic systems and sewer connections. By 2001, however, the nascent sewer system was encountering considerable financial difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Although the town\u2019s sewer system had initially been intended for use in areas where Title 5 compliance could not be achieved, the town, in May of 2002, sought to cast a wider net by adopting a by-law, pursuant to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21, requiring the owners of abutting properties generating wastewater to connect to the public sewer. Town residents, however, voted not to adopt the by-law at the May 20, 2002, annual town meeting. Two weeks later, the board of selectmen met to discuss the situation and, at that June 1, 2002, meeting, decided to meet with the board of health and draft for it a mandatory sewer connection regulation. Several such meetings thereafter took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-17\">A public hearing on the proposed board of health regulation took place on August 28, 2002, in which town residents voiced their concerns. Nonetheless, the board of health adopted the mandatory sewer connection regulation on September 25, 2002, to take effect on January 2, 2003.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-22\">The plaintiff homeowners then brought this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. More specifically, they sought (1) an order that the town and the board of health cease enforcing the mandatory sewer connection regulation; (2) a declaratian that the board of health had adopted the regulation based on impermissible criteria and without authority; (3) an order enjoining the town\u2019s selectmen from unlawfully interfering with the board of health in the future; and (4) a prehminary injunctian enjoining enforcement of the regulation during the course of the litigation. Since the parties appeared to be in agreement on the essential facts, the judge ordered the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>of the application for preliminary injunctive relief pursuant to the provisions of Mass.R.Civ.P. 65(b)(2), 365 Mass. 833 (1974). After a jury-waived trial, the judge concluded that the challenged mandatory sewer connection regulation was unrelated to public health and safety; he accordingly declared it invalid and, in essence, permanently enjoined the board of health from enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The town filed a notice of appeal on November 26, 2003. On December 18, 2003, it filed a motion to alter or amend, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.R 59(e), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), and a motion to stay the judgment pending appeal, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 62(c), 365 Mass. 830 (1974). Both motions were denied on March 8, 2004. On April 8, 2004, an \u201camended notice of appeal\u201d was entered on the docket stating that the town was amending \u201cthe Notice of Appeals to the Appeals Court from the judgment of [the Superior Court] dated October 31, 2003 . . . to also include appeal of [the Superior Court\u2019s] March 8, 2004, denial of defendant\u2019s Motion to Alter or Amend and Motion for Stay Pending Appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\"><em>Compliance with Mass.R.A.P. 4(a). </em>The plaintiffs contend that this appeal should be dismissed for failure to comply with Mass. R.A.P. 4(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> asserting that the April 8, 2004, amended notice of appeal was a nullity, as the underlying November 26, 2003, notice of appeal was extinguished when the town filed its December 18, 2003, motions. They argue that the town should have filed a new notice of appeal subsequent to the denial of its December 18, 2003, motions, but did not do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Case law is clear that rule 4(a) \u201cmeant what it said viz., a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>premature notice of appeal \u2018shall have no effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 634 (1986), quoting from <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 61 (1982). Appellate courts must \u201cgive unqualified effect to the language\u201d of rule 4(a), which instructs that \u201can appeal founded on a notice of appeal filed prior to disposition of a postjudgment motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(b), 52(b) or 59 is a nullity and shall be dismissed.\u201d <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 299, 302 (1985). The rule is premised on the \u201cundesirability of having a case proceed along the appellate path on the basis of a judgment that might be modified. Such a state of affairs was, at best, disorderly, and at worst, it was likely to provoke mischief if a trial court and an appellate court possessed power to modify the same judgment.\u201d <em>Finn </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 369 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-18\">We are persuaded that the April 8, 2004, notice filed by the town was a new notice of appeal that satisfied the requirements of rule 4(a). Although the town might well have been more clear in the language it used (describing it as an \u201camended notice of appeal\u201d rather than as a new notice of appeal), this linguistic shortcoming is not dispositive in the circumstances. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>391 Mass. 517, 520 (1984) (\u201cit is not fair to prevent the parties\u2019 exercise of. . . appellate rights on the basis of clerical niceties\u201d). The town\u2019s April 8, 2004, notice clearly and expressly referenced the final judgments from which appeal was being taken, thereby putting the parties and the court on notice of the judgments from which the town appealed. We think it of particular importance that the April 8, 2004, notice was filed subsequent to the filing and denial of the December 18, 2003, motions. Contrast <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Blackburn, supra </em>at 634-635; <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 993, 994 (1990); <em>West Springfield </em>v. <em>Olympic Lounge, Inc., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 923 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-36\"><em>Analysis. </em>The mandatory sewer connection regulation adopted by the board of health \u201cstands on the same footing as would a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>statute,\u201d and the reviewing court must make all rational presumptions in favor of its validity. <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 138 (1949). A party challenging such a regulation must prove that it \u201cis illegal, arbitrary, or capricious,\u201d and must establish the \u201cabsence of any conceivable grounds upon which the [regulation] may be upheld.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Fedn. of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 771 (2002), quoting from <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 722, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Formaldehyde Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Frechette, </em>464 U.S. 936 (1983). The plaintiffs cannot meet this burden by \u201carguing [, as they do,] that the record does not affirmatively show facts that support the regulation.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 776 (1980). \u201cRather, \u2018we must apply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action and not declare it void unless its provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be intejqrreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In reviewing the regulation, we are \u201cnot concerned whether there was substantial evidence in a record before the agency, but rather. . . whether, based solely on the record <em>made in court, </em>the adoption of the agency regulation was illegal, arbitrary, or capricious\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Tri-Nel Mgmt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barnstable, </em>433 Mass. 217, 219-220 (2001), quoting from <em>Massachusetts State Pharmaceutical Assn. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>387 Mass. 122, 126 (1982). We may consider \u201crelevant information, including that provided in the briefs in determining whether there was a rational basis\u201d for the regulation. <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 725 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Our review of a regulation, then, is not like our review of the outcome of an administrative hearing, and we may not \u201ccheck back on the agency\u2019s \u2018reasons\u2019 and \u2018determination[s]\u2019 of fact and law[, as it] would have an unhealthy tendency to substitute the court for the agency as a policymaker.\u201d <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>363 Mass 474, 491 (1973). \u201c[A] regulation that is irreconcilable with an agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>enabling legislation,\u201d however, may not stand. <em>Massachusetts Fedn. of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., supra </em>at 771-772, quoting from <em>Quincy </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Water Resources Auth., </em>421 Mass. 463, 468 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The board of health adopted the present regulation under the authority of G.

App. Ct. 420, 423 (1996). \u201cHealth regulations have a strong presumption of validity .... A court may invalidate the regulation only when there is no rational relation between [it] and its stated public health purpose.\u201d <em>Tri-Nel Mgmt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barnstable, supra </em>at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">The stated health purpose of the challenged regulation is \u201cthe protection of the public health, safety, welfare and environment and for the further purpose of ensuring the protection of the Wachusett Reservoir, a public water supply.\u201d To prevail in their challenge, the plaintiffs must prove that the sewer regulation lacks any nexus with public health and safety. They contend in this regard that Title 5 compliant septic systems, such as the ones servicing their property, pose no danger to the public health or safety. Even if they were to have established that presently compliant systems pose no such danger, however, the regulation will not be invalidated if there is a \u201cconceivable ground\u201d upon which the board could rationally have concluded that Title 5 compliant systems may nonetheless represent a danger to public health and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"A4x\">In his affidavit, Robert Barrell, chairman of the board of health, stated that \u201c[according to John Scannell and Patricia Austin of the MDC, who met with the board of health on April 9, 2003, even an on-site septic system that passes a Title 5 inspection can contribute pollution to the groundwater due to a hidden failure when the soil below the system stops providing appropriate treatment for septage.\u201d We note that Title 5 requires that septic systems be evaluated only in connection with the transfer of a property serviced by such a system. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.301(1) (1995).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Further, Joseph M. McGinn, director of the division of watershed management of the MDC, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>stated in a letter to the board of health that \u201c[t]he second major reason for compelling the earliest connection of other properties to the sewer is to reverse as quickly as possible the continuing degradation and pollution of the ground and surface waters of the Wachusett Reservoir watershed by inadequate septic systems . . . .\u201d Given this, the board of health could plausibly have adopted the challenged mandatory sewer connection regulation based on the logic that, over time, a once compliant system could become a noncompliant, failing system, that the failure might well remain undetected for some period of time, and that the undetected failing system would, until detected and brought back into compliance, contribute to pollution. This constitutes a \u201cconceivable ground\u201d upon which the board of health could properly have based its adoption of the mandatory sewer connection regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-18\">Relying on <em>Home Builders Assn. of Cape Cod, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Commn., </em>441 Mass. 724 (2004), and <em>Hamel </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Edgartown, supra, </em>the plaintiffs contend that the MDC studies did not provide the board of health with sufficient scientific basis upon which to base the mandatory sewer regulation. To be sure, the two cases upon which the plaintiffs rely do draw more precise connections between the scientific studies conducted and the challenged regulations than are present here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such level of precision is not, however, the prerequisite for promulgation of a regulation that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>appear to suggest. A board of health is permitted to take preventative action in order to preserve the public health and safety; it is not required to \u201cwait until the danger materializes\u201d before taking action. <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. at 727 n.19. Nor is it incumbent upon a board of health before taking such action to demand unqualified scientific proof as to its efficiency. <em>Ibid. </em>(\u201cSome doubts [about] whether [a particular type of insulation] properly installed in houses will cause the symptoms characteristic of exposure to formaldehyde will not stay the commissioner\u2019s hand\u201d). Lack of such level of scientific proof does not prevent regulatory action. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leis, </em>355 Mass. 189, 195 (1969). Moreover, as previously discussed, the board of health was required only to have a \u201cconceivable basis\u201d for its action; this it had. The plaintiffs had the burden of showing the absence of a rational relationship between the regulation and public health and safety; this they did not do. Their reliance on <em>Home Builders </em>and <em>Hamel </em>is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The plaintiffs also contend that the subjective motivations of the members of the board of health should be taken into account in determining whether the reasons that the board of health supplied for adopting the mandatory sewer connection regulation were only a pretext. They argue that the real reason for the regulation is the financial difficulties that the town faced in connection with the new sewer system and not genuine public health concerns. Be this as it may, because we have concluded that a nexus between the regulation and public health existed, we need not consider the motives of the board of health. See <em>Massachusetts Fedn. of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>at 776-777 (\u201cWhere statutory language clearly authorizes actions taken by an agency, the actions are wholly lawful, and we need not look behind them to determine the agency\u2019s motives\u201d). Moreover, we are unaware of any controlling precedent in which a regulation was invalidated by virtue of the improper motivation of the agency that adopted it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Given our conclusion that the challenged regulation is valid, it is unnecessary for us to address the remaining issues raised by the town.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment is vacated and a new judgment shall enter declaring that the mandatory sewer connection regulation promulgated by the town\u2019s board of health is rationally related to the protection of public health and safety and is, therefore, valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A5d\"> Effective July 1, 2003, pursuant to <em>G. </em>L. c. 21, \u00a7 1, the MDC merged with the former Department of Environmental Management to become the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR).

Hence, the studles did not draw the precise connection between the proposed regulation and such compliant systems that might well have been preferable. Nonetheless, there was evidence in studies before the board of health that supported the adoption of a mandatory sewer connection regulation based on public health and safety concerns. In the MDC\u2019s \u201cWatershed Protection Plan Update\u201d of July 31, 1998, referenced in the July 1, 2002, letter to the board of health from John Westerling, the town\u2019s superintendent of services and drains, the assessment was that \u201c[o]n-site wastewater disposal systems continue to represent a potential source of pathogens and other pollutants of concern to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the water supply. . . . [Tjhese pollutants may eventually appear as surface water pollution in the tributaries throughout the watershed system and/or migrate via groundwater pathways.\u201d In addition, a different study referenced in the same letter to the board of health, \u201cEnvironmental Quality Assessment Report, Reservoir District, 2002,\u201d concluded that \u201cpollutants from failing septic systems . . . have been . . . causing] severe impacts to the macroinvertebrate community .... It is expected that sewers will significantly improve water quality in the near future once installation and connections are completed.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 critique of such studies does not, in any event, further their cause, as they cannot prevail simply by arguing that the record does not affirmatively show facts that support the regulation.

App. Ct. 679, 684 (1987), pertains only to the denial of an individual zoning application and not to a regulation of general application. It is not on point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b152-10\"> It is also unnecessary for us to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the regulation is improper because it did not provide for a variance mechanism. We express no opinion on this issue because the issue was not raised in the Superior Court proceedings and is not properly before us.
