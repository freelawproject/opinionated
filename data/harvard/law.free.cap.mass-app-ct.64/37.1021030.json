L. c. 254, \u00a7 4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>: Does a subcontractor\u2019s transportation and delivery of a large piece of equipment (a used transformer owned by a nuclear power plant) to the power plant site and the placement of that equipment by the subcontractor onto a concrete pad, where it was stored as spare or backup equipment for possible future use at the power plant, constitute an \u201cimprovement of real property\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>entitling the subcontractor to the statutory lien? A judge of the Superior Court concluded that it does not. We agree and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><em>Factual background. </em>The underlying facts are not in dispute. The defendant, Entergy Nuclear Generation Company (Entergy), a Delaware corporation, operates the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station (power plant) in Plymouth. In December, 2000, Entergy purchased a piece of equipment known as a transformer from a company called NSTAR to serve as a spare or backup transformer in the event the transformer currently in use at the power plant should need repair or become inoperable. A transformer is a large (twelve feet wide by twenty-one feet long by twenty-two feet high) and extremely heavy (376 tons) steel box that is essential to the operation of the power plant. Its purpose, when connected to the power plant\u2019s generator, is to increase the voltage of the electricity, produced by the generator at 22.8 kilovolts, to 345 kilovolts, at which voltage the electricity is transferred to various substations, where it is again transformed and distributed to the power plant\u2019s customers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In November, 2001, Entergy contracted with Ohio Transformer, Inc. (Ohio Transformer),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to pick up the transformer Entergy had purchased almost a year earlier, which was then located at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford, Connecticut, deliver it to the power plant, set it on an existing concrete storage pad near (but not next to or connected to) the generator, and \u201cdress\u201d it. (\u201cDressing\u201d a transformer is a process of putting it in a state of readiness for use and involves attaching various pumps, fans, bushings, and other components to it and filling it with 17,000 gallons of mineral oil.) Entergy agreed to pay Ohio Transformer $520,463 for transporting, delivering, and dressing the transformer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ohio Transformer, in turn, subcontracted with the plaintiff, Mammoet USA, Inc. (Mam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>meet)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> later in November, 2001, to \u201ctransport transformer from Millstone Power Plant via track and barge to Pilgrim Power Plant and set on pad,\u201d for which Ohio Transformer agreed to pay Mammoet $312,640.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Mammoet completed its performance of those services on or about December 1, 2001. Although it did not \u201cdress\u201d the transformer as part of its contractual obligations with Ohio Transformer,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mammoet \u201crough-set\u201d it onto a concrete storage pad located at the power plant. This rough-setting process required a high degree of sophistication and expertise in engineered heavy lifting.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the transformer was brought to the power plant for the purpose of serving as a spare transformer, it was not connected to the generator at the time of the delivery and rough-setting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Entergy paid Ohio Transformer in full for the services performed by Ohio Transformer and Mammoet. Before Mammoet was paid pursuant to its subcontract with Ohio Transformer, however, Ohio Transformer filed for bankruptcy and never paid Mammoet anything. Mammoet then commenced the instant action against Entergy seeking to enforce the mechanic\u2019s lien it had established by filings in the Plymouth County registry of deeds in February, 2002, to recover the $312,640 it was owed for the services it had performed in picking up and delivering the transformer and rough-setting it onto the storage pad at the power plant. On Entergy\u2019s motion, a judge of the Superior Court discharged Mammoet\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien and granted Entergy summary judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>Mammoet claims that the judge erred in failing to recognize that it was entitled to protection under the mechanic\u2019s lien statute<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because it \u201cfurnished labor or materials in connection with the improvement to [Entergy\u2019s] real property\u201d and \u201cimproved the value of\u201d that property. Entergy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>counters that Mammoet merely transported a piece of Entergy\u2019s personal property from one location to another, where it is kept in storage as spare equipment. That does not, Entergy argues, satisfy the statutory requirement of being engaged in work related to an \u201cimprovement of real property,\u201d but rather constituted work no different in kind than delivering a backup computer for Entergy to keep in reserve on a shelf in a storeroom in case its functioning computer fails. Neither party benefits from any Massachusetts appellate decision construing the term \u201cimprovement\u201d as used in the statute, which we are therefore obliged to address.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">As always in such matters, our goal is to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent in using that term, and any analysis must begin with the actual language of the statute. Unfortunately, the term is undefined in the statute, and we know of no pertinent legislative history to assist us. The words of the statute nonetheless do afford helpful insight.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The familiar rule of construction known as ejusdem generis is applicable and indicates a more limited contextual meaning for a word that in isolation might appear general or broad. That doctrine provides that \u201c[w]here general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Banushi </em>v. Dorfman, 438 Mass. 242, 244 (2002), quoting from 2A N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.17, at 273-274 (6th ed. rev. 2000). In other words, we \u201ctreat[] a general, all-encompassing word at the end of a list of specific items as taking on the character of those specific items.\u201d <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Host Intl., Inc., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 96, 103-104 (2001). \u201cThe doctrine is most appropriate when a series of several terms is listed that concludes with the disputed language.\u201d <em>Banushi </em>v. <em>Dorfman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">Here, each of the words that precedes \u201cimprovement\u201d in G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4, i.e., \u201cbuilding\u201d and \u201cstructure,\u201d in common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>parlance connotes something that has been constructed or assembled out of a combination of materials or parts to form a physical object purposefully created for human habitation or for use in the place where it has been assembled.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This more limited connotation for the associated term \u201cimprovement\u201d is reinforced by the statutory references to \u201cconstruction management\u201d and \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d services as principal types of work for which a lien may be claimed. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4. Perhaps most persuasive is the fact that such a narrowing of the scope of an \u201cimprovement,\u201d to something construction-related, fairly comes within the lien statute\u2019s underlying \u201cspirit and intent,\u201d <em>Perlera </em>v. <em>Vining Disposal Serv., Inc., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 496 (1999), quoting from <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Melrose, </em>315 Mass. 291, 295 (1943), which is \u201cto [be] ... a vehicle to secure payment for those furnishing labor and materials in construction.\u201d Lizza, Mechanic\u2019s Lien Law \u00a7 3.2, at 3-2 (Mass. Cont. Legal Educ. 2001). This limitation of \u201cimprovement\u201d to a category associated with things being constructed and to the constmction industry is underscored by the use in \u00a7 4 of the qualifier \u201cother,\u201d which would appear to cabin the word even further and limit the breadth it might otherwise be deemed to have in the absence of that adjective.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Thus, the word \u201cimprovement\u201d in context must be seen as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>denoting the product of some sort of construction-based activity on or at a property owner\u2019s land. That would not include the transportation functions Mammoet engaged in here \u2014 picking up, delivering, and setting down an already assembled unitary object (the transformer) that is never going to be used in situ \u2014 nor would it extend (as Mammoet argues) to any work or process that somehow \u201cimprove[s] the value of . . . [the owners\u2019s] property.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In short, the statutory context in which the phrase \u201cimprovement of real property\u201d is placed in \u00a7 4 strongly indicates that something is not an improvement unless it is itself, in whole or in part, constructed or assembled in connection with a building or structure or other construction-related project. Cf. <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Tibbetts Engr. Corp., </em>391 Mass. 364, 367-368 (1984). At the very least, the placement of the phrase in that context militates against its interpretation in the expansive sense Mammoet advocates, which would afford mechanic\u2019s lien protection to the activity of anyone who simply moves a piece of the property owner\u2019s personal property from one location to another. Compare note 16, <em>infra, </em>and <em>Banushi </em>v. <em>Dorfman, </em>438 Mass. at 244-245; <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 90, 92-93 (1996); and <em>Osorno </em>v. <em>Simone, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 615-618 (2002) (all restricting the generality of the term \u201cbuilding\u201d by reference to the specific words in a series under the doctrine of ejusdem generis).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Reinforcing this contextual limitation of the reach of the concept of \u201cimprovement\u201d is the long-standing judicial observation that \u201c[a] mechanic\u2019s lien is a statutory creation and can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>enforced only by strict compliance with . . . [G. L.] c. 254[, which] governs the creation, perfection, and dissolution of a mechanic\u2019s lien and \u2018is strictly construed against the party claiming the lien\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United Cas. &amp; Sur. Ins. Co., </em>440 Mass. 723, 726 (2004), quoting from <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>436 Mass. 638, 644 (2002). See <em>Golden </em>v. <em>General Builders Supply LLC, </em>441 Mass. 652, 654 (2004). Ignoring the mle of strict construction, Mammoet erroneously contends that \u201cimprovement\u201d must be read as \u201cintrinsically broad\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and should at least encompass anything that is so bulky as to be essentially \u201cattached to the property\u201d and practically \u201cimmovable.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These assertions are untenable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>as well as bereft of pertinent case support.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Another applicable (and confirmatory) interpretive guide is the principle that legislative intent may be gleaned by construing the statutory term at issue in light of \u201cthe ordinary and approved usage of the language,\u201d as reflected in recognized dictionary definitions. See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Pembroke Real Estate, Inc., </em>443 Mass. 110, 114, 116-117 (2004). Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 1138 (2002) defines \u201cimprovement\u201d as \u201ca permanent addition to or betterment of real property that enhances its capital value and that involves the expenditure of labor or money and is designed to make the [real] property more useful or valuable as distinguished from ordinary repairs.\u201d That definition decidedly cuts against Mammoet\u2019s position. The transformer delivered and set in place on a concrete pad apart from the power plant\u2019s generator is, notwithstanding its size, indisputably not permanent; there is no evidence in the record that it enhanced the \u201ccapital value\u201d of Entergy\u2019s property<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; and its intended service as a spare part \u2014 however expensive and weighty a spare part it may be \u2014 makes it conceptually more akin to a replacement light bulb, whose contingent use would commonly be regarded as an \u201cordinary repair\u201d than as something that enhances real property or capital asset value.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Cases decided under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B (a statute of repose which precludes any tort actions \u201carising out of any deficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>or neglect in the design, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property\u201d if brought over six years after the opening or substantial completion and occupation of the improvement) are instructive and appear in accord with our conclusion. They find authoritative guidance in the same dictionary definition of \u201cimprovement\u201d noted above, see <em>Rosario </em>v. <em>M.D. Knowlton Co., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 796, 800 (2002), and stress as the key factors in identifying something as an \u201cimprovement of real property\u201d (a) its permanence and (b) its actual effect in making the facility to which it is related more valuable or substantially more useful or productive. <em>Ibid. </em>(installation of a hydraulic lift for material handling in a facility). See <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Tibbetts Engr. Corp., </em>391 Mass. at 364-366 (construction extending a road from a public way to facilities in an industrial park); <em>Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crandall Dry Dock Engrs., Inc., </em>396 Mass. 818, 823 n.8 (1986) (foundation and mooring system for a ship permanently attached as the cocktail lounge of an adjacent restaurant); <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Scott Prods., Inc., </em>401 Mass. 645, 647 (1988) (installation of insulation in a building); <em>Parent </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engr. Corp., </em>408 Mass. 108, 111 (1990) (installation of permanent electrical distribution panel in an electrical generating plant); <em>Salinsky </em>v. <em>Perma-Home Corp., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 193, 198-199 (1983) (installation of aluminum siding).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Mammoet\u2019s activity here could not be deemed an improvement under these authorities, because it neither made a permanent addition to Entergy\u2019s power plant \u2014 the transformer might be again moved to another location or sold, despite its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>large size \u2014 nor effected anything that actually rendered the facility more useful and productive, either upon delivery or, indeed, ever, since the transformer might be sold or moved before being used, or never used at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Mammoet has pointed to no supporting or persuasive authority for its claim of entitlement to a mechanic\u2019s lien on these facts. Compare, in particular, <em>Colomba </em>v. <em>Fulchini </em>Plumbing, 58 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (2003) (\u201cmere installation\u2019\u2019 of a \u201creplacement boiler\u201d was not an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B). Its effort to liken its position to that of the materials suppliers in <em>International Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Corp. </em>v. <em>Rich Constr. Co. </em>372 Mass. 134 (1977), and <em>M. Lasden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Decker Elec. Corp., </em>372 Mass. 179 (1977), is misplaced and unconvincing. Mammoet is not a materials supplier, and neither of those cases dealt in any way with the instant issue (the meaning and scope of the words \u201cimprovement of real property\u201d). Both in fact involved a surety bond statute, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, that \u2014 unlike the mechanic\u2019s lien statute \u2014 is accepted as remedial and given a broad and liberal construction. See <em>International Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Corp., supra </em>at 138; <em>M. Lasden, Inc., supra </em>at 182-183.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Mammoet\u2019s reliance on a dozen cases dealing with mechanic\u2019s lien statutes in several other jurisdictions is also unavailing. Every one of those cases involved lien claimants who actually delivered building materials or equipment to a construction site \u2014 i.e., delivered property the suppliers were not merely providing but selling \u2014 that was intended to be used in the ongoing construction but was never actually so used. In addition to the distinction between the factual circumstances of those cases and this, Mammoet never establishes the identity, or even the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>similarity, of the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes in those other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Mammoet\u2019s final contentions are that (a) it \u201cfurnished\u201d \u201ctools\u201d or \u201cmaterials,\u201d in the form of its own equipment used to move and rough-set the transformer, and (b) what it did amounted to the \u201calteration\u201d of an \u201cimprovement of real property.\u201d These arguments are, however, merely conclusory and unsupported by coherent reasoning, contrary to Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). They are, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>therefore, unworthy of extended discussion. See <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Carelli, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 85-86 (1995), and cases cited. We note that \u201cmaterial\u201d under the statute is traditionally held to refer to building materials sold by materialmen or suppliers with the understanding or expectation they would be incorporated or used in a construction project, cf. note 19, <em>supra, </em>and <em>International Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Corp. </em>v. <em>Rich Constr. Co., </em>372 Mass. at 136-137; <em>M. Lasden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Decker Elec. Corp., </em>372 Mass. at 182-184; while \u201ctools\u201d are typically manual devices ordinarily used by workmen and mechanics, <em>Devney's Case, </em>223 Mass. 270, 272 (1916), such \u201cas a hammer or saw.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 2408.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Mammoet\u2019s contention begs the question in any event, since the hen depends upon the furnished objects being related to an \u201cimprovement of real property.\u201d The \u201cimprovement\u201d to which Mammoet directs these assertions is, however, nothing more than the preexisting concrete storage pad at Entergy\u2019s facility. Mammoet makes no factual or legal argument demonstrating that that pad is or ever was an \u201cimprovement\u201d under the statute, there being nothing in the record indicating when or by whom the pad was created or whether it was either permanent or an enhancement of the capital value of the property. Moreover, the work that Mammoet did \u2014 piling something on top of the pad \u2014 was not an \u201calteration\u201d as that term is commonly used.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AC\">Although we conclude that Mammoet is not entitled to the protection of the mechanic\u2019s hen statute, we are not unmindful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>of the difficulty and expertise involved in the work it performed and that such work was indeed of value to Entergy. Nonetheless, the factual realities are that Entergy has already paid in full for that work and was in no way responsible for Mammoet\u2019s being deprived of its rightful payment as a result of the bankruptcy of others; and the legal realities are that the mechanic\u2019s lien statute remains subject to strict construction \u2014 \u201c[tjhere are no equities to be invoked in aid of it.\u201d <em>International Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Corp. </em>v. <em>Rich Constr. Co., </em>372 Mass. at 138, quoting from <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Blaikie, </em>129 Mass. 206, 209 (1880). If a transporter or a deliverer of a piece of equipment or other chattel not intended to be utilized in or as part of a construction project is to receive the statute\u2019s protection, it is up to the Legislature to make it so. Cf. <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United Cas. &amp; Sur. Ins.

Similarly, a homeowner\u2019s oil delivery company, which provides an annual tank inspection, might conceivably be protected under the statute.

Moreover, in <em>M.

Mammoet correctly points out that the statutes applicable to those cases spoke only in terms of labor or materials in connection with a \u201cbuilding\u201d or \u201cstructure\u201d and not with \u201cother improvement of real property.\u201d The rationale of those cases, however, does appear pertinent to the instant case: \u201cThe petitioner does not allege that he performed any labor upon material which became part of the structure, so as to change its shape or character, in order to adapt it to the building. He did nothing with the sand, to make it tit and proper to enter into the construction of any part of the house, nor did he perform any labor by which the lumber was fitted and adapted to any section of the structure. What he did was to draw the sand to these premises, so that the contractor, if he saw fit, with other material could make it into mortar, and use it in the construction of the building. So with the lumber; when delivered, the contractor could do with it as he pleased. He could sell it, as his assignee in insolvency afterwards did as to a part of it, or he could use the sand in making mortar, and then sell it, as was done by his assignee as to a portion thereof; or he could employ them in the erection of the house. We think this labor of the petitioner does not come within the terms of the statute; that it was not connected with the building of the structure; and that it was too remote to enable him to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien therefor.\u201d <em>Webster v. Real Estate Improvement Co., </em>140 Mass. at 527. The Legislature, presumed to be aware of these rulings when it amended the statute on several occasions, particularly in 1996, could of course have explicitly included transportation or delivery services as lien-entitling had it intended to do so. See <em>MacQuarrie </em>v. <em>Balch, </em>362 Mass. 151, 152 (1972); <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dept. of Boston, </em>434 Mass. 233, 238-239 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\"> Webster\u2019s Third New Intl.

It merely constituted the placing of a chattel, an inoperable, single piece of equipment \u2014 albeit an extremely large and difficult-to-move one \u2014 on top of the pad. Further, when considered in connection with the other types of work listed in the statute, i.e., \u201cerection,\u201d \u201crepair,\u201d \u201cremoval\u201d (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>368 Mass. 58, 68 [1975], and the discussion, <em>supra), </em>no \u201calteration\u201d of the pad was involved in that work; merely moving the transformer from point A to point B was not the sort of construction-related project connoted by the other terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
