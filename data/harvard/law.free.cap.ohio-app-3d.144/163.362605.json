The city suspended Billingsley effective May 16, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">Billingsley along with relator City, County and Waste Paper Drivers Union, IBT Local 244, (\u201cthe union\u201d) filed a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between the city and the union. Ultimately, an arbitrator issued a ruling:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-17\">1. Sustaining the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>2. Reinstating Billingsley with back pay (less a setoff for any earnings during the period) and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Under the CBA, the arbitration is \u201cfinal and binding.\u201d Complaint, Tab B, CBA, at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Relators request that this court compel respondents (the city, mayor, the Division of Payroll, and various administrative officials) to:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">1. Reinstate Billingsley;</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">2. Pay full back pay and benefits to Billingsley;</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">3. Award interest on monetary amounts; and</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">4. Pay attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">By entry dated April 11, 2001, this court granted relators\u2019 application for alternative writ and ordered respondents to reinstate Billingsley or show cause why they are not required to comply. Respondents filed a reply to the show cause order and relators filed a response. Respondents also filed a motion to dismiss and relators filed a motion for summary judgment. For the reasons stated below, we deny respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss, grant relators\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and allow the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">The fundamental criteria for issuing a writ of mandamus are well established:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">\u201cIn order to be entitled to a writ of mandamus, relator must show (1) that he has a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, (2) that respondents are under a clear legal duty to perform the acts, and (3) that relator has no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. National City Bank v. Bd. of Education </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 81 [6 O.O.3d 288], 369 N.E.2d 1200.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Harris v. Rhodes </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 41, 42, 8 O.O.3d 36, 37, 374 N.E.2d 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">Of course, all three of these requirements must be met in order for mandamus to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">In <em>Am. Fedn. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emp., Ohio Council 8, Local 100, AFL-CIO v. Cleveland </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 128, 590 N.E.2d 286 (\u201cAFSCME\u201d), jurisdictional motion overruled (1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 705, 566 N.E.2d 170, an arbitrator had awarded an employee of the city of Cleveland back pay, benefits, and reinstatement to full-time employment. The employee and his union brought an action in mandamus in the court of common pleas to compel the city and its mayor to comply with the arbitrator\u2019s award. The court of common pleas ordered the respondents to reinstate the employee and \u201cto pay him the value of lost benefits pursuant to the arbitrator\u2019s opinion and award.\u201d 69 Ohio App.3d at 130, 590 N.E.2d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>This court affirmed the judgment of the court of common pleas and held that the arbitrator\u2019s award established that the relators had a clear legal right to relief and that the respondents had a clear legal duty to perform the requested acts. Likewise, this court rejected the respondents\u2019 arguments that there were other, adequate remedies in the ordinary course of the law. The <em>AFSCME </em>court specifically held that R.C. 2711.09, which authorizes the filing of an application for an order confirming an arbitration award, \u201cis not an ordinary remedy.\u201d 69 Ohio App.3d at 131, 590 N.E.2d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u201cOpinions reported in the Ohio Official Reports * * * shall be considered controlling authority for all purposes in the judicial district in which they were rendered unless and until each such opinion is reversed or modified by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d S.Ct.R.Rep.Op. 2(G)(2). Respondents have not called this court\u2019s attention to any authority reversing or modifying <em>AFSCME. </em>Respondents argue, however, that <em>AFSCME </em>is not controlling in this action because, in <em>AFSCME, </em>the court of common pleas had denied respondents\u2019 motion to vacate the arbitration award and the appeal of that denial had been dismissed prior to the filing of the action in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">On April 6, 2001, respondent city filed an application to vacate arbitration award under R.C. 2711.10: <em>Cleveland v. City, Cty. &amp; Waste Paper Drivers Union, Local No. 244, IBT, </em>Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas case No. CV-434593. The city filed the application to vacate arbitration award one week after relators filed the complaint in this action and one day after relators served the summons and complaint. Case No. CV-434593 remains pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Respondents contend that this court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction in this mandamus action \u201cruns the risk of inconsistent rulings and outcome.\u201d Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss, at 4. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">As noted above, a court determining an action in mandamus must consider whether the relator has a clear legal right to the relief requested, the respondent has a clear legal duty to act as requested, and an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law exists. In light of <em>AFSCME, </em>we are required to conclude that the pleading and the other material presented in this action demonstrate unequivocally that relators are entitled to relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Proceedings under R.C. 2711.10 require the court of common pleas to examine the conduct of the arbitration process <em>per se.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This action in mandamus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>however, requires that this court examine the three criteria discussed above. As a consequence, we cannot conclude that the mere possibility that the court of common pleas might grant the application to vacate the arbitration award prevents this court from exercising jurisdiction in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Nevertheless, we recognize that the court of common pleas has the authority to act on the application to vacate arbitration award. The judgment in this action is not, therefore, intended to restrict the court of common pleas from exercising the authority granted to it by the General Assembly under R.C. Chapter 2711 nor is it intended to limit or presage this court\u2019s exercise of its appellate jurisdiction in the event any party appeals the determination of the court of common pleas. See R.C. 2711.15. Rather, we observe that the issues addressed in a mandamus action are distinct from those examined in a proceeding under R.C. 2711.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Accordingly, respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss is denied and. relators\u2019 motion for summary judgment is granted. Respondents are ordered to reinstate Billingsley with back pay (less a setoff for any earnings during the period) and benefits, and fulfill any additional requirements set forth in the February 12, 2001 Opinion and Award of Thomas R. Skulina, Arbitrator, case No. 00-012242. This court\u2019s determination of this action on the merits supersedes the prior granting of the application for alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Respondents to pay costs.
