McMonagle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On August 17, 1999, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned a fifty-nine-count indictment against defendant-appellant, Michael D. Hollander. Forty-seven counts charged appellant with the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material, in violation of R.C. 2907.323; eleven counts charged appellant with pandering sexually oriented material involving a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.322; and the remaining count charged appellant with possession of criminal tools, in violation of R.C. 2923.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The charges stemmed from a report received by the Lakewood Police Department that a special agent posing as a child had received numerous photographs of naked children from appellant over the Internet. The Lakewood Police Department investigated the tip and executed a search warrant at appellant\u2019s home on August 17, 1999. The police seized a large amount of child pornography, including numerous books, magazines, videos, posters, and photographs of young males not fully clothed. In addition, the police seized a Sony receiver, a Sony Internet terminal for Web TV, a computer keyboard, a television set, two VCRs, and a printer. A majority of the items were seized from appellant\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">On March 1, 2000, appellant forfeited his interest in the property seized by the police and pled guilty to two counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material, two counts of pandering sexually oriented material, and one count of possession of criminal tools. The remaining charges were nolled in exchange for appellant\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">On May 24, 2000, the trial court held a sentencing hearing. In its journal entry filed June 22, 2000, the trial court sentenced appellant to maximum, consecutive sentences of incarceration as follows:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">\u201cOn May 24, 2000, a sentencing hearing was held pursuant to R.C. 2929.19, notice having been given to all parties. Defendant was present in person, was represented by counsel, was given an opportunity to speak and to present witnesses, and was afforded all rights pursuant to Crim.R. 32. The Court has considered the record, oral statements, any victim impact statement, the presentence report, the Sex Offender Unit\u2019s assessment report, the evaluations and results of the Abel test administrated [sic] to defendant, the purposes and principals [sic] of sentencing under R.C. 2929.11, the seriousness and recidivism factors relevant to the offense and offender pursuant to R.C. 2929.12, and the need for deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and restitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">\u201cThe Court finds that the defendant has been convicted under Counts 1 and 2 of Illegal Use of a Minor in Nudity-Oriented Material, a violation of R.C. 2907.323, a felony of the second degree; under Counts 35 and 36 of Pandering Sexually-Oriented Material Involving a Minor, a violation of R.C. 2907.322, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>felony of the fifth degree; and under Count 59 of Possession of Criminal Tools, a violation of R.C. 2928.24, a felony of the fifth degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201cThe Court further finds that the following factors enumerated in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\u201c(1) attempt, or actual threat of, physical harm to a person, or prior conviction for causing such harm to a person (or children);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\u201c(2) for organized criminal activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">\u201c(3) sex offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">\u201c(4) served prior (federal) term for similar sex offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">\u201cThe Court further finds that consecutive prison sentences are consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing under R.C. 2929.11 for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">\u201c(1) it is commensurate with the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and its impact on society;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">\u201c(2) it is reasonably necessary to deter the offender in order to protect the public from future crime and to protect the public and punish the offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-13\">\u201c(3) it would not place an unnecessary burden on governmental resources;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-14\">\u201c(4) it is not disproportionate to the conduct and to the danger the offender poses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-15\">\u201c(5) the offender\u2019s criminal history shows consecutive terms are needed to protect the public from harm so great or unusual that a single term does not adequately reflect the seriousness of his repeated conduct, based upon sex offense, prior convictions for similar crimes committed, inability of defendant to stop his behavior as indicated by letters he is still writing and receiving while awaiting sentencing in this matter, and no genuine remorse shown;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-16\">\u201c(6) all responses elicited from defendant per the Sex Offenders Unit\u2019s assessment and Abel testing evaluation, which are incorporated herein by reference;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-17\">\u201c(7) recidivism highly likely; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-18\">\u201c(8) defendant\u2019s failure to respond favorably to sanctions (treatment) previously imposed on more than one occasion throughout the years, including intensive treatment defendant received through University Hospital\u2019s sex offenders treatment program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-19\">\u201cIt is ordered that the defendant serve a stated term of 8 years in prison under Count 1 and 8 years under Count 2 for violations of R.C. 2907.323; 1 year under Count 35 and 1 year under Count 36 for violations of R.C. 2907.322; and 1 year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>under Count 39 for violation of R.C. 2923.24. The sentences shall be served consecutively to each other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Appellant timely appealed, raising one assignment of error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred by sentencing the appellant to maximum consecutive terms of incarceration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Appellant first contends that the trial court erred in sentencing him to the maximum term of imprisonment on each count. Appellant concedes that a prison term \u201cof some measure\u201d was appropriate for his offenses but argues that because he is an \u201cacknowledged pedophile,\u201d rather than a major drug offender or repeat violent offender, he should have received a lesser sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">A trial court has broad discretion in sentencing a defendant. <em>State v. Yontz </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 342, 515 N.E.2d 1012. Pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G)(1), an appellate court may modify or vacate a sentence imposed under Senate Bill No. 2 only if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the sentence is not supported by the record or is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Appellant pled guilty to two counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material, felonies of the second degree. Appellant also pled guilty to two counts in pandering sexually oriented material and one count of possession of criminal tools, felonies of the fifth degree. R.C. 2929.14(A)(2) sets forth the sentencing guidelines applicable to second-degree felonies, allowing prison terms of two to eight years. R.C. 2929.14(A)(5) provides that the prison term for a felony of the fifth degree shall be six to twelve months.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">R.C. 2929.14(C) specifies when a court may impose a maximum prison term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">\u201c* * * <em>[pjhe court </em>imposing a sentence upon an offender for a felony <em>may impose the longest prison term, authorized for the offense </em>pursuant to division (A) of this section only upon offenders who committed the worst forms of the offense, <em>upon offenders who pose the greatest likelihood of committing future crimes, </em>upon certain major drug offenders under division (D)(3) of this section, and upon certain repeat violent offenders in accordance with division (D)(2) of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Thus, to impose the maximum sentence, there must be a finding on the record that the offender committed one of the worst forms of the offense or posed the greatest likelihood of recidivism. <em>State v. Futrell </em>(Nov. 10, 1999), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 75033, 75034 and 75035, unreported, 1999 WL 1024169. While the court need not use the exact language of the statute, it must be clear from the record that the trial court made the required findings. <em>Id.; State v. Assad </em>(June 11,1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 72648, unreported, 1998 WL 308109.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Here, in accordance with R.C. 2929.14(C), the trial court found that appellant posed the greatest likelihood of recidivism. A review of the trial judge\u2019s remarks at sentencing and the trial court\u2019s journal entry indicate that, prior to sentencing, the judge considered, among other things, appellant\u2019s presentence report, the Sex Offender Unit\u2019s assessment report, and the results of the Abel Assessment test given to appellant, all of which indicated an extremely high likelihood of recidivism. Indeed, as the trial judge stated, \u201cWhat\u2019s glaring is the report that this court has received through the sex offender\u2019s assessment unit, and he is assessed, and this is the first one I had where he\u2019s assessed so high for the likelihood of recommitting * * *.\u201d Thus, in its journal entry, the trial court stated that \u201crecidivism [is] highly likely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Moreover, as the trial judge noted at the sentencing hearing, appellant\u2019s pedophilic behavior had not stopped even after his arrest. Letters obtained from appellant\u2019s jail cell shortly before the sentencing hearing indicated that even after his arrest, appellant continued to write letters to other prisoners containing graphic descriptions and pictures of sexual activity between young boys and adult males.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Finally, the record reviewed by the trial court demonstrated that appellant had a lengthy history of criminal convictions relating to his pedophilia, had not responded favorably to sanctions and/or treatment imposed for his criminal convictions, and had failed to demonstrate any remorse for his offenses. See R.C. 2929.12. Accordingly, the trial court properly found that appellant posed the greatest likelihood of committing future offenses and, therefore, properly imposed maximum sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) governs the imposition of consecutive sentences and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">\u201cIf multiple prison terms are imposed on an offender for convictions of multiple offenses, the court may require the offender to serve the prison terms consecutively if the court finds that the consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender and that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public, and if the court also finds any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">\u201c(a) The offender committed the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-release control for a prior offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>\u201c(b) The harm caused by the multiple offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of a single course of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">\u201c(c) The offender\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.\u201d R.C. 2929.19(B)(2) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">\u201cThe court shall impose a sentence and shall make a finding that gives its reasons for selecting the sentence imposed in any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">\u201c(c) If it imposes consecutive sentences under section 2929.14 of the Revised Code, its reasons for imposing the consecutive sentences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Thus, R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) requires the trial court to make at least three findings prior to sentencing an offender to consecutive sentences. Moreover, pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(2), the trial court must also give the reasons behind its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Here, although not specifically citing R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), the trial court made the findings required by the statute. In its journal entry, the trial court specifically stated that it was imposing consecutive sentences in this case because they were (1) \u201creasonably necessary to deter the offender * * * and to protect the public and punish the offender\u201d; (2) \u201cnot disproportionate to the [seriousness of appellant\u2019s] conduct and to the danger [he] poses\u201d; and (3) \u201cneeded to protect the public from harm so great or unusual that a single term does not adequately reflect the seriousness of his repeated conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">In addition, in accordance with R.C. 2929.14(E), prior to sentencing appellant on May 24, 2000, the trial judge stated on the record that appellant had a twenty-year history of recidivism such that multiple terms were necessary to protect the public from future harm. Upon reviewing appellant\u2019s criminal history, the trial judge noted that in 1975, appellant pled guilty to gross sexual imposition involving minors, and was placed on probation and ordered to receive outpatient psychiatric treatment. In 1979, appellant was arrested again and charged with disseminating materials harmful to a juvenile through the United States mail. Appellant was placed on probation for three years and again ordered to undergo treatment. In 1981, appellant was convicted in California of the misdemeanor charge of interstate transportation of child pornography. In 1989, while employed by the United States Postal Service, appellant was again arrested and charged with disseminating materials harmful to juveniles through the United States mail service. He was sentenced to a one-year prison term and then three years of intensive out-patient counseling. The trial judge noted, however, that appellant admitted that he continued to engage in pornographic activities in 1991 and 1992 even while he was engaged in counseling for his pedophilia.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>On .this record, it is clear that the trial court followed the statutory guidelines for imposing consecutive sentences set forth in R.C. 2929.14(E) and properly imposed consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b614-7\">Diane Kabpinski, A.J., and James J.
