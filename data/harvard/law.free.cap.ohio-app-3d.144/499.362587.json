Welsh, Jr. (\u2018Welsh\u201d) has appealed from the judgment of the Cuyahoga Falls Municipal Court, which granted prejudgment interest to Ohio Edison Company. This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Because appellee, Ohio Edison Company (\u201cOhio Edison\u201d), failed to file a brief with this court, we will accept Welsh\u2019s statement of facts as correct. App.R. 18(C). Ohio Edison filed suit against Welsh for damage Welsh caused to a utility pole owned by Ohio Edison. The matter went to trial, and a jury found in favor of Ohio Edison. Subsequently, the trial court journalized the verdict, and <em>sua sponte </em>ordered prejudgment interest to be paid from the date the damage occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Welsh has timely appealed, and has asserted one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant in an award of prejudgment interest absent * * * a petition for such relief as required by [R.C.] 1343.03(C); a hearing on the issue as required by [R.C.] 1343.03(C); and a determination that defendant/appellant failed to make a good faith effort to settle where the jury\u2019s verdict was only $43.64 higher than defendant\u2019s offer of settlement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In his sole assignment of error, Welsh asserts that the trial court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>granting prejudgment interest. Specifically, Welsh asserts that because Ohio Edison never filed a motion for prejudgment interest, and the lower court did not hold a hearing on the issue, the prejudgment interest award must be reversed. This court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">A trial court\u2019s grant of prejudgment interest will be upheld absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Kalain v. Smith </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 157, 159, 25 OBR 201, 202-203, 495 N.E.2d 572, 573-574.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">The only statutory authority to impose prejudgment interest is found in R.C. 1343.03(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute permits an injured party, in certain circumstances, to recover interest in a tort action from the date the cause of action accrues. \u201c[T]he purpose of R.C. 1343.03(C) is to encourage litigants to make a good faith effort to settle their case, thereby conserving legal resources and promoting judicial economy.\u201d <em>Peyko v. Frederick </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 164, 167, 25 OBR 207, 209, 495 N.E.2d 918, 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">An \u201cR.C. 1343.03(C) <em>motion </em>for prejudgment interest <em>must be made </em>to the trial court <em>following the verdict or decision in the case </em>and in no event later than fourteen days beyond the entry of judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Cotterman v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 48, 517 N.E.2d 536, paragraph one of the syllabus. The statute places an evidentiary burden upon the party seeking the award. R.C. 1343.03(C). See, also, <em>Galmish v. Cicchini </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 22, 25, 734 N.E.2d 782, 793. Moreover, the statute \u201crequires that the trial court determine the issue of prejudgment interest \u2018at a hearing held subsequent to the verdict or decision in the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galmish, supra, </em>quoting <em>Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 638, 658, 635 N.E.2d 331, 347-348.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">In the instant case, Ohio Edison did not make a motion for prejudgment interest following the verdict, and a hearing was never held. Accordingly, this court finds that the lower court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest pursuant to R.C. 1343.03(C). See <em>Boes v. Boes </em>(June 17, 1998), Seneca App. No. 13-98-10, unreported, 1998 WL 317599 (reversing a trial court\u2019s grant of prejudgment interest on the basis that the award was made <em>sua sponte, </em>and that the record did not support a finding that a <em>good </em>faith effort to settle was not made).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Welsh\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The prejudgment interest award is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-7\">Batchelder, P.J., and Slaby, J.,\"concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-11\">.
