McMonagle, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">This cause came on to be heard upon the accelerated calendar pursuant to App.R. 11.1 and Loc.R. 25, the records from the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, the briefs, and the oral arguments of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Plaintiff-appellant, Lynn Davis, individually and as administrator of the estate of decedent Katherine R\u00f3sala (\u201cappellant\u201d), appeals the decision of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court granting summary judgment to defendant-appellee, Shelby Insurance Company (\u201cShelby Insurance\u201d), on the basis that appellant was not entitled to receive uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits under decedent\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">A review of the record reveals that, on July 31, 1996, the decedent was killed in an automobile accident when the vehicle in which she was a passenger went left of center and struck an oncoming truck. The driver of the vehicle, Hoyt Dawson, was covered by a policy of automobile insurance with limits of $25,000, which was tendered to appellant as representative of decedent\u2019s estate. The trucking company was insured by a policy of insurance with limits of $1,000,000, of which $90,000 was tendered to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">When Shelby Insurance denied a claim for underinsured motorist benefits under a policy of homeowner\u2019s insurance issued to decedent, appellant filed a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that this policy of insurance, by operation of law, provided such coverage and that appellant was entitled to the $100,000 limits under that policy. The parties subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In its entry granting summary judgment to Shelby Insurance, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">\u201cPursuant to <em>Overton v. Western Reserve Group </em>([Dec. 8,] 1999), [Wayne App. No. 99CA0007, unreported, 1999 WL 1215138], Plaintiffs homeowner\u2019s policy is not an automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance, thus UM/UIM coverage is not available under the policy or by operation of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Appellant thereafter filed this appeal assigning the following error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellee Shelby Insurance Company, as appellant is entitled to underinsured motorist coverage in the policy issued to her by appellee Shelby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Appellant contends that because the homeowner\u2019s policy issued to decedent provides automobile liability coverage in limited circumstances, Shelby Insurance was required to offer uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits. When it failed to do so, such benefits arose by operation of law and, moreover, were not subject to setoff or to the subrogation provisions under that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Shelby Insurance, on the other hand, maintains that UM/UIM benefits were not offered because the policy of insurance was a homeowner\u2019s policy not an automobile policy. Even if the homeowner\u2019s policy could be construed to provide such coverage, however, Shelby Insurance argues that benefits would be unavailable because of statutory setoff provisions as well as subrogation provisions contained within the policy itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Decedent\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cSECTION II \u2014 LIABILITY COVERAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">\u201cCOVERAGE E \u2014 PERSONAL LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">\u201cIf a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies, we will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">\u201c1.

This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-13\">\u201c(A) No automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state unless both of the following coverages are provided to persons insured under the policy for loss due to bodily injury or death suffered by such persons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\">\u201c(2) Underinsured motorist coverage, which shall be in the amount of coverage equivalent to the automobile liability or motor vehicle liability coverage and shall provide protection for an insured against loss for bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, suffered by any person insured under the policy, where the limits of coverage available for payment to the insured under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured are less than the limits for the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage. Underinsured motorist coverage is not and shall not be excess insurance to other applicable liability coverages, and shall be provided only to afford the insured an amount of protection not greater than that which would be available under the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage if the person or the persons liable were uninsured at the time of the accident. The policy limits of the underinsured motorist coverage shall be reduced by those amounts available for payment under all applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201c(B) Coverages offered under division (A) of this section shall be written for the same limits of liability. No change shall be made in the limits of one of these coverages without an equivalent change in the limits of the other coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Relying on <em>Selander v. Erie Ins. Group </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 541, 709 N.E.2d 1161, appellant contends that where a policy of insurance provides automobile coverage, even in limited circumstances, the insurer is required to offer UM/UIM coverage and when it fails to do so this coverage arises by operation of law. In <em>Selander, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio found that a general business policy was an \u201cautomobile policy\u201d for purposes of R.C. 3937.18 because it extended liability coverage for \u201chired\u201d and \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobiles. Appellant seeks to extend this reasoning to find UM/UIM coverage under a homeowner\u2019s policy that likewise extends automobile coverage in limited circumstances. Shelby Insurance, on the other hand, relies on <em>Overton v. W. Res. Group </em>(Dec. 8,1999), Wayne App. No. 99CA0007, unreported, 1999 WL 1215138, which held that incidental coverage extended to recreational off-road conveyances and golf carts \u201cis * * * not enough to transform a homeowner\u2019s policy into an automobile liability policy\u201d for purposes of finding UM/UIM coverage. See, also, <em>Dicke v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 13, 2000), Allen App. No. 1-2000-64, unreported, 2000 WL 1824885, affirmed on authority of <em>Davidson v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co., infra; Dicke v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 334, 744 N.E.2d 1162 (homeowner\u2019s policy cannot reasonably be \u201cconstrued to provide uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage where there is no automobile liability coverage intended by the parties or contained within the policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The Ohio Supreme Court recently affirmed <em>Overton </em>based on the authority of <em>Davidson v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 262, 744 N.E.2d 713. See <em>Overton v. W. Res. Group </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 333, 744 N.E.2d 1162. In its syllabus, the <em>Davidson </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201cA homeowner\u2019s insurance policy that provides limited liability <em>coverage </em>for vehicles that are not subject to motor vehicle registration and that are not intended to be used on a public highway is not a motor vehicle liability policy and is not subject to the requirements of former R.C. 3937.18 to offer uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">The <em>Davidson </em>court found that the general business liability policy in <em>Selander </em>specifically provided limited coverage for liability coverage for claims arising out of the use of hired or non-owned automobiles used in the insured\u2019s business. Since there was express automobile liability coverage arising out of the use of these automobiles, the <em>Davidson </em>court reasoned that UM/UIM coverage was required. In distinguishing <em>Selander, </em>the <em>Davidson </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cIn contrast, the policy at issue in this case is a homeowner\u2019s policy that does not include coverage for liability arising out of the use of motor vehicles generally. Instead, the homeowner\u2019s policy provides incidental coverage to a narrow class of motorized vehicles that are not subject to motor vehicle registration and are designed for off-road use or are used around the insured\u2019s property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The <em>Davidson </em>court went on to state that automobiles, unlike the vehicles listed in a homeowner\u2019s policy, are subject to motor vehicle registration and are designed and used for transporting people on a public highway. Consequently, it is logical to require UM/UIM coverage in <em>Selander </em>but restrict recovery under a homeowner\u2019s policy that provides only incidental coverage for a very limited class of motorized vehicles that are neither subject to motor vehicle registration nor designed to be used on a public highway. <em>Davidson, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 267-268, 744 N.E.2d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u201cMoreover, we never intended <em>Selander </em>to be used to convert every homeowner\u2019s policy into a motor vehicle liability policy whenever any incidental coverage is afforded for some specified type of motorized vehicle. Instead, <em>Selander </em>stands only for the proposition that UM/UIM coverage is to be offered where a liability policy of insurance expressly provides for coverage for motor vehicles without qualification as to design or necessity for motor vehicle registration.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We acknowledge that the <em>Davidson </em>court did not specifically address whether a \u201cresidence employee\u201d exclusion in a homeowner\u2019s policy could be construed so as to provide UM/UIM coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 265, 744 N.E.2d at 715, fn. 2. We see no reason, however, not to extend the reasoning of <em>Davidson </em>to the policy at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Explaining the differences between UM/UIM coverage and homeowner\u2019s coverage, the <em>Davidson </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">\u201c[I]n the case of bodily injury, homeowner\u2019s liability insurance is essentially designed to indemnify against liability for injuries that noninsureds sustain themselves, typically while in the insured\u2019s home. In contrast, the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage is \u2018to protect persons from losses which, because of the tortfeasor\u2019s lack of liability coverage, would otherwise go uncompensated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Cincinnati Indemn. Co. v. Martin </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 604, 608, 710 N.E.2d 677, 680.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">\u201cCommon sense alone dictates that neither the insurer nor the insured bargained for or contemplated that such homeowner\u2019s insurance would cover personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident that occurred on a highway away from the insured\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Davidson, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 269, 744 N.E.2d at 719.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Consequently, the policy at issue in this case cannot be construed so as to provide UM/UIM coverage. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-6\">Frank D. Celebrezze, Jr. and James J. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-17\">. Appellant presented two issues for review under the single assignment of error presented for review by this court. The first issue was whether UM/UIM coverage is available under a homeowner\u2019s policy while the second issue dealt with whether principles of setoff apply. Since we find that coverage is unavailable, we need not discuss the issue, of setoff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
