S. Code, tit. 11, \u00a7 47 (11 USCA \u00a7 47). They involved only the right of a nonresident creditor, who had proved his claim, to withdraw it in order to avoid being subject to a liability in tho bankruptcy court to respond for a preference said to have been given to him. It is plain that this court has no power of review, except as the power to revise in matter of law is given by 24b. Since the amendment of May 27,1926 (11 USCA \u00a7 47), abolishing petitions to revise, the only review is by a special appeal, allowed in its discretion by this court, instead of in the usual manner. It is probably to he inferred, as the reason for this amendment, that it was thought tho ordinary proceedings in bankruptcy ought not to ho reviewed, and necessarily suspended, by any appeal which either party might invoke as a right, and that the appellate court would not allow frivolous or nonsubstantial appeals. Whether or not this is the reason, tho fact is clear that we have no jurisdiction of an appeal under 24b which we did not allow. The appeal here was allowed in February, 1927, by the District Court, as it might be if taken under 24a or 25a (11 USCA \u00a7 48). See Rutherford v. Elliott (C. C. A. 6) 18 F.(2d) 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">The appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. We have the less regret in thus disposing of tho ease, because we are not satisfied that tho permission to withdraw was erroneously granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
