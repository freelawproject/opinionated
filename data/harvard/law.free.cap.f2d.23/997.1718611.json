Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 43 S. Ct. 597, 67 L. Ed. 1078. There it was held that Mrs. Frothingham was without standing, as a mere taxpayer, to restrain the enforcement of the \u201cMaternity Act\u201d of November 23, 1921. 42 Stat. 224 (42 USCA \u00a7 161 et seq.; Comp. St. \u00a7 9188% et seq.). Appellant\u2019s contention that he brings this suit as a citizen, and not as taxpayer, is without merit, for two reasons: First, Mrs. Frothingham alleged in her bill that she was a citizen of the United States, as well as a taxpayer; and, second, the interest of a citizen in such a suit is no more direet than that of a taxpayer. As the court observed in the Frothingham Case: \u201cWe have no power per se to review and annul acts of Congress on the ground that they are unconstitutional. * * * If a ease for preventive relief be presented, the court enjoins, in effect, not the execution of the statute, but the acts of the official, the statute notwithstanding. Here the parties plaintiff have no such case. Looking through forms of words to the substance of their complaint, it is merely that officials of the executive department of the government are executing and will execute an act of Congress asserted to be unconstitutional, and this we are asked to prevent. To do so would be not to decide a judicial controversy, but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and coequal department, an authority which plainly we do not possess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">The decree is affirmed, with costs. Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
