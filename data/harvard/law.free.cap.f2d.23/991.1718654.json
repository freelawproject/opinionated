The motion was sustained by the lower court, and the bill was dismissed. This appeal was then taken.</p>\n<p id=\"AbVd\">We are of the opinion that the ruling of the lower court was right. The bill of complaint alleges that differences of opinion have arisen between the plaintiffs and certain of the defendants concerning the management of the lodge, but it contains no averment that the lodge is insolvent, or that the proceedings complained of as inharmonious, and lacking in the spirit of fraternity and amity, are in violation of law or of the governing regulations of the lodge; nor does the bill charge the lodge, or any of the defendants, with waste or with fraud. It is therefore clear that the bill does not state grounds for a statutory dissolution of the corporation, nor for the appointment of a receiver for its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">This leaves for consideration only the alleged indebtedness of the lodge to the plaintiffs and their associates, and their claim of an equitable lien upon the real estate of the lodge. It is stated in the bill that the sums of money advanced by these parties to the lodge were intended as a loan, and that the amounts thereof are now due and owing to them from the lodge. The plaintiffs, however, state in the bill that it was the agreement that certain \u201ccertificates of shares in said corporation\u201d should be issued to them for the money thus loaned, and that such shares were in fact issued and delivered to them accordingly. The bill, however, does not disclose the terms or conditions of the certificates of shares thus referred to, nor does it disclose whether the lodge therein or thereby promised to repay the sums thus advanced, or, if so, the terms and conditions of such repayment. It is true that the plaintiffs aver in the bill that the sums so advanced are due and owing to them from the lodge, but these statements, standing alone, are mere conclusions of law, and are not sustained by necessary av\u00e9rments of facts. It follows that the bill fails to show any indebtedness due to plaintiffs from the lodge, such as would entitle them to present relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">The decree entered below is accordingly affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
