It is also stipulated that it has been, the custom of the Board that if such petitions accompanied by the filing fee should- be delivered to a member of the Board, or an employee of the Board, after office hours and before midnight, they should be marked filed as of the date on which they were thus delivered or deposited. -</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">. On September. 10, 1926, the Commissioner filed a motion with the Board to dismiss the petition for the following reasons, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-5\">\u201c(1) The deficiency letter was .mailed to the taxpayer on June 11, 1926, while the petition shows on its face that it was filed with the Board of Tax Appeals on August 20, 1926.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-6\">\u201c(2) The petitioner has failed to file its appeal with the Board of Tax Appeals within the time prescribed by law, and therefore the Board of Tax Appeals is without jurisdiction to hear the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">The Board sustained this motion and dismissed the appeal, at the same time stating that, the failure of the taxpayer to pay the, filing,fee within the.60-day period aforesaid was the ground of the dismissal. Thereupon this appeal was brought by the taxpayer for a review of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">The Board of Tax Appeals is authorized to prescribe reasonable rules of procedure for conducting its business. Section 900, Revenue Aet of 1924 (26 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 1211-1222;. Comp. St. \u00a7 6371%b). This court will take judicial notice of the Board\u2019s rules when regularly promulgated. Goldsmith v. Board of Tax Appeals, 55 App. D. C. 229, 4 F.(2d) 422. , Under this authority the Board prescribed the. following rule, to wit: \u201cRule.l. <em>Busmess Hows. </em>The office of the Board at Washington, D. C., will be open each business day from 9 o\u2019clock a. m. to 4:30 o\u2019clock p: m.\u201d In the present instance the Board\u2019s office was closed, conform-ably with its rules, prior to 7:10 p. m., when the postman placed the petition in the mail box or left it upon the office floor. Accordingly there was no one then at the office to receive the petition, nor was it received by any one for the Board until the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">The controlling question at present is whether this deposit of the petition .consti-.. tuted a filing of it within the law. This ques\u2022tion must be answered in the negative, for it is well established that in general a paper is not \u201cfiled,\u201d within contemplation of law, until it is delivered to the proper officer to be filed by him. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\"><em>\u201c * </em>* * A paper is said also to be filed when it is delivered to the proper officer, and by him received to be kept on file. 13 Vin. Abr. 211; 1 Littleton, 113; 1 Hawk. PI. Cr. 7, 207. * * * Piling a paper, in modem usage, consists in placing it in the custody of the proper official by the party. charged with the duty, and the making of the proper indorsement by the officer. Stone v. Crow, 2 S. D. 525, 51 N. W. 335. In the sense of a statute \u00abrequiring the filing of a paper or document, it is filed when delivered to and received by the proper officer to be kept on file. The word carries with it the idea of permanent preservation of the thing so delivered and receivedthat it may become a part of the public record. It is not synonymous with deposited; People v. Peck, 67 Hun, 560, 22 N. Y. S. 576.\u201d 2 Bouv. Law Dict. 1219, \u201cFile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">See In re Gubelman (C. C. A.) 10 F.(2d) 926, 929; Gallagher v. Linwood, 30 N. M. 211, 231 P. 627, 37 A. L. R. 664; Hoyt v. Stark, 134 Cal. 178, 66 P. 223, 86 Am. St. Rep. 246; Westcott v. Eccles, 3 Utah, 258, 2 P. 525; In re Conant\u2019s Estate, 43 Or. 530, 534, 73 P. 1018; In re Von Borcke (D. C.) 94 F. 352; Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Phinney (C. C. A.) 76 F. 618; Appeal of Satovsky, 1 B. T. A. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-14\">It follows that, the Board\u2019s decision dismissing the petition was correct, for the requirement that such .petitions shall be filed \u25a0within 60 days after the mailing of notice of the deficiency, is statutory and jurisdictional and is not merely procedural. Revenue Act of 1926, \u00a7 274 (a). The Board, therefore, was without jurisdiction to hear the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">Appellant argues that the sole ground upon which the decision of the Board was based was the taxpayer\u2019s failure to pay the $10 fee within the 60-day period, and that the decision should be reversed because the reason thus assigned was erroneous. It is true that the ground stated for the decision was erroneous. See Weaver v. Blair, Commissioner (C. C. A.) 19 F.(2d) 16, and Reliance Mfg. Co. v. Blair, Commissioner (C. C. A.) 19 F.(2d) 789, which hold that the payment of the fee is \u201cnot- jurisdictional, but incidental and procedural.\u201d But it is elementary. that, \u201cwhere a judgment or order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>is correct, it will not be reversed on appeal because the trial court has based its decision on insufficient or erroneous reasons or grounds, or has stated no reason therefor.\u201d 4 C. J. p. 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Appellant also argues that the Commissioner\u2019s present objection to the filing of-the petition was not presented or considered below and therefore should not be heard in this appeal, citing rule 5 (3) of this court. This argument is answered by the rule that \u201cthe want of jurisdiction apparent on the face of the record will be taken notice of by the appellate court, whether set up and relied on as a defense in the court below or not.\u201d 3 C. J. p. 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
