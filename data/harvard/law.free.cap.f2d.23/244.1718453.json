It does not prohibit such manufacture, sale, etc., for scientific, medicinal, industrial, or other nonbeverage purposes. The National Prohibition Act (27 USCA), passed to enforce that amendment, could not therefore prohibit the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors for nonbeverage purposes; it could only regulate as to such liquors, in order to make effective the object of the amendment, and that is all it undertakes to do. As the amendment does not apply to all intoxicating liquors, and by way of exception authorize the manufacture and handling of nonbeverage liquors, it would seem- to follow that an indictment based on a violation of constitutional prohibition must allege that the intoxicating liquors manufactured or handled by the accused were for beverage purposes. The averment in the indictment in this ease, that the liquors involved were \u201cfit for beverage purposes,\u201d is not equivalent to 'an averment that they were for beverage purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-19\">In Powers v. United States, 294 F. 512, we held an indictment good which charged that the liquor was intended for beverage <em>purposes. But the </em>expression \u201cfit for beverage purposes\u201d describes equally well both beverage and nonbeverage liquor. This is recognized by the National Prohibition Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>in title 2, \u00a7 4 (27 USCA \u00a7 13), where it is provided that medicinal preparations, proprietary medicines, antiseptic preparations, flavoring extracts, and syrups \u201cthat are unfit for use for beverage purposes\u201d shall not bo subject- to the act, and in title 3, \u00a7 6 (27 USCA \u00a7 76), where it is provided that distilled spirits \u201cfit for beverage purposes\u201d may be withdrawn from bonded warehouses, to be denatured and sold. In the recent case of Brown v. United States (C. C. A.) 21 F. (2d) 827, we held that an indictment for conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act, \u201cby transporting intoxicating liquors\u201d from Savannah to Chicago, did not state an offense. In the opinion in that case it was stated that the averments of the indictment were consistent with the conclusion that what the accused agreed to transport was liquor not fit for use for beverage purposes. Section 4 of title 2 was cited as sufficient to show that the indictment was defective. That case is not authority for the conclusion that it is sufficient to charge that liquor was fit for use for beverage purposes. The averments that the conspiracy was unlawfully entered into, and that its objects were to manufacture, sell, transport, etc., \u201cin violation of title 2, section 3, of the act of Congress, commonly known as the National Prohibition Act,\u201d are urged by the government as being sufficient to sustain the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The word \u201cunlawfully\u201d modifies the charge of conspiracy, and does not characterize the supposed offense that was the object of the conspiracy. That word, as used in the indictment, signifies \u201ccontrary to law\u201d\u2014 to any law, criminal or civil. 2 Bishop\u2019s Criminal Law, \u00a7 178 (2). The allegation that an act which is intrinsically lawful was done unlawfully is insufficient, unless there is an allegation specifically pointing out in what manner the act was done unlawfully. 31 C. J. 702. If the ae( complained of is in its very nature unlawful, it need not be alleged that it was done unlawfully. Rumely v. United States (C. C. A.) 293 F. 532; Burns v. United States (C. C. A.) 296 P. 468. But where an act may ho either lawful or unlawful, as is the ease here, the indictment must allege that it was done unlawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In such a ease the fact that the conspiracy is characterized as unlawful is not enough. Conrad v. United States (C. C. A.) 127 P. 798; Hilt v. United States (C. C. A.) 279 F. 421; Brown v. United States, supra. The averment that what the accused conspired to do was in violation of a section of the National Prohibition Act is a mere formal conclusion of law, and forms no part of the charge made in the indictment. Frisbie v. United States, 157 U. S. 160, 15 S. Ct. 586, 39 L. Ed. 657. The conclusion is that the demurrer to the indictment should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
