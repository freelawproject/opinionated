On hearing, the bill was dismissed and the patent held invalid. Thereupon the plaintiffs took this appeal. To determine the rights alleged to have accrued under this patent, we must first ascertain the prior state of the knife sharpener art as disclosed in patent No. 1,335,603 for such an article, applied for May 10, 1919, and granted to Roberts March 30, 1920. We note in the margin the pertinent parts of his specifications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-20\">Bearing in mind the fact that some knives, as, for example, butcher ones, are sharpened by the abrasion of both sides of the edge, and others, as for example, bread <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>knives, have but one side of the edge abraded, it will bo seen from the above statements, numerically applied to the figure shown, that the patent disclosed a device for abrading both sides of the edges simultaneously at the central point of the housing, where both sets of interlapping disks revolved, and also a device for abrading one side only of the edge at the end housings <em>15 </em>or <em>16, </em>where but one set -of disks revolved. It will, of course, be seen that there was no novelty in drawing a knife blade between the meeting point of two smooth, rigid, abrading surfaces. The improvement of Roberts over such well-known method is shown in the specification in the tilting of the sharpening cylinders or disks sideways, and using the disk edges as the sharpening abrasive agency. Thus the tilting of the disks is pointed out by the statement: \u201cThe <em>sharpening </em>cylinders are formed of a series of disks <em>12, </em>and, as shown, are comparatively thin, with <em>straight outer edges, </em>and provided with openings <em>14 </em>to receive the bolts <em>10 </em>and <em>11. </em>Any number of <em>cutting </em>disks may be used, and between each disk is a washer <em>14, </em>the diameter of which is considerably less than that of the <em>sharpening </em>disk. The washers, like the disks, are provided with openings through which the bolts pass, and there are sufficient disks and washers on each bolt to <em>nearly fill </em>the space between the sides of the housing <em>2, </em>so that there is a slight longitudinal movement of the <em>cutting </em>disks on the bolts.\u201d Now, as the cutting disks are \u201ccomparatively thin,\u201d and as sufficient space is provided to permit \u201ca straight longitudinal movement of the cutting disks on the bolts,\u201d it is apparent that, when the knife is drawn across them transversely, the thin cutting disks will tilt and their \u201cstraight outer edges\u201d he the patentee\u2019s functional agency for sharpening the side of the drawn knife. But the specification does not leave this to reasoning inference or palpable mechanical effect, but it expressly asserts such is the fact when it says: <em>\u201cThe sharp edges of disk </em>engage both sides of the knife and sharpen the same.\u201d For it may well be asked: How could the \u201ccomparatively thin\u201d disks, hung on a holt so as \u201cto nearly fill the space\u201d as to permit \u201ca slight longitudinal movement of the <em>cutting </em>disks on the bolts,\u201d do anything else but tilt when the knife was drawn transversely across and thereby, as stated, \u201cthe sharp edges of the disk engage both sides of the knife and sharpen the same\u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">The disclosure thus made by Roberts of utilizing the edges of tilted, revoluble, overlapping disks to sharpen knives drawn transversely across them, it follows that no alleged subsequent invention could be deemed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>first invention, although Roberts may not have claimed all he disclosed. Milburn v. Davis, 270 U. S. 390, 46 S. Ct. 324, 70 L. Ed. 651. It is contended, however, that the specification did not disclose what we have stated above, and that we should not so construe it, because Eoberts did not claim such alleged invention in toto. In other words, i\u00a3 he had made such invention, he would have claimed it, and, because he did not claim it, he did not make it, and therefore did not disclose it. This contention may be plausible on its face; but, when the proofs are studied, the reason why Eoberts did not claim his disclosures in toto is plain. We shall not discuss those facts, but limit ourselves to saying that there had for many years been in public use by Eoberts in his butcher shop, and for several years in a grocery store in Pittsburgh from whose owner he got it, a knife sharpener, which was produced in court, which was identical with Figure 1 of Egberts\u2019 patent, if we eliminate the two upright ends <em>15 </em>and <em>16. </em>This earlier sharpener, it will be noted, engaged both sides of the knife edge, and Eoberts conceived the idea of adding the two upright ends and utilizing each set of cylinders with its adjoining upright to abrade but one side of the knife edge. He had to disclose the central double cylinder to show what his improvement at its two ends was; but he did not claim such device, because he was not the first inventor of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">It follows, therefore, that both by the long prior public use of knife sharpeners with the thin tilting cylinders, which made their edges the functional abrasive, and by the disclosure thereof, in Eoberts\u2019 specification in 1919, Lambert was not the first inventor thereof when he applied for his patent in 1923. So holding, the decree below should be and is now affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-21\"> \u201cThe object of my invention is to provide a sharpener for knives, scissors, and the like, in which both sides of the cutting edge thereof may be sharpened, and also providing means whereby either side of the cutting edge may be sharpened at different angles. Another object of the invention is to provide a sharpener of this character, in which the sharpening cylinders are composed of a series of rotatably supported disks spaced apart, so that the disk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>one cylinder overlaps the disk of the other, so that a greater sharpening surface is obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AoX6\">Referring to the accompanying Figure 1 the application proceeds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-6\">image</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">\"The housing 2 is of a rectangular form, slightly smaller than the base <em>1, </em>and has its side walls provided with upwardly curved portions 6* and 7, having openings 6\u2019 and <em>9, </em>in which are two bolts <em>10 </em>and <em>11 </em>which extend across the housing, and upon which are mounted the sharpening cylinders, as will now be described. The sharpening cylinders are formed of a series of disks IS, and, as shown, are comparatively thin, with straight outer edges <em>13 </em>and provided with openings <em>H </em>to receive the bolts <em>10 </em>and II. Any number of cutting disks may be used, and between each disk is a washer <em>\u00cdJ\u00a1, </em>the diameter of which is considerably less than that of the sharpening disk. The washers, like the disks, are provided with openings through which the bolts pass, and there are sufficient disks and washers on each bolt to <em>nearly fill </em>the space between the sides of the housing <em>2, </em>so that there is a <em>slight longitudinal movement of the cutting disks on the holts. </em>The bolts are so positioned that they pass between the sharpening disk carried by the other bolt, as clearly shown in Figs. 2 and 3 of the drawings. In the ordinary sharpening of a knife, and when it is desired to sharpen both sides, it is placed between the two sets of sharpening disks and drawn transversely of the housing, so that the <em>sharp edges </em>of the disk engage both sides of the knife and sharpen the same. The housing <em>2 </em>has its ends <em>15 </em>and <em>16 </em>extending upwardly a considerable distance to form the guides for sharpening one side-of the cutting edge of a knife, scissors, or other implements. The end, <em>15, </em>as shown is thickened or drawn inwardly, as indicated at 17, above the sharpening cylinder, so that a knife or scissors blade placed against the inner face thereof, and drawn transversely of the housing will be sharpened. The end Id is thickened, or drawn inwardly, as indicated at IS, to a greater extent than the end 17 so that its inner face is closer to the top of the disk, and whereby the point of contact of the knife is at a less angle when held against the end <em>16 </em>than when held against the end <em>15. </em>By this arrangement, applicant has produced a sharpener in which the proper bevel can be given to the cutting edges of different implements on either side, by drawing the tool across the same from different sides.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
