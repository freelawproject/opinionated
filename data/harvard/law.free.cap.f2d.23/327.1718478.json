This also was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-22\">It is very doubtful if the case is properly before us, but we are not disposed to scrutinize very closely the steps taken to bring it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">In his oral argument and upon his brief the appellant\u2019s counsel contends that the District Court of Porto Rico had jurisdiction of his petition, and could issue a writ of habeas corpus under Revised Statutes, \u00a7 753, Comp. Stat. 1916, \u00a7 1281 (28 USCA \u00a7 453), because the appellant is \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution * * * of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-24\">The judgment of the district court for the judicial district of Guayama, Porto Rico, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Porto Rico on April 15,1925. No appeal was taken, nor writ of error prosecuted, from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>judgment. It is not now contended that any error was committed in the trial of his ease in the courts of Porto Rico, or that he was convicted without the due process guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. The sole ground upon which the petition for the writ of habeas corpus is based is the alleged confession by another party that he committed the crime for which the appellant is serving a sentence made after the petitioner had entered upon his term of imprisonment. This might be urged as the proper subject for executive clemency, but it affords no basis for judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Under the facts presented by this record, the United States District Court for the District of Porto Rico was without jurisdiction t\u00f3 issue the writ, and therefore did not err in denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
