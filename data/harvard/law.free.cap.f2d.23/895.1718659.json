It is insisted, however, that appellee company is appropriating the corporate name of the Oil Company. It is unnecessary to discuss this proposition, in view of our decision this day delivered in Three in One Oil Co. v. Lobl Manufacturing Co., 57 App. D. C. -, 23 F.(2d) 893.</p>\n<p id=\"AQg\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
