For a recital of the doings which led to the decree of the District Court holding the bankrupts guilty of contempt, we refer to the opinion rendered by this court in the intermediate case of Marcus et al. v. United States, 20 F.(2d) 454, and the opinion of the trial court in Re Marcus, 21 F.(2d) 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-29\">The decree here on review not only had its rise in bankruptcy but was rendered by a bankruptcy court. The first question is whether or not a court of bankruptcy has jurisdiction to entertain a petition and enter a decree for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-30\">The appellants maintain that, as the general jurisdiction of the court is purely statutory, its jurisdiction over contempts is limited by the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA), of which there are but two, namely, section 41b and section 2 (13). 30 Stat. 544; Comp. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 9625, 9586 (11 USCA \u00a7\u00a7' 11, 69). They say that section 41b did not confer jurisdiction upon the court to enter this decree because that section gives it jurisdiction over matters of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>tempt only in proceedings on a certificate of a referee, where a person has, \u201cin proceedings before a referee,\u201d done one of the things forbidden by section 41a (11 USCA \u00a7 69), while the bankrupts\u2019 action here was not one of those things. This provision looks like an express statutory extension \u2018 of the court\u2019s inherent contempt jurisdiction over its own orders to orders of a referee. However that may b\u00e9, we are in accord with the appellants\u2019 contention on the facts and hold that the court of bankruptcy in this proceeding for contempt did not have jurisdiction under section 41b of the Bankruptcy Act. Biderman v. Cooper (C. C. A.) 273 F. 683. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Turning to section 2 of the act whereby District Courts of the United States are made courts of bankruptcy with jurisdiction (13) to \u201cenforce obedience by bankrupts, officers, and other persons to all lawful orders, by fine or imprisonment or fine and imprisonment,\u201d the appellants argue that this jurisdictional provision was not invoked in, nor can it apply to, the instant case because the court did not attempt to enforce obedience to its order by fine or imprisonment as there provided but sought to enforce obedience by commanding the bankrupts to return goods or pay money to the trustee, when the provision does not confer jurisdiction to make such an order. Whatever force there may be in this contention it avails the appellants nothing in view of the settled law that courts of the United States, when called into existence and vested with jurisdiction over any subject, at once become possessed of the power to punish for contempt,, which is inherent in all courts and essential to the administration of justice. Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. (86 U. S.) 505, 510, 22 L. Ed. 205; In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 594,15 S. Ct. 900, 30 L. Ed. 1092; Michaelson v. United States, 266 U. S. 42, 65, 45 S. Ct. 18, 69 L. Ed. 162, 35 A. L. R. 451; Boyd v. Glucklich, 116 F. (C. C. A. 8th), 131; Kelton v. United States (C. C. A.) 294 F. 491, 493. And this is equally true of courts of bankruptcy. In re Kahn (C. C. A.) 204 F. 581, 582; Biderman v. Cooper (C. C. A.) 273 F. 683, 684. Unless divested or arrested by some controlling circumstance, the court of bankruptcy had jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The appellants, however, insist there was such a circumstance, in that there was no previous order of the bankruptcy court that the bankrupts could disobey and, accordingly, no order on which to base the decree imposing punishment for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The order on which the corporate trustee, by its petition, based this proceeding for contempt is the court\u2019s order made at the beginning of the bankruptcy proceeding appointing it receiver and directing the bankrupts \u201cto deliver and convey\u201d their property to the receiver. Continuing, the petitioning trustee charged that at the time it took possession as receiver, and at other times, the bankrupts, then in its employ, \u201cwell knowing said order of this court, did clandestinely remove large amounts of merchandise and assets from the custody of the receiver without the knowledge of the receiver, and with-intent to defraud the receiver and the creditors of the said alleged bankrupts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The bankrupts contend that the only part of this order directed to them was that which-required them to deliver and convey their property to the receiver and that they obeyed it by making delivery. To the charge that they clandestinely removed goods so delivered they reply that, if true, it might amount to larceny or interference with the possession of 'the receiver\u2019s assets but could not be-disobedience of the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Implicit in the order upon the bankrupts to deliver and convey their property to the receiver was the mandate that they permit their property when delivered to remain in its possession, for delivery followed by immediate withdrawal is no delivery at all.. Delivery of property in the sense of the order means surrender of property. To give with one hand and take back with the other and call it obeying the order to deliver was sheer artifice. The court entered the decree for contempt against the bankrupts on a finding that they had, with intent to defraud the estate, clandestinely removed from the custody and possession of the receiver property which under a previous order they had delivered to the receiver for care and management pending the outcome of the bankruptcy-proceeding. Clearly their action amounted to interference with property in the custody of the court of bankruptcy for which that court had jurisdiction to impose punishment-It -was not necessary that the court should in the previous order specifically command the bankrupts not to take back property which they had just delivered to its receiver, for no-rule is better settled than that, when a court has appointed a receiver, his possession is the possession of the court and cannot' be disturbed without-leave of the court, and that if any person within its jurisdiction, without, leave, intentionally interferes with such possession, he necessarily commits a contempt of court and is liable to punishment therefor. In re Tyler, 149 U. S. 164, 181, 13 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Ct. 785, 37 L. Ed. 689; In re Dialogue (D. C.) 215 F. 462, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The bankrupts\u2019 next line of defense is that, if what they did was to interfere with tho receiver\u2019s possession of property of the bankrupt estate, it was interference with the court\u2019s possession, and, if contempt at all, it was contempt of the court\u2019s authority, and therefore criminal contempt, and being criminal, tho bankrupts (falling back to a still further' line of defense) next claim they were entitled under the Clayton Act to trial by jury. 38 Stat. 738; section 387, tit. 28, U. S. Code (28 USCA \u00a7 387; Comp. St. \u00a7 1245b).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">To avoid a hurried conclusion from the bankrupts\u2019 premises, we must inquire whether the order on appeal is indeed for criminal contempt. Conceivably the thing done by the bankrupt's might have been criminal (Marcus v. United States [C. C. A.] 20 F. [2d] 454), but that would not necessarily make the contempt proceeding and the decree for contempt criminal. They might he civil, according to what tho court did and what it intended. Realizing that it is \u201cnot always * * * easy to classify a particular act as belonging to either one of these two classes,\u201d and that \u201cit may partake of the characteristics of both\u201d (Bessette v. Conkey, 194 U. S. 329, 24 S. Ct. 665, 48 L. Ed. 997), and recognizing also that in every decree for contempt, whether civil or criminal, punishment is involved, the Supreme Court has made clear that it is not tho fact of punishment but rather its character and purpose that serves to distinguish between the two classes of cases. \u201cIf it is for civil contempt the punishment is remedial, and for the benefit of the complainant. But if it is for criminal contempt the sentence is punitive, to vindicate the authority of the court.\u201d Gompers v. Buck\u2019s Stove <em>&amp; </em>Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 441-443, 31 S. Ct. 492, 498 (55 L. Ed. 797, 34 L. R. A. [N. S.] 874); In re Kahn (C. C. A.) 204 F. 581, 582; Biderman v. Cooper (C. C. A.) 273 F. 683, 684. Applying this settled law to the instant case, it is evident that the purpose of the court in entering the decree for contempt, commanding the bankrupts to deliver to their trustee \u201cassorted groceries so clandestinely removed, or in lien thereof, shall pay to the said trustee the sum of $31,300,\u201d was not punitive and not made to vindicate the authority of the court but was remedial and made to restore the abstracted property or its money equivalent to the bankrupt estate. We think, therefore, the decree plainly falls within the definition of civil contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">On this holding the bankrupts\u2019 contention that under the Clayton Act they are entitled to trial by jury fails under authority of Michaelson v. United States, 266 U. S. 42, 45 S. Ct. 18, 69 L. Ed. 162, 35 A. L. R. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"AgY\">The bankrupts next assign error in the court\u2019s ruling on a matter of evidence. The witness Dobkin was asked by the bankrupts\u2019 attorney whether or not he had a conversation with a man named Baskin in which he told Baskin that he was going to send this fool to jail, moaning one of the bankrupts. The witness answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Later,- the bankrupts put Baskin on the stand and their attorney, claiming that he had laid grounds for contradiction, proposed to prove by the witness the conversation which Dobkin had denied, as showing bias and prejudice of the witness Dobkin. The court, remarking that the matter was \u201crather collateral,\u201d rejected the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">This proceeding in contempt was, in truth, an inquiry instituted and prosecuted by the court within what has been from time immemorial tho special function of courts to determine the offense of contempt. Kelton v. United States (C. C. A.) 294 F. 491, 493. The court was judge of both the facts and tho law. If its ruling was technically erroneous, we cannot say \u2014 indeed we do not think \u2014 it was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">And, finally, we are satisfied that there is ampio evidence to sustain the findings and decree of the court and that it is not void by reason of indefiniteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
