This mark is used on chocolate containing milk and cream preparations in liquid form.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-21\">The petitioner, Hunter, claims that he is damaged- by the registration, of the Russell mark, and alleges prior use of the word \u201cChoc-o-lishus\u201d as a trade-mark for chocolate syrup and other preparations, including chocolate flavored milk. It is urged by the petitioner that the dominant characteristic of the Russell trade-mark, the abbreviation of the word \u201cChoco\u201d for \u201cchocolate,\u201d is so similar to \u201cChoc-o-lishus,\u201d the dominating feature of which he asserts is \u201cChoco,\u201d as to cause confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-22\">We agree with the Commissioner that the abbreviation \u201cChoco\u201d is not the dominant feature of the Russell trade-mark. Nor do we find any such similarity between the two marks as in our judgment would lead to confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-23\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
