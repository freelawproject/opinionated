There was evidence to the following effeet:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">For many years prior to 1913 appellant was engaged in manufacturing and selling live stock mixed feeds, including horse and dairy feeds. In that year appellant purchased from Harry H. Hughes, who for several years had conducted a similar kind of business under the name \u201cJust \u25a0 Milling &amp; Feed Company,\u201d and whose mill at Nashville, Tenn., for manufacturing mixed stock feeds, was called \u201cJust Mills,\u201d his physical property used in that business, his good will, trademarks, and trade-names. For several years prior to that sale Hughes manufactured and sold in several states, including Tennessee and Alabama, animal feeds under names which contained the word \u201cJust,\u201d including \u201cJust Horse Feed\u201d and \u201cJust Dairy\u2019 Feed.\u201d In 1911 Hughes registered in the United States Patent Office a trade-mark for stock and poultry feed, consisting of the word \u201cJust\u201d under a picture of a weighing scale. Since the date of its purchase'from Hug\u2019hes, appellant has continuously manufactured and sold in the above-mentioned territory animal feeds under names whieh contained the word \u201cJust,\u201d including \u201cJust Dairy Feed\u201d and \u201cJust Grainola Feed.\u201d Some time prior to June, 1923, the appellee began marketing cow feeds and horse feeds under names whieh included the words \u201cJust Right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">Appellee alleged in its answer to the bill that it adopted the phrase \u201cJust Right\u201d in the year 1920 as a trade-mark for its stock feeds, and has continuously since that time used that trade-mark in its business; but the \u2022 evidence does not show when appellee\u2019s use of those words in the names of its .products commenced. In what is printed on bags containing appellee\u2019s products, the colors used, green and red, are like those used on the bags . in whieh appellant\u2019s products are and have been marketed. At the top of the bags in whieh feeds of the appellant are marketed, the word \u201cJust\u201d is displayed in large letters, and on bags in whieh similar products of the appellee are marketed the words \u201cJust Right\u201d are displayed in large letters of similar color and typography, and in the same location. Evidence adduced convincingly indicated that appellee\u2019s use of the words \u201cJust Right\u201d in the names of its products is the means of confusing its products with those of the appellant, and of deceiving sellers and buyers into selling and accepting products of the appellee, when products of the appellant are intended to be dealt in.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">The allegation as to the registration by Hughes, appellant\u2019s predecessor in business, of tiie word \u201cJust\u201d as a trade-mark, was not sustained by the evidence; as that word alone did not constitute what was registered by him as a trade-mark. It was suggested in argument in behalf 'of the appellee that the word \u201cJust\u201d was not subject to exclusive appropriation as a trade-mark for the articles in reference to or in connection with which it was used by the appellant, as it was descriptive of those articles, or indicative of their quality or characteristics, in that sueh names as \u201cJust Horse Feed\u201d or \u201cJust Dairy Feed\u201d indicate that the animal feed referred to is only or solely horse feed or dairy feed, or is a balanced feed for the kind of animals indicated. If appellant was entitled to relief on the ground of unfair competition, it is not material to determine whether the word \u201cJust\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>used by the appellant does or does not constitute a valid trade-mark for animal feeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Evidence as to the long-continued exclusive use-by the appellant and its predecessor in business of the word \u201cJust\u201d in the business of manufacturing and selling mixed animal feeds \u2014 in the names given to feeds marketed, in the name under which a predecessor of the appellant conducted his business, and in the name of a mill in which such feeds were manufactured \u2014 indicated that such use had resulted in that word becoming so associated in the minds of dealers in and buyers of such products in appellant\u2019s trade territory with products of the appellant as to identify to such dealers and buyers as products of the appellant animal feeds marketed under names including that word and one or more other words, and of rendering probable the failure of ordinary buyers of such products to discriminate between appellant\u2019s products, marketed under names including that word, from similar products of a competitor of appellant, marketed under names including the words \u201cJust Right.\u201d It may be inferred that, as used by the appellant in the names of its products, \u201cJust\u201d was a catehword by which appellant\u2019s products came to be known and remembered by ordinary buyers, with the result that such buyers, intending to get a product of the appellant, when acting without an opportunity of comparing the appearance of a product of the appellant as prepared for marketing with that of a similar product of a business competitor of the appellant, marketed under a name a salient part of which is the word \u201cJust,\u201d would fail to notice the dissimilarity in the names and accept the competitor\u2019s product as that of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">There may be unfair competition, against which injunctive relief may be afforded, where the similarity between a name given to one dealer\u2019s commodity and a name subsequently given by another dealer to his commodity of like kind is such as is likely to mislead buyers of ordinary caution and prudence into believing that the commodity of the dealer who was later in naming his commodity is that of the other dealer, though the similarity is not such as to deceive persons seeing the two commodities side by side; and if there is a manifest liability to deceive it is not necessary that a buyer has been actually deceived. Hydraulic Press Brick Co. v. Stevens (C. C. A.) 15 F. (2d) 312; The Best Foods v. Hemphill Packing Co. (D. C.) 5 F.(2d) 355; Northam Warren Corporation v. Universal Cosmetic Co. (C. C. A.) 18 F.(2d) 774; Fuller v. Huff (C. C. A.) 104 F. 141, 51 L. R. A. 332; Nims on Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks (2d Ed.), \u00a7 326. We conclude that the long-continued exclusive use by the appellant of the word \u201cJust\u201d in the names of its animal feeds was such that the subsequently commenced use by the appellee in the same trade territory of the same word in the names of its similar products constituted unfair competition, subject to be enjoined at the instance of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In behalf of the appellee it was contended that the action of the court in dismissing the bill for want of equity cannot be reviewed, because the record does not show that it contains all the evidence introduced in the trial of the cause. At the end of a document setting out testimony of witnesses, and to which was attached exhibits referred to, appears the following certificate, which was signed by the trial judge: \u201cThe foregoing narrative statement of the evidence is hereby allowed and approved, and same is hereby ordered filed as a statement of the evidence to be included in the record on appeal in the above-styled eause, as provided in paragraph (b) of equity rule 75.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">We are of opinion that that certificate imports that what was so certified to included all of the evidence essential to the decision of the questions presented by the appeal.' Equity rule 75 (b) provides for the omission of all parts of the evidence not essential to the decision of those questions. Attention is called to the fact that the record does not contain the tags referred to in the following part of the testimony of a witness, who stated that dealers offered \u201cJust Right Feed\u201d when he called for \u201cJust Feed\u201d: \u201cThe tags (offered in evidence as Exhibits 10 and 11) are tags from the \u2018Just Right\u2019 cow feed bags at\u201d the places of business of the dealers mentioned. It is not clear from the record that the tags so referred to were admitted in evidence. If they were admitted in evidence, it well may be inferred that they were not copied in or attached to the statement of the evidence, because not essential to the decision of the questions presented by the appeal. We think that the record satisfactorily shows that it contains all the evidence essential to the decision of the question of unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The decree is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
