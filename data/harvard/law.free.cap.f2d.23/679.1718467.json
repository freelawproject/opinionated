It sufficiently alleges carrying on the business of selling by one who was required to register and who had not; but the proof tended to show nothing except the purchase by respondent of narcotics in or from an unstamped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>package. One who only buys or sells in or from unstamped packages is not required to register. Weaver v. U. S. (C. C. A.) 15 F.(2d) 38; Martin v. U. S. (C. C. A.) 20 F.(2d) 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The second count is good. There was substantial evidence to go to the jury. The sentence did not exceed that imposable under the second count. It is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
