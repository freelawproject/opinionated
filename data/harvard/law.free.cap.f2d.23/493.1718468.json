The granting or refusal of the motion for continuance was in the discretion of the trial court. The granting or refusal of the motion for new trial, was likewise in the discretion of the trial* court; and no useful purpose could have been subserved by further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-19\">Petition for rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
