The law excludes from registration trade-marks which are \u201cidentical with * * k or which so nearly resemble a registered or known trademark owned and in use by another * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers.\u201d Trade-Mark Act 1905, \u00a7 5, as-amended (15 USCA \u00a7 85). The Commissioner disposed of the case upon the single question of whether or not the marks were so similar as to cause confusion in trade. The goods on which the marks are used are concededly the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">We are of opinion that the trade-mark \u201cPharaoh\u201d is not so similar either in appearance, sound, or suggestion to any of the op-poser\u2019s marks as to mislead the public and produce confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
