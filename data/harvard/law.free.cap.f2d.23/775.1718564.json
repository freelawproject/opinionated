The opposer is the prior user of the mark \u201cButtermels\u201d as a trade-mark for candy.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-21\">Unquestionably the words \u201cbutter\u201d and \u201choney,\u201d standing alone, are descriptive; but, when joined to the suffix \u201cmels,\u201d they are nothing more than suggestive, and arc subject to use as valid trade-marks. The suffix \u201cmels,\u201d meaning sweets, has had a use on candy in connection with the mark \u201ccaramels\u201d long prior to the adoption and use of opposer^ mark. Indeed, the name \u201ccaramels\u201d is a common one, extensively employed to refer to candy mixtures of a popular kind. Both parties have borrowed this suffix, and by combination with descriptive terms have constructed legitimate trade-marks. The suffix \u201cmels\u201d being common to both marks, the distinctive feature is between the words \u201choney\u201d and \u201cbutter.\u201d It was properly held by the Commissioner that no confusion could arise from the use of these two words in connection with the same quality of goods. With this holding we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-22\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
