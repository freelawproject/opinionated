We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Eisenman's assignment of error to the admission of his convictions is based on <em>State v. Burton.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Since filing the briefs, <em>Burton </em>has been overruled by <em>State v. Ray, </em>116 Wn.2d 531, 806 P.2d 1220 (1991). <em>Ray </em>explicitly holds that theft crimes are per se admissible under ER 609(a)(2), hence, Eisenman's convictions were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Applicability of <em>State v. Ray</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">In his petition for rehearing, Eisenman asserts that since <em>State v. Ray, supra, </em>was decided subsequent to his trial it cannot be applied to validate the admission of his convictions. We address the issue but deny any relief. Eisenman is correct that any retroactive effect of judicial decisions is subject to due process and ex post facto limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \"[W]here a court overrules a prior decision so as to enlarge the scope of criminal liability, [due process requires that] the new rule must be applied prospectively only.\" <em>State v. Gore, </em>101 Wn.2d 481, 489, 681 P.2d 227 (1984). A new law violates the ex post facto prohibition if it (1) aggravates a crime; (2) imposes more severe punishment; or (3) permits less or different testimony to convict the offender.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>On the other hand, a change in the law does not violate the the ex post facto provision if it neither increases the punishment for an offense nor alters the ingredients of the offense, the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt, or the degree of proof necessary. <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Edwards, </em>104 Wn.2d [63,] at 71 [701 P.2d 508 (1985)] (citing <em>Hopt v. Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 590, 28 L. Ed. 262, 4 S. Ct. 202 (1884)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><em>State v. Henderson, </em>50 Wn. App. 158, 160, 747 P.2d 504 (1987), <em>aff'd, </em>114 Wn.2d 867, 792 P.2d 514 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The <em>Ray </em>holding that theft convictions are per se admissible under ER 609(a)(2) does not increase the punishment, change the elements of the offense, nor change the facts or the degree of proof required to establish guilt. Accordingly, the admission of Eisenman's convictions under <em>Ray </em>is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The rule concerning retroactive application of eviden-tiary rulings is authoritatively stated in <em>Hopt v. Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 590, 28 L. Ed. 262, 4 S. Ct. 202 (1884):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">Any statutory alteration of the legal rules of evidence which would authorize conviction upon less proof, in amount or degree, than was required when the offence was committed, might, in respect of that offence, be obnoxious to the constitutional inhibition upon <em>ex post facto </em>laws. But alterations which do not increase the punishment, nor change the ingredients of the offence or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt, but \u2014 leaving untouched the nature of the crime and the amount or degree of proof essential to conviction \u2014 only remove existing restrictions upon the competency of certain classes of persons as witnesses, relate to modes of procedure only, in which no one can be said to have a vested right, and which the State, upon grounds of public policy, may regulate at pleasure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The <em>Hopt </em>analysis was reexamined and expressly approved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Dobbert v. </em>Florida.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In upholding a conviction in a capital case, the <em>Dobbert </em>Court stated that \"[e]ven though it may work to the disadvantage of a defendant, a procedural change is not <em>ex post facto.\u201d Dobbert, </em>432 U.S. at 293. Although no Washington case has addressed the precise point, <em>Hopt </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>has been cited with approval by a number of Washington courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><em>State v. </em>Brown<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Brown </em>II) does not suggest a different result. The court there applied its holding \u2014 that a defendant had to testify to preserve errors under ER 609(a) \u2014 prospectively only. The <em>Brown </em>court noted that retroactivity per se was not the issue, but rather whether to apply the rule there adopted<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the defendant Brown. Had <em>Brown </em>applied retroactively, it would unfairly prejudice defendants relying on prior Washington law<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because any defendant who chose not to testify in view of an in limine ruling admitting certain convctions would be deprived of the opportunity to challenge their admission. No such considerations are here present. Eisenman did testify, the jury heard his version of the facts and he now has his opportunity to challenge admission of the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We agree with the <em>Hopt </em>analysis and hold that the rule announced in <em>Ray </em>that theft crimes are per se admissible under ER 609(a)(2) applies retroactively to the eviden-tiary rulings in Eisenman's trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Assessment of Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Eisenman argues that the trial court failed to find a present or future ability to pay costs, and that it therefore erred in assessing $70 in court costs and $100 for the victim assessment fund. The State contends that Eisen-man has the ability to pay the very minimal $17 a year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>for 10 years to fulfill his obligation, and that this does not infringe on his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">RCW 10.01.160 authorizes a trial court to impose costs and attorney fees on a convicted indigent if he is able to pay, or will be able to pay. In <em>Fuller v. </em>Oregon,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court set out conditions that recoupment statutes must satisfy to be constitutional. Fuller was assessed fees and expenses incurred by his attorney and investigator under an Oregon recoupment statute identical to RCW 10.01.160, which was enacted in Washington after <em>Fuller. </em>The central question was whether Fuller's right to counsel was compromised by the assessment of fees. The Court determined that recoupment in that case was constitutional because the Oregon statute contained important safeguards against imposition of fees against defendants who are indigent and will likely remain so.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Those safeguards were delineated more fully by the Washington State Supreme Court in <em>State v. Barklind </em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Like <em>Fuller, Barklind </em>also involved a challenge to the assessment of attorney fees. After pleading guilty, Bark-lind was assessed $150 for a portion of the cost of his court-appointed attorney, to be paid at the rate of $25 a month. The court determined that Barklind's right to counsel was not impeded by the trial court's assessment of fees, because the assessment followed the requirements of <em>Fuller.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>State v. </em>Earls<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> followed from <em>Fuller </em>and <em>Barklind. </em>In <em>Earls, </em>the trial court ordered the defendant to pay attorney fees of $6,125.90 and costs of $2,608.43. On appeal the court reversed imposition of the costs, citing the lower court's failure to make findings concerning Earls\u2019 \"present or future ability to pay, his financial resources, or the likelihood indigency will change.\" <em>Earls, </em>at 196. The <em>Earls </em>court also stated that although compensation paid jurors cannot be recouped,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a $50 jury fee may be recouped, as may a $70 court filing fee. The <em>Earls </em>court did not determine whether a $70 filing fee and a victim assessment fee required a separate formal finding if there are no other fees assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The court in <em>State v. </em>Hayes<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> went a step further. Relying on <em>Earls, </em>it held that the trial court erred in ordering the defendant to pay court costs ($101), attorney fees ($447), and contribute to a drug fund ($100) and a victim assessment fund ($70), because the trial court should have entered specific findings on the defendant's ability to pay, his financial resources, and the likelihood that his indigency status will change. Without adequate explanation, the <em>Hayes </em>court lumped all fees and costs together, finding that there was no distinction between attorney fees and contributions to a drug fund.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>We do not interpret <em>Hayes </em>to require that the imposition of every fee or cost requires formal findings, especially if the amount is minimal, so long as the imposition does not infringe on the right to counsel. In the present case, the court assessed Eisenman a total of $170. There is no justification in <em>Fuller, Barklind, </em>or <em>Earls </em>for the proposition that a filing fee and a victim assessment amounting to $17 a year for 10 years infringes on a person's right to counsel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is not even clear that the $100 victim assessment should be considered a \"cost\", because it is imposed under a separate statute that is not concerned with recoupment of costs incurred by the State, RCW 7.68.035, and does not appear discretionary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In any case, it is a rare defendant who cannot afford such a minimal payment, and if costs are imposed on a defendant who truly cannot pay, or later is unable to pay, that person will not be subject to incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Requiring formal findings where the assessments amount to a few hundred dollars would cost the public more than it would gain, and is unnecessary to protect the defendant in light of the <em>Barklind </em>conditions. Indeed, the court utilized this reasoning in waiving Eisenman's attorney fees, stating that \"it would cost more to try to collect it than the money involved would be.\" We find that where Eisenman's attorney fees were requested by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>prosecutor and disallowed, the trial court impliedly concluded that Eisenman had an ability to pay the $70 in court costs and $100 for the victim assessment fund. Accordingly, we hold that the court did not err in assessing the $70 in costs and the $100 for the victim assessment fund without a formal finding as to Eisenman's ability to pay, his financial resources, or the likelihood his indigency will change.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Baker and Agid, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">After modification, further reconsideration denied August 29, 1991.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\"> 101 Wn.2d 1, 676 P.2d 975 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-10\"><em>State v.
