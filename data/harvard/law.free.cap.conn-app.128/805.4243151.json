Karl and Susan Moore, appeal from the judgment, rendered after a trial to the court, in favor of the plaintiff, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. On appeal, the defendants claim that the court improperly denied their motion to dismiss the summary process complaint. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendants\u2019 appeal. The plaintiff took title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>to 38 Georgetown Road in Weston, by virtue of a certificate of foreclosure dated February 14, 2007. On February 2,2009, a notice to quit was served on the defendants by abode service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The plaintiff commenced this summary process action on February 20, 2009. On April 3, 2009, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the notice to quit was improper for failure to name the landlord or owner of the subject property, thus depriving the court of subject matter jurisdiction. After argument on the motion on April 23, 2009, the court denied the motion to dismiss, finding, inter aha, that the notice to quit statute, General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> expressly permits an owner\u2019s legal representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>to provide the notice. The parties proceeded to trial on April 8, 2010, and the court rendered judgment of possession in favor of the plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The defendants\u2019 sole claim on appeal is that the notice to quit was defective for failure to state the name of the owner of the subject property. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">\u201cA motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [decision to deny] . . . the motion to dismiss will be de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caruso </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>285 Conn. 618, 627, 941 A.2d 266 (2008); see also <em>South Sea Co. </em>v. <em>Global Turbine Component Technologies, LLC, </em>95 Conn. App. 742, 744, 899 A.2d 642 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">\u201cBefore the [trial] court can entertain a summary process action and evict a tenant, the owner of the land must previously have served the tenant with notice to quit. ... As a condition precedent to a summary process action, proper notice to quit [pursuant to \u00a7 47a-23] is a jurisdictional necessity. . . . This court\u2019s review of the trial court\u2019s determination as to whether the notice to quit served by the plaintiff effectively conferred subject matter jurisdiction is plenary. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">\u201cWe further observe that [s]ummary process is a special statutory procedure designed to provide an expeditious remedy. ... It enable [s] landlords to obtain possession of leased premises without suffering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>delay, loss and expense to which, under the common-law actions, they might be subjected by tenants wrongfully holding over their terms. . . . Summary process statutes secure a prompt hearing and final determination. . . . Therefore, the statutes relating to summary process must be narrowly construed and strictly followed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bayer </em>v. <em>Showmotion, Inc., </em>292 Conn. 381, 388, 973 A.2d 1229 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. ... In seeking to determine [the] meaning [of a statute], General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extra-textual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Developmental Services, </em>297 Conn. 391, 399, 999 A.2d 682 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The defendants acknowledge that it is \u201cundisputed that the landlord\u2019s attorney may sign the notice to quit\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but argue that \u201cif an essential purpose of the notice to quit is to apprise the tenant of the information which he needs to defend the eviction then it would make sense that the notice to quit state the identity of the landlord . . . .\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">The text of \u00a7 47a-23 is clear and unambiguous. The legislature used language indicating that notice shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>given by \u201cowner or lessor, or the owner\u2019s or lessor\u2019s legal representative, or the owner\u2019s or lessor\u2019s attomeyat-law, or in-fact.\u201d In fact, three times in this statutory section, the legislature identified \u201cthe owner\u2019s or lessor\u2019s legal representative, or the owner\u2019s or lessor\u2019s attomey-at-law, or in-fact\u201d as one category of individuals authorized by the statute to provide notice. The use of the word \u201cor\u201d in \u00a7 47a-23, instead of \u201cand,\u201d suggests \u201cin the alternative.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the owner and the owner\u2019s legal representative both are included in the specific array of possible individuals who might give notice, we cannot see how the statute as written requires that the notice to quit reflect <em>both </em>the owner\u2019s identity <em>and </em>the identity of the owner\u2019s legal representative, attomeyat-law or attorney-in-fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Furthermore, if, in contemplating the content of the notice to quit, the legislature considered the identity of the owner to be necessary, it could have included such requirement in the list of information under \u00a7 47a-23 (b) where it provides that \u201cnotice shall be in writing substantially in the following form . . . .\u201d It is well settled that \u201c[w]e are not permitted to supply statutory language that the legislature may have chosen to omit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ventres </em>v. <em>Goodspeed </em>Airport, <em>LLC, </em>275 Conn. 105, 160, 881 A.2d 937 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1111, 126 S. Ct. 1913, 164 L. Ed. 2d 664 (2006). We decline the defendants\u2019 invitation to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\"> The defendants do not dispute that the notice to quit was properly served. The notice stated: \u201cI hereby terminate your lease and give you notice that you are to move out of the premises you occupy at 38 Georgetown Road, Weston, Connecticut, on or before February 7, 2009, for the following reasons: You originally had the right or privilege to occupy the premises, but such right or privilege has terminated. If you do not move by the date stated above, I may start an eviction action against you. Any payments tendered after service of the Notice to Quit Possession will be accepted for reimbursement of costs and attorney\u2019s fees and for use and occupancy only with reservation to continue with the eviction action.

Bishop, Attorney For Owner\u2019. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b831-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) When the owner or lessor, or the owner\u2019s or lessor\u2019s legal representative, or the owner\u2019s or lessor\u2019s attomey-at-law, or in-fact, desires to obtain possession or occupancy of any land or building . . . such owner or lessor, or such owner\u2019s or lessor\u2019s legal representative, or such owner\u2019s or lessor\u2019s attomey-at-law, or in-fact, shall give notice to each lessee or occupant to quit possession or occupancy of such land [or] building ... at least three days . . . before the time specified in the notice for the lessee or occupant to quit possession or occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">(b) The notice shall be in writing substantially in the following form: \u2018I . . . hereby give you notice that you are to quit possession or occupancy of the (land [or] building . . .), now occupied by you at (here insert the address . . .), on or before the (here insert the date) for the following reason (here insert the reason or reasons for the notice to quit possession or occupancy using the statutory language or words of similar import, also the date and place of signing notice).
