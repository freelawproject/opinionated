From January, 2005, to March, 2007, the defendant lived with his parents in Prospect, and D.L. lived with her parents and siblings in Waterbury. During this time, the defendant and D.L. regularly spent time together, as the two were cousins whose families would often gather to share holidays, parties and other family occasions. On March 25, 2007, D.L., who was then seven years old, revealed to her mother, R.L., that the defendant previously had sexually abused her during visits in both Prospect and Waterbury. Soon thereafter, R.L. informed detectives of the Waterbury police department of her daughter\u2019s revelations, and a formal investigation of the alleged abuse was initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>On April 9, 2007, D.L. underwent a forensic interview during which she recounted in detail the nature of the defendant\u2019s sexually abusive behavior. This interview was recorded by videotape in its entirety and the substance of D.L.\u2019s statements during the interview were later confirmed by the defendant himself in a voluntary statement that he made to Waterbury police detectives on May 18, 2007. Additionally, on May 21, 2007, D.L. underwent a physical examination that corroborated further her account of the defendant\u2019s sexually abusive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged in two separate informations<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with four counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2), four counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) and two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1). The cases were consolidated and, following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of the four counts of sexual assault in the first degree and the four counts of risk of injury to a child.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court imposed a total effective sentence of thirty years incarceration, execution suspended after twenty-three years, with ten years of probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">ADMISSIBILITY OF VIDEOTAPED INTERVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly admitted as substantive evidence the videotaped interview of D.L. Specifically, the defendant claims that, given the highly suggestive and leading manner in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the interviewer elicited answers from D.L., D.L.\u2019s videotaped account of the defendant\u2019s abusive conduct was coerced and is grievously unreliable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude the state from admitting as evidence the videotaped interview of D.L. In support of this motion, the defendant argued, inter alia, that the coercive nature by which D.L.\u2019s description of the sexual abuse was procured rendered the videotaped interview grievously unreliable and, therefore, inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">On January 23, 2009, an evidentiary hearing was held on the defendant\u2019s motion, dining which the defendant presented the expert testimony of a clinical psychologist, David M. Mantell. Mantell testified that in his professional opinion, \u201cthe validity of the investigation techniques\u201d used during D.L.\u2019s interview were \u201cso seriously marked from the best practices, that . . . they invalidate [d] the procedural integrity of the [entire] evaluation.\u201d More precisely, Mantell criticized the \u201csuggestive techniques\u201d utilized by the interviewer during D.L.\u2019s examination; techniques that he found \u201cproduce^] results of a questionable memory . . . .\u201d At the conclusion of Mantell\u2019s testimony, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine, ruling that \u201cMantell\u2019s review [of the videotape], with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight . . . does show that some questions could be better worded . . . but not that [D.L.\u2019s] testimony was coerced.\u201d As the court explained, the \u201cfailure to comply with protocols or prevailing standards does not necessarily connote grievous unreliability,\u201d as otherwise required for exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">During the state\u2019s case-in-chief, D.L. testified as to the defendant\u2019s sexually abusive behavior; however, her testimony in this regard was often inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the details she provided during her videotaped interview. As such, following D.L.\u2019s testimony, the state moved to introduce the portions of the videotaped interview that were inconsistent with D.L.\u2019s trial testimony as substantive evidence pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), and \u00a7 8-5 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response, the defendant argued that D.L.\u2019s \u201cstatement[s] [during the interview] were taken in such circumstances that they undermine[d] the reliability of the statements]\u201d and should be excluded under <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>253 Conn. 280, 306-307, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000). The court then granted the state\u2019s request to admit \u201cthose portions of the tape that [were] inconsistent with [D.L.\u2019s] testimony,\u201d and, at the behest of the defendant, the entire videotaped interview eventually was admitted and shown to the jury members.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The defendant now claims that the court improperly admitted D.L.\u2019s videotaped interview as substantive evidence. Specifically, the defendant maintains that because of the overtly suggestive manner by which the interviewer obtained D.L.\u2019s account of the defendant\u2019s sexually abusive behavior, the videotaped interview should have been excluded as grievously unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we begin by setting forth the applicable standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>review and legal principles governing our analysis. \u201c[T]he admissibility of evidence, including the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement pursuant to <em>Whelan, </em>is a matter within the . . . discretion of the trial court. . . . [T]he trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. . . . On review by this court, therefore, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>286 Conn. 634, 643, 945 A.2d 449 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 306-307, our Supreme Court explained \u201cthat the linchpin of admissibility [under <em>Whelan] </em>is reliability: the [prior inconsistent] statement may be excluded as substantive evidence only if the trial court is persuaded, in light of the circumstances under which the statement was made, that the statement is so untrustworthy that its admission into evidence would subvert the fairness of the fact-finding process. In the absence of such a showing by the party seeking to exclude a statement that meets the <em>Whelan </em>criteria, the statement is admissible as substantive evidence; like all other evidence, its credibility is grist for the cross-examination mill. Thus, because the requirements that [were] established in <em>Whelan </em>provide a significant assurance of reliability, it will be the highly unusual case in which a statement that meets the <em>Whelan </em>requirements nevertheless must be kept from the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Here, there is no dispute that D.L.\u2019s videotaped interview satisfies the criteria of a prior inconsistent statement articulated in <em>Whelan </em>and adopted in \u00a7 8-5 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. Rather, the defendant argues, quoting <em>Mukhtaar, </em>that \u201cin light of the circumstances under which the statement was made . . . the statement is so untrustworthy that its admission into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>evidence . . . subverted] the fairness of the fact-finding process.\u201d Id., 307. Our review of the videotape, however, does not support the defendant\u2019s characterization of D.L.\u2019s forensic interview. Although it is true that the interviewer used leading questions to elicit information from D.L., it is equally true that D.L. freely volunteered information, including the identity of the defendant, when describing how she was sexually abused. In fact, the defendant\u2019s claim that the \u201ccircumstances of the interview . . . made the videotape grievously unreliable\u201d is nothing more than an attack on the credibility of D.L.\u2019s statements during the interview, and, as our Supreme Court noted in <em>Mukhtaar, </em>\u201ccredibility is grist for the cross-examination mill.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 307. Although we are mindful of the criticisms voiced by Mantell regarding the maimer in which the interview was conducted, we agree with the court that the \u201cfailure to comply with . . . prevailing standards does not necessarily connote grievous unreliability\u201d such that the videotape should have been excluded. To the contrary, these criticisms are, and were in this case, appropriate for the juiy members to consider in weighing the overall credibility of D.L.\u2019s description and allegations of the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse. Finally, there is nothing \u201cso unduly coercive or extreme\u201d about the circumstances of D.L.\u2019s interview that would serve to \u201cgrievously undermine the reliability generally inherent in such a statement, so as to render it, in effect, not that of\u2019 D.L. herself. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>supra, 306. \u201c[L]ike statements satisfying the requirements of other hearsay exceptions\u201d; id.; D.L.\u2019s prior inconsistent statements during the videotaped interview were \u201cpresumptively admissible\u201d; id.; and that presumption was never rebutted by the untrustworthiness advanced by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Thus, based on our review of the record, we cannot say that the court\u2019s decision to admit as substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>evidence D.L.\u2019s videotaped interview constituted an abuse of discretion in the present case. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">JOINDER</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly joined and consolidated the two cases stemming from his sexual abuse of D.L. in Prospect and Waterbury. Specifically, the defendant maintains that, given the high degree of factual similarity between the two cases, it was impossible for the jury to consider the cases separately, thereby depriving him of a fair trial. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The following additional facts are relevant to the disposition of the defendant\u2019s claim. On September 11, 2008, the defendant filed a motion to sever the Prospect and Waterbury cases, claiming that a \u201cjoinder of [these cases] would prejudice his right to a fair trial and . . . result in substantial injustice.\u201d In response, the state filed a motion to consolidate the cases, arguing, inter alia, that the \u201ccharges involve[d] discrete, easily distinguishable factual scenarios . . . and [that a consolidated] trial [would] not be complex.\u201d On January 15, 2009, the court granted the state\u2019s motion to consolidate, ruling that, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>287 Conn. 608, 629, 949 A.2d 1156 (2008), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>288 Conn. 418, 437, 953 A.2d 45 (2008), \u201cevidence from the Prospect case . . . would be cross admissible in the trial of the Waterbury case\u201d to show a common plan or scheme and, therefore, joinder of the two cases was warranted. Thereafter, at the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s consolidated trial, the court instructed the jury members that \u201c[t]he fact that there are two separate informations should not in any way be held against the defendant. There are two separate informations only because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>state alleges that the crimes took place in two separate locations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The defendant now claims that the court improperly joined the Prospect and Waterbury cases. The defendant argues that because of the factual similarities between the two cases, the jury could not possibly consider the cases separately and, as such, he was deprived of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 54-57 and Practice Book \u00a7 41-19 permit a trial court to join similar charges in pending cases against a common defendant. Our prior decisions have made clear that the trial court enjoys broad discretion in this respect and that its decision to consolidate will not be disturbed in the absence of manifest abuse of that discretion. . . . [T]his court consistently has recognized a clear presumption in favor of joinder and against severance . . . and, therefore, absent an abuse of discretion . . . will not second guess the considered judgment of the trial court as to the joinder or severance of two or more charges. ... On appeal, [t]he defendant bears a heavy burden of showing that the denial of severance resulted in substantial injustice, and that any resulting prejudice was beyond the curative power of the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gupta, </em>297 Conn. 211, 222-23, 998 A.2d 1085 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u201cWhere evidence of one incident can be admitted at the trial of the other, separate trials would provide the defendant no significant benefit. It is clear that, under such circumstances, the defendant would not ordinarily \u2022be substantially prejudiced by joinder of the offenses for a single trial. . . . We consistently have found joinder to be proper if we have concluded that the evidence of other crimes or uncharged misconduct would have been cross admissible at separate trials.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 628-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201c[T]o establish a common scheme, [i]t is not enough that the two offenses are similar. . . . [Rather], the characteristics of the two offenses must be sufficiently distinctive and unique as to be like a signature. . . . We repeatedly have applied, however, a more liberal approach to admitting evidence of misconduct to prove a common plan or scheme in sex crime cases than in other types of cases. . . . We generally have determined that such evidence is relevant to a common scheme or plan of sex crimes provided that three conditions are met: [T]he prior offenses (1) are not too remote in time; (2) are similar to the offense charged; and (3) are committed upon persons similar to the prosecuting witness.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Here, the court relied on the three factors articulated in <em>Sanseverino </em>to conclude that joinder of the Prospect and Waterbury cases was appropriate, as evidence in each case was cross admissible in the other. As the court reasoned, the \u201ctwo offenses occurred over the same time period . . . [involved a] course of conduct [that] seems to be similar . . . [a]nd, of course . . . were both committed against the same person.\u201d Nonetheless, the defendant maintains that the court abused its discretion in joining the cases because the two cases were so factually similar that the jury could not possibly consider each of the offenses separately. As our Supreme Court in <em>Sanseverino </em>emphasized, however, the factual similarities of cases \u2014 including timing, nature of the crimes and the characteristics of the victim or victims \u2014 is an important, and arguably, dispositive, consideration that trial courts must identify in determining that joinder is justified based on the cross-admissibility of evidence. Indeed, were it not for the factual similarities between the Prospect and Waterbury cases, joinder of the cases would not be appropriate under the <em>Sanseverino </em>standard. Moreover, our review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>record discloses, and the defendant concedes, that the prosecutor and the court took great caution in informing the jury members to consider each case separately based on the entirety of the evidence presented. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gupta, </em>supra, 297 Conn. 223 (\u201c[t]he defendant bears a heavy burden of showing that . . . any resulting prejudice [of joinder] was beyond the curative power of the court\u2019s instructions\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Therefore, we conclude that the court thoroughly considered the propriety of joining the Prospect and Waterbury cases pursuant to the methodology of <em>Sanseverino </em>and, accordingly, we \u201cwill not second guess the considered judgment of the trial court as to the joinder\u201d of those two cases. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim of improper joinder cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">JURY INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he state . . . does not want the conviction of an innocent person . . . [as] [t]he state is as much concerned with having an innocent person acquitted as in having a guilty person convicted.\u201d Specifically, the defendant argues that this instruction improperly bolstered the credibility of the prosecutor and weakened the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence. The defendant concedes that he did not preserve this claim at trial and now seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We review the defendant\u2019s claim because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 369 n.29, 857 A.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005). Nevertheless, on its merits, the defendant\u2019s claim fails to satisfy <em>Golding's </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. On Friday, February 6, 2009, the court held a charging conference in chambers with both parties to discuss \u201cthe charge and [make] further amendments or refinements to it\u201d as needed. The following Monday, February 9, 2009, the court explained that, although it had not provided a final draft of the charge to counsel, \u201cthe draft that [the parties had was] essentially in substance what the charge to the jury [would be] . . . [and that] a final draft [would be provided to the parties] after closing arguments . . . .\u201d At this time, defense counsel noted that she \u201cdid have an opportunity to review the jury charge . . . [and] had made a request to certain changes with regard to the reasonable doubt charge, and [had] take[n] exception as to those changes that did not take place.\u201d The court responded that defense counsel\u2019s exception was noted and that \u201cboth counsel . . . [would have] another opportunity to record any exceptions that they may have\u201d after the charge was delivered to the jury. At the conclusion of its charge, the court inquired of defense counsel as to whether she had further objection to the instruction that was delivered to the jury members. Defense counsel then reiterated the \u201cexception to the charge as to certain objections which [were] provided to the court in writing with regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>reasonable doubt charge.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At no time, however, did defense counsel object to the specific language that the defendant now claims was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u201cIt is well established in Connecticut that unpreserved claims of improper jury instructions are reviewable under <em>Golding </em>unless they have been . . . implicitly waived.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>299 Conn. 447, 468, 10 A.3d 942 (2011). It is also well established that \u201c[wjaiver is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. ... It involves the idea of assent, and assent is an act of understanding. . . . The rule is applicable that no one shall be permitted to deny that he intended the natural consequences of his acts and conduct. ... In order to waive a claim of law it is not necessary . . . that a party be certain of the correctness of the claim and its legal efficacy. It is enough if he knows of the existence of the claim and of its reasonably possible efficacy. . . . Connecticut courts have consistently held that when a party fails to raise in the trial court the constitutional claim presented on appeal and affirmatively acquiesces to the trial court\u2019s order, that party waives any such claim [under <em>Golding}.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In <em>Kitchens, </em>our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[c]ases in which Connecticut courts have deemed jury instructions implicitly waived under <em>Golding </em>fall into three categories.\u201d Id., 475. In one of those categories, \u201ccourts have found waiver when there was no on-the-record discussion of the challenged jury instruction but the defense acquiesced in, or failed to object to, the instruction as given, and engaged in other trial conduct consistent with acceptance of the instruction.\u201d Id., 477. \u201cThis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>is in accord with case law stating that a party may not pursue one course of action at trial for tactical reasons and later on appeal argue that the path he rejected should now be open to him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 480. Of course, a \u201cconstitutional claim [of instructional error] that has been waived does not satisfy the third prong of the <em>Golding </em>test because, in such circumstances, we simply cannot conclude that injustice [has been] done to either party ... or that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In the present case, we deem the defendant\u2019s unpreserved instructional challenge implicitly waived in accordance with our Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Kitchens. </em>Here, there \u201cwas no on-the-record discussion of the challenged jury instruction but the defense acquiesced in, or failed to object to, the instruction as given, and engaged in other trial conduct consistent with acceptance of the instruction.\u201d Id., 477. Not only was defense counsel given an opportunity to review \u201cin substance\u201d the court\u2019s charge before it was delivered to the jury members, but the court also afforded defense counsel the opportunity to object to any portion of the charge after the jury instructions had been given. At no time, either before or after the instructions were delivered, did defense counsel object to the specific language now challenged by the defendant for the first time on appeal. Moreover, in concluding that defense counsel \u201cacquiesced in, or . . . engaged in . . . conduct consistent with acceptance of the instruction\u201d; id.; we find it telling that an objection was raised with respect to other aspects of the court\u2019s charge, other than the instruction that is now claimed to be improper. Indeed, because <em>\u201cGolding </em>is not intended to give an appellant a second bite at the apple\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 480; to now afford the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>relief would amount to an ambuscade of the trial judge. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>289 Conn. 496, 505, 958 A.2d 731 (2008) (\u201c[t]he purpose of the [rule of practice that claims of instructional error are reviewable only if they are raised at trial] is to alert the court to any claims of error while there is still an opportunity for correction in order to avoid the economic waste and increased court congestion caused by unnecessary retrials\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Therefore, because we deem the defendant\u2019s claim of instructional error implicitly waived under <em>Kitchens, </em>the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-9\"> The conduct charged in this case occurred on various dates between January, 2005, and March, 2007.

See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b73-10\"> The state charged the defendant separately, given the fact that his sexual abuse of D.L. occurred allegedly at different times and at different locations in Prospect and Waterbury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b73-11\"> The defendant was found not guilty of the remaining two counts of risk of injury to a child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b75-6\"> As the commentary to \u00a7 8-5 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence explains, \u201c[\u00a7] 8-5 (1) incorporates the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>[supra, 200 Conn. 753]\u201d; Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-5 (1), commentary; with respect to the \u201cprior inconsistent statement\u201d exception to the general hearsay rule. Pursuant to \u00a7 8-5, a prior inconsistent statement of a witness is \u201cnot excluded by the hearsay rule, provided the declarant is available for cross-examination at trial . . . Id., \u00a7 8-5. A prior inconsistent statement of a witness is one that is \u201c(A) ... in writing or otherwise recorded by . . . videotape . . . (B) the writing or recording is duly authenticated as that of the witness, and (C) the witness has personal knowledge of the contents of the statement.\u201d Id., \u00a7 8-5 (1). The defendant does not dispute that D.L.\u2019s videotaped interview qualifies as a prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b81-10\"> Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. Although the defendant also requests review pursuant to the plain error doctrine; see Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; such review is not warranted in light of our decision to review the defendant\u2019s claim pursuant to <em>Golding.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\"> We note that the record is devoid of any such written objection. We further note that it is well established that \u201c[i]t is the appellant\u2019s burden to provide an adequate record for review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>121 Conn.
