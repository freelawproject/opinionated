The union claims that the town violated General Statutes \u00a7 7-467 et seq. of the Municipal Employee Relations Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7 7-460 et seq.; by refusing to pay retroactive wages to former employees who had been union members. The union argues that the trial court erred in holding that the union\u2019s former members were not \u201cemployees,\u201d as defined in the act, and affirming the board\u2019s finding that it was without jurisdiction to consider the union\u2019s claims. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>. The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the union\u2019s appeal. The union was subject to a collective bargaining agreement that expired on June 30,2003. In late 2006, locals 2863,3042 and 1303-052<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the town settled, ratified and implemented successor collective bargaining agreements for the period of July 1, 2003, to June 30, 2007. The wage schedule in each of these agreements was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\u201cEffective retroactively to July 1, 2003, all wage rates in effect on June 30, 2003 shall be increased by two and one half (2 1/2) percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">\u201cEffective retroactively to July 1, 2004, all wage rates in effect on June 30, 2004 shall be increased by three (3) percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">\u201cEffective retroactively to July 1, 2005, all wage rates in effect on June 30, 2005, shall be increased by three (3) percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">\u201cEffective July 1, 2006, all wage rates in effect on June 30, 2006, shall be increased by three (3) percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">None of the collective bargaining agreements at issue contain any provision concerning retroactive wages and/or other financial benefits for former employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">On November 8, 2006, an arbitrator issued an interest arbitration award in the matter of the town and local 1303-115<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> covering the period of July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2007. The wage provisions in the award were identical to the aforementioned successor collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>bargaining agreements. The interest arbitration award did not contain any provision concerning retroactive wages and/or other financial benefits to former employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">During the period after June 30, 2003, in which the bargaining process was ongoing but before ratification or implementation of the agreements, various members of each local either retired or otherwise left the town\u2019s employ. On October 20, 2006, and February 8, 2007, the union filed complaints with the board, alleging that the town had refused to bargain in good faith and had violated the act in that the town refused to pay to the former employees the retroactive wages provided for in the new agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">On October 12, 2007, the town submitted a motion to dismiss both complaints, asserting that it had no obligation to bargain on the subject of retroactive wages for retirees who were not employees, as defined in the act. The town further asserted that, because it had no obligation to bargain with nonemployees, the board lacked jurisdiction over the union\u2019s claims. On October 17, 2007, the town filed two complaints alleging that the union was bargaining in bad faith by pursuing the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">On May 19, 2008, the matters were heard before the board. The board issued its ruling on October 3, 2008, concluding that the case is \u201cclearly answered by our case law, which is based on the federal law. . . . The [a]ct\u2019s duty to bargain in good faith applies only to people who are employees within the meaning of the [a]ct and within the bargaining unit. . . . Once an employee leaves the bargaining unit, the duty to bargain imposed by the [a]ct no longer has any application. . . . Accordingly, an employer cannot be found to have committed a refusal to bargain with respect to persons who are not employees within the meaning of the [a]ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Likewise, the [ujnion has no duty to represent [nonbargaining], [nonemployees].\u201d (Citations omitted.) The board also rejected the union\u2019s argument that the issue of nonemployee retroactive wages has an effect on current employees because current employees are concerned with whether they will receive retroactive wages when they leave their jobs. The board determined that the matter \u201csolely concerns the rights of [nonemployees].\u201d Accordingly, the board granted the town\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The union appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. On November 9, 2009, the trial court dismissed the union\u2019s appeal, holding that the board correctly concluded that the retired members were not employees as defined in the act and, therefore, that the board \u201cdid not err in finding that it was without jurisdiction to consider the union\u2019s claim of the town\u2019s bargaining in bad faith.\u201d Accordingly, the court held that the board did not act illegally or in abuse of its discretion in granting the motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">\u201cOur review of an agency\u2019s decision on questions of law is limited by the traditional deference that we have accorded to that agency\u2019s interpretation of the acts it is charged with enforcing. ... In this case, General Statutes \u00a7 7-471 (2), which defines the powers of the state board of labor relations, authorizes the board to determine whether a position is covered by sections 7-467 to 7-477, inclusive, in the event of a dispute between the municipal employer and an employee organization. Our duty is to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency charged with enforcement] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>omitted.) <em>Police Dept. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>225 Conn. 297, 300, 622 A.2d 1005 (1993).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The union argues that the court erred in holding that the board correctly concluded that the union\u2019s retired members were not \u201cemployees\u201d as defined in the act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 7-469 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe municipal employer and such employee organization as has been designated as exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate unit, through appropriate officials or their representatives, shall have the duty to bargain collectively. . . .\u201d \u201cMunicipal employers or their representatives or agents are prohibited from ... (4) refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with an employee organization which has been designated in accordance with the provisions of said sections as the exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate unit . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-470 (a). The act defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany employee of a municipal employer, whether or not in the classified service of the municipal employer, except elected officials, administrative officials, board and commission members, certified teachers, part-time employees who work less than twenty hours per week on a seasonal basis, department heads and persons in such other positions as may be excluded from coverage under sections 7-467 to 7-477, inclusive . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-467 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The union argues that, for the purposes of the prerequisite of subject matter jurisdiction, the date that should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>be used in determining who is an \u201cemployee\u201d for the purposes of the act is July 1, 2003, the initial retroactive date of the pay increase.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We note that the statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d does not include retired or former employees. \u201cThe meaning ascribed to the term employee under labor law is consistent with its common meaning. We ordinarily look to the dictionary definition of a word to ascertain its commonly approved usage. . . . Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, for example, defines the term employee as T: <em>one employed </em>by another usually in a position below the executive level and usually for wages; 2: in labor relations: any worker <em>who is under wages or salary </em>to an employer and who is not excluded by agreement from consideration as such a worker.\u2019 . . . See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) (defining employee as \u2018[a] person who works in the service of another person [the employer] under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance\u2019). These definitions make it evident that, like the meaning of employee under labor law, the currency of the relationship is paramount.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>292 Conn. 334, 345, 972 A.2d 706 (2009). Additionally, \u201c[t]he seminal case of <em>Allied Chemical &amp; Alkali Workers of America, Local Union No. 1 </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., </em>404 U.S. 157, 172, 92 S. Ct. 383, 30 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1971), squarely held that retirees are not employees within the bargaining unit.\u201d <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Pursuant to <em>Allied Chemical &amp; Alkali Workers of America, Local Union No. 1, </em>retirees who are no longer employees lose their status as bargaining unit members and are outside the scope of representational responsibility of their unions. See <em>Allied Chemical &amp; Alkali </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>Workers of America, Local Union No. 1 </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., </em>supra, 404 U.S. 181 n.20 (\u201c[s]ince retirees are not members of the bargaining unit, the bargaining agent is under no statutory duty to represent them in negotiations with the employer\u201d). Once an employee leaves the bargaining unit, the duty of a municipality to bargain under the act with that employee ceases. Thus, we agree with the board that \u201can employer cannot be found to have committed a refusal to bargain with respect to persons who are not employees within the meaning of the [a]ct.\u201d On the basis of our statutes and case law, it is clear that the board did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion in determining that the town was not obligated to bargain with the union with respect to the claims of former employees, regardless of when their claims arose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>The union, however, also argues that the board should have jurisdiction because the issues presented \u201cvitally affect the terms and conditions of employment\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Allied Chemical &amp; Alkali Workers of America, Local Union No. 1 </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., </em>supra, 404 U.S. 176; of current employees. See id., 178 (subjects for mandatory collective bargaining normally include only issues that settle an aspect of relationship between employer and employees, but matters involving individuals outside employment relationship not wholly excluded). The union argues that current employees are concerned with whether they will receive retroactive wages when they leave their jobs. This case, however, concerns former employees and does not concern current employees negotiating for a future benefit for themselves.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the board did not abuse its discretion in determining that the issue \u201csolely concerns the rights of [nonemployees]\u201d who were no longer members of the bargaining units, and it correctly determined that it thus lacked jurisdiction to act on their claims. See <em>Allied Chemical &amp; Alkali Workers of America, Local Union No. 1 </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., </em>supra, 182 (\u201c[effect that] bargaining on behalf of pensioners would have on the negotiation of active employees\u2019 retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>plans is too speculative a foundation on which to base an obligation to bargain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">We conclude that the board did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion in concluding that the town had no duty to bargain on a subject affecting the rights of former employees. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the board did not err in granting the town\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-10\"> The original complaint was filed with the defendant state board of labor relations by locals 818, 2863, 3042 and 1303-052.

See <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>103 Conn. App. 571, 576, 930 A.2d 739, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 930, 934 A.2d 245 (2007). For the reasons we will discuss, we disagree that this issue has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> AH of the former employees were employees on July 1, 2003, the date of the initial retroactive period. None were employed in late 2006 when the new agreement was reached.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b772-5\"> The union urges us to adopt the reasoning in <em>Summit County Children\u2019s Services Board </em>v. <em>Local No. 4546, Communications Workers of America (AFL-CIO), </em>Docket No. 21184, 2003 WL 356300 (Ohio App. February 19, 2003). In <em>Summit County Children's Services Board, </em>the union filed a grievance on behalf of former employees who claimed that they were due a retroactive pay increase pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Id. An arbitrator awarded the pay increase, and the employer appealed, claiming that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction because the former employees were no longer members of the bargaining unit, and, therefore, neither the union nor the employees had standing to file grievances on behalf of former employees. Id. The Court of Appeals of Ohio, Ninth District, concluded that the arbitrator did not act unlawfully or capriciously in concluding that he had jurisdiction. Id. We are not persuaded that we should adopt the <em>Summit County Children\u2019s Services Board </em>court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">First, <em>Summit County Children\u2019s Services Board </em>involved review of a decision by an arbitrator regarding whether the arbitrator had jurisdiction over the former employees\u2019 grievances. In the present case, we are reviewing, with our \u201ctraditional deference that we have accorded to that agency\u2019s interpretation of the acts it is charged with enforcing\u201d; <em>Police Dept. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 300; a determination by our state board of labor relations that it did not have jurisdiction over the union\u2019s claims. Second, other courts in Ohio have declined to apply <em>Summit County Children\u2019s Services Board. </em>See <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Trotwood-Madison City Board of Education, </em>181 Ohio App. 3d 764, 773, 910 N.E.2d 1088 (2009) (\u201c[w]hile [the <em>Summit County Children\u2019s Services Board </em>court\u2019s] approach has some logic ... we cannot ignore the wording of the [collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>agreement] and the case law, which seems almost uniformly to follow the approach that retirees axe not bound by the grievance procedure in the collective-bargaining agreement unless they are specifically included\u201d); see also <em>Independence Fire Fighters Assn. </em>v. <em>Independence, </em>121 Ohio App. 3d 716, 721, 700 N.E.2d 909 (retired firefighters challenging calculation of amounts paid to them upon retirement for accrued but unused holidays, sick leave, and vacation time were not required to exhaust administrative remedies because they no longer were employees and therefore were not governed by collective bargaining agreement), appeal denied, 80 Ohio St. 3d 1449, 686 N.E.2d 276 (1997), cited in <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 292 Conn. 344.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b773-6\"> The collective bargaining agreements at issue were in effect between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2007, and they did not include any provision for retroactive wages for current employees who retired after June 30, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b774-14\"> The union makes additional arguments that denying the former employees retroactive pay would lead to an inequitable result or be unlawful pursuant to the state\u2019s wage statutes.
