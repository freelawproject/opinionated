The defendant\u2019s former wife was represented by Attorney Nikola Cunha in postdivorce matters involving visitation rights and custody of the defendant and his former wife\u2019s three minor children. On December 19, 2006, the defendant telephoned Cunha\u2019s law office and asked to speak to her. The receptionist, Cherokee Ghere, who is also Cunha\u2019s sister, informed the defendant that Cunha was out of the office but that he could leave a message. The defendant was upset by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>response and became angry. He complained that Cunha had advised his former wife not to fill out paperwork in regard to his visitation rights and called Cunha \u201ca corrupt cunt and a bitch.\u201d After listening to the defendant for a couple of minutes, Ghere became upset and fearful for her own and Cunha\u2019s safety. She yelled at the defendant, calling him \u201cdisgusting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Witnessing Ghere becoming emotional and yelling, Louise Massaro, a case manager at the law firm, instructed her to put the call on hold. Massaro then picked up the telephone and asked the defendant to identify himself. He did so and informed her that he called to speak to Cunha because he was not going to let her get away with advising his former wife not to sign the visitation papers. When Massaro replied that Cunha was out of the office and that the defendant should take up his complaint with the court, he angrily yelled that Cunha was a \u201cscumbag\u201d and a \u201cdouche bag\u201d and that if they thought they deserved respect, he would \u201cshow [them] what respect was.\u201d Massaro became nervous and hung up the telephone. Shortly thereafter, the women contacted the police. When Officer Lance Helms arrived at the office, he found the women to be visibly shaken and upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of two counts of harassment in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3). The court imposed a total effective sentence of thirty days incarceration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The defendant claims that \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) is vague both on its face and as applied to his conduct, in violation of his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, and that his conviction under the statute had the effect of criminalizing his speech, in violation of the first amendment. Conceding that these claims were not raised in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>court, the defendant seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For a claim that the statute is unconstitutional on its face, the record, to be adequate, must show that the defendant was convicted under the statute. For a claim that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the record must reflect the conduct that formed the basis of his conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 800, 640 A.2d 986 (1994). The record is sufficient in this regard and the issues are constitutional in magnitude. Because the claims are amenable to review, we analyze them under Golding\u2019s third prong to determine whether the alleged constitutional violations clearly exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The defendant first claims that \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) is unconstitutionally vague both (a) on its face and (b) as applied to his conduct in violation of his right to procedural due process. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">We begin our analysis with the governing legal principles. A deteimination of statutory vagueness is a question of law over which we exercise de novo review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>294 Conn. 753, 758-59, 988 A.2d 188 (2010). In undertaking such review, we make every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s validity. Id., 759. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Accordingly, \u201c[t]o demonstrate that [a statute] is unconstitutionally vague as applied to [the defendant, he must] . . . demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] had inadequate notice of what was prohibited or that [he was] the victim of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. ... If the meaning of a statute can be fairly ascertained a statute will not be void for vagueness since [m]any statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for [i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties. . . . References to judicial opinions involving the statute, the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain a statute\u2019s meaning to determine if it gives fair warning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Finally, although a defendant ordinarily may challenge the vagueness of a statute only as applied to his particular conduct; <em>State </em>v. <em>Robert H., </em>273 Conn. 56, 67, 866 A.2d 1255 (2005); where an allegedly vague statute threatens to inhibit a constitutionally protected right such as freedom of speech, the statute\u2019s constitutionality may be tested for vagueness on its face. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ehlers, </em>252 Conn. 579, 584-85, 750 A.2d 1079 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The United States Supreme Court has expounded upon these principles as follows. \u201cFirst, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. Third, but related, where a vague statute abutfs] upon sensitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms. Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 108-109; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>supra, 294 Conn. 759-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Here, the state concedes that its evidence of the harassing manner of the defendant\u2019s phone call \u201crested entirely\u201d on the content of the speech he conveyed. Consequently, because the right to free speech under the first amendment is implicated, we review the defendant\u2019s claim that the statute is vague on its face as well as his claim that the statute is vague as applied to his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The defendant claims that the statutory standard \u201cin a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm\u201d is subjective and, consequently, that \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) is unconstitutionally vague on its face. He argues that because it does not provide an express objective standard, such as a reasonable person standard, parties lack reasonable notice of what conduct is prohibited, and, therefore, the statute likely will be enforced according to the inconsistent whims of law enforcement personnel, victims and juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">\u201cIn a facial vagueness challenge, we . . . examine the challenged statute to see if it is impermissibly vague in all of its applications. A statute that is impermissibly vague in all its applications is vague, not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all. . . . Such a provision simply has no core.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>\u201cFurther, in evaluating the defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, we read the statute narrowly in order to save its constitutionality, rather than broadly in order to destroy it. We will indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality .... In so doing, we take into account any prior interpretations that this court, our Appellate Court and the Appellate Session of the Superior Court have placed on the statute.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 804-805.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We recognize that although the term \u201cannoy\u201d has been declared unconstitutionally vague; see id., 815-16; this vagueness has been remedied by judicial interpretation. The Supreme Court in <em>Indrisano </em>recognized that a court may add interpretive gloss to a challenged statute in order to render it constitutional. Id., 805; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Robert H., </em>supra, 273 Conn. 67 (\u201cfacially vague law may nonetheless comport with due process if prior judicial decisions have provided the necessary fair warning and ascertainable enforcement standards\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, in regard to the statute at issue in <em>Indrisano, </em>the court remedied the vagueness in the language \u201cannoys or interferes with another person\u201d by holding that parties should rely primarily on the term \u201cinterferes\u201d to interpret the statute, essentially reading the term \u201cannoys\u201d out of the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 818. This court has adopted a similar interpretive gloss in regard to \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), holding the language \u201cin a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm\u201d to be unambiguous as a whole by relying on the term \u201calarm\u201d to remedy the vagueness of the term \u201cannoyance.\u201d See <em>State v. Cummings, </em>46 Conn. App. 661, 672-74, 701 A.2d 663, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 940, 702 A.2d 645 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Just as in <em>Cummings, </em>in which we followed the Supreme Court\u2019s statutory construction in <em>Indrisano </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>to read the term \u201cannoyance\u201d out of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), we again follow <em>Indrisano's </em>lead to resolve the defendant\u2019s present claim that the statute provides no ascertainable standard of conduct. In <em>Indrisano, </em>the court held that the language \u201cwith intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm\u201d was not subject to arbitrary interpretation because \u201cthe legislature intended the language \u2018inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm\u2019 to be that perceived by a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 810. Accordingly, we deduce that the legislature intended the same language in \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), namely, \u201cannoyance or alarm,\u201d to be that perceived to be as such by a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards. We conclude, therefore, that the statute provides a sufficient core of meaning that it is not void for vagueness on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">We turn next to the defendant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to his conduct. He makes two arguments in this regard: neither the statute nor any prior decision of this state provides fair warning of what constitutes harassment, and no prior decision of this state has held that the substance of his conversation could be made subject to punishment. We do not find either of these arguments to be availing.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">\u201c[T]he fundamental purpose of the void for vagueness doctrine is to ensure fair warning in order to avoid traps for the innocent . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>supra, 294 Conn. 770. Here, the defendant has made no plausible argument that he acted in reliance on the belief that his conduct was lawful or that a person of ordinary intelligence would have no reason to know that he was engaging in harassing conduct. See id. To the contrary, our state\u2019s appellate decisions have held that the statute is not vague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>as applied to angry telephone \u201ccomplaints\u201d to a place of business; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>55 Conn. App. 475, 481-83, 739 A.2d 714, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 908, 743 A.2d 619 (1999); and that \u201cthe fact finder may consider the language used in the communication in determining whether the state has proven the elements of the offense, namely, that the defendant intended to harass, annoy or alarm, and that he did so in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>254 Conn. 561, 569, 757 A.2d 1125 (2000). Furthermore, insofar as the defendant is implying that a single, angry telephone call is insufficient to demonstrate harassment, we note that an insufficiency argument is not pertinent to a vagueness analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>supra, 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Additionally, we note that in arguing that no prior decision has held that the substance of his conversation could be criminalized, the defendant is implying not that the statute gave inadequate notice but, rather, that the statute impermissibly criminalized his speech. In other words, this is a pure first amendment claim in the guise of a vagueness challenge, and, as such, it is not persuasive for purposes of vagueness analysis. See id. Because he has failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that he lacked adequate notice that his conduct was prohibited by the statute, we conclude that the statute is not vague as applied to the operative facts in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">We turn, finally, to the defendant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) is unconstitutional as applied to his conduct. In this regard, the defendant argues that because his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>conviction rested primarily on the verbal content of the telephone call, the statute impermissibly was applied to proscribe his speech.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the defendant\u2019s challenge, in this regard, is that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to him, not that it was facially over-broad. \u201cOrdinarily, a particular litigant claims that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to him or her; if the litigant prevails, the courts carve away the unconstitutional aspects of the law by invalidating its improper applications on a case-by-case basis. . . . Overbreadth analysis, in contrast, does not reach the question whether the challenger\u2019s speech is constitutionally protected; instead it strikes down the statute entirely, because it might be applied to others not before the Court whose activities are constitutionally protected. When invalidated for overbreadth, a law is not narrowed, but rather becomes wholly unenforceable until a legislature rewrites it or a properly authorized court construes it more narrowly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Leydon v. Greenwich, </em>257 Conn. 318, 347 n.33, 777 A.2d 552 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Section 53a-183 (a) (3) has survived multiple first amendment challenges. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 481 (\u201cAlthough the defendant claims that the statute prevents him from speaking out on matters of public concern, it merely prohibits purposeful harassment by use of the telephone and does not involve first amendment concerns. The statute proscribes conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>not the content of the telephone calls.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1978-4), </em>34 Conn. Sup. 689, 696, 389 A.2d 1270 (1978) (\u201cit is the manner and means employed to communicate [the messages] which is the subject of the prohibition rather than their content\u201d); see also <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Director, Connecticut State Dept. of Probation, </em>632 F.2d 938 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1023, 101 S. Ct. 591, 66 L. Ed. 2d 485 (1980) (fact finder permissibly could consider verbal content of telephone call as evidence of defendant\u2019s intent without infringing on first amendment rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Nevertheless, we subsequently ruled in <em>State </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>120 Conn. App. 330, 991 A.2d 728, cert. granted, 297 Conn. 916, 996 A.2d 278 (2010), that \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) was unconstitutional as applied to a postal employee who called her place of work and commented that she understood how a postal worker could become enraged and kill coworkers and that she could \u201c \u2018do that, too.\u2019 \u201d Id., 333. We held in <em>Moulton </em>that although the statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad on its face, \u201cthe state prosecuted the defendant on the basis of her speech, not her conduct in making the telephone call, and, therefore, her conviction was based on an impermissible construction of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), which implicated her first amendment rights. Accordingly, we conclude that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the defendant.\u201d Id., 337. We also stated that \u201c[t]he jury should have been instructed to examine only whether the act of calling and causing the ringing of the telephone was harassing, and to look to the speech only for the intent in physically making the telephone call.\u201d Id., 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The present case is similar to <em>Moulton </em>not only factually but also because here, as in <em>Moulton, </em>the state prosecuted the defendant on the basis of his speech. Consequently, and in accord with <em>Moulton, </em>we conclude that \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) was unconstitutionally applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the defendant\u2019s speech in violation of the first amendment. Furthermore, given the state\u2019s concession that its evidence of the harassing manner of the defendant\u2019s telephone call \u201crested entirely\u201d on the content of the speech he conveyed, we conclude, pursuant to the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>that the constitutional violation clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Removing the defendant\u2019s speech from consideration in regard to the conduct element, the remaining evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render a judgment of acquittal as to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of harassment in the second degree when ... (3) with intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, he makes a telephone call, whether or not a conversation ensues, in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\"> Although the defendant conflates these two claims in his brief, we note that they are distinct andrequire separate analyses. See <em>Grayned v. Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972) (\u201cclear and precise enactment may nevertheless be \u2018overbroad\u2019 if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct\u201d). Additionally, the defendant claims that (1) the evidence was insufficient to prove intent, (2) the jury instructions were improper and (3) the conviction on the second count violated the constitutional protection against double jeopardy. Because we find that the defendant must be acquitted on the basis of his claim that the statute was unconstitutionally applied, we need not reach these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\"> Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 23EM0. \u201cThe first two [prongs of <em>Golding] </em>involve a determination of whether the claim is reviewable; the second two . . . involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>293 Conn. 303, 325, 977 A.2d 209 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\"> We also note that although the defendant has raised an insufficiency claim in regard to the state\u2019s evidence of <em>intent </em>to harass, he has failed to raise a formal insufficiency claim in regard to the evidence of harassing <em>conduct.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> The state argues in opposition that the defendant\u2019s first amendment rights were not implicated because the telephone communication amounted to a constitutionally unprotected \u201ctrue threat.\u201d It also suggests that the language may have amounted to constitutionally unprotected obscenity. These arguments are unpersuasive given that the state did not prosecute the case under either of the two criminal threatening statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-61aa and 53a-62, or the criminal obscenity statutes, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-193 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
