J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avh\">The plaintiff, Edward A. Peruta, appeals from the judgment of the trial court granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly determined that (1) he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and (2) the administrative remedies available to him were not inadequate and futile. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history relevant to our discussion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff travels throughout the state and possesses a permit to carry pistols or revolvers (permit) issued by the department of public safety (department) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 29-28 (b). On July 28, 2007,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff sent an e-mail to the department and to the board of firearms permit examiners (board) stating that he was researching the laws and regulations that govern the possession of a permit to carry a firearm and set forth nine questions seeking to clarify the extent to which the holder of a valid permit may openly carry a firearm in the state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff delivered a document with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>these same questions to the department on July 30, 2007. In response, the department\u2019s legal affairs unit sent a letter to the plaintiff on August 1, 2007, stating that it was unable to provide answers to his questions and recommended that he seek the advice of an attorney. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff commenced an action for a declaratory judgment in the Superior Court naming three defendants: the department, the board and the police officer standards and training council (council).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>In Ms complaint, the plaintiff asserted that the department and the mumcipalities served by the council had violated the statutory and constitutional rights of Connecticut citizens to bear arms by proMbiting, under tMeat of arrest, valid permit holders from opeMy carrymg a pistol or revolver and by immediately confiscatmg a holder\u2019s valid permit upon such arrest. The plaintiff alleged that the board had denied Ms request for a declaratory ruling, and, consequently, he suffered from uncertainty with respect to Ms legM obligations to conceal Ms firearm and relinquish, upon demand, Ms permit to the department. Thus, the plaintiff requested a judiciM determination of whether he lawfully could carry a pistol or revolver opeMy in the state and whether the defendants lawfully may confiscate permits if a permit holder is arrested for opeMy carrying a firearm. The plaintiff served a copy of Ms complaint on the office of the attorney general.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The defendants, represented by the attorney general\u2019s office, filed a motion to strike the plaintiffs complaint, wMch the court deMed. Thereafter, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plamtiff s complaint claiming, inter alia, that the court shoMd exercise its discretion and refuse to issue a declaratory judgment because the plaintiff had adequate admiMstrative remedies available to him. After a hearing on the matter and after both parties filed supplemental briefs, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that Mthough the plaintiff had presented a petition for a declaratory ruling to the board, wMch had declined to rale on the matter, the department had a central role to play m deciding the petition and should be given an opportuMty to do so. The court then determmed that because the plamtiff had not submitted a petition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>department, he had not complied with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-175 and 4-176. The court further concluded that because the plaintiff had only claimed that the department was \u201clikely\u201d to issue a ruling adverse to him, futility could not be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion to reargue claiming that the department\u2019s failure to promulgate rules of practice for filing requests for declaratory rulings acted as a waiver of its jurisdiction to issue such rulings and excused the plaintiffs failure to petition the department. The court summarily denied this motion. The plaintiff then filed a second motion to reargue claiming that the e-mail he sent to the department on July 28,2007, was avalid petition for a declaratory ruling and because the department lacked rules of practice for submitting petitions for declaratory rulings, he had exhausted his administrative remedies to the extent possible. The court, however, denied the plaintiffs motion concluding that the overall thrust of the questions he presented to the department were not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 4-176.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff then appealed to this court and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5, filed a motion for articulation with respect to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that his July 28, 2007 e-mail to the department was not a petition for a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cA motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>C. R. Klewin Northeast, LLC </em>v. <em>State, </em>299 Conn. 167, 174, 9 A.3d 326 (2010). \u201cA motion to dismiss tests . . . whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . When a . . . court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light. ... In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader. . . . The motion to dismiss . . . admits all facts which are well pleaded, invokes the existing record and must be decided upon that alone.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., </em>286 Conn. 454, 463-64, 944 A.2d 315 (2008). \u201c[O]ur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [grant] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo. . . . Factual findings underlying the court\u2019s decision, however, will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . The applicable standard of review for . . . a motion to dismiss, therefore, generally turns on whether the appellant seeks to challenge the legal conclusions of the trial court or its factual determinations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>LaSalle Bank, National Assn. </em>v. <em>Bialobrzeski, </em>123 Conn. App. 781, 786-87,3 A.3d 176 (2010). With these principles in mind, we turn to the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the court erroneously concluded that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedi\u00e9s. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that because the department has failed to promulgate rules setting forth the required form and filing procedure for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>petitions for declaratory rulings in accordance with its duty under \u00a7 4-176 (b),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he was unable to know what the department required for such petitions. Therefore, according to the plaintiff, his July 28, 2007 e-mail to the department, to the extent possible, was a petition for a declaratory ruling.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Our Supreme Court has determined previously that whether a party\u2019s communication with an agency constitutes a petition for a declaratory ruling is \u201cessentially [a] fact-based issue . . . .\u201d See <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>239 Conn. 124, 135 n. 18, 680 A.2d 1329 (1996). We, therefore, will not disturb the court\u2019s conclusion unless it is clearly erroneous. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The right to petition an agency for a declaratory ruling is statutorily granted to a party by \u00a7 4-176 (a). That section, in relevant part, provides: \u201cAny person may petition an agency ... for a declaratory ruling as to the validity of any regulation, or <em>the applicability to specified circumstances of a provision of the general statutes, </em>a regulation, or a final decision on a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>within the jurisdiction of the agency.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (a). That section sets \u201cthe ground rules\u201d for bringing a petition for a declaratory ruling before a state agency; see <em>Hill </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>83 Conn. App. 599, 606, 851 A.2d 320, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 909, 859 A.2d 561 (2004); and, in the absence of additional agency direction, sets the standards required for such a petition. See <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 135-36 (using \u00a7 4-176 to evaluate party\u2019s correspondence with agency as petition for declaratory ruling); <em>Liberty Mobile Home Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>6 Conn. App. 723, 726-27, 507 A.2d 499 (1986) (same). Thus, in order for the plaintiffs e-mail correspondence with the department to constitute a petition for a declaratory judgment it needed to set forth specific circumstances and seek to have the department apply a regulation, statute or final decision on a matter in its jurisdiction to those specific circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">We cannot conclude that the court was clearly erroneous in determining that the plaintiffs July 28, 2007 e-mail to the department was not a petition for a declaratory ruling. In that e-mail, the plaintiff stated that he was \u201cin the process of researching the laws and regulations that govern the possession of a permit\u201d in the state. Then, through a series of nine questions, the plaintiff asked the department <em>to identify </em>and to provide the source of legal authority preventing, in whole or in part, a valid permit holder from carrying a firearm in the state, openly or exposed, and from doing so in a \u201crestaurant\u201d or \u201can establishment that serves alcoholic beverages . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not seek to have the department apply or examine a regulation or statute with respect to a specified set of circumstances. Rather, because he was \u201cin the process of researching,\u201d he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>supplied the department with details of general scenarios, such as a permit holder carrying a holstered firearm into a restaurant or an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages, so that the department could then create a list of germane legal authority for him. The plaintiffs e-mail lacks any indication that he sought any form of reasoned <em>analysis or decision </em>from the department.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss because two exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion applied in his case. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that he is not required to first petition the department for a declaratory ruling pursuant to \u00a7 4-176 because the action for a declaratory judgment he brought in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-29 presents a facial challenge to state statutes that the judicial branch must resolve, and it would be futile to seek a declaratory ruling from the department because the department is biased and lacks the authority to grant the relief he seeks. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The plaintiff contends that he was not required to first exhaust his administrative remedies by petitioning the department for a declaratory ruling because his action for a declaratory judgment in the Superior Court presented a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the \u201csuitability\u201d requirement of \u00a7 29-28 (b),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> incorporated by reference into General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-32b and 29-35. He then argues it is the duty of the judiciary to resolve such challenges. Acknowledging that he did not present this claim to the trial court, the plaintiff seeks review of this claim pursuant to the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), as refined by <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Specifically, the plaintiff calls our attention to <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>561 U.S. 742, 130 S. Ct. 3020, 177 L. Ed. 2d 894 (2010), and argues that review of his claim is warranted under the exceptional circumstances doctrine because \u201canew constitutional right not readily foreseeable has arisen between the time of trial and appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 70; <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239 n.8; see <em>Imperial Casualty &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>246 Conn. 313, 321, 714 A.2d 1230 (1998). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>supra, 561 U.S. 742, the United States Supreme Court held that a Chicago, and virtually identical Oak Park, municipal ordinance that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>effectively prevented all inhabitants of those municipalities from possessing a firearm in their home was unconstitutional under the second amendment to the constitution of the United States. Id., 742. In so holding, the Supreme Court, for the first time, applied the second amendment, through incorporation into the fourteenth amendment, to the actions of the states. Id., 749-50. The plaintiff asserts that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>McDonald, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 29-28 (b), 29-32b and 29-35 are unconstitutional on their face because they make a person\u2019s second amendment right to keep and to bear arms contingent upon a \u201csuitability\u201d requirement for which there is no statutory definition or guidance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The plaintiff, however, has failed to advance any legal analysis explaining to this court how <em>McDonald </em>confers on him a new constitutional right that renders the statutes he identifies unconstitutional on their face. \u201c [Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Claudio C., </em>125 Conn. App. 588, 600, 11 A.3d 1086 (2010), cert. denied, 300 Conn. 910, 12 A.3d 1005 (2011). \u201cWe do not review constitutional claims that are inadequately briefed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>106 Conn. App. 97, 101 n.4, cert. granted, 287 Conn. 905, 950 A.2d 1282, 940 A.2d 858 (2008); see <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>115 Conn. App. 671, 673 n.l, 974 A.2d 65 (2009) (\u201c[w]e . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>decline to review any vaguely framed or inadequately briefed constitutional issues\u201d). We conclude that the plaintiffs claim of a new constitutional right is inadequately briefed, and, accordingly, we decline to review the plaintiffs unpreserved claim pursuant to the exceptional circumstances doctrine. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>114 Conn. App. 493. 504 n.11, 969 A.2d 868, cert. denied, 292 Conn. 917, 973 A.2d 1277 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the court improperly determined that a petition for a declaratory ruling to the department would not be futile or inadequate. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that it would be futile to petition the department for a declaratory ruling because it cannot act in an unbiased manner in interpreting Connecticut\u2019s firearm statutes, and, even if it could, the department lacks the authority to provide the relief he seeks. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">\u201cIt is a settled principle of administrative law that, if an adequate administrative remedy exists, it must be exhausted before the Superior Court will obtain jurisdiction to act in the matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 350-51, 542 A.2d 672 (1988). \u201cNotwithstanding the important public policy considerations underlying the exhaustion requirement, [our Supreme Court] has carved out several exceptions from the exhaustion doctrine . . . although only infrequently and only for narrowly defined purposes. . . . Such narrowly defined purposes include when recourse to the . . . remedy would be futile or inadequate.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>292 Conn. 334, 340, 972 A.2d 706 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The plaintiff first argues that a petition for a declaratory ruling to the department would be futile because the department is incapable of acting in an unbiased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>manner. The plaintiff cites <em>Wallingford Center Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>68 Conn. App. 803, 809-10, 793 A.2d 260 (2002), and claims that, as in that case, the administrative remedy available to him is futile because the department cannot agree with the plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 29-35 without \u201c \u2018backing away\u2019 \u201d from the position that it takes on a daily basis in revoking state permits and defending appeals from such revocations before the board. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In <em>Wallingford Center Associates, </em>the plaintiff appealed from the city tax assessor\u2019s valuation of its property to the defendant board of tax review and, when that was unsuccessful, to the Superior Court. <em>Wallingford Center Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 805. While the appeal to the Superior Court was pending, title to the property changed hands, and the new owner filed a motion to be joined as a party so that it too could challenge the tax assessor\u2019s valuation for the years that it was in ownership of the property. Id. The Superior Court denied the motion reasoning that the new owner had failed to first exhaust its administrative remedies by taking its own appeal to the defendant. Id. We concluded that the new owner did not first need to exhaust its administrative remedies by filing its own appeal with the defendant because, at the time, the defendant was engaged in vigorously defending the same valuation, with respect to the very same piece of property, that the new owner sought to challenge. Id., 810. We reasoned that to require the new owner to appeal to the board itself would be futile because the defendant could not have provided the relief the new owner sought without changing a position that it was then vigorously defending at trial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In <em>Wallingford Center Associates, </em>the administrative remedy had been exhausted by the old owner, and the new owner of the property sought to join an action properly before the Superior Court. Moreover, the new owner sought a determination with respect to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>issue that the defendant had first addressed in the administrative appeal. In the present case, however, the plaintiff seeks to challenge the language of a statute that, according to the trial court, the department has \u201cnever officially\u201d addressed, let alone presented a position that it has defended vigorously. The plaintiff, in fact, has alleged that the department considers the statute ambiguous with respect to a permit holder\u2019s ability to carry a firearm openly in the state. The administrative remedy has not been exhausted and, unlike in <em>Wallingford Center Associates, </em>there is nothing to indicate that requiring the plaintiff to first do so would be mandating an exercise in futility. See <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>191 Conn. 528, 542, 469 A.2d 382 (1983) (\u201c[a] remedy need not be exhausted if to do so would be a futile gesture\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We are mindful that, \u201c[i]n light of the policy behind the exhaustion doctrine, these exceptions are narrowly construed. See, e.g., <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Ervin, </em>234 Conn. 498, 507, 661 A.2d 1018 (1995) (plaintiffs\u2019 mere suspicion of bias on part of defendant, without more, not sufficient to excuse them, on ground of futility, from exhaustion requirement); <em>O &amp; G Industries Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 419, 429, 655 A.2d 1121 (1995) (actual bias, rather than mere potential bias, of administrative body renders resort to administrative remedies futile); <em>Polymer Resources, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>[227 Conn. 545, 561, 630 A.2d 1304 (1993)] (mere conclusory assertion that agency will not reconsider decision does not excuse compliance, on basis of futility, with exhaustion requirement); <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>[222 Conn. 414, 430, 610 A.2d 637 (1992)] (fact that commissioner previously indicated how he would decide plaintiff\u2019s claim did not excuse compliance, on ground of futility, with exhaustion requirement); <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>[204 Conn. 551, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>557-60, 529 A.2d 666 (1987)] (futility is more than mere allegation that administrative agency might not grant relief requested).\u201d <em>Fish Unlimited </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities Service Co., </em>254 Conn. 1, 13-14, 756 A.2d 262 (2000). We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs allegation that the department routinely enforces an adverse interpretation of \u00a7 29-35 before the board, if proved, does not render futile the administrative remedy available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The plaintiff next claims that even if he does petition the department for a declaratory ruling, such a petition would be futile because the department lacks the authority to provide the relief he seeks. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 29-35 is not binding on municipal law enforcement agencies, which also have the authority to arrest individuals for violations of state criminal law. Thus, according to the plaintiff, the administrative remedy provided by the department is futile because it would require additional litigation before he is conclusively informed of his right to carry a firearm openly throughout the state. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">\u201cA remedy is futile or inadequate if the decision maker is without authority to grant the requested relief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 292 Conn. 340. \u201cThe law does not require the doing of a useless thing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Labbe </em>v. <em>Pension Commission, </em>229 Conn. 801, 813, 643 A.2d 1268 (1994). Section 29-28 (b)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>grants the department the authority to issue permits, and \u00a7 29-32 (b) grants it the authority to revoke them \u201cfor cause . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As a corollary to this authority, and pursuant to its obligation to issue a declaratory ruling under \u00a7 4-176, the department is able and, indeed, even required to interpret \u00a7 29-32 (b). See <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>173 Conn. 352, 356, 377 A.2d 1099 (1977) (\u201c[A]dministrative agencies must necessarily interpret statutes which are made for their guidance. To rule otherwise would be to ignore the subtle and intricate interaction of law and fact.\u201d). Thus, the department\u2019s authority to revoke a permit for cause necessarily requires it to determine if our statutes proscribe the open carry of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">To the extent that the plaintiff seeks an unequivocal declaration that he will not be <em>arrested </em>for openly carrying a firearm, it is not the department\u2019s lack of authority that keeps the plaintiff from the remedy he seeks; rather, it is a consequence of the question\u2019s indefinite parameters. \u201cIt is inherent in our judicial system of dispute resolution that the interpretation of statutes, like the development of the common law, grows out of the filtering of a set of facts through the law, as seen by the administrator or judge. The result of this application is a hybrid, composed in part of fact, in part of law, which by its existence contributes to the interpretation of a statute. As is recognized by our policy of declining to give advisory opinions . . . and by our desire that even declaratory rulings be grounded in some real controversy, a statute cannot be read in a vacuum but must be illuminated by the force of concrete, everyday pressures.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 356-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>57. Depending on the specific circumstances, a person who openly carries a pistol conceivably may be subject to arrest for violating several statutes,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> even if \u00a7 29-35 does not prohibit a permit holder from carrying a pistol openly. In sum, if the plaintiff petitions the department for a declaratory ruling by supplying it with specific factual circumstances, the department has the authority to interpret \u00a7 29-35 to determine if it allows for the open carry of a firearm under the circumstances provided. If aggrieved, the plaintiff may appeal the department\u2019s ruling to the Superior Court. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. We will not speculate as to the possible consequences of such a ruling on the arrest actions of municipal law enforcement departments who must enforce all of our criminal statutes. \u201cIt is not the [plaintiffs] preference for a particular remedy that determines whether the remedy before the agency is adequate . . . and an administrative remedy, in order to be \u2018adequate,\u2019 need not comport with the [plaintiffs] opinion of what a perfect remedy would be.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Connecticut Mobile Home Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Jensen\u2019s, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 586, 590, 424 A.2d 285 (1979). Accordingly, we conclude that a petition to the department for a declaratory ruling would not be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\"> The record includes, inter alia, the complaint, the evidence submitted at the March 12, 2009 hearing, affidavits and the court\u2019s memorandum of decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\"> Although the document contained in the record is dated July 28, 2006, at oral argument before this court the plaintiff asserted that the correct date the e-mail was sent was June 28, 2007. In the record, however, the plaintiffs amended second affidavit states that the correct date this e-mail was sent was July 28, 2007. The plaintiffs brief to this court also states the correct date as July 28, 2007.

Section 29-32b-15\u201d to the board on August 6, 2007, wherein he asked whether a valid permit holder may openly carry a firearm in the state. By e-mail, the board declined to issue a declaratory ruling stating that the plaintiffs request did not conform to the requirements of \u00a7 29-32b-15 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. The plaintiff subsequently filed another such document with the board, which the board declined to address, stating that such a \u201cruling on the petition as presented . . . would be inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b804-11\"> The department is created pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 29-lb (a).

See General Statutes \u00a7 7-294b; see also General Statutes \u00a7 29-lzz.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> General Statutes 4-176 (a) provides: \u201cAny person may petition an agency, or an agency may on its own motion initiate a proceeding, for a declaratory ruling as to the validity of any regulation, or the applicability to specified circumstances of a provision of the general statutes, a regulation, or a final decision on a matter within the jurisdiction of the agency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> In its ruling, the court explained that it had concluded the plaintiffs July 28, 2007 e-mail to the department was not a request for a declaratory ruling because it was \u201cnot denominated a declaratory ruling, [it gave] no factual background, and lack[ed] any statement of position, factual or legal, on the appropriate declaratory ruling to be given.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\"> At oral argument before this court, the department conceded that it has not adopted rules or regulations establishing a prescribed form and filing procedure for petitions for declaratory rulings. Section 4-176 (b) provides: \u201cEach agency shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, that provide for (1) the form and content of petitions for declaratory rulings, (2) the filing procedure for such petitions and (3) the procedural rights of persons with respect to the petitions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b808-14\"> We summarily reject the plaintiffs second claim that the department\u2019s failure to adopt rules of practice governing the submission of petitions for declaratory rulings constitutes a waiver of its jurisdiction to rule on such petitions. Section 4-176 statutorily enables a party to petition an agency for a declaratory ruling and imposes a duty on an agency to act pursuant to various deadlines upon the receipt of such a petition. See <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>64 Conn. App. 134, 141, 779 A.2d 817 (2001), appeal dismissed, 260 Conn. 180, 799 A.2d 294 (2002). The plaintiff has provided this court with no legal support, and our review of the case law has uncovered none, for the novel contention that the rights granted to him by \u00a7 4-176 (a), and the duties imposed on the department by \u00a7 4-176 (c) through (j) are dependent on the department first promulgating rules pursuant to \u00a7 4-176 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b809-6\"> See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\"> The plaintiff draws our attention to a letter dated June 9, 2009, that the department sent to him in response to six questions, all similar in substance to his original nine questions, that he had e-mailed to them on June 2, 2009. In that letter, the department stated that the newly e-mailed questions appear to \u201cpresent a request or requests for a declaratory ruling . . . .\u201d The plaintiff argues that the department\u2019s alternating interpretation of his similar questions is proof that a person cannot know the form, content and filing procedure required by the department for consideration of a request for a declaratory ruling. We disagree. As discussed above, \u00a7 4-176 (a), which grants aparty the right to file a petition for a declaratory ruling to an agency, does provide standards with which a party may fashion such a petition. In addition, the department\u2019s letter was written by a member of its legal affairs unit and expressly refused to provide answers to his questions because the plaintiffs appeal from the dismissal of his action for declaratory relief in the Superior Court was pending before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-28 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon the application of any person having a bona fide residence or place of business within the jurisdiction of any such authority, such chief of police, warden or selectman may issue a temporary state permit to such person to carry a pistol or revolver within the state, provided such authority shall find that such applicant intends to make no use of any pistol or revolver which such applicant may be permitted to carry under such permit other than a lawful use and that <em>such, person is a suitable person to receive such permit. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\"> In a footnote in his appellate brief, the plaintiff also broadly asserts that in light of <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>supra, 561 U.S. 742, it is now unconstitutional for Connecticut to prohibit the open carry of a firearm outside the home by one in possession of a permit. \u201cWe consistently have held that [ajnalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>118 Conn.
