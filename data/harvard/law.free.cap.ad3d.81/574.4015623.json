The Baumann defendants established their prima facie entitlement to summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against the infant defendant, and in opposition, Alrose failed to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(see Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 557 [1980]).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Additionally, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying that branch of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion which was for leave to amend the complaint to add a cause of action on behalf of Alrose based on concerted action liability insofar as asserted against the infant defendant. \u201cAlthough leave to amend a pleading \u2018shall be freely given\u2019 in the absence of surprise or prejudice, the determination whether to grant such leave is within the court\u2019s discretion, and the exercise of that discretion will not be lightly disturbed\u201d <em>(Comsewogue Union Free School Dist. v Allied-Trent Roofing Sys., Inc., </em>15 AD3d 523, 524 [2005], quoting CPLR 3025 [b]; <em>see Fischer v RWSP Realty, LLC, </em>53 AD3d 595, 596 [2008]). \u201c[W]here the application for leave to amend is made long after the action has been certified for trial, \u2018judicial discretion in allowing such amendments should be discrete, circumspect, prudent, and cautious\u2019 \u201d <em>(Morris v Queens Long Is. Med. Group, P.C., </em>49 AD3d 827, 828 [2008], quoting <em>Clarkin v Staten Is. Univ. Hosp., </em>242 AD2d 552 [1997]). \u201cMoreover, when . . . leave is sought on the eve of trial, judicial discretion should be exercised sparingly\u201d <em>(Morris v Queens Long Is. Med. Group, P.C., </em>49 AD3d at 828; <em>see American Cleaners, Inc. v American Intl. Specialty Lines Ins. Co., </em>68 AD3d 792 [2009]; <em>Comsewogue Union Free School Dist. v Allied-Trent Roofing Sys., Inc., </em>15 AD3d at 525). In light of Alrose\u2019s delay in moving for leave to amend its complaint to add a cause of action based on concerted action liability insofar as asserted against the infant defendant, and in light of the failure of Alrose to set forth a reasonable excuse for the delay in seeking such relief, we discern no reason to disturb the Supreme Court\u2019s determination on this issue <em>(see American Cleaners, Inc. v American Intl. Specialty Lines Ins. Co., </em>68 AD3d 792 [2009]; <em>Sampson v Contillo, </em>55 AD3d 591 [2008]; <em>Fischer v RWSP Realty, LLC, </em>53 AD3d at 596-597; <em>Cohen v Ho, </em>38 AD3d 705, 706 [2007]; <em>Comsewogue Union Free School Dist. v Allied-Trent Roofing Sys., Inc., </em>15 AD3d at 525).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Alrose\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.
