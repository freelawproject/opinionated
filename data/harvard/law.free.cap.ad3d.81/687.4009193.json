The defendant established, prima facie, that its alleged negligence in supervising the infant plaintiff was not a proximate cause of the injury-producing event <em>(see Benitez v New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>73 NY2d 650 [1989]; <em>Convey v City of Rye School Dist., </em>271 AD2d 154, 159-160 [2000]). In opposition, the plaintiffs failed to submit evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(see Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 557, 563 [1980]). The defendant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>established, prima facie, that it did not create or have actual or constructive notice of the alleged defective condition of the object which caused the injury of the plaintiff Neil R Frei <em>(see Gordon v American Museum of Natural History, </em>67 NY2d 836, 837-838 [1986]). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to submit evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(see Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d at 563).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contention is without merit. Rivera, J.P., Leventhal, Sgroi and Miller, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
