Thereafter he filed a post-conviction petition which was dismissed upon motion by the circuit court of Cook County, and he now appeals from that judgment of dismissal.</p> <p id=\"b574-5\" pgmap=\"574\">In this court he contends that an evidentiary hearing was required because his post-conviction petition alleged that on December 1, 1962, the date specified in the indictment as the date of the offense, he was in the custody of police officials of the city of LaGrange during the entire day. But even if there had been an error in the indictment, and upon a trial the proof had established that the offense was committed on a date other than the precise date alleged, that irregularity would not have constituted a fatal variance. (People v. Schmidt, 10 Ill.2d 221; People v. Rohde, 403 Ill. 41.) Such an irregularity, if it existed, was waived by the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty. People v. Dennis (1966), 34 Ill.2d 219.</p> <p id=\"b574-6\" pgmap=\"574\">The defendant also contends that the indictment to which he pleaded guilty was void because it did not set out the section of the Criminal Code alleged to have been violated. There is however no constitutional requirement that the statute alleged to have been violated be cited or set out in an indictment, and, as we held in People v. Delafosse, 36 Ill.2d 327, \u201cthe lack of specification of the statutory provision alleged to have been violated * * * \u00bfid not render the indictment fatally defective.\u201d 36 Ill.2d at 330.</p> <p id=\"b575-4\" pgmap=\"575\">Since the petition failed to state a violation of any constitutional provision, the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b575-5\" pgmap=\"575\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b575-6\" pgmap=\"575\">Mr. Justice Ward took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
