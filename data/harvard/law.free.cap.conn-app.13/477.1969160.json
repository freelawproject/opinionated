That decision denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for service connected disability retirement benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-169 (b). The dispositive issue of this appeal is whether the decision of the defendant was \u201cclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record . . . .\u2019\u2019General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g) (5). We conclude that the decision was clearly erroneous, and we find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">In December, 1979, the plaintiff was a mental health worker at Norwich Hospital, a state facility, when he was physically assaulted by a violent patient. In April, 1984, the hospital, acting pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-244,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requested the personnel division of the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>department of administrative services to seek a position for the plaintiff requiring less arduous duties. This request was predicated on the plaintiffs injuries suffered in December, 1979. The personnel division was unable to do so. In July, 1984, the plaintiff filed an application for service connected disability retirement benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-169 (b), <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that as a result of the December, 1979 attack he was permanently disabled from continuing to render service as a mental health worker. His claim had two medical bases: (1) injuries to his back, supported by reports of his orthopedic surgeon; and (2) psychiatric disability, supported by reports of his psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In October, 1984, a hearing on the plaintiffs application was held before the medical examining board pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-169 (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At this hearing, the plaintiff testified and introduced medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>reports by his orthopedic physician<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and by Michael P. O\u2019Brien, the psychiatrist who treated him for his condition resulting from the 1979 attack. In November, 1984, the board denied the plaintiff\u2019s application. The plaintiff then requested a reconsideration of the board\u2019s decision. The board held a second hearing and, in May, 1985, again denied the plaintiff\u2019s application. The plaintiff then requested the defendant commission to review the board\u2019s decision. The defendant adopted the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the defendant\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in sustaining the defendant\u2019s decision because (1) the decision was not based on substantial evidence, and (2) the defendant employed an erroneous legal standard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiff\u2019s first claim of error, and therefore need not reach his second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g) provides in pertinent part that, in an administrative appeal such as this case, \u201c[t]he court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. . . . The court may reverse or modify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: ... (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">This standard has been recently and exhaustively explained. We must sustain the agency decision if any one of its reasons is supported by substantial evidence, leaving the credibility of witnesses within the agency\u2019s province. <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 539-41, 525 A.2d 940 (1987). \u201c \u2018This so-called substantial evidence rule is similar to the \u201csufficiency of the evidence\u201d standard applied in judicial review of jury verdicts, and evidence is sufficient to sustain an agency finding if it affords \u201ca substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . .. [I]t must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\u201d . . . \u201cThe \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 rule is a compromise between opposing theories of broad or de novo review and restricted review or complete abstention. It is broad enough and capable of sufficient flexibility in its application to enable the reviewing court to correct whatever ascertainable abuses may arise in administrative adjudication. On the other hand, it is review of such breadth as is entirely consistent with effective administration. . . . [It] imposes an important limitation on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency . . . and to provide a more restrictive standard of review than standards embodying review of \u2018weight of the evidence\u2019 or \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 action. . . . \u201d \u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>[171 Conn. 705, 713-14, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert, denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977)]; <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>191 Conn.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>384, 409, 465 A.2d 308 (1983). The United States Supreme Court, in defining \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 in the \u2018directed verdict\u2019 formulation, has said that it \u2018is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 <em>Consolo </em>v. <em>Federal Maritime Commission, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966); see <em>Consolidated Edison Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S. Ct. 206, 83 L. Ed. 126 (1938). \u2018The reviewing court must take into account [that there is] contradictory evidence in the record . . . but \u201cthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence . . . .\u201d \u2019 <em>American Textile Manufacturers Institute, Inc. </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>452 U.S. 490, 523, 101 S. Ct. 2478, 69 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1981), quoting <em>Consolo </em>v. <em>Federal Maritime Commission, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u201cWe have said that an administrative agency is not required to believe any witness, even an expert, nor is it required to use in any particular fashion any of the materials presented to it so long as the conduct of the hearing is fundamentally fair. <em>Manor Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>180 Conn. 692, 697, 433 A.2d 999 (1980).\u201d <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 541-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We first note that the standard of disability which the plaintiff was required to establish was not that he was permanently disabled from rendering <em>any </em>service. It was, instead that \u201cwhile in state service, [he became] permanently disabled from continuing to render <em>the service in which he has been employed </em>as a result of any injury received while in the performance of his duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>as a state employee . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 5-169 (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">It is clear from the two decisions of the board that, while recognizing that the plaintiffs claim of a psychiatric disability was supported by substantial evidence, the board read that same evidence as insufficient to establish that the psychiatric disability was permanent. In its first decision, the board stated: \u201cWhile recognizing the substantial evidence of a psychiatric condition as presented by the applicant, the Board finds that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the psychiatric condition is permanently disabling. The Board takes note of a report from the applicant\u2019s psychiatrist, Doctor Michael P. O\u2019Brien, dated May 15th, 1984, which states that applicant, \u2018. . . have psychiatric treatment to avoid chronicity. . .\u2019\u2018Histreatment was prematurely terminated in March, 1981.\u2019 From the statement by the applicant\u2019s own psychiatric consultant, the Board infers that Doctor O\u2019Brien, himself, is not satisfied as to the permanence of the disability sustained by Mr. Briggs.\u201d In its second decision, the board stated: \u201cAfter consideration of new evidence submitted by the applicant, as well as the applicant\u2019s testimony, the Board again finds that while there is substantial evidence of psychiatric problems currently under treatment the Board notes that the applicant\u2019s psychiatrist states that there is improvement. \u2018He is less depressed. His speech is more spontaneous.\u2019 \u2018His concentration is improved. . .\u2019 With these considerations in mind the Board fails to find sufficient new evidence of the permanence of a psychiatric condition claimed by the applicant and therefore upholds its denial of service-connected disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>It is also clear that the board based its findings that the plaintiffs psychiatric disability was not permanent and its conclusion of evidentiary insufficiency on the reports of O\u2019Brien, the plaintiff\u2019s psychiatrist. As the plaintiff points out, however, the board\u2019s reading of those reports is distorted and unduly selective; it simply cannot be squared with a fair reading of the psychiatric reports in their proper context.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In his report of May 15, 1984, O\u2019Brien noted, inter alia, that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cpsychiatric condition continues relatively unchanged since my report of September 30, 1980 and subsequent treatment reports through March 16,1981.\u201d He diagnosed the plaintiff as having \u201c[p]ost-traumatic stress disorder, chronic.\u201d His report concluded: \u201cI recommended that Mr. Briggs have psychiatric treatment to avoid chronicity in my report of September 30, 1980. His treatment was prematurely terminated in March, 1981. Mr. Briggs\u2019 condition is the result of the injuries he sustained at Norwich State Hospital on December 28, 1979. He cannot return to work there at this time and his capacity for work elsewhere is not clear. His current mental state, which prevents him from rendering the service he performed at Norwich State Hospital, has persisted and may persist for an indefinite period, absent resumption of proper treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff introduced into evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>before the board the \u201cGuides To The Evaluation Of Permanent Impairment,\u201d published by the American Med<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ical Association. That document contains the following definition: \u201cThe term \u2018permanent\u2019 refers to a condition which results in a substantial loss of function despite treatment and which has persisted and may persist for an indefinite period.\u201d It is clear, therefore, that although O\u2019Brien\u2019s report did not use the term \u201cpermanent,\u201d O\u2019Brien was characterizing the plaintiff\u2019s condition at that time as permanent. In light of this, and taking O\u2019Brien\u2019s report as a whole, we find unsupported by substantial evidence the board\u2019s inference from O\u2019Brien\u2019s report that O\u2019Brien was \u201cnot satisfied as to the permanence of the disability sustained by Mr. Briggs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion as to the plaintiff\u2019s permanency became more clear in his next medical report, dated March 5,1985. In that report, O\u2019Brien referred to the \u201csevere psychic trauma that Mr. Briggs experienced when he was attacked at Norwich State Hospital and the subsequent denial of appropriate medical care for the stress disorder it caused.\u201d The report noted that the plaintiff is \u201cchronically depressed\u201d and that \u201c[t]he continuation of his frightening dreams, historically precipitated by the attack, and his continued psychic numbing (distance) indicate that his post-traumatic stress disorder is also chronic.\u201d O\u2019Brien concluded: \u201cMr. Briggs is permanently disabled from rendering the services he performed at Norwich State Hospital, and his permanent disability is the result of injuries he sustained at Norwich State Hospital on December 28, 1979.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The board selected isolated phrases from O\u2019Brien\u2019s reports which indicated some marginal improvement. Those phrases, taken out of context, do not, however, justify a reading of O\u2019Brien\u2019s report to support a finding of a lack of permanent disability. The board\u2019s conclusion simply does not square with the evidence on which that conclusion was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We emphasize that this is not a case in which the plaintiff submitted ambiguous or loosely phrased medical evidence, so as to justify the board in rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s application because the evidence yielded the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions or because of insufficient evidence. O\u2019Brien\u2019s reports were clear, detailed and unambiguous. Nor is this a case which turned in any way on the credibility of witnesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The board itself twice noted the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of the plaintiffs psychiatric condition. The only question was whether that condition was permanent, and the only evidence regarding that question was O\u2019Brien\u2019s reports. Nor does either of the board\u2019s decisions disclose that it was dissatisfied with the documentary nature of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence and required live testimony from O\u2019Brien instead. This is a case in which the board simply misconstrued the plain meaning of the documentary evidence as to the issue of the permanency of the plaintiff\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We also note that a determination today that the plaintiff is permanently disabled does not preclude a different determination tomorrow if his condition changes. \u201cRetirement income being paid for disability retirement shall end when and if the disability ends.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 5-169 (e). The plaintiff conceded at oral argument in this court that the defendant can request that he be reevaluated from time to time in order to determine whether he is still disabled and, if he is not, to end his benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We recognize that our scope of review of the defendant\u2019s actions is very limited. <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra. We recognize, also, that it is a rare case in which a challenge to an administrative agency\u2019s rejection of a claim for insufficient evidence will be successful, precisely because of that limited scope of review. This is that rare case. As we have said in another context, however, \u201c[ljimited appellate review . . . must not be a mere shibboleth on the basis of which the appellate court makes such review a nullity.\u201d <em>Ehrenkranz </em>v. <em>Ehrenkranz, </em>2 Conn. App. 416, 421, 479 A.2d 826 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">This conclusion leaves the question of the proper remedy on the remand. Ordinarily, in an administrative appeal, the court is warranted in issuing an order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the administrative agency only where the totality of the evidence before the agency can be said to constitute substantial evidence as a matter of law, \u201c \u2018supporting the . . . finding that only one conclusion [granting] the plaintiffs [application] could be reached, thereby compelling a modification of the administrative decision and directed order to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Denby </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>6 Conn. App. 47, 57-58, 502 A.2d 954 (1986), quoting <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>191 Conn. 384, 409-410, 465 A.2d 308 (1983); see also <em>Plastic Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>5 Conn. App. 219, 230, 497 A.2d 1005 (1985) (judgment directed where agency could reach only one conclusion as a matter of law). Our review of the record in this case leads us to conclude that this is such a case. The totality of the evidence before the board constituted substantial evidence as a matter of law that the plaintiff suffered a psychiatric disability resulting from the attack at Norwich Hospital, which rendered him permanently incapable of continuing to perform services as a mental health worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment reversing the defendant\u2019s decision and ordering the defendant to grant the plaintiff\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-244 provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen [a state] employee has become physically or mentally incapable of . . . the effi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>cient performance of the duties of his position, by reason of infirmities due to advanced age or other disability, the appointing authority shall recommend to the commissioner of administrative services that the employee be transferred to less arduous duties or separated from state service in good standing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-169 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf a member [of the state employees retirement system], while in state service, becomes permanently disabled from continuing to render the service in which he has been employed as a result of any injury received while in the performance of his duty as a state employee, such member is eligible for disability retirement regardless of his period of state service.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-169 (c) provides: \u201cThe governor shall appoint a board of seven physicians, each of whom is a state employee and two of whom shall be experienced in psychiatry, to serve at his pleasure as a medical examining board to determine whether each applicant for disability retirement is entitled thereto. Three of such members, one of whom shall be the elected chairman or the elected secretary of the board, shall constitute a quorum for the determination of any applicant\u2019s entitlement. The chairman or the secretary shall report the findings of the board to the retirement commission from time to time as requested by the commission as to the entitlement of each applicant or the continuance of disability of members so retired. The comptroller is authorized to pay for stenographic and professional services as requested and approved by the board.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> Although in this appeal the plaintiff has not abandoned his claim that the defendant improperly rejected his claim of an orthopedic disability, the principal thrust of his appeal focuses on his psychiatric disability. Since we find error regarding that disability, it is'not necessary to discuss the plaintiffs orthopedic disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b494-10\"> The defendant commission concluded (1) that it deferred, as an administrative policy, to the board\u2019s judgment in disability cases, because it lacked the expertise to judge the medical evidence independently, and (2) that the statute creating the board was intended to make the board the final administrative arbiter of medical issues. The plaintiff does not challenge these determinations. We therefore consider the decision of the board as that of the defendant commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b494-11\"> The plaintiff also claims that the decision denied him due process of law. This claim, however, is simply a conclusion based solely on his first two claims. We therefore do not regard it as a separately presented claim of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\"> It is not disputed that the plaintiff was attacked and injured \u201cwhile in state service,\u201d or that his disability is \u201cas a result of [the] injury received while in the performance of his duty as a state employee.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 5-169 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\"> O\u2019Brien\u2019s entire report dated May 15, 1984, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u201cConfidential Henry Briggs</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Psychiatric Report May 15, 1984</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u201cMr. Briggs\u2019 psychiatric condition continues relatively unchanged since my report of September 30,1980 and subsequent treatment reports through March 16, 1981.

He has the early morning awakening form of insomnia and is irritable and vigilant. He reports decreased frequency of nightmares.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u201cHe states that he has not been able to find work because of his past medical history of injury. He went to computer school but there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>computer job. He feels that his doctor, wife and lawyer have understood him more in recent years than before but it is not clear to what extent he has informed other people of his problems. Apparently, he told his wife some aspects of what had happened to him and was surprised when she told him that he had not mentioned them before. He thought he had.

His speech is slow and quiet. His mood is depressed and his affect constricted. His thinking is tangential but there are no delusions. His thought content is despairing but he is not suicidal at this time. Serial sevens and number repetition showed impaired concentration but good effort.

He cannot return to work there at this time and his capacity for work elsewhere is not clear. His current mental state, which prevents him from rendering the service he performed at Norwich State Hospital, has persisted and may persist for an indefinite period, absent resumption of proper treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">We note that the board based its first decision partially on O\u2019Brien\u2019s statement that the plaintiff\u2019s treatment was prematurely terminated in March, 1981. The plaintiff claims that this termination was not of his doing, but was the result of a decision by the state to terminate payment for this treatment. He testified before the board that O\u2019Brien \u201creceived a letter from Attorney General Girard telling him to stop seeing me. This was about the same time that they stopped paying the [workers\u2019] compensation money. So, I stopped seeing him.\u201d He also testified that his orthopedic physician \u201cwanted me to continue seeing Dr. O\u2019Brien but I can\u2019t pay Dr. O\u2019Brien. So, I had to stop. Dr. O\u2019Brien put me on some medication and the medication has helped. I will say that. But I cannot see him, what he asks for his fees.\u201d Although there is no letter in this record from the attorney general withdrawing payment for continued treatment by Dr. O\u2019Brien, the defendant in this court agreed \u201cthat treatment [by O\u2019Brien] was terminated under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Program. ...\u201d Furthermore, in O\u2019Brien\u2019s subsequent report, dated March 5,1985; see footnote 9, infra; he referred to the \u201csubsequent denial of appropriate medical care for the stress disorder\u201d caused by the incident at Norwich Hospital. There is no suggestion, therefore, in this record that the plaintiff voluntarily terminated treatment with O\u2019Brien prematurely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b500-6\"> O\u2019Brien\u2019s entire report, dated March 5, 1985, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u201cConfidential March 5, 1985</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Psychiatric Report Henry Briggs</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u201cMr. Briggs was seen today for re-evaluation.

His concentration is improved and his judgment remains intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u201cConsidering the history of severe psychic trauma that Mr. Briggs experienced when he was attacked at Norwich State Hospital and the subsequent denial of appropriate medical care for the stress disorder it caused, it is not surprising that he continues to show signs of stress disorder as well as depression even with therapeutic dosage of Imipramine. The medication has reduced the severity of the neurovegetative symptoms but he is chronically depressed. The continuation of his frightening dreams, historically precipitated by the attack, and his continued psychic numbing (distance) indicate that his post-traumatic stress disorder is also chronic. Mr. Briggs is permanently disabled from rendering the services he performed at Norwich State Hospital, and his permanent disability is the result of injuries he sustained at Norwich State Hospital on December 28, 1979.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
