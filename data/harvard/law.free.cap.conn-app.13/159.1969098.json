(Spectrum), from a decision of the commission denying Spectrum\u2019s application to renew a special permit to operate a game room. The commission contends that the trial court erred (1) in concluding that the denial of a special permit was unwarranted because it imposed an unauthorized semi-policing obligation on Spectrum, and (2) in holding that there was no evidence presented to the commission to support its denial of the special permit renewal application. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The facts relevant to this appeal are as follows: Spectrum owns and operates a video arcade located in a shopping center in Ellington. The shopping center is in a commercial zone. Ellington zoning regulations require a special permit to operate an amusement enterprise, such as a video arcade, in a commercial zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">On July 1, 1983, Spectrum was granted a one year special permit to use its location as a game room, subject to the condition, among others, that it \u201cshall con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>trol loitering and other nuisance occurrences from the public which may disrupt the quiet enjoyment <em>of </em>area residents and other businesses occupying the shopping center.\u201d Spectrum did not challenge the validity of this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">In 1984, Spectrum applied for renewal of its special permit. At a public hearing before the commission, testimony was adduced from nearby business owners and residents concerning noise, litter, vandalism, loitering and use of drugs and alcohol in the shopping center by patrons of Spectrum. The commission unanimously denied the application for the renewal of the special permit on the ground that Spectrum \u201cfailed to control loitering and nuisances which have disrupted the quiet enjoyment of neighbors and the other businesses in the area.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Spectrum appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. The court sustained the appeal, holding that the commission could not \u201cimpose a semi-policing obligation upon a special permit applicant,\u201d and that \u201cthere was no evidence presented to the commission from which [it] could conclude that [Spectrum] created or maintained any nuisance or supported any loitering.\u201d We granted certification for appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The commission first claims that the court erred because Spectrum did not appeal the 1983 special con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>dition requiring it to control loitering and nuisances, and therefore the validity of that condition was not an issue before the trial court in this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">When Spectrum applied for renewal of its special permit in 1984, it did so with full knowledge that attached to the special permit was a condition requiring it to control \u201cloitering and other nuisance occurrences.\u201d Of critical significance here is the fact that after accepting the conditions imposed in 1983 without legal challenge, Spectrum sought a renewal of the special permit which included those conditions. Spectrum did not contest the imposition of the conditions before the commission with respect to the renewal of the permit. Just as a party may not ordinarily ask for a certain result and then challenge its validity on appeal; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>205 Conn. 262, 275, 533 A.2d 545 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>13 Conn. App. 40, 43, 534 A.2d 623 (1987); see also <em>Giulietti </em>v. <em>Connecticut Ins. Placement Facility, </em>205 Conn. 424, 429, 534 A.2d 213 (1987); a party may not challenge on appeal the validity of a preexisting condition to a special permit which it seeks to renew. Having failed to challenge it when it was imposed, Spectrum was in no position to contest the validity of the condition when the commission evaluated Spectrum\u2019s renewal application by looking to its noncompliance with the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Spectrum, citing <em>Parish of St. Andrews Church </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 350, 354, 232 A.2d 916 (1967), argues that an unauthorized condition upon a special permit is void, and therefore any denial of the renewal of a permit based upon a failure to comply with that condition is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. The <em>Parish of St. Andrews Church </em>decision is distinguishable. That case involved a direct challenge to a condition attached to a special permit. Here, Spectrum accepted the condition imposed upon its special permit and acquiesced in the validity of that condition by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>application for renewal. Spectrum has not directed our attention to any case in which a special permit condition was declared void in a similar collateral attack on its validity. Finally, we note that if we held otherwise, and allowed an applicant to challenge the validity of a special permit condition which was not questioned until after the applicant\u2019s noncompliance, a special permit applicant would have it both ways, making the system of land use regulation contemplated by General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 impractical and unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The trial court also concluded that there was no evidence that Spectrum \u201ccreated or maintained any nuisance or supported any loitering.\u201d This conclusion was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u201c \u2018Courts are not to substitute their judgment for that of the board . . . and decisions of local boards will not be disturbed so long as honest judgment has been reasonably and fairly exercised after a full hearing. . . . \u201cUpon appeal, the trial court reviews the record before the board to determine whether it has acted fairly or with proper motives or upon valid reasons.\u201d \u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>179 Conn. 650, 654, 427 A.2d 1346 (1980). Since the \u2018credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the province of the administrative agency\u2019; <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>180 Conn. 421, 425, 429 A.2d 910 (1980); the court must determine the correctness of the conclusions from the record on which they are based. <em>Housatonic Terminal Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>168 Conn. 304, 306, 362 A.2d 1375 (1975).\u201d <em>Torsiello </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>3 Conn. App. 47, 49-50, 484 A.2d 483 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u201cWhere a zoning authority has stated the reasons for its action, a reviewing court may only determine if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>reasons given are supported by the record and are pertinent to the decision. <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 23, 25-26, 376 A.2d 385 (1977) ... The decision of a zoning authority will only be disturbed if it is shown that it was arbitrary, illegal or an abuse of discretion. <em>Beit Havurah </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>177 Conn. 440, 444, 418 A.2d 82 (1979).\u201d Id., 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The commission\u2019s decision was based upon a finding that Spectrum failed to control loitering and nuisances by its patrons which disrupted the quiet enjoyment of nearby residents and businesses. The issue of whether Spectrum \u201ccreated\u201d or \u201csupported\u201d those activities was not relevant to an evaluation of the commission\u2019s conclusion. The evidence presented to the commission amply supported its determination that Spectrum had failed to control, or even attempt in good faith to control, the disruptive behavior of its patrons. In passing upon an application for a special permit, Ellington zoning regulations mandate the commission to consider, inter alia, \u201cthe need for the proposed use; existing and future character of the neighborhood . . . and protection of neighborhood property values. ...\u201d Ellington Zoning Regulation 4.1 (f). Having concluded that Spectrum had not fulfilled a condition of its special permit and had failed to control the objectionable conduct of its patrons, the commission\u2019s conclusion was based on the evidence before it and was properly guided by the standards set forth in the applicable statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to dismiss the appeal of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> The commission enumerated other reasons for its decision to deny renewal of the special permit. The trial court concluded that these other reasons could not support the decision of the commission. The commission does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion in this regard. Since the commission\u2019s decision must be upheld if supported by any one reason given; <em>Hoagland </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>1 Conn. App. 285, 290, 471 A.2d 655 (1984); and since the commission contests the trial court\u2019s conclusion only with respect to the validity of the commission\u2019s action based on its finding that Spectrum failed to control loitering and nuisances, our review is limited to this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
