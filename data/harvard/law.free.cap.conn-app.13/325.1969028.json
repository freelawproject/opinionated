The plaintiffs claim the trial court erred (1) in using an incorrect standard for its decision on the motion to strike, and (2) in its interpretation of the charter of the city. We find the issues to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Most of the facts are not in dispute. On April 21, 1986, the clerk of the city of Groton received a petition signed by the plaintiffs and other electors of the town seeking to convene a special meeting of the electors for the purpose of acting on three resolutions pursuant to article IV, section I of the city charter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The resolutions to be considered directed the mayor and city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>council (1) to engage special counsel to institute legal action to challenge the constitutionality of Special Acts 1985, No. 34, which authorized conveyance from the State to a private developer of the Branford House, an historic mansion located in the city of Groton, (2) to expend the sum of $20,000 for that legal action, charging this expense to contingency or unencumbered funds, or, if no such funds were available, borrowing such sums in anticipation of next fiscal year taxes, and (3) to employ architectural engineering, recreational, historic preservation, and cultural consultants to study the acquisition of the Branford House by the city of Groton in accordance with its plan of development.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Prior to the meeting scheduled to consider these proposals on May 15,1986, a petition, signed by more than four electors was filed seeking a referendum on the resolutions, pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 7-7. The defendant city clerk of Groton refused to schedule such a referendum, and the plaintiffs thereupon brought this action of mandamus to compel the referendum. At the hearing to show cause why the writ should not be granted, the defendants moved to strike the complaint pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 545 alleging it failed to state a cause of action for which relief could be granted, in that it was legally insufficient since the proposed resolutions clearly exceeded the power of the electorate under the charter of the city of Groton.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The plaintiffs challenge an act which no longer exists. Special Acts 1985, No. 34,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which is the basis of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>petition for a writ of mandamus was repealed by Special Acts 1987, No. 29. Obviously, the plaintiffs cannot challenge the constitutionality of an act which no longer exists nor can they seek to expend money for that purpose, as sought by the first two resolutions. See <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor </em>Control, 5 Conn. App. 432, 499 A.2d 432 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The authority given to the board of trustees of the University of Connecticut to sell the state-owned Bran-ford House to private developers was withdrawn, thereby extinguishing the threat of the public use of the property. Although the property may no longer be available for sale, the plaintiffs argue that the state may in the future declare it to be surplus property, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 3-14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If that were to occur then the city of Groton would have an option to purchase that property under General Statutes \u00a7 3-14b.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>plaintiffs use this statute to claim that the third resolution is not moot. This is highly speculative and we are not persuaded by this argument as it refers to the third resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We conclude that no practical relief may be granted to the plaintiffs because the property in this matter is not subject to Special Acts 1985, No. 34, the act about which the plaintiffs complain. See <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 149, 96 S. Ct. 347, 46 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1975). Jurisdiction over an appeal requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>existence of an actual and present controversy. <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 436, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981); <em>Connecticut Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>International Ladies Garment Workers Union, </em>177 Conn. 17,19, 411 A.2d 1 (1979). This court will not entertain academic questions. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Tynan, </em>148 Conn. 456, 459, 172 A.2d 190 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u201cIt is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. <em>Connecticut State Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>188 Conn. 196, 199, 448 A.2d 1341 (1982); <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>186 Conn. 247, 440 A.2d 310 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Macri, </em>189 Conn. 568, 569, 456 A.2d-1203 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-11\"> Article IV, section 1 provides in part: <em>\u201cA </em>special city meeting shall be convened when the Mayor and Council deem it necessary.
