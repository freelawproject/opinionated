The charges stemmed from the sexual abuse of the defendant\u2019s son, C, and daughter, R, ages six and three and one-half respectively, at the time of the crimes. The defendant claims the trial court erred (1) in admitting hearsay testimony regarding R\u2019s identification of the defendant as her assailant, (2) in determining that the defendant\u2019s son was competent to testify, and (3) in its instruction to the jury on circumstantial evidence. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the evening of October 29,1984, the defendant brought R, who spoke only Spanish, to the emergency room at Danbury Hospital, suffering from a copious vaginal discharge. Such an abnormal discharge suggested two potential causes: a foreign body within the vagina causing an infection; or venereal disease, particularly gonorrhea. Attempts at an examination to determine whether a foreign body was present were inconclusive, and tests for gonorrhea required forty-eight hours to render conclusive results. The defendant took the child home before the cause of the discharge could be determined but brought her back the following evening. Upon R\u2019s return to the hospital, the examining physician enlisted the aid of a Spanish-speaking security guard to take R\u2019s medical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Out of the presence of the defendant and the doctor, R indicated to the security guard, without speaking but by nodding her head, that she had not placed foreign objects inside her body, that she had been molested and that the molesting individual was her father. The security guard attempted to have the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>repeat her responses in the presence of the treating physician but she refused. The defendant ultimately agreed to admit R to the hospital that night. The culture taken from R tested positive for a strain of gonorrhea for which the defendant had been treated only two days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The trial court found that R was unavailable to testify because she had stopped responding to questions regarding the relationship with her father and as the trial approached, began to experience nightmares and incidents of vomiting. At trial, the hospital security guard testified concerning his conversation with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">After a hearing on the issue of competency, the court allowed C, the defendant\u2019s son, to testify. C testified that the defendant had sexually molested both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court erred in allowing into evidence R\u2019s nonverbal \u201cstatements\u201d identifying him as her assailant. He claims that the admission of this hearsay evidence was both an erroneous evidentiary ruling and a violation of his right of confrontation under both the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The state contends that R\u2019s identification of her father as her assailant falls within three exceptions to the hearsay rule: (1) as a statement made for purposes of medical treatment or diagnosis; (2) as an excited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>utterance; and (3) as a statement which is admissible under the residual hearsay exception. We find the statement admissible under the first of the three exceptions and need not determine whether the remaining exceptions apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Connecticut recognizes nonverbal communications as hearsay statements. <em>Hine et al., Appeal from Probate, </em>68 Conn. 551, 557-58, 37 A.2d 384 (1897); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (1986 Sup.) \u00a7 11.2, pp. 146-47. Connecticut also recognizes a long standing exception to the hearsay rule which allows into evidence statements made by a patient to a physician for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Blauvelt, </em>152 Conn. 272, 274, 205 A.2d 773 (1964); <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>American Tube &amp; Stamping Co., </em>79 Conn. 498, 504, 66 A. 4 (1907); B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence (1988 Sup.), \u00a7 100c, p. 985; Tait &amp; LaPlante, supra. This case requires us to determine (1) whether the \u201cstatements\u201d made by R fall within the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule, and (2) whether such statements which actually identify an assailant are admissible under that same exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Federal Rule of Evidence 803 (4), which is virtually identical to the rule established in Connecticut case law, has given rise to a line of cases making the exception applicable to cases involving physical or sexual abuse of children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Iron Shell, </em>633 F.2d 77 (8th Cir. 1980), utilized a two part test to determine whether hearsay statements should have been admitted under the medical treatment exception. \u201cFirst, [was] the declarant\u2019s motive consistent with the purpose of [obtaining medical treatment]; and second, [was] it reasonable for the physician to rely on the information in diagnosis or treatment.\u201d Id., 84. Such a test ensures that the information being allowed into evidence was rendered with a guarantee of trustworthiness sufficient to justify an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Both criteria are satisfied in the present case. R, the young abuse victim, was told by the Spanish-speaking security guard that he was questioning her to aid in the doctor\u2019s treatment. The security guard testified that R understood what she was being told. She was aware that she had a problem that needed medical attention, and was not coached as to expected replies. There is no indication that R\u2019s responses were motivated by any reason other than the need for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">As to the second prong of the <em>Iron Shell </em>test, the information sought was relevant to treatment and was reasonably relied upon by the treating physician. Given the limited number of potential causes for R\u2019s infection, the uncertainty of the diagnosis at the time of R\u2019s questioning and the absence of other possible sources of infection, it was reasonable for the treating physician to rely upon the information gleaned from R\u2019s conversation with the security guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">While statements regarding causation or identification are not generally allowed into evidence under the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule; see Tait &amp; LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 11.12c; the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has carved an exception out of this restriction which we adopt today. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Renville, </em>779 F.2d 430 (8th Cir. 1985), the court applied the medical treatment exception to the identification by an eleven year old sexual assault victim, of her stepfather as her abuser. While acknowledging that the court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Iron Shell, </em>supra, found that statements to a treating physician regarding identity of an assailant \u201c \u2018would seldom, if ever\u2019 be reasonably pertinent to treatment or diagnosis\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Renville, </em>supra, 436, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Iron Shell, </em>supra, 84; the <em>Renville </em>court made an exception for cases in which the party being identified as the assailant in a sexual abuse case was a member of the victim\u2019s household: \u201cWe believe that a statement by a child abuse victim that the abuser is a member of the victim\u2019s immediate household presents a sufficiently different case from that envisaged by the drafters of rule 803 (4) [so] that it should not fall under the general rule. Statements by a child abuse victim to a physician during an examination that the abuser is a member of the victim\u2019s immediate household <em>are </em>reasonably pertinent to treatment.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Renville, </em>supra, 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The <em>Renville </em>rationale applies in the present case. First, the injury in question is not purely somatic. It is beyond dispute that child abuse results in emotional and psychological, as well as physical, injury. An aspect of these less apparent, but equally devastating forms of injury, may be directly linked with the identity of the abuser. While the identity of a party causing an injury is rarely germane to medical treatment, \u201cthe exact nature and extent of psychological problems which ensue from child abuse often depend on the identity of the abuser.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Renville, </em>supra, 437. \u201cThe psychological sequelae of sexual molestation by a father, other relative, or family friend may be different and require different treatment than those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>resulting from abuse by a stranger. . . . Furthermore, effective treatment may require that the victim avoid contact with the abuser, not just to prevent further abuse, but also to facilitate recovery from past abuse.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>153 Ariz. 191, 200, 735 P.2d 801, 810 (1987). In the present case, the fact that R\u2019s abuser was her father could have had untold adverse emotional and psychological effects, subject to successful diagnosis and treatment only with the physician\u2019s knowledge of the assailant\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Second, although a statement regarding fault is not ordinarily relevant to prevention of recurrence, in cases of sexual abuse in the home, there is a direct correlation between identity and recurrence. Because child abuse cases often reveal a pattern of continued abuse, information regarding identity is often necessary to diagnose the extent and likelihood of further harm to the victim. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Renville, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u201cInformation that the abuser is a member of the household is therefore \u2018reasonably pertinent\u2019 to a course of treatment which includes removing the child from the home.\u201d Id., 438. We therefore conclude that in cases of sexual abuse in the home, hearsay statements made in the course of medical treatment which reveal the identity of the abuser, are reasonably pertinent to treatment and are admissible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The defendant also claims that the admission of the hearsay statements violated his constitutional confron-</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tation rights. The existence of numerous exceptions to the hearsay rule indicate that the right to confrontation is not absolute under all circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 695, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987). The U.S. Supreme Court holds that dispensing with in-court confrontation is permitted if two conditions are met: (1) if the declarant\u2019s in-court testimony is unavailable, and (2) if the declarant\u2019s out-of-court statement bears adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980). The trial court properly found that R was unavailable to testify because of severe and repeated adverse physical and psychological reactions to attempts to prepare her for trial. In <em>Roberts, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court also held that the second prong of the test, the indicia of reliability, \u201ccan be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra. This second requisite is satisfied by our conclusion that R\u2019s \u201cstatements\u201d to the security guard fall within the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra (statement of five-year old sexual abuse victim to physician regarding abuse and the identity of her abuser admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803 (4) and, therefore, not a violation of the confrontation clause). \u201cWe note, moreover, that the [United States] Supreme Court has construed the confrontation clause in a pragmatic fashion, recognizing the need to balance the rights of the accused against the public\u2019s \u2018strong interest in effective law enforcement.\u2019 <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>[supra, 64], <em>That interest is nowhere stronger than in the case of defenseless child abuse victims. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dorian, </em>803 F.2d 1439, 1447 (8th Cir. 1986). Applying the protections established by the United States Supreme Court to the facts of the present case, we conclude that the admission of R\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>communications did not violate the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The defendant next assigns error to the trial court\u2019s determination of C\u2019s competency to testify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">It is beyond dispute that the age of a witness is not the decisive factor in determining his competency; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 139, 439 A.2d 918 (1981); and that this determination is a matter in which the trial court is granted substantial discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>189 Conn. 1, 9, 454 A.2d 256, cert, denied, 461 U.S. 933, 103 S. Ct. 2098, 77 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1983). A trial court\u2019s ruling will be disturbed only upon a finding of clear abuse of that discretion or an error of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barkal, </em>8 Conn. App. 313, 315, 512 A.2d 972, cert, denied, 201 Conn. 812, 517 A.2d 630 (1986). Our review of the record in the present case indicates no abuse of discretion or error of law. The trial court\u2019s unusually thorough inquiry was more than adequate for its evaluation of the child\u2019s maturity and its effect on his ability to receive accurate sensory impressions, to recall and narrate events and the subject matter of his testimony, and to appreciate the moral duty to tell the truth. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barkal, </em>supra. The trial court\u2019s determination that C was competent to testify was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of error concerns the trial court\u2019s jury instruction regarding circumstantial evidence. The defendant alleges that the instruction impermissibly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proving beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>a reasonable doubt, each essential element of the offenses charged, because it stated that an inference to be drawn need only be reasonable and logical. The defendant alleges the charge should have also required the jury to find that any inference drawn be established beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Despite the defendant\u2019s failure to object or take exception to the instruction, we will review the claim, \u201cbecause it implicates the fundamental constitutional right that the state prove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>204 Conn. 769, 772, 529 A.2d 1283 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Our disposition of this issue is controlled by the holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>supra. There, our Supreme Court held that the trial court did not err in giving a virtually identical instruction on inferences and circumstantial evidence. The defendant\u2019s claim in that case was the same as that made in the present case, namely, that the instruction diluted the standard of proof borne by the state. <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The court held otherwise. \u201cWe do not perceive the same potential for confusion of the jury in the \u2018reasonable\u2019 and \u2018logical\u2019 language that we have found in the \u2018more probable than not\u2019 phrase. We note that three recent Appellate Court decisions have rejected claims that an instruction permitting a jury to draw \u2018reasonable and logical\u2019 inferences is improper. <em>State </em>v. <em>Widget, </em>[11 Conn. App. 47, 525 A.2d 548 (1987)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>10 Conn. App. 683, 691-92, 525 A. 2d 528 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>9 Conn. App. 275, 280-82, 518 A.2d 658 (1986). \u2018The statement that inferences should be reasonable and logically drawn is not, in and of itself, erroneous. In fact, such an instruction, it has previously been recognized,.is \u201centirely proper.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 282; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>194 Conn. 594, 598, 483 A.2d 1087 (1984); D. Borden &amp; L. Orland, Connecticut Criminal Jury Instructions \u00a7 2.5, pp. 43-44.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>supra, 691.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>supra, 774</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">With regard to circumstantial evidence, the trial court in the present case expressly instructed the jury that \u201c[wjhether or not to draw an inference or a conclusion of fact and whether it\u2019s proven beyond a reasonable doubt, as I\u2019ve stated before, is entirely up to you.\u201d Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>supra, 691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-11\"> Although the defendant makes his claim under both article first, \u00a7 8 of the constitution of Connecticut and the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, \u201che offers no separate analysis of the Connecticut constitution as a basis for different treatment of the federal and state constitutional claims. We decline to undertake such analysis.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foshay, </em>12 Conn. App. 1, 14 n.10, 530 A.2d 611 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> Federal Rule of Evidence 803 (4) provides: \u201cThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness: ...
