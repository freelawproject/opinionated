A state trial referee, acting as the trial court, dismissed the appeal. The plaintiff appeals from that dismissal. The plaintiff claims that the court erred in holding that the defendant properly assessed the plaintiffs personal property pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-71 (b). We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff owns real and personal property located in the town of East Haven. On October 1, 1985, the assessors for East Haven determined that the plaintiffs real property would be liable for taxation at a rate of 70 percent of its true and actual value as of October 1,1981, the date of the town\u2019s last decennial revaluation. The assessors further determined that the plaintiff\u2019s personal property would be liable for taxation at 70 percent of its true and actual value as determined on October 1,1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The plaintiff does not contest the legitimacy of the decennial revaluation of real property authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 12-62,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nor the method by which real property is valued. General Statutes \u00a7 12-64.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the plaintiff contends that the language of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 12-71 (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and its legislative history require that towns value real and personal property on the same date so that the two are taxed at the same effective rate, not merely at the same percentage of their assessed value. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Prior to 1957, the legislature provided for the taxation of both real and personal property at its \u201ctrue and actual valuation.\u201d <em>E. Ingraham Co. </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>144 Conn. 374, 379, 132 A.2d 563 (1957). In that case, our Supreme Court was asked to reduce the plaintiffs\u2019 personal property rate from 90 percent of the property\u2019s actual value to 50 percent, the rate of taxation for real property. The court concluded that, although the practice of taxing real and personal property at a fraction of its actual value was so widespread as to be respectable, the practice was illegal because the statute required the taxing of both real and personal property at 100 percent of its value. Id., 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In response to the decision in <em>E. Ingraham Co., </em>the legislature revised General Statutes \u00a7 12-71 (b), changing the relevant portion of the statute from \u201c[a]ll property subject to this section shall be valued at their then actual valuation\u201d to \u201c[a]ll property subject to this section shall be valued at the same percentage of its then actual valuation as the assessors have determined with respect to the listing of real estate for the same year. . . .\u201d Statements made during the legislative hearings indicate an understanding that the change would eliminate the inequity that had existed when real and personal property were taxed at different fractions of their actual value.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The plaintiff contends that East Haven\u2019s implementation of General Statutes \u00a7 12-71 (b) fails to carry out the intention of the legislature. The plaintiff also points out that because real property is subject to revaluation every ten years, real property retains its assessed value for that period whether its actual value increases or decreases; see <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 525 A.2d 91 (1987);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> while personal property is valued annually. The plaintiff points out that real property located in the town of East Haven which comes into existence between revaluations is taxed at 70 percent of the value it would have had at the time of the last decennial revaluation. Personal property, by contrast, is taxed at 70 percent of its current value, the property\u2019s value being determined annually on the first of October. The plaintiff contends, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>therefore, that because General Statutes \u00a7 12-71 (b) mandates that towns tax real and personal property at the same \u201cpercentage\u201d of its then actual valuation as determined for real estate for the same year, there cannot be an inconsistency in when the value of the two types of property is determined.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In support of its argument that the defendant acted illegally in valuing the plaintiffs real and personal property on different dates resulting in different effective tax rates, the plaintiff cites at length from the legislative history of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> What is lacking from this history is any indication that the legislature intended a prohibition against the practice of valuing personal property annually.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">At the time the legislature revised General Statutes \u00a7 12-71, both real property and personal property were required to be listed annually for taxation at their then actual value.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The practice of requiring a decennial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>revaluation of property, however, was limited to real property. \u201c \u2018The presumption is that the legislature, in adopting an act, does so in view of existing relevant enactments and with the intention that the act be read with them so as to make one consistent body of law.\u2019 <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>142 Conn. 646, 654, 116 A.2d 420 (1955).\u201d <em>Drisdelle </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>3 Conn. App. 343, 345-46, 488 A.2d 465, cert, denied, 196 Conn. 801, 491 A.2d 1104 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u201c \u2018It is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that statutes are to be construed so that they carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>out the intent of the legislature.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 561, 429 A.2d 960 (1980); 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.05. In construing a statute, this court will consider its plain language, its legislative history, its purpose and the circumstances surrounding its enactment. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 64, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985); <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214-15, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 161, 496 A.2d 186 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">There is nothing in either the language of General Statutes \u00a7 12-71 (b) or its legislative history which calls into question the practice of revaluing real property every ten years but valuing personal property annually. This conclusion is consistent with the legislature\u2019s decision to give tax assessors the authority to increase or decrease the \u201cvaluation of property\u201d which appears on the town\u2019s annual grand lists. General Statutes \u00a7 12-55.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that this language provides for a permissive valuation of property in the years between the decennial revaluations, without requiring it. See <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 437. There is nothing in this language which requires that the assessors carry out interim revaluation of all classes of property if they revalue one class of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Rather, \u00a7 12-55 allows towns to engage in voluntary tax relief when property has decreased in value. See <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 430 n.5. If we were to conclude, as the plaintiff argues, that real property and personal property must be valued on the same date, we would vitiate the express language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>of \u00a7 12-55 because we would then be requiring that assessors treat real property and personal property in an identical fashion during the years between the decennial revaluation. We note that the nature of personal property lends itself to an annual valuation, often completely losing its useful value in a ten year period. Real property, by contrast, is durable and nearly always appreciates in value. See <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra. Furthermore, personalty is generally assessed annually at a lower value than each preceding year because it depreciates. <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 429. Thus, owners of personalty receive the benefit of a declining value each year for the purposes of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We conclude that there is no basis for rejecting the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the town of East Haven acted within the authority granted to it by the legislature by taxing the plaintiff\u2019s real and personal property as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\\</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-62 provides in relevant part: \u201cperiodic revaluation of real estate, (a) Commencing October 1, 1978, the assessors of all towns, consolidated towns and cities and consolidated towns and boroughs shall, no later than ten years following the last preceding revaluation of all real property and every ten years after each such revaluation, view all of the real estate of their respective municipalities, and shall revalue the same for assessment and, in the performance of these duties, except in any municipality where there is a single assessor, at least two of the assessors shall act together, and all valuations shall be separately approved by a majority of the assessors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-64 provides in relevant part: \u201creal estate liable to taxation. . . .

Our Supreme Court held that a tov^n is not \u201crequired, as a matter of law, to adjust the plaintiffs\u2019 tax assessment in the interim period between decennial revaluations of real property.\u201d The court reached this conclusion after an exhaustive analysis of the relevant statutes. Our reading of <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>is that the court confined itself to reaffirming its holding in <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>182 Conn. 619, 438 A.2d 782 (1981), that a town cannot be required to revalue real property in the years between the ten year revaluation, and that this interpretation applies to personal property as well. Although the effect of <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>was to treat both realty and personalty in the manner which the plaintiffs in that case sought, the holding of <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 428, was limited to real property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> The following hypothetical explains the implementation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-62, 12-64, and 12-71 (b) in the town of East Haven. Real property valued in 1981, during the ten year assessment, for $40,000 would continue to be taxed on that valuation for the next ten years regardless of appreciation or depreciation; real property which came into existence in 1985 and had an actual value of $100,000 in 1985 would have its value rolled back to 1981 values, e.g., $40,000. If, however, personal property came into existence in 1985 and had an actual value of $100,000 it would be taxed at 70 percent (the tax rate for real property in 1985) of its full value. Thus, the owner of personal property which has the same fair market value as real property for the 1985 tax year will pay substantially more tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> See footnote 4, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> The authority for establishing tax policy lies with the legislature, not the courts. If, in fact, the legislature intended that real and personal property be taxed at the same effective rate and not merely at the same percentage of their assessed value, then the legislature must establish a requirement that real and personal property be valued on the same date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 1788 provides: \u201cREAL ESTATE liable to taxation. All the following mentioned property, not exempted, shall be set in the list of the town where it is situated and shall be liable to taxation at its present true and actual valuation: Dwelling houses, garages, barns, sheds, stores, shops, mills, buildings used for business, commercial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>financial, manufacturing, mercantile and trading purposes, ice houses, warehouses, silos, all other buildings, house lots, all other buildings lots, shellfish lands, all other lands, quarries, mines, ore beds, fisheries, property in fish pounds and machinery. Any interest in real estate shall be set by the assessors in the list of the person in whose name the title to such interest stands on the land records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 1737 provides: \u201cperiodic revaluation OF real estate. The assessorsof all towns, consolidated towns and cites and consolidated towns and boroughs, unl\u00e9ss otherwise provided, shall, during each period of ten years after February 1, 1930, view all of the real estate of their respective municipalities, and shall revalue the same for assessment, and in the performance of these duties, except in any municipality where there in a single assessor, at least two of the assessors shall act together, and all valuations shall be separately approved by a majority of the assessors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 1745 provides in relevant part: \u201cpersonal PROPERTY LIABLE TO TAXATION; SITUS; DESCRIPTION. All notes, bonds and stocks, not issued by the United States, moneys, credits, choses in action, vessels, except registered and enrolled sailing vessels, except barges engaged in trade between this and other states and except registered vessels which are actually engaged in foreign commerce, goods, chattels or effects, or any interest therein, belonging to any resident in this state, shall be set in his list in the town where he resides at their then actual valuation, except when otherwise provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">We note that the statutory language which requires that property be revalued every ten years is still limited to real property; General Statutes \u00a7 12-62; though the holding <em>o\u00ed Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 525 A.2d 91 (1987), appears to apply this rule to personal property by judicial construction. By implication, therefore, the court concluded that towns cannot be required to revalue personal property more frequently than every ten years. Id., 438 n.15. This holding, however, does not prohibit more frequent revaluations by a town.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-55 provides in relevant part: \u201clists; notice of increase; public inspection; abstracts. When the lists of any town have been so received or made by the assessors, they shall equalize the same, if necessary, and make any assessment omitted by mistake or required by law. The assessors may increase or decrease the valuation of property as named in any of such lists or in the last-preceding grand list . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
