The jury rendered its verdict on November 26, 1986, which the court accepted and on which judgment was rendered. The plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial on December 4, 1986. The determination of the timeliness of the plaintiff\u2019s motion is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Practice Book \u00a7 320 provides in part: \u201cMotions in arrest of judgment, whether for extrinsic causes or causes apparent on the record, motions to set aside a verdict and motions for new trials, unless brought by petition served on the adverse party or parties, must be filed with the clerk within <em>five days after the day the verdict is accepted or judgment rendered, </em>exclusive of such days as the clerk\u2019s office is not open; provided that for good cause the court may extend this time.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Practice Book \u00a7 405 provides in relevant part: \u201cClerks\u2019 offices shall be open each weekday from Monday to Fri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>day inclusive, between 9 o\u2019clock in the forenoon and 5 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, but they shall not be open on legal holidays. If the last day for filing any matter in the clerk\u2019s office falls on a day on which such office is not open as thus provided . . . then the last day for filing shall be the next business day upon which such office is open.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\">Our Supreme Court has recently concluded that, \u201c[b]y its very terms, \u00a7 405 applies only to the \u2018last day for filing\u2019 or terminal day of the time period. . . . Our interpretation accords with the common law rule that \u2018if the last day for performance of certain acts falls on a Sunday or a legal holiday, the doing of that act on the following day would be timely.\u2019 <em>Norwich Land Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>170 Conn. 1, 9, 363 A.2d 1386 (1975). Intervening nonterminal days in which the clerk\u2019s office is not open are immaterial.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Small </em>v. <em>South Norwalk Savings Bank, </em>205 Conn. 751, 757-58, 535 A.2d 1292 (1988). The plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial was, therefore, filed well beyond the five-day limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a timely motion to set aside the verdict limits this court to ascertaining whether there was plain error. Id., 758. After a careful review of the record and the briefs we cannot find that the trial court committed plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
