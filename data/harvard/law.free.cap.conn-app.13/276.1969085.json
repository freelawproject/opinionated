We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The facts are undisputed. On September 8,1975, the plaintiff was employed by the named defendant, Caron Pipe Jacking, Inc., of which the codefendant, Travelers Insurance Company, was the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. On or about December 19,1983, the plaintiff gave his employer and the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner written notice of a claim for compensation based on an alleged work-related heart attack that occurred on September 8, 1975, and its aftereffects, and on a subsequent bypass operation that he underwent on September 30, 1983. On October 29, 1984, the defendants filed a notice of contest of liability with the compensation commissioner. The plaintiff\u2019s notice of claim complied with General Statutes \u00a7 31-294, except for its untimeliness. The defendants\u2019 notice to contest liability also complied with General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b), except for its untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">The plaintiff moved, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b), to preclude the defendants from contesting liability because they had not filed a notice to contest liability within twenty days from their receipt of the plaintiff\u2019s notice of claim. The commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to preclude. The defendants appealed to the compensation review division. The review division affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal, relying on our decisions in <em>LaVogue </em>v. Cincinnati <em>Inc., </em>9 Conn. App. 91, 516 A.2d 151, cert, denied, 201 Conn. 814, 518 A.2d 72 (1986), and <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Quality Bakers of America, </em>2 Conn. App. 363, 479 A.2d 820, cert, denied, 194 Conn. 804, 482 A.2d 709 (1984). The defendants appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The defendants claim that the review division erred because <em>LaVogue </em>and <em>Bush </em>do not control this case, and because an employer\u2019s preclusion from contesting liability pursuant to \u00a7 31-297 (b) only arises upon the timely giving of a written notice of claim for compensation by the employee pursuant to \u00a7 31-294. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Section \u00a7 31-294 provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo proceedings for [workers\u2019] compensation . . . shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given within one year from the date of the accident <em>. ... \u201d </em>Section \u00a7 31-297 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer, he shall file with the compensation commissioner, on or before the twentieth day after he has received a written notice of claim, a notice . . . stating [inter alia] that the right to compensation is contested . . . and the specific grounds on which the right to compensate is contested, and a copy thereof shall be sent to the employee. If the employer . . . fails to file the notice contesting liability within the time prescribed herein, the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of such alleged injury . . . and shall have no right thereafter to contest the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation on any grounds or the extent of his disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We have had three occasions to consider the effect of the preclusion provision of \u00a7 31-297 (b). In <em>Bush </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>Quality Bakers of America, </em>supra, 373-74, we held that an employer\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of contest precluded the employer from contesting the issue of whether the death of the claimant\u2019s decedent was work related. In <em>LaVogue </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, Inc., </em>supra, 93, we held that the employer\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of contest precluded it from contesting the issue of whether the employee\u2019s contacts with Connecticut were sufficient to give Connecticut jurisdiction over his employment relationship with the out-of-state employer. In <em>Yuknat </em>v. <em>State, </em>9 Conn. App. 425, 426, 519 A.2d 622 (1987), we held that where the employee gave the employer an \u201cadequate statutory notice,\u201d the employer was precluded from contesting liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">None of these decisions, however, addressed the precise issue raised by the defendants in this case, namely, whether an untimely notice of claim by an employee triggers the preclusion provision of \u00a7 31-297 (b). In none of those decisions was the employee\u2019s notice of claim untimely. Furthermore, an examination of the decisions of our Supreme Court construing \u00a7 31-297 (b) discloses that none of them addresses the specific issue of the timeliness of the employee\u2019s notice of claim. See <em>Adzima v. UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 411 A.2d 924 (1979); <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>165 Conn. 338, 334 A.2d 452 (1973); see also <em>Balkus </em>v. <em>Terry Steam Turbine Co., </em>167 Conn. 170, 178 n.7, 355 A.2d 227 (1974). An analysis of the relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 31-297 (b) and 31-294, and of the purposes of \u00a7 31-297 (b), leads us to conclude that <em>Bush, LaVogue </em>and <em>Yuknat </em>do not control this case, and that a timely notice pursuant to \u00a7 31-294 is a necessary prerequisite to the preclusion provision of \u00a7 31-297 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Section \u00a7 31-294 requires an employee to give \u201ca written notice of claim for compensation . . . within one year from the date of the accident . . . . \u201d Section \u00a7 31-297 (b) requires an employer to file a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>claimer \u201con or before the twentieth day after he has received a written notice of claim . . . .\u201d Although the phrase, \u201cwritten notice of claim,\u201d in \u00a7 31-297 (b) does not specifically refer to the phrase, \u201cwritten notice of claim for compensation,\u201d in \u00a7 31-294, it is clear that both statutory sections refer to the same notice. When two such sections are part of the same legislation and refer to the same conduct, they should be read so as to harmonize with each other. <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Della Ghelfa, </em>3 Conn. App. 432, 438, 489 A.2d 398 (1985), aff\u2019d, 200 Conn. App. 630, 513 A.2d 52 (1986). Although \u00a7 31-297 (b) does not specifically refer to the timeliness of the written notice required pursuant to \u00a7 31-294, the relationship between the two sections strongly suggests that \u00a7 31-297 (b) contemplates a timely notice given pursuant to \u00a7 31-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The purposes of the preclusion provision of \u00a7 31-297 (b) solidly buttress this suggestion. Those purposes are \u201cto ensure (1) that employers would bear the burden of investigating a claim promptly and (2) that employees would be timely apprised of the specific reasons for the denial of their claim. These effects would, in turn, diminish delays in the proceedings, discourage arbitrary refusal of bona fide claims and narrow the legal issues which were to be contested.\u201d <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>supra, 343. Section \u00a7 31-297 (b) also requires that the employer\u2019s notice of contest state \u201cthe specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested . . . .\u201d \u201cThe point of this criterion is to inform the claimant of the deficiencies of his claim after the defending party has had an opportunity to make a thorough investigation.\u201d <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>supra, 345. The employee\u2019s notice triggers the obligation of the employer \u201cto investigate the claim forthwith and either to concede its compensability or to reveal concrete reasons for contesting that claim. This rule is equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>because employers and insurers have the necessary resources to fulfill its mandate, whereas the claimant often receives no more assistance than that furnished by the commissioner in filing his claim.\u201d Id., 345-46. Therefore, \u201c[i]t is not unjust to require a defending employer or insurance carrier to investigate the case seasonably and to cause a responsive answer to be filed.\u201d Id., 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">It is clear from this discussion of \u00a7 31-297 (b) that a principal purpose of the preclusion provision is to require a prompt and thorough investigation of the employee\u2019s claim so as to yield a specific disclaimer of liability, if any, and so as to avoid unnecessary delay in the adjudication of the claim by the compensation commissioner. The statutory scheme contemplates, therefore, that the employer will have, upon receipt of the claim, the opportunity for such an investigation. Unless the claim itself was presented in a timely fashion the employer is deprived of that opportunity. A statute must be construed by reference to its history and purpose. See <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Della Ghelfa, </em>supra, 437-38. The history and purpose of \u00a7 31-297 (b) compel the conclusion that the timeliness of the employee\u2019s claim is essential to the operation of the preclusion provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Indeed, the facts of this case vividly demonstrate the necessity for this conclusion. The plaintiff gave written notice in 1983 of an alleged work-related heart attack eight years earlier in 1975, followed by heart surgery in 1983. We can hardly say that an employer and insurer in the defendants\u2019 positions would within twenty days likely be able to investigate such a late claim thoroughly and respond to it with specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">There is error, the order of the compensation review division dismissing the defendants\u2019 appeal is set aside, and the case is remanded to the compensation review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>division with direction to sustain the defendants\u2019 appeal and to deny the plaintiff\u2019s motion to preclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
