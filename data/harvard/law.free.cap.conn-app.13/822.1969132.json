This court cannot find facts or draw conclusions from primary facts found, but can only review such findings to determine whether they could legally, logically and reasonably be found and whether the trial court could thereby conclude as it did. <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>186 Conn. 673, 676-77, 443 A.2d 486 (1982); <em>Hallmark of Farmington </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>1 Conn.
