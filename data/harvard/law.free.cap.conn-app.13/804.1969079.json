Thereafter, the plaintiff instituted the present action, seeking to enjoin that arbitration proceeding. The trial court permanently enjoined the arbitration. This appeal followed. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In their several claims of error, the defendants raise what appear to be complex questions of law. Our thorough review of the record and the briefs of the parties, however, reveals that the defendants only seek to retry this case on appeal. This we will not do. <em>Griffiths </em>v. <em>Griffiths, </em>12 Conn.
