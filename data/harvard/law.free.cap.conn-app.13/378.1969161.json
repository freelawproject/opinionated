Because we find that the defendant\u2019s attempt to withdraw his plea was not afforded appropriate consideration by the trial court, we remand the case so that an evidentiary hearing may be held to determine whether the defendant should be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. In the course of his trial on charges of injury or risk of injury to, or impairing morals of, a minor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21, and sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71, the defendant informed the court through counsel that he wished to withdraw his pleas of not guilty and enter a plea of guilty to the sole charge of injury or risk of injury to a minor. The state\u2019s attorney informed the court that no agreement had been made as to the sentence to be recommended or imposed, but that the state had agreed to drop the other charges pending against the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After assuring itself that the defendant was aware of the terms of the plea bargain, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>court informed the defendant that since the trial had already started he would not be able to withdraw the plea of guilty he was about to enter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u201e The court then began to canvass the defendant to determine whether his plea was being entered knowingly and voluntarily. In the middle of the court\u2019s canvass, the defendant three times asserted that he did not do the acts which he was alleged to have committed. Faced with these protestations of innocence, the trial court initially refused to accept the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. After a brief colloquy with the defendant, however, the court continued its canvass.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Upon the conclusion of the canvass, the trial court determined that the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty was, in fact, being entered knowingly and voluntarily. The court accepted the plea and ordered a presentence investigation of the defendant with a report to be prepared for the sentencing which was scheduled for September 9, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the court sentenced the defendant to ten years imprisonment suspended after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>seven years with five years probation. Immediately after the imposition of sentence, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u201cThe Defendant: May I say something, your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u201cThe Court: Well, go ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: I had not pleaded guilty to this court on my own recognition. I was on a pressure force to plead guilty. It was the way to withdraw\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u201cThe Court: Your transcript \u2014 your transcript to me shows otherwise, Mr. Morant.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Your Honor, I\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s all right. You can \u2014 you can take that up with your next attorney if you want.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">\u201cThe Court: But it\u2019s not appropriate at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">\u201cDefense Counsel: Two things, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">\u201cThe Court: Please don\u2019t say anymore about it. It might make me sorry that I even gave you just seven suspended \u2014 I mean ten suspended after seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">\u201cMr. Thomas: May the record reflect, your Honor, I believe the clerk is in the process of giving the defendant his notice of right to appeal and sentence review.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, you would give him his rights of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-17\">\u201cThe Clerk: He has that now.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-18\">\u201cThe Court: Excuse me, costs are not waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-19\">\u201cThe Defendant: Your Honor, I\u2019m \u2014 your Honor, I\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b396-20\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t want to hear anymore from you, Mr. Morant. Your case is over as far as\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b396-21\">\u201cThe Defendant: I\u2019m appealing, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u201cThe Court: You can appeal, fine. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You can appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u201cThe Defendant: Please, let it know I\u2019m appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u201cThe Court: You have a right to take an appeal. Leave this transcript of his in the file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We begin our analysis by noting that \u201c[A] plea of guilty is in effect a conviction and the equivalent of a finding of guilty by a jury. <em>Machibroda </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S. Ct. 510, 7 L. Ed. 2d 473 [1961]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carta, </em>90 Conn. 79, 81, 96 A. 411 [1916]. The entry of a plea of guilty waives the constitutional right to a trial by jury, the right to confront accusers, and the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>170 Conn. 469, 473, 365 A.2d 1100 (1976); see also <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969). \u201cFor this waiver to be valid under the Due Process Clause, it must be \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u2019 <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 [58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461] (1938). Consequently, if a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is not equally voluntary and knowing, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore void. Moreover, because a guilty plea is an admission of all the elements of a formal criminal charge, it cannot be truly voluntary unless the defendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts.\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Once a guilty plea has been entered, the proper procedure for challenging the knowing and voluntary nature of the plea is by a motion to withdraw the plea made to the trial court before the conclusion of the proceeding at which sentence is imposed. Practice Book \u00a7 720;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Schaeffer, </em>5 Conn. App. 378, 385, 498 A.2d 134 (1985). Ordinarily, the failure to file such a motion \u201cprecludes review of claimed infirmities in the acceptance of a plea.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaeffer, </em>supra. The state contends that the defendant failed to file a motion to withdraw the plea in this case. We find, however, that the defendant did assert in a timely fashion the claim that his guilty plea was involuntary. The trial court erred in not giving the defendant the opportunity to present that claim fully.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The record in this case indicates that immediately after the defendant was sentenced but before the close of the sentencing proceeding the defendant informed the court that he had not entered his plea on his own \u201crecognition.\u201d He also told the court that he had been \u201con a pressure force to plead guilty.\u201d Such statements are clearly allegations by the defendant that his plea had not been entered voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Ordinarily, a defendant is not allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty, nor is he entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine the voluntariness of his plea, merely because he makes a general allegation that his plea was involuntary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 185, 438 A.2d 46 (1980). \u201cIn considering whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea the court may disregard any allegations of fact, whether contained in the motion or made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>an offer of proof, which are either conclusory, vague or oblique. [Id.]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 266, 460 A.2d 970 (1983). In this case, however, we deem that the statements made by the defendant are sufficient to require the holding of an evidentiary hearing because the trial court effectively precluded the defendant from making any more specific allegations of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We note that at the earlier plea proceeding the defendant was erroneously informed by the court that he could not under any circumstances withdraw his guilty plea.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is reasonable to conclude that once the defendant was so informed, he would not assert a claim for withdrawal of his plea. The defendant attempted to assert the substance of his claim to the sentencing court but was interrupted. When the defendant attempted to respond to the court, he was told to take the matter up with his next attorney. After a brief interjection by the prosecuting attorney, the defendant tried once more to speak to the court. The court responded with a thinly veiled threat telling the defendant that if he heard anymore from him the court might be sorry that it sentenced him to <em>only </em>ten years suspended after seven. Understandably, the defendant failed to make more specific allegations of fact. Under these circumstances, the defendant should be given the opportunity to present evidence as to whether his plea of guilty might be withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">There is error, the case is remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant should be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty. In the event that the trial court determines that the defendant should be allowed to withdraw his plea, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings; in the event that the trial court determines that the defendant should not be allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>to withdraw his plea, the judgment shall be amended to reflect that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\"> The plea bargain included an agreement by the state\u2019s attorney to drop similar charges pending against the defendant in another case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\"> The following colloquy took place: \u201cThe Court: And you also understand that if the Court accepts your plea there will be no chance for your plea to be vacated or withdrawn because this case has started a trial, and to allow you to withdraw your plea at some later time could constitute double jeopardy; and you would not be entitled to be tried again. So I\u2019m sure no judge is going to allow you to withdraw your plea. So, I want you to be sure that your plea is voluntary. You understand that tomorrow or one week from now or one month from now won\u2019t do any good.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u201cWell, are we going to sentence him today? I don\u2019t want to sentence him tonight?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u201cMr. Thomas: That\u2019s fine with me, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u201cThe Court: But your plea is not going to be withdrawn. And so no claim of \u2014 no claim that you have ineffective assistance of counsel or that you didn\u2019t know what you were doing or that your plea was not voluntary will do you any good to have your plea withdrawn at a future time. You understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b394-12\"> The relevant portion of the plea proceeding was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">\u201cThe Court: Are you satisfied \u2014 Do you know that the acts or unlawful-risk of injury means that you must do so willfully and unlawfully?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">\u201cThe Court: And willfully means an intent to do the act that you did.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: I didn\u2019t know all that, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-18\">\u201cThe Court: What\u2019s that?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-19\">\u201cThe Defendant: I didn\u2019t know all that, your Honor. I am hearing that now.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-20\">\u201cThe Court: Unlawfully, you did it without right to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">\u201cThe Defendant: I still didn\u2019t do that, your Honor; but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">\u201cThe Court: What?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u201cThe Defendant: I still didn\u2019t do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u201cThe Court: Well, then I can\u2019t accept that.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: I still didn\u2019t do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u201cThe Court: I cannot accept that plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Your Honor, may I say something?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">\u201cThe Court: Counselor, I cannot accept your plea of guilty. We will proceed with the trial. We will continue this until tomorrow morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: What I\u2019m talking about is not that.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">\u201cThe Court: Counsel, we will continue with the trial tomorrow. Bring the jury out. I cannot accept this plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">\u201cDefense Counsel: Your Honor, I think\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">\u201cThe Court: I can understand your position.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">\u201cDefense Counsel: But I think he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s now clearer on what he was\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">\u201cThe Court: If he\u2019s going to maintain that he did not do what I\u2019m telling him, then he\u2019s not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-18\">\u201cThe Defendant: No, your Honor. I\u2019m sorry to say that. I\u2019m sorry to say that. I\u2019m listening to what you say, but something one right here, I understand, sir. That\u2019s what I said, I didn\u2019t know that.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-19\">\u201cThe Court: For me to accept the plea of guilty, you have to admit that you did what you did.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-20\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-21\">\u201cThe Court: If that\u2019s your plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-22\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-23\">\u201cThe Court: And under 23-53-21, which deals with injury or risk of injury to a minor child, means that what you did, the act that you did which was likely to injury her health or impair her morals was done without right, unlawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-24\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-25\">\u201cThe Court: You understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-26\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-27\">\u201cThe Court: And it was done with the intent to commit the general intent to do wrong.
