A hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was scheduled for September 15,1986. On September 11, 1986, the plaintiff filed a motion for extension of time to file its memorandum of law in opposition to the motion to dismiss. No action was taken on that motion and the plaintiff filed its memorandum in opposition the following day. On September 15, 1986, the trial court addressed the merits of the motion to dismiss, and granted the motion. The plaintiff appeals from the granting of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">We find this case to be controlled by our holdings in <em>Czaja </em>v. <em>Sallak, </em>13 Conn.
