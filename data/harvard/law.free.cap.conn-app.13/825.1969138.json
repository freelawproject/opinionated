The plaintiff claims that the court erred (1) in granting summary judgment based on a defense which was not specially pleaded by the defendants, (2) by not finding that permission of the court is unnecessary to sue a court appointed receiver after the receivership has been terminated, (3) in finding a lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the plaintiff\u2019s failure to obtain permission to sue the receiver, (4) in unconstitutionally denying the plaintiff access to the courts, and (5) in rendering summary judgment \u201con grounds in law and fact that are false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">This case is controlled by our decision in <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>3 Conn. App. 397, 488 A.2d 1278, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 802, 492 A.2d 1239 (1985). \u201c \u2018A receiver appointed by judicial authority cannot, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, be subjected to suit without the leave of the court whose officer he is, granted in the cause in which he was appointed.\u2019 \u201d Id., 399, quoting <em>Links </em>v. <em>Connecticut River Banking Co., </em>66 Conn. 277, 284, 33 A. 1003 (1895). The plaintiff\u2019s failure to obtain permission of the court to sue the receiver is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
