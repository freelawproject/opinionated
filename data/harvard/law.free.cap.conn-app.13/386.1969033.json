The defendant further claims that he was denied a fair trial because of improper prosecutorial comments concerning his failure to testify. We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. At various times on June 10 and 11, 1986, the victim, who had previously lived with the defendant, encountered him on the streets of New London. The defendant demanded money from the victim, and, when it was not provided, the defendant beat, kicked and cut the victim and threw her from a third floor porch to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>a lower landing. He also threatened her for reporting this brutality to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">At trial, the victim testified on redirect examination that during their cohabitation, she and the defendant got along amicably as long as she gave the defendant money and drugs, but that he beat her whenever she did not. The defendant did not testify. The circumstances surrounding the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments regarding this failure to testify are set forth in the course of the ruling on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The first two claims of error concern the admission of evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct. The defendant does not strenuously press his claim concerning prior drug use. In a nonresponsive answer to a question posed by the defendant on cross-examination, concerning the victim\u2019s relationship with the defendant, the victim alluded to the defendant\u2019s drug use.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No motion to strike the unresponsive reply was made by the defendant at that time and it was allowed to stand. Although perhaps inadmissible, once the defendant allowed the bars to be let down to an incompetent or irrelevant field of inquiry by failing to object to the victim\u2019s response, he could not complain if his adversary was also allowed to avail himself of the opening. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>173 Conn. 35, 49-50, 376 A.2d 391 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The defendant does, however, vigorously argue error in his second claim, regarding the admission of evidence that he beat the victim on previous occasions. On cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>examination of the victim, the defendant introduced evidence intended to show that he and the victim got along harmoniously when they lived together. On redirect examination, the court allowed the state to inquire into this relationship to show that this was not so, and that the victim had been subjected to beatings by the defendant during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We recognize that evidence of guilt of other crimes is normally inadmissible because of the danger that the jury will infer that if a person committed an earlier crime he probably committed the present crime as well. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 95, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983). This rule, however, is not without its exceptions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, \u201c[t]he field of inquiry was opened by the defendant and he cannot complain if the state attempted to clarify that field, even if the evidence would otherwise be inadmissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>[supra, 50]; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>194 Conn. 483, 498-99, 481 A.2d 741 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>3 Conn. App. 148, 154, 485 A.2d 1343 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The trial court did not commit error in allowing evidence of prior drug use or prior beatings of the victim by the defendant to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">With regard to the defendant\u2019s third claim concerning the court\u2019s jury instruction on reasonable doubt, the transcript shows that at one point in the jury instruction the court stated: \u201c[I]f the facts you may find proven on the evidence you deem credible [are] consistent with or may be reasonably explained by any other hypothesis, <em>then the accused is guilty. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statement is unquestionably wrong. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>be correct the instruction should have stated that under such circumstances the defendant should have been found <em>not </em>guilty. It is significant, however, that such a clear misstatement of a rudimentary legal principle brought no outcry from either counsel. It is possible, however, that the instruction as presented in the transcript was not that actually given by the court, but is rather the result of a typographical error on the part of the transcript\u2019s preparer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nonetheless, we must accept the transcript as it appears. We observe that when defense counsel, actually present in the courtroom at the time of a claimed error, fails to object and except, we may presume that he did not view the allegedly objectionable language to be as egregious as appellate counsel now urges; nor did he view the error as so prejudicial that his client\u2019s right to a fair trial was seriously jeopardized.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>195 Conn. 475, 484, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985). <em>State </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>12 Conn. App. 163, 168, 529 A.2d 1343 (1987). \u201cThis assumption is reinforced by the defendant\u2019s failure to include the claim in his preliminary statement of the issues as is required by Practice Book [4013].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>8 Conn. App. 125, 138-39, 512 A.2d 921, cert, denied, 201 Conn. 807, 515 A.2d 380 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Because of the absence of proper preservation, we address this claimed error under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), because the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial is implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201c \u2018On appeal, the adequacy of jury instructions is not determined by the giving of any one instruction, but by examining the instruction as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 14, 27, 505 A.2d 690 (1986). The trial court correctly explained each of the elements of the crimes charged, and in the course of so doing instructed the jury more than forty times to the effect that each element must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of any crime. At the very least, we are confronted with an inadvertent slip of the tongue by the trial court. Notwithstanding that the instruction as given involves a constitutional right, reversible error is not an inevitable appellate result. \u201c \u2018An erroneous instruction, even of constitutional dimension, is harmless if, viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>199 Conn. 322, 325, 507 A.2d 457 (1986). Examining this charge as a whole, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflet, </em>199 Conn. 718, 754, 508 A.2d 748 (1986). The trial court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">As his final claim of error, the defendant raises a comment made by the prosecutor regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Despite the defendant\u2019s failure to preserve the issue in a proper manner, it is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 71. <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnotti, </em>198 Conn. 209, 215, 502 A.2d 404 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 prohibits a prosecutor from commenting on the fact that an accused does not testify.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is essential, however, that we examine the circumstances under which the state\u2019s remark was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>In his closing argument, defense counsel noted the paucity of eyewitnesses called to testify on the state\u2019s behalf, and argued that \u201cto prove [a crime] in a court of law you better come up with a witness. There is none in this whole case . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In rebuttal, the state argued that \u201c[i]f there are only two people there, they are the only ones who can testify as to what happened. <em>And the defendant doesn\u2019t take the stand which is his right. </em>That leaves only one person; that is the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">It is apparent that the remarks of the state\u2019s attorney were invited by the comments of defense counsel. When a prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper argument is in direct response to matters raised by defense counsel, the defendant has no grounds for complaint. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Estremera, </em>531 F.2d 1103, 1110 (2d Cir. 1976), cert, denied, 425 U.S. 979, 96 S. Ct. 2184, 48 L. Ed. 2d 807 (1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hoog, </em>504 F.2d 45, 50 (8th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In reviewing the challenged comment in the context of the entire trial; <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 457, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>450 A.2d 828 (1982); we conclude that in the totality of the circumstances the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 provides in pertinent part: \u201cassault in THE second degree: class d felony, (a) A person is guilty of assault in the second degree when: . . .

There was no evidence at the first assault. Well, if there aren\u2019t any witnesses, we are not going to put people on the witness stand to perjure themselves. If there are only two people there, they are the only ones who can testify as to what happened. And the defendant doesn\u2019t take the stand, which is his right. That leaves only one person; that is the victim. We can\u2019t put somebody else there and have somebody else testify as to what they saw when they didn\u2019t see anything. So she is the only <em>one </em>that <em>can testify as to </em>what happened to her. And you saw the injuries.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
