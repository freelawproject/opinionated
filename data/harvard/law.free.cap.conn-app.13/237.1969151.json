At the conclusion of the altercation, the defendant left the immediate scene and returned with a handgun. The defendant sought the victim and picked him out of the crowd which had gathered because of the previous fight. The victim then attempted to run away, but slipped and fell. The defendant, holding the gun in a two-handed grip, shot the victim, who was lying on the ground. The bullet passed completely through the victim\u2019s leg. As the victim struggled to his feet, the defendant shot him again, the bullet grazing the victim\u2019s left shoulder. The victim staggered part way down the street and collapsed into unconsciousness. The defendant was arrested and tried by a jury which found him guilty of attempted assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The sole claim of error before this court is that the evidence submitted at the trial by the state was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the specific intent to cause <em>serious </em>physical injury to the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Our review of the record, transcript and briefs discloses ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The question of intent is purely a question of fact to be determined by the jury.
