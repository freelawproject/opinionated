The trial court found that the plaintiff, and not the defendant, breached the landscaping contract and that the plaintiff could not recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the value of materials and services allegedly provided. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\u201cAn appellate court may not retry facts and its duty upon review of such a claim is limited to a determination of whether the trial court\u2019s judgment was clearly erroneous in this respect or otherwise contrary to law.

Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>2 Conn. App. 54, 56, 475 A.2d 341 (1984). It is the province of the trial court to pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence. <em>Edgewood Construction Co. </em>v. <em>West Haven Redevelopment Agency, </em>170 Conn. 271, 272, 365 A.2d 819 (1976); <em>Essex Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Leeker, </em>2 Conn. App. 98, 102, 476 A.2d 1071 (1984). This court cannot find facts or draw conclusions from primary facts found, but can only review such findings to determine whether they could legally, logically and reasonably be found and whether the trial court could thereby conclude as it did. <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>186 Conn. 673, 676-77, 443 A.2d 486 (1982); <em>Hallmark of Farmington </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>1 Conn.
