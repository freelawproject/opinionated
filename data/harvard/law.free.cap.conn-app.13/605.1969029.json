The petition was subsequently amended to reflect that the father was deceased. The petition alleged that it was in Saba\u2019s best interest to terminate her mother\u2019s parental rights because: (1) the child had been abandoned by the mother in the sense that she had failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the welfare of the child within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (1); (2) the child had been found in a prior proceeding to have been neglected or uncared for, and the mother has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>tation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, she could assume a responsible position in the life of the child within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2); (3) the child had been denied by reason of act or acts of commission or omission the care, guidance or control necessary for her physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (3); and (4) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship, as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">A trial was held during which evidence was introduced to support the following facts. On April 11,1985, the child Saba, who was born on October 2,1980, was voluntarily placed in foster care where she still remains. On December 10, 1985, Saba was adjudicated an uncared for child and committed to DCYS.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Saba\u2019s mother suffers from a long history of mental illness which has been diagnosed as chronic schizophrenia, undifferentiated. She has been admitted to the Norwich Hospital as an in-patient on eight separate occasions over a period of twenty years for periods ranging from a few days to almost seven years. She was admitted three times during 1985 and 1986 for periods totalling seven months. Her prognosis is \u201cpoor\u201d and Saba would be clearly at risk if placed in her care. Further, it would be \u201cseveral years, if ever,\u201d before the mother could safely care for Saba. Also, there was a \u201cprobability\u201d of further future admission of the mother to Norwich Hospital. At the time of trial, the mother was receiving heavy doses of lithium carbonate, approximately 900 milligrams per day. The mother talks and screams to herself and is prone to violent behavior. The mother visited Saba four times during the period from February of 1986, to the time of trial. These visits were initiated and encouraged by DCYS. The visits failed in their purpose of establishing a positive bond between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>mother and child because the mother, instead of relating to the child, used the visitation time to talk about subjects of apparently greater interest to her such as social security benefits and other personal items not relevant to her parental relationship with her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">As far as Saba is concerned, she recognizes the respondent as her mother but has no feelings which reflect any emotional ties to her. Saba has developed a warm and loving relationship with her foster parents. The trial court expressly found that the \u201cemotional ties between Saba and her foster parents are significant, healthy and clearly the best thing that has happened to Saba in her young life.\u201d Saba is at a critical age and has gone through a violent and unstable history. The trial court found that it was in the best interest of Saba to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights and expressly stated that \u201cSaba\u2019s situation cries out for permanency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Thereupon, the court found that, by clear and convincing evidence, three grounds existed to justify the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights. The court found that the grounds had existed for more than one year and also found that it would be in the best interest of the child to terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights. The trial court specifically found that Saba had been \u201cabandoned\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (1); had been denied, by reason of respondent\u2019s omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for her physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being under General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (3); and that \u201cno ongoing parent-child relationship\u201d existed under General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (4). The respondent has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">We hold, initially, that the only claim of error properly before this court is the respondent\u2019s first claim of error, i.e., that the trial court misapplied the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 <em>ll-\u00e1Aa.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We will not consider the respondent\u2019s second claim of error because it was not raised in the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 4185; <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-7), </em>3 Conn. App. 30, 33, 484 A.2d 472 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) provides that the court may terminate parental rights if it finds that \u201cover an extended period of time, which . . . shall not be less than one year,\u201d at least one of the four statutory grounds for termination exists. Since the grounds are listed in the disjunctive, the court need find only one ground to grant the petition. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-BC), </em>194 Conn. 252, 258, 479 A.2d 1204 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The respondent\u2019s argument is based upon the premise that the court, in making a finding as to whether the grounds for termination have been in existence for not less than one year, is limited to the date of commitment as the starting point for measuring the one year requirement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Although the respondent, DCYS and the trial court speak in terms of the year commencing at a particular date, we do not determine the statutory year as legally requiring any fixed starting date. The statutory requirement is, simply that, at the time of the adjudication, statutory grounds exist for the termination of parental rights, and that those grounds must have existed for not less than one year. The statute does not say \u201cone year from the date of placement\u201d or \u201cone year from the date of commitment.\u201d It requires only that the ground exist for not less than one year. This is so regardless of the status of the child. The child may be in placement, in commitment or still at home being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>cared for by grandparents, siblings, other relatives or strangers and may at the same time be subject to parental behavior amounting to grounds for termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We acknowledge that numerous cases involving coterminous petitions have been brought and termination of parental rights have been sustained where the \u201cwaiting period\u201d was traced from placement in foster care not the date of commitment. See, e.g., <em>In re Theresa S., </em>196 Conn. 18, 491 A.2d 355 (1985); <em>In re Nicolina T., </em>9 Conn. App. 598, 520 A.2d 639 (1987); <em>In re Christine F., </em>6 Conn. App. 360, 505 A.2d 734 <em>(1986)-, In re Juvenile Appeal (85-3), </em>3 Conn. App. 194, 485 A.2d 1369 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We do not believe, however, that a \u201cwaiting period\u201d is a requirement of the statute. We hold that the one-year requirement is a minimum period of time during which the grounds for termination must exist. Whether the grounds for termination exist for not less than one year is a question of fact to be determined by the court from the facts and circumstances in any given case. Our review of the record in this case reveals ample support for the trial court\u2019s finding that the grounds for termination in this case were in existence for not less than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In this opinion, Stoughton, J., concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\"> We will only consider this claim of error as it relates to the amicus curiae brief filed by the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union.

I respectfully disagree with the conclusion of the majority opinion that the record in this case amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the grounds for termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights were in existence for not less than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Saba was born to Janina and Marion on October 2, 1980. In April of 1985, the mother separated from her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>husband, taking Saba with her. An older brother, Arthur, then 23 years of age, became concerned about Saba\u2019s care because of the mother\u2019s mental illness. Since he could not make suitable child care arrangements for her, he wished her placed voluntarily through DCYS. The parents gave their written consent to this. On April 11, 1985, Saba was placed in a foster home. She was later committed to DCYS on December 10, 1985, after adjudication as an uncared for child. A petition requesting the termination of parental rights was withdrawn at that time to allow the brother the opportunity to explore the possibility of becoming her caretaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Upon the brother\u2019s later suggestion that it would be in the best interests of Saba to be freed for adoption, DCYS, on May 13, 1986, filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of the parents. Jurisdiction for the petition was based on General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The grounds alleged were those specified in \u00a7 17-43a (b) (1), (2), (3) and (4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petition contained two fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ther allegations relating to the statutory time requirement for termination of parental rights: (1) that the stated reasons had existed for not less than one year; and (2) that a waiver of the one year requirement would be in the best interests of the child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">On June 22, 1986, the child\u2019s father died of cancer. Because of this, the petition was amended at the commencement of the hearing to delete that portion which sought to terminate the parental rights of the father. The hearings were held on September 3 and 23,1986, after which the court filed its memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In its memorandum, the court initially considered the one year requirement of \u00a7 17-43a (b). The court acknowledged that the standard of proof required for a waiver of the time requirement under \u00a7 17-43a (c) was not clear, but concluded, \u201cin any event, the petitioner has not proved by even a preponderance of the evidence that'such a waiver is necessary.\u201d Because of the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>year requirement, therefore, the court denied the petition as to the allegation under \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2), since that period had not expired after Saba\u2019s adjudication as an uncared for child on December 10,1985. The court did, however, find that the remaining three statutory grounds alleged met the one year threshold limitation because the original petition of May 13, 1986, and its amendment on September 3, 1986, to exclude the father because of his intervening death, were filed more than one year from the voluntary placement of Saba on \u201cApril 1, 1985.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It thereafter concluded that these grounds were established by the petitioner upon clear and convincing proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The court found that the mother was confined at Norwich Hospital on eight separate occasions over the previous twenty years for \u201cchronic schizophrenia, undifferentiated.\u201d During the period of Saba\u2019s voluntary placement in foster care, the mother was an inpatient at the hospital in April and December, 1985. Subsequent to Saba\u2019s adjudication as an uncared for child on December 10, 1985, the mother was hospitalized in June of 1986. There was a probability of a ninth, or even a tenth, admission to a psychiatric hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">A psychologist testifying for DCYS maintained that Saba was at risk of physical injury from her mother, but a medical doctor called as a witness by the mother found that the mother was not prone to violence and was not a danger to her child or to herself. The medical doctor expressed the opinion that the child\u2019s reunion would possibly be beneficial to the mother\u2019s attempt to stabilize her psychiatric condition. Without concluding further on this conflicting testimony, the court observed that the medical doctor had made no evaluation of Saba and had offered no opinion as to the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>on Saba of a return to her mother. The court did find, however, that the mother visited her child during foster care on several occasions, \u201cbut, to say the least, these visits have been less than successful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The trial court found that for the period commencing April 1,1985, to the time of the hearing, Saba had been abandoned by her mother under the provisions of \u00a7 17-43a (b) (1) \u201cin that Janina P. has failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the welfare of the child. . . [even though] that failure on the part of Saba\u2019s mother has been occasioned, at least in part, by [the] mother\u2019s psychiatric illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The court found further ground for termination of Janina\u2019s parental rights under \u00a7 17-43a (b) (3) in that Saba had been denied the care, guidance or control necessary for her physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being. The court observed in this regard that Saba was responding favorably to the removal from the previous home environment provided by her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Finally, the court found proven the remaining ground for termination of Janina\u2019s parental rights as set forth in \u00a7 17-43a (b) (4) because there was no ongoing parent-child relationship. \u201c[A]t least in part because of her schizophrenia, [the mother] has not met on a day to day basis, or even on an occasional basis, the physical, educational, moral and emotional needs of the child. . . . [T]o allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of such parent-child relationship would be detrimental to Saba\u2019s best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In reviewing its ultimate findings under \u00a7 17-43a (d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court concluded: \u201cThere is no question that [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>mother might have done better at maintaining a relationship with Saba if she were not severely handicapped by her emotional disability . . . [but] it is Saba\u2019s best interests which are at issue here and not Janina\u2019s. Saba\u2019s situation cries out for permanency, and it is therefore found, by clear and convincing proof, that the parental rights of Janina P. should be terminated in her daughter Saba.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In response to the petitioner\u2019s motion for articulation, the trial court made the following supplementary findings: (1) \u201c[W]ith respect to the ground for termination of parental rights found in Connecticut General Statutes section 17-43a (b) (2) (i.e., \u2018failure to rehabilitate\u2019), the one year \u2018waiting period\u2019 is calculated from the date of adjudication of the child as neglected or uncared for in the prior proceeding in this case, specifically December 10,1985. ... (2) [W]ith respect to the other three grounds in the petition for termination of parental rights (i.e., \u2018abandonment,\u2019 \u2018acts of parental commission or omission,\u2019 and \u2018no parent-child rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>tionship\u2019) the one-year \u2018waiting period\u2019 was calculated from April 1,1985, the date of voluntary placement of the child in foster care. . . . (3) [T]here was no evidence before the court that the child\u2019s situation was such that any significant difference in the welfare of the child would occur if the hearing in this case were heard three months later, in December instead of September.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">There are two claims raised on appeal: (1) the court did not properly measure the one year period under \u00a7 17-43a (b), and (2) the time requirement is unconstitutionally vague. Since the constitutional question was not raised below, we do not consider it. \u201cThe general rule against considering claims not raised at trial, Practice Book [\u00a7 4185] applies also to constitutional issues . . . . \u2018Only in most exceptional circumstances can and will this court consider a claim, constitutional or otherwise, that has not been raised and decided in the trial court.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank of New Britain </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 369, 377, 439 A.2d 396 (1981). There is nothing in the record to bring the respondent within any exception to this rule. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 69-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The respondent argues that the period of time required to establish any of the four grounds for termination of parental rights specified in \u00a7 17-43a (1), (2), (3) and (4), is \u201can extended period of time,\u201d but not less than one year. The commencement of this period, therefore, must be measured from the inception or beginning of the alleged ground, and not from the voluntary placement of Saba by her parents in a foster home. With that I would agree. I would disagree, however, with the mother\u2019s claim that the required time for the grounds alleged in \u00a7 17-43a (b) (1), (3) and (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>and found proven here must necessarily be marked from the legal commitment as an uncared for child on December 10, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">\u201cThe word 'period\u2019 as applied to time carries with it the idea of the separation of a designated interval of time from the flow of time in general.\u201d <em>Van Dresser </em>v. <em>Firlings, </em>305 Mass. 51, 54, 24 N.E.2d 969 (1940). There must be a beginning and an ending in the measuring of an extended period of time of not less than one year under \u00a7 17-43a (b). The ending would necessarily be coterminous with the trial on a petition brought thereunder. The beginning must be fixed by the date of origin of the specific ground relied upon under subsections (1), (3) or (4) of \u00a7 17-43a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The voluntary beneficent act of placing Saba in a foster home under the guidance and direction of DCYS cannot by its own facts be considered as evidence of any one of these three grounds for termination of parental rights. It was not an act of abandonment of Saba under \u00a7 17-43a (b) (1); it was not a denial, by parental act of commission or omission, of the care, guidance or control necessary for Saba\u2019s physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being under \u00a7 17-43a (b) (3); nor was it the termination of the parent-child relationship under \u00a7 17-43a (b) (4); all as found by the trial court. Not being evidence of any of these grounds for the termination of parental rights, the voluntary placement of Saba in a foster home cannot mark the beginning of the \u201cextended period of time\u201d required to be measured for at least one year as a condition precedent to the granting of a petition for such termination of Janina\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Saba\u2019s commitment to DCYS on December 10,1985, following her adjudication as an uncared for child under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129, while probative of the time requirement under \u00a7 17-43a (b), does not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>fix the beginning of the extended period of time in all cases. An earlier date may be established by evidence relevant to any of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights under the law. A review of all statutes relating to the termination of parental rights supports this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The petition for the termination of Janina\u2019s parental rights was filed on the judicial department form JD-JM-40 Rev. 2-85. The identification of this form indicates that it was prepared for use in proceedings under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-43a and 45-61c. The jurisdictional statement provided on this form relates to petitions under the following circumstances: (1) termination under \u00a7 17-43a where child previously committed to DCYS; (2) termination of parental rights under \u00a7 17-43a (e) where child not previously committed to DCYS; and (3) transfer from probate court under \u00a7 45-61c (g). As noted earlier, the petition in this case was erroneously brought under \u00a7 17-43a (e), instead of pursuant to \u00a7 17-43a after a prior commitment of Saba to.DCYS. My earlier review of the law related to a petition filed under \u00a7 17-43a after a prior commitment to the custody of DCYS under \u00a7 46b-129 as an uncared for child, the factual situation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Section 17-43a (e) provides that any petition brought by DCYS pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 for the commitment of a neglected, uncared-for or dependent child may be accompanied by a petition for termination of parental rights filed under \u00a7 17-43a \u201cnotwithstanding that such child has not been committed to the commissioner of children and youth services.\u201d Such a provision for the filing of simultaneous petitions excludes the possibility that a commitment under \u00a7 46b-129 must mark the beginning of the \u201cextended period of time\u201d required by \u00a7 17-43a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Similarly, the statutory provisions for the transfer of petitions to terminate parental rights from the courts of probate to the superior court exclude the possibility that a commitment under \u00a7 46b-129 must fix the beginning of the \u201cextended period of time\u201d required by \u00a7 17-43a (b). General Statutes \u00a7 45-61c (a) permits the filing in a court of probate of a petition to terminate parental rights. Section 45-61c (g) authorizes the transfer of such a petition to the superior court. Whether heard in the court of probate, or on transfer in the superior court, such a petition would not be conditional upon a prior commitment of the child to DCYS as an uncared for child. Section 45-61f (f) (1), (2) and (3)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provide the same grounds for termination of parental rights as \u00a7 17-43a (b) (1), (3) and (4), respectively. Missing only is the ground provided in \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2), relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>a child previously committed to DCYS as uncared for, since a petition under \u00a7 45-61f (f) in the probate court is independent of and unrelated to a prior commitment to the custody of DCYS under \u00a7 46b-129. The required \u201cextended period of time\u201d under \u00a7 45-61f (f), which like \u00a7 17-43a (b), \u201cshall not be less than one year,\u201d therefore, cannot be measured from a commitment to the custody of DCYS under \u00a7 46b-129.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">I agree with the majority in its conclusion that whether the grounds for termination exist for an extended period of not less than one year is a factual determination to be made on a case by case basis. I disagree, however, with their conclusion that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the alleged grounds for the termination of Janina\u2019s parental rights of Saba existed for not less than one year. First, the court did not factually establish the beginning date of each ground for the measurement of the required period of not less than one year. Second, the court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights because of her chronic schizophrenia, rather than upon a finding that her mental illness manifested itself in conduct demonstrative of an inability to care for her child. The court focused on Janina\u2019s status as a mentally ill person, rather than upon her conduct and relationship to Saba. <em>See In re Nicolina T., </em>9 Conn. App. 598, 607, 520 A.2d 639 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\"> This appears to have been in error. General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (e) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny petition brought by the commissioner of children and youth services to the superior court, pursuant to subsection (a) of section 46b-129, may be accompanied by a petition for termination of parental rights filed in accordance with this section with respect to such child, notwithstanding that such child has not been committed to the commissioner of children and youth services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Saba had previously been adjudicated an uncared for child and committed to DCYS under \u00a7 46b-129 (a).

Nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights; or (4) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship, which means the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a day to day basis the physical, emotional, <em>moral and </em>educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of such parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (c) provides: <em>\u201cThe </em>court may waive the requirement that one year expire prior to the termination of parental rights if it finds from the totality of the circumstances surrounding the child that such a waiver is necessary to promote the best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\"> This date is in error.
