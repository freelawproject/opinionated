The circumstances under which the last clear chance doctrine is applicable are correctly stated in the plaintiff\u2019s brief: \u201cTo warrant the submission of this issue \u2018there must be evidence from which the jury might find the following facts. 1. That the one to be charged with liability was actually aware of the other\u2019s presence. 2. That he was actually aware that the other was either ignorant of the peril or unable to extricate himself from it. 3. That, after discovery of the situation, due care required and time afforded an opportunity for saving action.\u2019 <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>87 N. H. 36, 38. However, a \u2018finding of actual knowledge (need not) be based upon testimony to that effect given by the pne to be charged. The circumstances may be such that the jury would be warranted in disregarding direct testimony of lack of actual knowledge, and find, in spite of that testimony, that the one to be charged did, in actual fact, have knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>of the other\u2019s presence and of the latter\u2019s want of appreciation of the impending peril.\u2019 <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>88 N. H. at 39.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">If the defendant\u2019s evidence is disregarded and all of the evidence is construed most favorably to the plaintiff, there remains the question whether the plaintiff has sustained his burden of proof on the issue of last clear chance. Anno. 159 A. L. R. 724. Plaintiff\u2019s own testimony is more indicative of defendant\u2019s negligence than it is that the defendant had the last clear chance. Plaintiff testified that the defendant was proceeding 35 to 40 miles an hour when 50 feet from the intersection, that there was no change in defendant\u2019s speed, course or direction until the collision, that there were no brake marks and that the \u201cwhole front end\u201d of the defendant\u2019s car struck the plaintiff\u2019s car. This conduct on the part of the defendant is evidence of inattention, failure to look, failure to see what an efficient look would disclose and generally of negligence but it is not sufficient proof that the defendant knew that the plaintiff was in a dangerous position of which he was ignorant or from which he could not escape. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was proof of a discoverable peril rather than a discovered peril which under our decisions is not sufficient basis upon which to submit the last clear chance doctrine to the jury. <em>LaCoss </em>v. <em>Company, </em>88 N. H. 403. While this view creates \u201cdifficulties in the way of plaintiff\u2019s satisfying the doctrine\u201d (1944 Annual Survey of American Law 958), it is established law in this jurisdiction that \u201cit is not a question whether the party sought to be charged should have discovered the injured party\u2019s dilemma but whether he in fact did.\u201d <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>93 N. H. 179, 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Emphasis is placed on other evidence to meet the burden of proof in this case. When 150 feet north of the intersection the defendant could see the plaintiff\u2019s automobile when it was 35 feet east of the intersection. This, together with the fact that the defendant was maintaining a general lookout and that he slackened his speed and applied his brakes at 150 feet and 60 feet from the intersection, is said to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof. Conceding that the jury could find that the defendant saw the plaintiff, there is no evidence in the case to support the second requirement of the last clear chance doctrine that the defendant knew the plaintiff \u201cwas then oblivious to his danger or was unable to do anything to avoid it.\u201d <em>Marchand </em>v. <em>Company, </em>95 N. H. 422, 427. This evidence which was present in <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>94 N. H. 492, 495, is absent here. Furthermore \u201cthe last chance must be a clear chance\u201d <em>(Lavigne </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>91 N. H. 304, 309) and \u201cthere must be a <em>clear opportunity </em>to avoid the accident.\u201d <em>Ramsdell </em>v. <em>Company, </em>86 N. H. 457, 462; <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Hoyt, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The ruling in a somewhat similar intersectional collision in <em>LaCoss </em>v. <em>Company, </em>88 N. H. 403, 404, is applicable to this case. \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s counsel contends that since the defendant admits that he was looking at the intersection when a hundred feet away, it could be found that he saw the plaintiff there in ample season to have averted the collision. That much may be conceded, but it does not follow that there was anything in the plaintiff\u2019s conduct on which to base the further (and essential) finding of actual knowledge on the defendant\u2019s part that the plaintiff \u2018was either ignorant of the peril or unable to extricate himself from it.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The request for the submission of the issue of the last clear chance to the jury was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
