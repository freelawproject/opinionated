Belford </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>94 N. H. 278; <em>In re Gile Estate, </em>95 N. H. 270. The \u201cremainder\u201d at her decease, after certain minor payments, was plainly left one-half to the plaintiff Marion individually, and one-half to her as trustee for the defendant Frank. Our attention is directed primarily to the provisions of the will which relate to the coal business.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">A life estate in the entire corpus of the residue was left to the widow. This included the assets of the coal business, which she was requested to continue in the management of the testator\u2019s son-in-law, R. I. Boulton, who presumably is the plaintiff administrator and husband of Marion, although the case does not so indicate. Whether the coal business was \u201ccontinued\u201d by the widow does not appear. If it was, there are no allegations or findings with respect to the value of the assets used in the business at the time of the decease of the widow in 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">If the business was carried on by the widow during her lifetime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>under the provisions of clause six of the will, the income of the business was to go to the widow during her lifetime, \u201cand after her decease, to go to my daughter Marion, as part of her share of my estate.\u201d Since the widow took a life interest in the entire residue, she would have been entitled to the income of the business without specific provision therefor. Literally construed, the will provides that \u201cthe income\u201d shall thereafter go to Marion \u201cas part of her share of my estate.\u201d It seems plain that this provision refers to the \u201cshare\u201d of the residue which Marion takes individually, since there is no suggestion that the share which she is to hold in trust was intended, or that the trustee is authorized to conduct the business. The share which she takes individually, Marion holds in fee. No specific disposition was made of the corpus of the business, as distinguished from the income, after the decease of the widow. \u201cA bequest of the income, unlimited as to time and without any disposition of the corpus of the fund, is a bequest of such corpus.\u201d <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Miltimore, </em>95 N. H. 17, 18. In this case the corpus of the \u201cbusiness,\u201d being part of the residue, passed at the widow\u2019s decease to the daughter Marion, either individually or as trustee. The specification of the will that she should have the income \u201cas part of her share\u201d is in our opinion an indication of intent that the corpus should pass to her as a part of her share of the corpus of the residue. See <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>New England Trust Co., 321 </em>Mass. 502, 505. The other half, left to her as trustee, was \u201cto be kept invested by her.\u201d The absence of any reference to the business in the trust provisions confirms the view that the corpus of the coal business was intended by the testator to pass to Marion individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">As previously stated, the case does not disclose the value of the \u201cremainder\u201d of the residue at the widow\u2019s death. It was the remainder at her death which was to be divided, and not the residue as inventoried at the testator\u2019s death. The assets of the coal business have undoubtedly changed since their value was determined in 1932. If their value at the widow\u2019s death was less than half of the total value of the remainder, no difficulty is presented in transfer of the business to Marion as \u201cpart of her share.\u201d In determining their value, all property of the business is to be taken into account, including working capital and receivables, less payables. <em>Coyle </em>v. <em>Donaldson, </em>91 N. J. Eq. 138; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>118 N. J. Eq. 108; <em>Matter of Lowe, </em>206 N. Y. 671; <em>Chavis </em>v. <em>Myrick, </em>190 Va. 875. See also, <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Hightower, </em>(Ind. App.), 81 N. E. (2d) 707; <em>In re Estate of Zents, </em>148 Neb. 104; <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>69 Vt. 168; annotation, L. R. A. 1917 D 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The legacy of the coal business is not however to be regarded as a specific legacy payable in full at the expense of the residue. <em>Cf. Petition of Cain, </em>87 N. H. 318; <em>Malcolm </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>90 N. H. 399. The intent of the testator that it should pass as a part of the residue is reasonably plain, and his expression of this intent should be given no different effect than are residuary clauses by which a general gift is intended, although specific items are enumerated therein. <em>Le Rougetcl </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>63 N. H. 472; annotation 128 A. L. R. 822, 835; 4 Page, Wills (Lifetime <em>ed.) pp. </em>111, 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The will contains no evidence of an intention that any part of the residue should pass to the trustee in kind. A power on the part of the administrator to convert the residue, except for the business, into cash is to be implied. <em>Romprey </em>v. <em>Brothers, </em>95 N. H. 258, 261, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">If the value of the assets of the coal business proves to be greater than half the value of the total \u201cremainder,\u201d some division of these assets between the halves must be effected. Presumably liquid assets, such as the bonds described in the inventory, may be divided equitably to effect a satisfactory adjustment. If not the administrator may be licensed to sell the assets of the business as well. In view of the absence of any findings concerning values, no more specific advice can be given in response to the inquiry made.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
