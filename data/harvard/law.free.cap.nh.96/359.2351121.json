The attachments as returned by the sheriff were of \u201call the chattels and personal property of every nature and description belonging to [the defendant] and located in the brick building situate at the corner of Pleasant &amp; Mechanic Streets in Berlin, New Hampshire.\u201d According to the findings, the defendant hardware company closed its doors on Christmas, 1949. When the attachments were made its store was still closed and it was unoccupied and the doors locked. The sheriff effected no entry and attempted none, but attached a new hasp to each of the three locked doors and locked each with a padlock, the key to which he retained. Subject to exception the Court ruled that since the sheriff might lawfully have broken in to take possession of the goods, the \u201cexclusive possession and control\u201d which he obtained and retained by means 'of the locks was sufficient to constitute a valid attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">It is established law in this jurisdiction that \u201cto constitute a valid attachment of personal property, it must be taken into the possession or be placed under the control of the officer.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Farr, </em>60 N. H. 426, 427. In <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, 2 N. </em>H. 317, it was held that a valid attachment of furniture in a dwelling house was made where the officer gave notice of the attachment and had \u201claid his hands\u201d on some of the goods. The validity of the attachment was said to arise from the fact that the entire contents came under his control. See also, <em>Odiorne </em>v. <em>Colley, 2 </em>N. H. 66; <em>Dunklee </em>v. <em>Fales, </em>5 N. H. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Mizner, 8 </em>Gray (Mass.) 182, and <em>Ilsley </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>12 Pick. (Mass.) 270, it was held that an officer is without right to break into a dwelling house for the purpose of making an attachment. See <em>Closson </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>47 N. H. 482. But where a shop or store is involved, the officer may enter by force if permission has been refused and the attachment will be valid. <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>16 Pick. (Mass.) 553; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>14 R. I. 11; <em>Fullam </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>30 Vt. 443. In <em>Haggerty </em>v. <em>Wilber, </em>16 Johns. (N. Y.) 286, 287, where a store was unoccupied, it was said: \u201cThere can be no doubt that the sheriff had authority to break open the store, and seize the goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">We take it to be established therefore that the defendant\u2019s goods were in fact within the power of the officer, in the sense that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>not inaccessible to him by reason of being locked up in a place where he could not lawfully reach them. <em>Cf. Huntington </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, supra. </em>Under our own decisions it was unnecessary for him to remove them. It was sufficient that they were \u201cput out of the control of the debtor\u201d <em>(Bryant </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>52 N. H. 182, 185), and placed and held under the control of the officer. <em>Odi\u00f3me </em>v. <em>Colley, supra; Johnson </em>v. <em>Farr, supra. </em>\u201c[TJaking into actual custody a building, or the key of it, so as to have the whole contents under one\u2019s control, is a receipt, or taking of the whole.\u201d <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, supra, </em>318. But for the authority of the writ, the action of the sheriff was such an interference with the debtor\u2019s right of control as would have constituted a trespass. 4 Am. Jur. 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Although the Court made no express ruling on the subject, the intervenor excepted \u201cto the . . . ruling that the Sheriff\u2019s returns . . . constitute a legal return of valid attachments.\u201d The returns were sufficient, within the requirements of our decisions. <em>Ela </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>32 N. H. 277, 282; <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Little, </em>42 N. H. 563. The descriptions were not so inadequate as to \u201csignify inability or failure to attach\u201d <em>(Dupont </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>86 N. H. 254, 257), and the particularity necessary to give notice of a bulky article attachment <em>(Bryant </em>v. <em>Osgood, supra), </em>was not required where actual control was retained by the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
