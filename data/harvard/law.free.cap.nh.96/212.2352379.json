The complaint in charging the defendant with a second conviction stated that he had been previously convicted \u201cin the Cheshire County Superior Court, at the September term, 1945. ...\u201d The information described it more fully as having taken place \u201cin the Cheshire County Superior Court on October 16, 1945. . . . \u201d This failure to recite the prior conviction more precisely in the complaint did not make it so defective in form or substance that it would not support a conviction <em>(State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>64 N. H. 440; <em>State </em>v. <em>Small, </em>64 N. H. 491) and prevent the defendant from being placed in jeopardy by a trial thereon. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sherburne, </em>58 N. H. 535; <em>State </em>v. <em>Liptzer, </em>90 N. H. 395; <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>93 N. H. 169; <em>State </em>v. <em>Belmestieri, </em>93 N. H. 262. The Municipal Court of Keene had jurisdiction of the offense with which he was charged. R. L., c. 377, <em>s. </em>15. He was arraigned, tried, convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">In the absence of an appeal, the defendant having been tried and convicted on a sufficient complaint by a court having jurisdiction thereof, he could never have been tried again for this same offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodgkins, </em>42 N. H. 474; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>136 Me. 127; <em>Clawans </em>v. <em>Rives, </em>104 F. (2d) 240; 22 C. J. S. 368; 15 Am. Jur. 38, 39; 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law (12th <em>ed. </em>), <em>s. </em>395.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">This brings us to the consideration of the effect of defendant\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court from his conviction in the Municipal Court. \u201cThe appeal is a continuation of the original proceeding; its object is to carry the cause to a higher tribunal, to be tried there anew, and a new judgment entered. . . . The effect of the appeal is to vacate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>for most purposes, the judgment below; and the judgment rendered in the court above is a distinct and original judgment.\u201d <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Brown, 25 </em>N. H. 216, 220, 221; <em>Bickford </em>v. <em>Franconia, 73 </em>N. H. 194. \u201cThe defendant by his appeal vacated the decision and sentence\u201d of the lower court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>150 Mass. 197, 199. The appeal, in fact, is more than a stay of the judgment of conviction before the Municipal Court. It vacates that judgment and transfers the whole proceeding to the Superior Court, there to be tried <em>de novo </em>on the original complaint, unless amended (R. L., c. 427, s. 12), or on a new information. <em>Malone </em>v. <em>State, </em>179 Ind. 184; 22 C. J. S., s. 256, <em>p. </em>393. The parties stand as though there had been no trial. <em>Jacoby </em>v. <em>State, </em>210 Ind. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Standing thus as though he had never been tried for this offense, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original complaint by the prosecutor <em>(State </em>v. <em>Dover, </em>46 N. H. 452) and the filing by him of an information for the same offense, does not give the defendant the right to plead former jeopardy thereto for by his appeal he has given up. that right. <em>Jacoby </em>v. <em>State, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>293 Pa. 218; <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>394 Ill. 433; <em>McDowell </em>v. <em>State, 225 </em>Ind. 495; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>United States </em>102 F. (2d) 275; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>70 S. Ct. 317; 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure (10th <em>ed.), s. </em>1455.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
