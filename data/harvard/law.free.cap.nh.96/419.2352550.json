R. L., c. 387, s. 13, provides that \u201cservice of writs against. . . corporations may be made upon the clerk, treasurer, cashier, or one of the directors, trustees or managers, if any in the state. ...\u201d The sheriff\u2019s return here recites that these writs were served on A. Metivier, president. This return does not show a compliance with the requirements of the above statute and unless it can be supplemented or modified the service would be defective. Where a statute points out a particular method of serving process on corporations such method must be followed and the sheriff\u2019s return should show the doing of everything necessary to constitute a compliance with its requirements. <em>FitzSimmons </em>v. <em>International Ass\u2019n of Machinists, </em>125 Conn. 490; 19 C. J. S. 993; 42 Am. Jur. 93; 9 Fletcher, Corporations (Perm. ed.) 208, 265; See <em>Dinnin </em>v. <em>Hutchins, </em>75 N. H. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u201cIt is not the return, however, but the service of the writ, that gives jurisdiction. The return is merely evidence by which the court is informed that the defendant has been served.\u201d <em>Bourgeious </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Trail Stages, </em>43 N. Mex. 453, 456; <em>Burleigh </em>v. <em>Leun, </em>83 N. H. 115. The essential factor therefore is that service be in fact made in compliance with the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">At the time of the service of these writs on him, A. Metivier was actually a director of the defendant corporation, an officer on whom service could properly be made under the provisions of R. L., <em>c. </em>387, s. 13. Service was in fact made on him. The sheriff\u2019s return of service on A. Metivier supplemented by the Court\u2019s finding that A. Metivier was at that time a director of the defendant corporation shows a proper service of these writs on the defendant. <em>Lucky Boy Min. &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>23 Ariz. 291; <em>Lamb-McAshan Co. </em>v. <em>Ellis, 270 </em>S. W. 547; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Lamb-McAshan Co., </em>278 S. W. 858. See <em>Mathes </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>62 N. H. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The sheriff\u2019s return may be amended in the Superior Court to accord with the facts. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>85 N. H. 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
