There was evidence that the plaintiff ceased all payments on the mortgage in the summer of 1929, that he then knew he was in default and expected the defendant would foreclose. He concedes that thereafter he \u201cgave no further thought to the matter\u201d and \u201cknew it had probably been foreclosed. ...\u201d From 1930 until 1948 although he knew others were occupying the premises, and had made \u201cchanges\u201d and \u201cenlarged\u201d it he \u201cmade no effort to act as owner of this property\u201d and told no one he had any claim to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">We believe these facts support the finding of a waiver, <em>(Kilgore </em>v. <em>Association, 78 </em>N. H. 498, 501, 502; <em>Mulhall </em>v. <em>Company, </em>80 N. H. 194, 205) and are clearly sustainable. <em>Jaques </em>v. <em>Chandler, 73 N. </em>H. 376, 384. This being so it is unnecessary to consider whether the finding of estoppel is warranted or what distinctions exist between it and the doctrine of waiver. See <em>McCracken </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>94 N. H. 474, and authorities cited; 31 C. J. S., Estoppel, <em>s. </em>61 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s remaining exceptions having been examined and none appearing sustainable, and it further appearing that if the motions contained in his brief were granted it would not affect the result, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-8\">Duncan, J., concurred in the result; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
