We believe that the agreement is valid. Squarely in point appears the case of <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Ugalde, </em>61 Ariz. 221, where a barbershop proprietor claimed that a contract with a barbers\u2019 union similar in the main to the one before us lacked consideration and was unenforceable. The court denied the defendant\u2019s contention and upheld the contract citing numerous authorities. See also, Teller, Labor Disputes and Collective Bargaining, s. 163 (1950 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The case of <em>Wicklund </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>18 Wash. (2d.) 206, cited by the defendant does not seem pertinent. There the court held that nonunion employees, who had not accepted the union as their bargaining agent under a collective bargaining agreement, and who were idled on account of a strike were not \u201cdirectly interested\u201d in the labor dispute so as to be disqualified from receiving compensation. The question of a lack of consideration in the contract between the union and the employer was not before the court and it is not perceived that this decision affects the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Since the decree entered by the Superior Court is correct, it is unnecessary to consider the exceptions to the findings and rulings upon which it was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b380-7\">Lampron, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
