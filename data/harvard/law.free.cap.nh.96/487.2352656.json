H. 184, 186; 3 Am. Jur. 630. Plaintiff\u2019s first two requests related to defendant\u2019s duty to inspect the tools and appliances furnished her. The only evidence in the record relating to inspection is the testimony of one Smith, a former employee of the defendant, who testified on behalf of the plaintiff as follows: \u201cQ. When you were there [1942, 1943, 1944] did you ever see any inspection made of the trucks while they were in use? A. Not that I know of, no.\u201d There is no evidence as to how much use if any the sash flat in question had received prior to the accident nor does it appear that the accident was caused by any defect which would have been discoverable by inspection. The Court\u2019s refusal to instruct in accordance with these two requests was therefore proper and plaintiff\u2019s exceptions thereto are overruled. <em>Lindberg </em>v. <em>Swenson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s other two requests, insofar as they were warranted, were sufficiently covered by the Court\u2019s charge as to the type of tools and instrumentalities which the defendant is required to furnish and the instructions and warnings which it is required to give to its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">The order must therefore <em>be</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-12\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
