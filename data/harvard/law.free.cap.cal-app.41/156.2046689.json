It is alleged in the complaint \u201cthat on or about the eighteenth day of March, A. D. 1915, the defendant J. E. Ervay forcibly, wrongfully, and unlawfully entered in and upon said premises and took possession of the same, together with all the personal property hereinafter set forth,\u201d and that \u201csaid defendants still unlawfully withhold and detain said property.\u201d The defendants by their answer deny that they took possession as alleged, or that \u201cthey are still <em>unlawfully </em>withholding or <em>unlawfully </em>detaining said property,\u201d which, as a matter of law, is an admission of possession of the property at the time of the commencement of the action. The answer further alleges that \u201cthese defendants are the owners and entitled to the immediate possession of said property\u201d; and further, a specific allegation is made \u201cthat defendant Ervay has been seriously damaged by the wrongful action of the plaintiff <em>in taking said property from him,\u201d </em>etc.\u2014referring to the taking by the sheriff under affidavit with order indorsed thereon, and undertaking, as provided by section 509 et seq. of the Cjode of Civil Procedure. This, we think, is an admission by defendants that the property was in their possession at the time of the commencement of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The court also finds that <em>\u201cat all times </em>in said complaint mentioned the said defendants Ervay and Bell forcibly, wrongfully, and unlawfully, and without any right, entered in and upon and took possession of said premises, together with the personal property therein contained, <em>to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>the exclusion of the rights of said plaintiff.\u201d </em>Though somewhat uncertain in its <em>terms, </em>how can this finding be construed, in the light of the admissions of the answer, other than as a statement that both defendants at all times had the possession and control of this property?</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">It therefore conclusively appears from the record before us that the respondent Ervay was a joint tort-feasor, both in the taking and withholding of said property from plaintiff, and that, therefore, the court should have adjudged that he, as well as the other defendants, is liable for all damages resulting from their withholding of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Judgment is reversed, and cause remanded with directions to the lower court to enter judgment in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Finlayson, P. J., and Sloane, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
