The judgment was entered after plea of guilty had been made to a charge of forgery. Before sentence was pronounced a physician was called by the defendant and he testified that, in his opinion, based upon a brief observation of the defendant, he was not rational. <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> However, his testimony did not produce in the mind of the trial judge a sufficient doubt as to the defendant\u2019s sanity, and we think that the mere opinion of a medical witness was not sufficient to compel a determination of the question in the defendant\u2019s favor, but that the trial judge had discretion to make the ruling which he caused to be entered. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hettick, </em>126 Cal. 425, [58 Pac. 918]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>178 Cal. 794, [175 Pac. 6].).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Conrey, P.
