The bond was for $6,746.50. The case was tried by the court without a jury. Judgment went for plaintiff in the sum of three thousand two hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The amended complaint is in two counts, in the first of which appears what purports to be a copy of the indemnifying bond and a copy of the contract between the plaintiff and said Aiken Reinforced Concrete Company, set but <em>in externa, </em>and the second realleging these same alleged facts which were set forth and referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the first cause of action. Without quoting said instruments or any portion of the complaint, suffice it to say that the plaintiff prays for judgment against defendant for the sum of six thousand seven hundred dollars, and for her costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">There was a demurrer to the complaint as amended. This demurrer was both general and special.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Appellant specifies fourteen errors at law occurring dur-. ing the trial, and fifteen specifications of insufficiency of the evidence to support the findings of .the court. In view of the fact that we are of the opinion that the first specification of error\u2014the court\u2019s overruling of the said demurrer\u2014 referred to in the transcript and appellant\u2019s opening brief, is well taken, we do not consider that for the present any other point urged need be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Nowhere in the amended complaint is it alleged, nor does the record contain any evidence, that the plaintiff herein performed <em>any, </em>much less all, of the covenants or conditions required to he performed by her under her contract with the contractor, the Aiken Reinforced Concrete Company. Notwithstanding this fact, the court, in finding VII, found: \u201cThat the plaintiff performed all the conditions and terms and agreements on her part to be performed with the Aiken Reinforced Concrete Company under said contract, provided to be by her kept and performed.\u201d The point is not urged by appellant, but we fail to find any evidence in the record to justify the find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ing, even had the pleadings been such as to permit the reception of the same. We think that this failure to so allege is fatal to the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The contract by its terms required the plaintiff to pay to said contractor the full sum of twenty-seven thousand dollars in six installments, as follows:' The sum of $4,050 \u201cwhen the foundations is in ready for the first floor joists\u201d; the second installment of $4,050 \u201cwhen the walls are up .one story, and the second-story joists are in place\u201d; the third installment of $4,050 \u201cwhen the roof is on\u201d; the fourth installment of $4,050 \u201cwhen the plastering is completed\u201d; the fifth installment of $4,038.50 \u201cwhen the building is completed and accepted,\u201d and the sixth, and final, payment of $6,761.50 \u201cthirty-five days after the acceptance of the building.\u201d Nowhere in the amended complaint is there an allegation that plaintiff has paid any of these installments to the said contractor as provided for in said contract, or otherwise or at all; and for aught that appears in the said amended complaint, the failure on the part of plaintiff to comply with any or all of said provisions may have been the reason for the failure and neglect of the contractor to complete the contract or agreement referred to, if, indeed, any such failure or neglect occurred. The demurrer should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We consider the citation of authorities unnecessary to support our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The judgment is reversed and the lower court ordered to reverse its ruling overruling, and to sustain defendant\u2019s demurrer to the amended complaint herein, granting plaintiff leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Finlayson, P. J., and Sloane, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
