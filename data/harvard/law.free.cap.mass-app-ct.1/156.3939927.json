Each count names as plaintiff a different member of the Roketenetz family which operates a waste disposal business in Woburn. Each of the four counts (hereafter referred to collectively as the declaration<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) alleges that the defendant in its newspaper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\u201cdid publish in said paper a false and malicious libel ... with express malice toward the said plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The publication attached to the declaration is an account of a meeting of the board of health of the city of Woburn at which two aldermen \u201casked for the cooperation of the new Board members to either convince the Woburn Redevelopment Authority to reassign another location to the Rokenctz [sic] businesses or to effectively police the Roketenetz property so that citizens in the area would not be bothered by foul smelling garbage left in trucks overnight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The meeting was held \u201cin anticipation of tonight\u2019s public hearing on the application for a permit to store gas, oil and diesel fuel at the new Roketenetz\u2019s business location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The account reported that members of the board \u201cstated that they would do everything in their power to see that the Roketenetz business obeyed the law and washed out their garbage hauling trucks each day.\u201d The chairman \u201cpointed out, however, that in the past it had been very difficult to deal with the Roketenetz family.\u201d These difficulties as described by the chairman are set out in the footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The article then quotes verbatim the discussion at the meeting between Alderman O\u2019Rourke and the superintendent of solid wastes as to the feasibility of preventing spillage and odor problems in the collection of garbage. Alderman Hassett asked \u201cif there was any way to prevent a truck full of garbage being parked there overnight\u201d and was told by the board of health secretary that it was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The account ends with a request to the board by Alderman O\u2019Rourke \u201cthat he be immediately informed if there were any complaints about the operations at the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>site and stated that he personally would inspect each complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The defendant demurred on the ground, among others, that the declaration did not state a cause of action. We agree; the demurrers were properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The plaintiffs rely on the proposition in <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>304 Mass. 31, 34, that \u201ca demurrer to a declaration in libel cannot be sustained ... unless the words ... are incapable of a defamatory meaning\u201d and its corollary that given defamatory words, privilege is \u201cmatter of defence not open on demurrer\u201d. <em>Muchnick </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>332 Mass. 304, dealing with the privilege of fair comment. But see the qualification in <em>Poland </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>330 Mass. 701, 704 and <em>Boston Nutrition Society, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stare, </em>342 Mass. 439, 443 (\u201cordinarily not open on demurrer\u201d). This order of pleading based on the common law allocation of the burden of proof (see Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 613) derives from the view of defamation as an intentional tort like trespass. Harper &amp; James, Torts, \u00a7 5.21. \u201cA person publishes libellous matter at his peril.\u201d <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Advertiser Newspaper Co. </em>154 Mass. 238, 245 (Holmes, J.). \u201c[T]he liability [is] the usual liability in tort for the natural consequence of a manifestly injurious act.\u201d <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>159 Mass. 293, 303, (Holmes, J., dissenting opinion). (See <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>215 Mass. 450). This historical development of libel bears out this analysis. Holdsworth, 8 History of English Law, 365-367, 375, et seq. Plucknett, A Concise History of the Common Law (4th ed.) 466, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">However, the analysis is not qualified by the constitutional limitation imposed by <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U. S. 254, and \u2014 particularly applicable in this case \u2014 <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>403 U. S. 29 and <em>Priestley </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. of Lynn, </em>360 Mass. 118. See <em>Twohig </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>362 Mass. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The publication in this case is strikingly similar to the newspaper reports in <em>Priestley </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publish</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>ing Co. of Lynn </em>of meetings of the selectmen in Saugus at which the town manager made defamatory charges, which a jury could have found to be false, against an architect commissioned to build a new junior high school. The Supreme Judicial Court in the <em>Priestley </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at 123, following <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>and <em>Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Association v. Bresler, </em>398 U. S. 6, held that the publication \u201crelated to the plaintiffs involvement in an event of public or general concern\u201d and applied the <em>Times </em>standard. Under that standard it is a matter of proof by the plaintiff (376 U. S. at 284) that the publication was made \u201cwith knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not\u201d (376 U. S. at 279-280), \u201cthat the lie was a knowing one, or uttered in reckless disregard of the truth.\u201d <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Baer, </em>383 U.S. 75,92.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The <em>Times </em>case, as extended by <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>403 U. S. 29, thus established a qualified constitutional privilege to publish false and defamatory material about matters of public concern. It adopted the view of the Kansas Court in <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>MacLennan, </em>78 Kan. 711, 723, that \u201cthe occasion gives rise to a privilege, qualified to this extent: any one claiming to be defamed by the communication must show actual malice or go remediless. This privilege extends to a great variety of subjects, and includes matters of public concern, public men, and candidates for office.\u201d See Kalven, The New York Times Case: A Note on \u201cthe Central Meaning of the First Amendment,\u201d 1964 Sup. Ct. Rev. 191, 203; Pedrick, Freedom of the Press and the Law of Libel: The Modern Revised Translation, 49 Cornell L. Q. 581,587.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The publication in this case clearly comes within the constitutional privilege. It reports a meeting of the board of health concerning garbage disposal and the grant of a permit to store gasoline, etc. at a new location about which a public hearing was scheduled. These were obviously matters of public concern. <em>See Arizona Biochemical Co. </em>v. <em>Hearst Corp. </em>302 F. Supp. 412 (S. D. N. Y.). The publication cannot, therefore, be the basis for a cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>unless the declaration contains an allegation adequate to comply with the <em>Times </em>standard. The introduction at trial of this article and the fact of its publication, without more, would result in a directed verdict for the defendant at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case unless the plaintiffs had also introduced sufficient evidence to permit the trier to find the facts that it was false and that the defendant either knew it was false or published the article recklessly, \u201cin fact entertain [ing] serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d <em>St. Amant </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>390 U. S. 727, 731, quoted in <em>Twohig </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>362 Mass. 807. See <em>Priestley </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. of Lynn, supra; Tripoli </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>359 Mass. 150. Since such \u201csubstantive facts [are] necessary to constitute the cause of action\u201d when the <em>Times </em>privilege applies, they must be pleaded. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 7, Second.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Gabriel </em>v. <em>Borowy, </em>324 Mass. 231, 234-235. <em>Cluff v. Picardi, </em>331 Mass. 320, 322. Mottla, Civil Practice (3ded.) \u00a7 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">This is consistent with the indications in <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Clinton Printing Co. </em>169 Mass. 512, 515 (\u201c[T]he defendant can escape liability [on] the ground of privilege, if any such appears on the face of the declaration\u201d) and <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Long, </em>190 Mass. 138, 141 (\u201c[UJnless the averments of the declaration show a sufficient occasion and justification for what the defendant is alleged to have done this [publication] is enough to constitute a cause of action\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>346 Mass. 245, 248-249. Cf. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Wakefield Item Co. </em>280 Mass. 451, 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Indeed, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that where an absolute privilege appears on the face of the declaration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>it is subject to demurrer though, as with a qualified privilege, \u201c[ijf the defendant relies upon the defence of absolute privilege, he has the burden of proving it.\u201d Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 613, comment f. <em>Mezullo </em>v. <em>Maletz, </em>331 Mass. 233 (physician\u2019s certificate in commitment proceedings). <em>Perry </em>v. <em>E. Anthony &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>353 Mass. 112 (report of litigation in a Federal Court). <em>Aborn </em>v. <em>Lipson, </em>357 Mass. 71 (testimony of witness). See <em>Cluff </em>v. <em>Picardi, </em>331 Mass. 320, 323, holding a bill of complaint demurrable where a memorandum of an oral contract incorporated by reference in the bill of complaint was inadequate to satisfy the statute of frauds. The court said \u2014 particularly applicable here \u2014 \u201cIf the plaintiff at a hearing on the merits should prove all the allegations of fact properly set forth in his bill, without more, he would lose his case for lack of a sufficient memorandum\u201d. See also <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Lowenstein, </em>314 Mass. 642 (declaration disclosing defence of statute of frauds held demurrable); <em>Reavey </em>v. <em>Guild of St. Agnes, </em>284 Mass. 300 (declaration for negligence held demurrable where it appeared on its face that the defendant had charitable immunity although \u201ccharitable immunity is an affirmative defence . . . not open on demurrer\u201d <em>[Grueninger </em>v. <em>President and Fellows of Harvard College, </em>343 Mass. 338, 339-340]).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The allegations of the declaration that the newspaper account was \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d and was published \u201cwith express malice toward the said plaintiff\u2019 are insufficient to make out a cause of action under the <em>Times </em>standard. Falsehood does not by itself make a publication actionable. \u201cWhat the <em>New York Times </em>rule ultimately protects is defamatory falsehood.\u201d <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Baer, </em>383 U. S. 75, 92 (Stewart, J., concurring). Indeed, even at common law falsehood is insufficient to overcome the conditional privilege which attaches to \u201c[t]he publication of a report of.. . proceedings of a legislative or administrative body or an executive officer of... a municipal corporation or of a body empowered by law to perform a public duty.\u201d Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 611. \u201cThis privilege differs from the usual conditional privilege [e.g., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>privilege of fair comment] in that it affords protection even though the defamatory statement reported is known to be false.\u201d Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 611, comment a. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Vallis, </em>356 Mass. 662, 669 (report of false charges made at a Registry of Motor Vehicles hearing held qualifiedly privileged); <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>355 Mass. 492, 498-499; <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>160 Mass. 509, 516; <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>326 Mass. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The word \u201cmalicious\u201d does not advance the pleader. \u201cThe summary allegation that the false statements are \u2018malicious\u2019 is usual in a libel suit. The word is one of art in such pleadings . . ..\u201d <em>Krebiozen Research Foundation </em>v. <em>Beacon Press, Inc. </em>334 Mass. 86, 89-90, citing, among other cases, <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>7 Allen, 61, 63 (\u201cAn averment in a declaration for slander that the words were spoken maliciously is not a distinct and substantive allegation of fact, but it is only descriptive of the legal character which the law imputes to words which import a charge of crime\u201d). In considering a declaration on demurrer we \u201clay to one side epithets such as \u2018without just cause,\u2019 and \u2018main ciously.\u2019 General conclusions of this nature without allegations of fact sufficient to support them are not admitted by the demurrer.\u201d <em>J. J. Gordon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worcester Telegram Publishing Co. Inc. </em>343 Mass. 142,143, and cases cited. See <em>Lothrop v. Adams, </em>133 Mass. 471, 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The allegation that the account was published \u201cwith express malice\u201d does not satisfy the <em>Times </em>standard. That phrase, used interchangeably with \u201cactual malice\u201d and \u201cmalice in fact,\u201d commonly means \u201cmalicious intention\u201d <em>(Lothrop </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>133 Mass. 470, 479), \u201can improper motive\u201d <em>(Hartmann </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>323 Mass. 56, 59; <em>Bander </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. </em>313 Mass. 337, 344). See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (rev. 4th ed.), 1109. \u201cA wish to harm\u201d <em>(Squires </em>v. <em>Wason Manufacturing Co. </em>182 Mass. 137, 141) might, perhaps, rebut the common law privilege of fair reporting, although \u201cit is questionable how far the defendant\u2019s motivation will be of controlling significance in a case of a writing in a field of public interest\u201d even if a case were made out \u201cof active <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>malice in the defendant \u2014 of a purpose to injure the plaintiffs or their business rather than an intent to publish a book about a controversial subject.\u201d <em>Krebiozen Research Foundation </em>v. <em>Beacon Press, Inc. </em>334 Mass. 86, 89. See Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 611, comment a, taking the position that \u201cprotection is lost if the report is published <em>solely </em>for the purpose of defaming the other and not for the purpose of informing the public\u201d (emphasis supplied). Such a motive does not in any event make a case of \u201cactual malice\u201d\u2014 knowing falsehood or reckless disregard \u2014 under the <em>Times </em>standard. <em>Beckley Newspapers Corp. </em>v. <em>Hanks, </em>389 U. S. 81, <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>380 U. S. 356. <em>Washington Post Co. </em>v. <em>Keogh, </em>365 F. 2d 965 (D. C. Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">We cannot construe \u201cexpress malice\u201d in the declaration to refer to \u201cactual malice\u201d in the <em>Times </em>sense. There is no indication in the declaration or the plaintiffs\u2019 scant brief, which does not mention the <em>Times </em>case, that more than the ordinary common law meaning of \u201cexpress malice\u201d was intended. \u201cNo intendment in favor of the pleader can be made upon a demurrer.\u201d <em>Comerford </em>v. <em>Meier, </em>302 Mass. 398, 402. <em>Gabriel </em>v. <em>Borowy, </em>324 Mass. 231. <em>Becker </em>v. <em>Calnan, </em>313 Mass. 625, 630. Moreover, the \u201cactual malice\u201d required by the <em>Times </em>case is, as Prosser points out, akin to deceit and misrepresentation, rather than motive. Prosser, Torts (4th ed.) \u00a7 118, p. 821. It should, therefore, like fraud, be pleaded with particularity greater than the bare phrase. <em>Krebiozen Research Foundation </em>v. <em>Beacon Press, Inc. </em>334 Mass. 86. See <em>Dealtry </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Watertown, </em>279 Mass. 22, 26-27 (general charges of bad faith not admitted on demurrer).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">This accords with the <em>Times </em>objective to minimize the inhibiting effect of the expense involved in defending libel suits on \u201cthe vigor and .. . the variety of public debate.\u201d <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U. S. 254, 279. <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>385 U. S. 374, 389. The mere incantation of the words \u201cactual malice\u201d should not be enough to put a defendant to the expense of a trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>We therefore hold that where it appears from the publication alleged to be defamatory that the <em>Times </em>privilege applies, the plaintiff must allege that it was false and that the defendant either knew it was false or published the material with reckless disregard of whether it was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The order sustaining the demurrers is affirmed. However, since the effect of the <em>Times </em>standard on pleadings has not heretofore been considered by the Supreme Judicial Court or this court, the plaintiffs are given leave to file a motion to amend the declaration in the Superior Court which motion should be allowed if the proposed amendment is in conformity with this opinion. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>177 Mass. 485, 488. <em>Berkwitz </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>269 Mass. 65, 66.

Cases and Materials on Torts (2d ed.) 54.

The declaration follows the forms set forth as sufficient in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 147, Forms, 18-20, except that no innuendo is stated. Where, as here, the published matter imputes crime, no innuendo is necessary. <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>New England Newspaper Publishing Co. </em>286 Mass. 258, 261. Therefore I would reverse the order sustaining the demurrers.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">I would not reach the question whether the words \u201cexpress malice\u201d or \u201cactual malice\u201d are a sufficient method of pleading facts necessary to overcome the conditional privilege enunciated in <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U. S. 254, and later cases. Privilege is a matter of defence and has repeatedly been held not to be raised by demurrer. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Coulter, </em>215 Mass. 566, 571. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Wakefield Item Co. </em>280 Mass. 451, 457. <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>304 Mass. 31, 34-35. <em>Muchnick </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>332 Mass. 304, 308. It is possible, of course, for a declaration to allege facts disclosing an affirmative defence, thus enabling the defendant to raise by demurrer what he would normally raise by his answer. The majority find such disclosure not in the plaintiffs\u2019 own allegations of fact but in the text of the allegedly libelous newspaper article. I feel that the sounder approach is that taken in <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Wakefield Item Co. </em>280 Mass. 451, 456, that facts stated in the allegedly libelous publication are not to be treated as allegations of fact by the plaintiff. The only fact these plaintiffs allege with respect to the article is that the defendant published it. They do not allege as fact any statements in the article, including those that the majority rely upon t\u00f3 establish privilege. Nothing in the declaration precludes a .contention by the plaintiffs that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the participants at the board of health meeting did not in fact make the defamatory statements reported, that the meeting never touched upon the Roketenetz business, or that there was in fact no meeting of the board of health. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Wakefield Item Co., supra. </em>Since the plaintiffs have not alleged facts showing conditional privilege, they are not required to allege facts sufficient to overcome the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Nothing in <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>or later cases has altered our established rules of pleading or proving privilege, or the facts which overcome privilege. The burden of proving facts to overcome a conditional privilege has always been on the plaintiff. <em>Brow </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>13 Allen 239. <em>Doane </em>v. <em>Grew, </em>220 Mass. 171, 182. <em>Bander </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. </em>313 Mass. 337, 344. Cases after <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>holding that the defendant is entitled to a directed verdict where the plaintiff fails to carry that burden <em>(Tripoli </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>359 Mass. 150; <em>Priestley </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. of Lynn, </em>360 Mass. 118; <em>Twohig </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>362 Mass. 807) stand on no different footing from such earlier cases as <em>Childs </em>v. <em>Erhard, </em>226 Mass. 454, and <em>Terrini </em>v. <em>New England Steamship Co. </em>244 Mass. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Even if facts stated in the allegedly libelous publication were treated as part of the plaintiffs\u2019 own allegations of facts, any conditional privilege thus disclosed was sufficiently rebutted by pleading that the defendant acted with \u201cactual malice\u201d, \u201cexpress malice\u201d, or \u201cmalice in fact.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <em>New York Times Co. </em>case itself used the phrase \u201cactual malice\u201d to denote the knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard necessary to overcome the privilege. 376 U. S. 254, 279-280. So do <em>Tripoli </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., Priestly </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. of Lynn, </em>and <em>Twohig </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>all <em>supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The plaintiff in a libel action should be able to use the same phrase. To require more particularity cannot, in my opinion, materially reduce \u201cthe inhibiting effect [on public debate] of the expenses involved in defending libel suits.\u201d Few plaintiffs in libel actions will be loathe to recite that the defendant published \u201cwith reckless disregard of whether the facts were true or false.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> The phrases are used interchangeably.
