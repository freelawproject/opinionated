The plaintiffs are the owners of and reside in a home some four or five hundred yards from the locus.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">The trial judge made detailed findings of fact, amply supported by the reported evidence, which led him to conclude that the proposed development \u201cis in complete harmony with the general purpose and intent of the\u201d bylaw (see G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 4, as most recently amended by St. 1966, c. 199) and that \u201c[t]he permitted exception is precisely the type contemplated by\u201d the aforementioned \u00a7 17B. As there is nothing in the findings or the evidence to suggest that the board\u2019s decision was \u201cbased on a legally untenable ground, or . . . [was] unreasonable, whimsical or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>arbitrary\u201d <em>(Golden </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Falmouth, </em>358 Mass. 519, 523, and cases cited), and as we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the board <em>(Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Framingham, </em>355 Mass. 275, 277-278), we lay to one side the plaintiffs\u2019 voluminous arguments as to the wisdom of the board\u2019s decision. Their remaining arguments must be placed in their proper context.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The development of the locus was subject to the jurisdiction of the planning board under the provisions of the Subdivision Control Law (G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81K through 81GG). In addition, \u00a7 17B (4) of the zoning by-law required the planning board to, and it did, submit to the board of appeals a written report of its recommendations with respect to the apartment development as it was portrayed on the plan which the applicant was required to, and did, submit to the latter board prior to the public hearing. Both that plan and another bearing some sort of written approval by the planning board under the subdivision control law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were submitted at the public hearing. After the conclusion of the public hearing, but prior to issuing its decision, the board of appeals consulted privately with the planning board. The judge made no findings on this point, but a careful review of the evidence discloses that the discussion between the two boards centered on the requirements ultimately found in the decision of the board of appeals with respect to the applicant\u2019s connecting the development to a 12 inch sewer main proposed to be constructed in Lynn Fells Parkway and his posting a bond to insure his completion of the requirements shown on the plan submitted to the board of appeals under \u00a7 17B (4) of the by-law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>applicant was not present at the conference between the two boards, and there is nothing to suggest that the merits of the pending case were discussed or that the basic decision of the board of appeals to grant the permit was influenced in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Although we think the board of appeals should not have discussed the case with the planning board following the conclusion of its public hearing and prior to issuing its decision (see <em>Boott Mills </em>v. <em>Board of Conciliation and Arbitration, </em>311 Mass. 223, 225-227, and <em>Moran </em>v. <em>School Committee of Littleton, </em>317 Mass. 591,594), we see nothing in the facts of the present case which requires us to annul the decision of the board of appeals for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Nor did the inclusion of the unconditional requirement of a sewer connection vitiate the decision of that board. See <em>Shoppers\u2019 World, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beacon Terrace Realty, Inc. </em>353 Mass. 63, 69-70. Cf. <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>345 Mass. 376, 378-379.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">We have confined our consideration to those issues open to the plaintiffs which they can fairly be said to have argued in their brief. Rule 1:13 of the Appeals Court. Rule 1:13 of the Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-11\"> See G.

We see no express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>warrant for the inclusion of the bond requirement. Compare, as to a planning board, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, as amended through St. 1967, c. 567. The applicant does not complain of either of these requirements, and we do not see how their inclusion harmed the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
