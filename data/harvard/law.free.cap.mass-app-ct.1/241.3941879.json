On November 23, 1971 the Malden city council passed a bond order authorizing the treasurer, with the approval of the mayor, to borrow $8,000,000 for the purpose of building an incinerator. The mayor signed the order on November 24, 1971. On December 14, 1971 the petitioners, who are registered voters of the city, filed a referendum petition, which they had circulated, with the city clerk. The referendum petition requests that \u201cthe question of approving or disapproving\u201d the bond order be submitted to the voters of Malden. The city clerk refused to deliver the referendum petition to the registrars of voters for certification of signatures. See G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 38.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The sole question presented is whether the referendum petition was seasonably filed under the provisions of G. L. c. 44, \u00a7 8A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The petitioners\u2019 assertion is that, but for the filing of the referendum petition, the \u201ceffective\u201d day of the order would be November 24, 1971, the day of the mayor\u2019s approval, and, since the referendum petition was filed with the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>clerk within twenty days of that day, the petition was seasonably filed under \u00a7 8A. The respondents argue that the \u201ceffective\u201d day would be November 23,1971, when the city council passed the bond order, and that not having filed the petition until the twenty-first day thereafter, the petitioners failed to comply with the requirement of \u00a7 8A.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">We take judicial notice of the city charter of Malden (St. 1881, c. 169) and amendments thereto. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Northampton, </em>316 Mass. 432,435. When G. L. c. 44, \u00a7 8A, is read in conjunction with \u00a7 11 of the charter, as amended by St. 1958, c. 286, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it becomes apparent that the bond order could become effective without the approval of the mayor only if passed by a two-thirds vote of the city council over his objections. <em>Scalley </em>v. <em>Registrars of Voters of Woburn, </em>358 Mass. 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The respondents rely heavily upon the provisions of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 42,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and upon <em>Corriere </em>v. <em>Registrars of Voters of Fitchburg, </em>257 Mass. 287, interpreting that statute. Explicit under \u00a7 42 is the fact that the twenty-day period starts to run from the final passage of a measure by a city council. A comparison of \u00a7 42 with G. L. c. 44, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8A, read in conjunction with G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 38, makes it clear that \u00a7 42 and the <em>Corriere </em>case are not applicable to a referendum petition challenging this bond order.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">It does not appear, however, that the city of Malden adopted one of the municipal charter plans set out in G. L. c. 43; and the applicability of this chapter to a city is expressly conditioned upon its acceptance of one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>plans described therein. <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Curnane, </em>329 Mass. 490,491. But, through the enactment of St. 1950, c. 29, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Malden city charter was amended to include precisely the then language of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 42, with respect to referendum petitions. It is significant that the amendment did not alter the previous acceptance of G. L. c. 44, \u00a7 8A, by the city relating to referenda on bond issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">There is no merit in the further assertion of the respondents based upon <em>Corriere </em>v. <em>Registrars of Voters of Fitchburg, </em>257 Mass. 287, 288,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the referendum petition must be filed with the city clerk sufficiently early within the statutory period of twenty days to allow the respondents\u2019 functions (see fn. 1) also to be performed within that period. To follow that argument would be to thwart the obvious legislative intent \u201cto provide a simple, practicable method of obtaining municipal referenda.\u201d <em>O\u2019Shea v. Holyoke, </em>345 Mass. 175, 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The order allowing the motion to dismiss is reversed and the case is to stand for trial in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\"> Section 38 (second paragraph) reads, \u201cWithin five days after the filing of said petition the registrars of voters shall ascertain by what number of registered voters the petition is signed, and what percentage that number is of the total number of registered voters, and shall attach thereto their certificate showing the result of such examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u201cThe city clerk shall forthwith transmit the said certificate with the said petition to the city council.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\"> Section 8A, inserted by St. 1939, c. 108, \u00a7 1, accepted by the city of Malden on November 14,1939, reads, \u201c[Ajn order authorizing the issue of bonds ... for any purpose specified in any applicable clause of section seven,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> other than clause (11)... shall not become effective before the expiration of a period of twenty days from the day upon which such order would become effective except for this section.
