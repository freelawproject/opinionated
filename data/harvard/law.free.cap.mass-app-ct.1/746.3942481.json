While the meager record before us omits the pleadings and does not otherwise disclose the exact nature of the ultimate relief sought, we infer that the petitioner seeks to establish his right to preference as a \u201cveteran\u201d on an eligibility list for promotion in the fire department pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 21-25, and to overturn the decision of the Director of Civil Service and the Civil Service Commission that he is not a \u201cveteran\u201d within the meaning of those statutes. We assume, without deciding, that certiorari is available for this purpose. See <em>Reidy </em>v. <em>Acting Director of Civil Service, </em>354 Mass. 760 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">The facts are undisputed. The petitioner enlisted in the army national guard on January 12,1961, and was on active duty therein from March 12 to September 11 of that year. His only national guard service thereafter consisted of attending annual two-week training programs until 1965. On January 11, 1965, he transferred to the army reserve, and commenced active duty therein by attending a two-week training program on July 17 of that year. During that two-week period he contracted myelitis and was confined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>at the Chelsea Naval Hospital by reason thereof until February 23, 1966. On December 6, 1966, he was retired from the army reserve with a service-connected disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Whether this military service makes the petitioner a \u201cveteran\u201d for the purposes of the veterans\u2019 preference law turns on the definition of that term in G. L. c. 31, \u00a721 (as amended through St. 1972, c. 98), which (with exceptions not here material) provides that the word \u201cveteran\u201d as used in G. L. c. 31 shall mean \u201cany citizen who ... is a veteran as defined in clause Forty-third of [G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7] ....\u201d Clause Forty-third of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, (as amended through St. 1968, c. 531<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) contains twelve paragraphs, but only the first, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>second, eighth and last of those paragraphs are pertinent to the petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The first paragraph of clause Forty-third, insofar as material, defines a \u201cveteran\u201d as \u201cany person ... (a) whose last discharge or release from his wartime service, as defined herein, was under honorable conditions and who <em>(b) </em>served in the army ... of the United States for not less than ninety days active service, at least one day of which was for wartime service, provided that any person who so served in wartime and was awarded a service-connected disability .. . shall be deemed to be a veteran notwithstanding his failure to complete ninety days of active service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The second paragraph of clause Forty-third defines \u201cwartime service\u201d as service performed by veterans of specified wars or by a member of the \u201cWAAC\u201d. The eighth paragraph, which is one of a series of paragraphs defining veterans of the wars specified in the definition of \u201cwartime service\u201d (see n. 1), gives a two-part definition of the term \u201cVietnam veteran\u201d: \u201c(1) any person who performed such wartime service during the period commencing August [5, 1964] ... and ending on a date to be determined by presidential proclamation and concurrent resolution of the congress of the United States or (2) any person who served at least one hundred and eighty days of active service in the armed forces of the United States during the period between February [1,1955] ... and August [4,1964] ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The last paragraph of clause Forty-third provides: \u201c \u2018Active service in the armed forces\u2019, as used in this clause shall not include active duty for training in the army national guard or air national guard or active duty for training as a reservist in the armed forces of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">No question has been raised as to whether the petitioner was discharged \u201cunder honorable conditions,\u201d as required by subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of clause Forty-third. Nor can it be doubted that he performed military duty during wartime, as required by subparagraph <em>(b) </em>of that paragraph, for his military duty as an army reservist in 1965 fell within the time period set forth in subparagraph (1) of the paragraph defining \u201cVietnam veteran.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While there is some question whether the duties he performed in 1965 constitute \u201cservice\u201d (see <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Civil Service, </em>281 Mass. 376 [1933]; <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>342 Mass. 67 [1961]), we assume, without deciding, that the petitioner satisfied the requirement of \u201cat least one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>day ... [of] wartime service\u201d contained in subparagraph <em>(b) </em>of the first paragraph. The sole issue, then, is whether the petitioner\u2019s military history brings him within the provisions of subparagraph (6) relating to \u201cactive service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">1. The petitioner first contends that his seven months\u2019 confinement in the Chelsea Naval Hospital satisfied the requirement in subparagraph <em>(b) </em>of the first paragraph of \u201cnot less than ninety days active service.\u201d We disagree. The last paragraph of clause Forty-third provides that \u201cactive duty for training as a reservist in the armed forces of the United States\u201d does not constitute \u201cactive service in the armed forces.\u201d At the time the petitioner contracted the illness which resulted in his hospitalization, he was engaged in an annual two-week program \u201cfor training as a reservist\u201d and was therefore not performing \u201cactive service in the armed forces.\u201d His ensuing hospitalization was at most a prolongation of that training program, and no more constituted \u201cactive service\u201d than the training program which caused it.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The petitioner attempts to avoid this conclusion by arguing that the paragraph which restricts the meaning of \u201cactive service in the armed forces\u201d applies only to that term as used in the paragraph defining \u201cVietnam veteran\u201d \u2014 where it appears only in subparagraph (2), which is admittedly inapplicable to the petitioner. This argument is apparently based on the fact that the applicable version of the paragraph defining \u201cVietnam veteran\u201d and the one defining \u201cactive service in the armed forces\u201d were both inserted in clause Forty-third by St. 1968, c. 531. The latter paragraph, however, is expressly made applicable to \u201cthis clause,\u201d and an examination of the act whereby \u00a7 7, Forty-third, was originally inserted (St. 1954, c. 627, \u00a7 1), the subsequent acts amending it (St. 1955, c. 403, \u00a7 1; St. 1957, c. 164, \u00a7 1; St. 1960, c. 299; St. 1960, c. 544, \u00a7 1; St. 1965, c. 875; St. 1966, c. 716; St. 1967, c. 437; St. 1968, c. 531) and other provisions in the General Laws referring to it (including the provision of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 21, involved in the present case) discloses a consistent legislative practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>using the word \u201cclause\u201d to embrace \u00a7 7, Forty-third, in its entirety. Actually, until the 1968 amendments the substance of the paragraph defining \u201cactive service in the armed forces\u201d was a part of the paragraph defining \u201cVietnam veteran\u201d (see St. 1967, c. 437). The fact that it was removed from that paragraph and placed in a separate paragraph at the end of clause Forty-third by St. 1968, c. 531, is further evidence of a legislative intention to broaden its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The petitioner\u2019s contention that the paragraph defining \u201cactive service in the armed forces\u201d is inapplicable to the first paragraph of clause Forty-third may also be based in part on the absence from the first paragraph of the words \u201cin the armed forces\u201d following the words \u201cactive service.\u201d We attach no significance to this omission. The \u201cactive service\u201d referred to in the first paragraph must have been performed \u201cin the army, navy, marine corps, coast guard, or air force,\u201d and those branches of service collectively constitute the \u201carmed forces\u201d as that term is defined in the penultimate paragraph of clause Forty-third (see n. 1). Thus, there is no discernible difference in meaning between \u201cactive service\u201d in the first paragraph and \u201cactive service in the armed forces\u201d in the last. Moreover, clause Forty-third is too cumbersome in concept and its component paragraphs too disparate in drafting style to bear intricate analysis based on such slight differences in form of expression. Rather, clause Forty-third must be approached as a whole, with a view to understanding the legislative intent underlying it. We are of the opinion that the term \u201cactive service\u201d in the first paragraph was intended by the Legislature to be governed by the definition of \u201cactive service in the armed forces\u201d in the last paragraph. In arriving at this conclusion we are not unmindful of the fact that St. 1968, c. 531, whereby the applicable version of the paragraph defining \u201cVietnam veteran\u201d and the last paragraph were inserted in clause Forty-third, was entitled, \u201cAn Act further defining \u2018Vietnam veteran\u2019.\u201d However, \u201cit is settled that plain words in the text of a statute are not to be cut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>down by its title.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>330 Mass. 291, 293 (1953).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">2. The petitioner next contends that even if he cannot satisfy the \u201cactive service\u201d requirement of the first paragraph of clause Forty-third, he is excused from that requirement by reason of his having been awarded a service-connected disability. He relies for this proposition on the proviso in subparagraph <em>(b) </em>of that paragraph, whereby \u201cany person who so served in wartime and was awarded a service-connected disability ... shall be deemed to be a veteran notwithstanding his failure to <em>complete </em>ninety days of active service\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In our view this is a strained interpretation at best. \u201cFailure to complete\u201d is not, as the petitioner seems to believe, synonymous with \u201cfailure to begin,\u201d but implies instead that the thing not completed has already been begun. The use of that expression in the proviso was obviously designed to cover the case of the person whose active service was cut short; we do not believe that it was intended to apply to the person who performed no \u201cactive service\u201d whatever. This conclusion is borne out by the terms of the \u201cwartime service\u201d requirement earlier in the same paragraph: \u201cninety days active service, at least one day of which was for wartime service.\u201d The Legislature has thus required that the minimum of one day of <em>wartime </em>service coincide with a day of <em>active </em>service. The proviso relied upon by the petitioner applies only to a person \u201cwho <em>so </em>served in wartime\u201d (emphasis supplied). For these reasons the petitioner cannot avail himself of the proviso to qualify as a \u201cveteran.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>3. The petitioner\u2019s final contention is that his exclusion from the scope of the veterans\u2019 preference law would deny him the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and would deny him similar rights guaranteed by arts. 1 and 10 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. There is no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Clearly the Legislature may afford some classes of veterans a greater preference than others. See <em>Hutcheson </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Service, </em>361 Mass. 480,485-487 (1972). We think it equally clear that the Legislature may provide a lesser preference or no preference at all for some classes of persons who have performed military duties, provided that the classification is not arbitrary or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">With regard to the petitioner\u2019s history as a reservist in 1965, we perceive nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in the distinction the Legislature has drawn between a person whose military career (but for an illness requiring hospitalization) was confined to participation in a two-week training program on the one hand, and a person whose military commitment extended over a far more substantial period of time and included accomplishment of the objects for which those training programs were conducted, on the other. See <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Civil Service, </em>281 Mass. 376 (1933); <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>342 Mass. 67 (1961). What has been said applies as well to the petitioner\u2019s annual two-week training duty in the army national guard prior to 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">As to the petitioner\u2019s six months of \u201cactive duty\u201d in the army national guard in 1961, he concedes in his brief that it was \u201cfor training\u201d and within the exclusion contained in the last paragraph of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Forty-third, but the record discloses nothing further about the nature of that duty and affords no factual basis for comparing it with the type of military duty which qualifies as \u201cactive service\u201d under clause Forty-third. On this record we cannot say that the Legislature was arbitrary or unreasonable in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>veterans\u2019 preference to persons performing \u201cactive duty for training in the army national guard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing petition affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-6\"> Forty-third, \u201cVeteran\u201d shall mean any person, male or female, including a nurse, (a) whose last discharge or release from his wartime service, as defined herein, was under honorable
