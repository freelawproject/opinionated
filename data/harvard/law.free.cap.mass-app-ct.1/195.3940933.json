The jury returned a verdict of guilty of \u201cinvoluntary manslaughter.\u201d The case is before us on the defendant\u2019s appeal under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. Error is alleged in permitting the assistant district attorney to pursue an improper line of questioning, in refusing to set aside the verdict, and in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">There was evidence from which the jury could have found the following facts. On the afternoon of December 25,1970, between noon and 1:00 p.m., the defendant was in his apartment drinking beer with one Dorothy Thurston and a man called Russell. About two hours later, the defendant\u2019s wife and son arrived at the apartment. In the presence of the defendant, his wife, and his son, Dorothy Thurston made an accusation against the defendant. The defendant then began to beat her. She left the apartment. As she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>leaving the housing project in which the defendant lived, she met two men named Hayes and Lynch who were entering the same building. Both Hayes and Lynch were intoxicated. Following a conversation among the three of them, they went to the defendant\u2019s apartment where Lynch began knocking on the defendant\u2019s door while Hayes was at the window outside the apartment. The defendant opened the door and then shut it. After getting a knife from the kitchen, the defendant reopened the door and thrust the knife out, hitting Lynch in the chest. Lynch never entered the apartment. There was conflicting testimony as to whether Hayes or Lynch was carrying a certain sword or a metal pipe, or both, at this time. Following this incident, at about 4:00 p.m., a police officer was summoned. In the hallway, he found Lynch lying unconscious on his back with blood on his shirt. He also saw Hayes, holding a sword and a metal pipe, banging on the door to the defendant\u2019s apartment. Hayes was then taken into custody, and Lynch was taken to the hospital, where he died. The defendant and his family were not in the apartment at this time, having left earlier for dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">At about 7:00 p.m. the same day, the defendant and his family returned to the apartment. The defendant was then placed under arrest and the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were read to him. At the trial, a voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s statements to the police made at the apartment following the arrest. Sergeant O\u2019Laughlin testified that the defendant was drunk when questioned at his apartment but that he said he understood the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. He testified that the defendant told him he stabbed someone with a certain knife which the defendant pointed to in the kitchen. Later, after being taken to the police station, the defendant was again interrogated for a period of five minutes. On the defendant\u2019s oral motion, the judge ruled that the statements made by the defendant to the police at the apartment were to be excluded because the defendant did not have an opportunity to make an intelligent judgment on the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The judge made no ruling suppressing the defendant\u2019s statement at the police station. No exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>was taken to this, nor was it brought to the judge\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">On direct and cross-examination, the defendant testified in detail concerning the incident in question and the subsequent dinner with his family. At the end of the cross-examination, the assistant district attorney asked the defendent, \u201cDid you ever tell anybody on Christmas Day about seeing the sword and the pipe other than your wife?\u201d Counsel for the defendant objected, and the judge ruled that the question should be \u201cmore specific.\u201d The assistant district attorney then asked, \u201cAfter Lynch got stabbed on Christmas Day, did you ever tell anybody about a sword or this pipe?\u201d Counsel for the defendant objected. The judge excluded the question. The defendant answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and the answer was stricken. The following then occurred: The assistant district attorney: \u201cYou remember going down to the police station?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">The assistant district attorney: \u201cYou remember talking to the officers?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">The assistant district attorney: \u201cDo you remember what you told the officers?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">The judge: \u201cYes orno?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">The witness: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">The assistant district attorney: \u201cYou can\u2019t remember that, right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-13\">The witness: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-14\">The assistant district attorney: \u201cBut you can remember all the other details?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-15\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-16\">Counsel for the defendant: \u201cObjection to the entire line of questioning, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-17\">The objection was overruled, and the defendant took an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-18\">The defendant now urges that this line of questioning pursued by the assistant district attorney was in violation of his right against self-incrimination. He argues that this line of questioning raised an inference in the minds of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>jurors that the defendant had failed to mention these weapons in his statement to the police in his apartment after the incident. Since the statement to the police was excluded on voir dire as not being the product of an intelligent understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the defendant argues that the indirect reference to that statement in cross-examination was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We are not certain which questions the defendant referred to when he objected to the \u201centire line of questioning.\u201d The first two questions related to the defendant\u2019s argument were not allowed. On the first, the assistant district attorney was directed to be \u201cmore specific\u201d and the second question was excluded and the answer was struck. The defendant argues, however, that notwithstanding the judge\u2019s exclusion, the mere asking of these questions, in the jury\u2019s presence, raises a prejudicial inference that the defendant failed to mention the weapons to the police. The defendant did not move for a mistrial. Moreover, we are not persuaded that such an inference was necessarily raised by these questions. The two questions literally sought to ascertain if the defendant had told anyone, other than his wife, about a certain sword and pipe. The alleged inference underlying these questions, even in light of the subsequent questions, is not so conspicuous as to require a finding of prejudice by this court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Marsh, 354 Mass. 713, 719-720. Cf. <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>375 U. S. 85, 91; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U. S. 415, 416-417.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The remaining questions were not objected to individually, but a general objection was entered to the entire line of questioning following these questions. The defendant\u2019s assignment of errors brings nothing to this court since it is not based on a valid exception. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>345 Mass. 251, 255-256. \u201cThe rule generally prevailing in this Commonwealth is that objections to matters of evidence must be seasonably made and exceptions taken when the evidence is offered .. ..\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Theberge, </em>330 Mass. 520, 527. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geagan, </em>339 Mass. 487, 513. It is also significant that these remaining questions very clearly referred to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>statement at the police station which had not been suppressed by the judge following the voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The defendant argues that his motion for a new trial and to set aside the verdict should not have been denied because the verdict of \u201cinvoluntary manslaughter\u201d was inconsistent with the evidence and the charge. The statute under which the defendant was convicted only provides the punishment for manslaughter. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13. It is the common law, not the statute, which defines the crime of manslaughter and distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter may be characterized as \u201can unlawful homicide, unintentionally caused ... by an act which constitutes such a disregard of probable harmful consequences to another as to constitute wanton or reckless conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>352 Mass. 387, 397. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 396-401. It is to be distinguished from voluntary manslaughter, which is characterized by a real design and purpose to kill, but without malice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lussier, </em>333 Mass. 83, 92. There was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant was guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The jury could have concluded from the defendant\u2019s testimony that the killing was unintentional. It could have found that the defendant was brandishing a knife and that when he opened the apartment door he thrust the knife recklessly and in wanton disregard of the consequences to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s charge limited the jury\u2019s consideration to the theory of voluntary manslaughter and that a verdict of involuntary manslaughter indicates that the jury misunderstood the nature of their finding. In determining the propriety of the charge, the charge must be considered in its entirety. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>357 Mass. 333, 342. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>323 Mass. 406, 416. So considered, we conclude that the judge\u2019s charge, to which no exception was taken, adequately defined and illustrated the elements of both voluntary and involuntary manslaughter and satisfactorily apprised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the jury of their collective responsibility on the exculpatory effect of the defendant\u2019s claim of self defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
