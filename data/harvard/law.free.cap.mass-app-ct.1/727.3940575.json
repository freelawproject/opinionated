Before sentence was imposed the defendant pleaded guilty to another indictment charging breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny. On May 5, 1970, the defendant, represented by new counsel, filed a motion for a new trial on the first three of the above described indictments and a motion for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty on the fourth. After a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the motions were denied; the cases are before us on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to those denials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The defendant argues that the motions should have been granted because of an impermissibly suggestive pretrial confrontation between the defendant and the rape victim (which took place at a police station) and because the Commonwealth did not establish \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d the independence of the victim\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant. We do not agree. The judge made and filed detailed findings, fully supported by the evidence, which reflect his careful consideration of the factors to be considered in determining the independence of an in-court identification from impermissibly suggestive pretrial procedures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge found that on September 5, 1968, the victim was being taken by the police to the Municipal Court of the Roxbury District to identify the defendant. On their way to the court house they stopped at the police station to pick up another officer. While the victim was standing in the hallway talking to the officer she observed the defendant coming up a stairway with two other officers. She recognized the defendant as her assailant and so informed the police officers. The trial judge found that \u201cthe victim at no time had any knowledge that the one suspected of raping her was then in the police station,\u201d that the confrontation \u201cwas purely happen-chance and was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>pre-arranged,\u201d and that the confrontation \u201cwas not sufficiently suggestive to affect her in-court identification.\u201d Findings such as these based on conflicting evidence are ordinarily conclusive. There was no error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambra, </em>357 Mass. 260, 262-263 (1970). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leaster, </em>362 Mass. 407, 410-411 (1972). <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>453 F. 2d 970 ,974 (1st Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Under the circumstances presented here, the <em>per se </em>exclusionary rule established in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218 (1967), and in <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U. S. 263 (1967), is inapplicable because (1) the confrontation was found to be accidental and (2) the confrontation occurred well before \u201cthe onset of formal prosecutorial proceedings.\u201d <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U. S. 682, 690 (1972). Accordingly, evidence of the identification made at the confrontation is admissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leaster, </em>supra, at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The judge further found that \u201cthe victim had more than adequate opportunity to observe the Defendant [during the commission of the crimes] and had ample capacity to remember what she observed.\u201d He also found \u201c[t]hat the victim\u2019s in-court identification was based not on the confrontation at the police station but rather on her observations of the Defendant at the time of the rape\u201d and \u201c[tjhat the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim\u2019s in-court identification of the Defendant was independent of the chance meeting of the Defendant at the police station.\u201d Thus, even if we were to assume that the confrontation was other than accidental, we are of the opinion that the independence of the victim\u2019s in-court identification was clearly demonstrated. <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U. S. 188, 193-201 (1972). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cefalo, </em>357 Mass. 255, 257-258 (1970). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henley, ante, </em>564, 566-567 (1973). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cofield, ante, </em>660, 666-667 (1974).

They were remanded to the Superior Court after the motions were filed to permit that court to take action on those motions. After hearing the motions were denied, and the defendant\u2019s exceptions were recorded. On November 3,1971, the cases were again remanded to the Superior Court to enable the Commonwealth to have included in the record findings of fact relative to the motions. At the request of the defendant a further evidentiary; hearing was held on April 20,1972. On May 10, 1972, the judge\u2019s written findings of fact were filed. The cases were subsequently transferred to this court pursuant to G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 12, on October 1,1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-6\"> In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.
