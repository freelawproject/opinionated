The trial judge declined to order a conveyance of the real estate to the plaintiff but did enter a decree awarding the plaintiff $20,641 for sums he had contributed toward the purchase of the real estate and monies he had advanced for mortgage payments and taxes. Both parties appealed. The trial judge adopted as a report of material facts the findings of fact made in his \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order for Decree.\u201d The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">The property was purchased on May 29, 1969, and conveyed by the seller to the defendant. The purchase price was $40,000, of which $30,000 was paid from the proceeds of a mortgage of the property given by the defendant to a bank; the remainder was furnished by the plaintiff. After title was passed, the mortgage and tax payments also came from the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">To counter the plaintiffs contention that the defendant took title on the plaintiffs behalf and that a resulting trust arose for his benefit, the defendant sought to prove that she had bought the property for her own benefit and had subsequently agreed orally with the plaintiff to sell it to him for $60,000. She testified that the monies advanced by the plaintiff prior to the agreement had been owed to her in connection with other matters. She also raised the defense of \u201cunclean hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">The trial judge found as matter of fact that the defendant\u2019s version of the arrangement was untrue; that the plaintiff and the defendant \u201cdid enter into an oral agreement whereby the [defendant] was to take title to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>property for and in behalf of the [plaintiff] with the understanding that the [defendant] would reconvey to the [plaintiff] or his nominee upon the assumption of the mortgage by the [plaintiff] ... [and] [t]hat the [plaintiff] and the [defendant] agreed that the latter would obtain a purchase money mortgage in the amount of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) which the [defendant] did obtain and became personally indebted thereby. A part of the agreement was that the [plaintiff] held himself responsible for the mortgage payments until such time as he was financially able ... [to pay] the entire mortgage and discharg[e] it.\u201d At the hearing the plaintiff \u201cconceded that he did not take title in his own name because he did not want his wife to reach the property for her support... [and] that he was having tax trouble with the Internal Revenue Service, and that he wanted to avoid an Internal Revenue Service lien on the property ....\u201d The trial judge found that the parties \u201cwere fully aware of [plaintiffs] purpose of circumventing the interests of his wife and the Internal Revenue Service as stated above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">On the basis of these findings of fact, we hold (contrary to the trial judge\u2019s rulings of law) that (1) the plaintiff established a resulting trust of the real estate in question and (2) he is not barred by the clean hands doctrine from compelling a conveyance by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">1. On the facts found by the trial judge, a resulting trust arose as a matter of law \u201cwithin the well recognized principle of equity jurisprudence, that where one buys and pays for real estate, but the conveyance of the title is to another, a trust results in favor of the one who pays the consideration....\u201d <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>199 Mass. 598, 600 (1908). Restatement 2d: Trusts, \u00a7 440, p. 393. This is so although \u201cthe consideration paid was not out of funds on hand by the original <em>cestui que trust </em>but from the proceeds of money borrowed by him even from the trustee. . ..\u201d <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Howe, supra, </em>at 601. Here the purchase price was furnished in part directly by the plaintiff and in part from proceeds of a mortgage of the property in question given by the defendant to the bank, the plaintiff agreeing, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>trial judge found, to hold \u201chimself responsible for the mortgage payments.\u201d The defendant\u2019s obligation to the bank was thus, in effect, a loan of credit to the plaintiff, the actual purchaser. The transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant stands no differently from a loan of money from the defendant (the grantee of the record title) to the plaintiff, on whose behalf the defendant took title, to enable the plaintiff to pay the purchase price. <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>O\u2019Niel, </em>113 Mass. 92, 95 (1873). <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>199 Mass. 598, 601 (1908). <em>Gerace </em>v. <em>Gerace, </em>301 Mass. 14, 16 (1938). <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Curtin, </em>325 Mass. 123, 125 (1949). Bogert, Trusts and Trustees (2d ed.) \u00a7 455, p. 532. It is essentially the same as a purchase money mortgage given to a seller by a grantee of the record title whom the beneficial owner agrees to exonerate. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Downer, </em>210 Mass. 573, 575 (1912). <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commercial Trust Co. </em>276 Mass. 508, 517 (1931). <em>Gerace </em>v. <em>Gerace, </em>301 Mass. 14, 18 (1938). <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>339 Mass. 195, 201-202 (1959). <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Venuti, </em>346 Mass. 780 (1964). Scott, Trusts (3d ed.) \u00a7 456.2, p. 3391. Restatement 2d: Trusts, \u00a7 456, comment d, p. 428 andillus. 4. Cf. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Markey, </em>321 Mass. 87, 89 (1947). From the findings of the trial judge, fully supported by the evidence, it appears, as the Supreme Judicial Court said in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commercial Trust Co. </em>276 Mass. 508, 517 (1931), \u201cthat the purchase was entirely financed by the ... [plaintiff], that expenditures for the acquisition and maintenance of the property were all made from money belonging or credit lent to the ... [plaintiff]. Such a situation gives rise to a resulting trust.\u201d The plaintiff therefore was entitled to a conveyance, subject however to the defendant\u2019s protection against the risk of loss. Scott, Trusts (3d ed.) \u00a7 456.2, p. 3393. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees (2d ed.) \u00a7 455, p. 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">2. The clean hands doctrine does not bar the plaintiffs recovery in this case. It is true, as the trial judge found, that the plaintiff conceded he was motivated in this transaction by a desire to keep the property out of the reach of his wife and to avoid a tax lien. But the motivation was immaterial to the establishment of the resulting trust; that arose as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>matter of law on the operative facts proved by the plaintiff. And these did not include an express agreement like that on which the plaintiff in <em>Caines </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>248 Mass. 368, 374 (1924) (cited by the defendant) had to rely in order to prove that his gratuitous transfer to the defendant, absolute on its face and therefore presumptively a gift (Scott, Trusts [3d ed.] \u00a7 405, p. 3219; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Lynde, </em>114 Mass. 366 [1874]), was subject to an express trust embodied in that agreement. The distinction is explained in <em>Bohaker </em>v. <em>Koudelka, </em>333 Mass. 139, 142-143 (1955), in which it was argued that \u201cthe petitioner [wa]s not entitled to relief because the conveyance to the testatrix was a fraud on his legal wife, Lulu, and hence he d[id] not come into court with clean hands.\u201d The court said (p. 143): \u201cIt is true that the judge found that the petitioner caused the property to be conveyed to the testatrix to keep the land free from any claim or interference by Lulu. We assume that as to her the conveyance was fraudulent. . . . However, since no rights of Lulu are involved in this suit, the petitioner can prevail if he can make out his case without reference to the fraudulent elements in the facts. <em>Lufkin </em>v. <em>Jakeman, </em>188 Mass. 528, 531-533. <em>O\u2019Gasapian </em>v. <em>Danielson, </em>284 Mass. 27, 34. <em>Charest </em>v. <em>St. Onge, </em>332 Mass. 628, 635. In his petition he averred that he paid the entire consideration for the property and caused title to be taken in the name of the testatrix. By proof of these averments, without more, he established his case. The petitioner is not attempting to enforce an express agreement which discloses on its face the fraud in the transaction as in <em>Caines </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>248 Mass. 368, 374, on which the respondent relies.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court further cited <em>Gerace </em>v. <em>Gerace, </em>301 Mass. 14 (1938), as being \u201cto the same effect.\u201d In that case, as in this, the plaintiff proved a loan of credit; the master\u2019s findings also established that he was bankrupt and that his motive in taking title in another\u2019s name was to avoid creditors. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>court said (p. 19), \u201cHe made no conveyance of property in fraud of creditors which he is seeking to avoid, so that cases like <em>Verne </em>v. <em>Shute, </em>232 Mass. 397, <em>Dunne </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>234 Mass. 332, and <em>Caines </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>248 Mass. 368, do not apply. If we assume that the plaintiffs purpose was fraudulent as to creditors, nevertheless, where, as here, he can show a <em>prima facie </em>right to the establishment of a resulting trust in the property purchased, without developing the alleged fraud in the transaction, the court will not permit the defendants to set up a fraud against third persons as a defence.\u201d See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commercial Trust Co. </em>276 Mass. 508, 518 (1931) (also involving a loan of credit and a resulting trust which the court recognized as binding on the parties, although motivated by a desire to circumvent a statutory restriction on bank holdings); <em>Lufkin </em>v. <em>Jakeman, </em>188 Mass. 528, 532 (1905) (in which the court answered in the negative the question \u201cwhether a common. transaction, the legal effect of which as between themselves is plain, shall lose its character in any particular because one of the parties, in making the arrangement, acted, with the knowledge of the other, from a motive which was fraudulent as against a third person\u201d); <em>Magee </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>233 Mass. 341, 346 (1919); <em>Charest </em>v. <em>St. Onge, </em>332 Mass. 628, 635 (1955) .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The defendant in her brief treats the plaintiffs motive to avoid a lien by the Internal Revenue Service on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>footing as his desire to keep the property out of his wife\u2019s reach. The trial judge also makes no distinction between the two in his rulings of law. This is in accord with <em>Kerwin </em>v. <em>Donaghy, </em>317 Mass. 559 (1945), in which property was placed in the defendant\u2019s name by her father. \u201cHis purpose was to defraud the Federal government by pretending to divide his income so as to avoid large surtaxes\u201d (p. 562). The court said (p. 573), \u201cEven if the actually innocent wife could be affected by the fraudulent purpose of her late husband in holding those stocks in the name of his daughter Gladys, the wife has made out her case without reliance upon any fraud [citing cases].\u201d See <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>77 Vt. 133, 140-142 (1904), cited in <em>Gerace </em>v. <em>Gerace, </em>301 Mass. 14, 19 (1938) and <em>Rugo </em>v. <em>Rugo, </em>325 Mass. 612, 619 (1950), in which a resulting trust was enforced despite the defense of unclean hands by a plaintiff who had taken mortgages in his son\u2019s name; his purpose was to avoid local taxation on the mortgages which, as the dissent pointed out, subjected him to \u201ca heavy penalty under V. S. 414 . . ..\u201d (p. 150) However, the majority made no reference to the illegality and discussed the unclean hands defense only in terms of \u201cfraud\u201d (p. 142). See also <em>Rudolph </em>v. <em>Gersten, </em>100 Ill. App. 2d 253, 267-270 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">This court will not give its aid to the consummation of an illegal transaction. See <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>329 Mass. 291 (1952), in which the court refused to recognize a conveyance, made pursuant to a trust, the effect of which was to permit the mother of a veteran to obtain veterans\u2019 benefits in violation of the servicemen\u2019s readjustment act. See also <em>Fouquette </em>v. <em>Millette, </em>310 Mass. 351, 354 (1941). Cf. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commercial Trust Co. </em>276 Mass. 508, 518 (1931); <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. R. </em>v. <em>Pierce Coach Lines, Inc. </em>281 Mass. 479, 482 (1933); <em>Braga </em>v. <em>Braga, </em>314 Mass. 666, 673 (1943); <em>Scola </em>v. <em>Scola, </em>318 Mass. 1, 8-9 (1945). Contra, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>321 U. S. 383,392-393 (1944), in which the court in the circumstances rejected the contention that an injunction would facilitate a violation of law and held that even if that were the case (which was doubtful) \u201cfederal agencies exist which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>charged with responsibilities to institute appropriate proceedings ... in federal tribunals.\u201d Justice Frankfurter dissented stating (p. 402): \u201cBut where the relief sought is not as to something past and collateral, but where it is the very means ... for completing an outlawed transaction, a court of equity should withhold its aid and not become the promoter of wrongdoing. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In this case the rejection of the unclean hands defense finds support in both the majority and minority opinions in <em>the Johnson </em>case. Here the plaintiff \u201cdoes not seek the aid of the court in the execution of the fraudulent scheme.\u201d <em>Paula </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>304 Mass. 450, 451 (1939), quoting <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>228 Mass. 565, 568 (1917). Indeed, it does not appear that the Internal Revenue Service was in any way defrauded or hindered <em>(Carll </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>148 Mass. 32 [1888]; see <em>Magee </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>233 Mass. 341, 346 [1919]; Scott, Trusts, [3d ed.] \u00a7 444, p. 3353) or that the plaintiff was otherwise incapable of meeting his tax obligations. <em>Cram </em>v. <em>Cram, </em>262 Mass. 509, 512 (1928). See <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Varney, </em>98 Mass. 118, 120 (1867). A conveyance to the plaintiff of this property may help rather than hinder whatever claims the Internal Revenue Service may have.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The decree is reversed and a new decree is to be entered ordering the defendant, in whatever capacity she holds the real estate in question,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to convey it by a good and sufficient quitclaim deed on condition that the plaintiff obtain and deliver to the defendant a discharge of the note and mortgage under which the defendant is obligated to the bank (see <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>339 Mass. 195, 202 [1959]; Scott, Trusts [3d ed.] \u00a7 456.2, p. 3392). The decree shall also provide that the defendant individually shall pay to the plaintiff the sum of $2,216.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-5\"> The court apparently did not think it significant that the record in that case (as in this case) showed that the plaintiffs motive to defraud his wife was first elicited on direct examination by his attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b574-6\"> The rule in these cases that a resulting trust, though intended to defraud creditors, will be enforced as between the parties is a minority view. See Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed.) \u00a7 401a, n. 20, p. 110. Any difference in treatment in this respect between an express trust imposed on a gratuitous conveyance by agreement and a resulting trust arising by operation of law has been criticized by Professor Scott who is of the opinion that the only \u201cquestion is whether the policy against permitting the unjust enrichment of B [the transferee] is outweighed by the policy against assisting a wrongdoer.\u201d Scott, Trusts (3d ed.) \u00a7 444, p. 3354; see \u00a7 63, p. 625, \u00a7 422.5, p. 3269; Restatement 2d: Trusts, \u00a7 422, comment f, p. 366; Bogert, Trusts and Trustees (2d ed.) \u00a7 463, pp. 638-639. See Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 1460, 1464. But express trusts have also been enforced, though in fraud of creditors when \u201c[n]o fraud was practised upon ... [the defendant;] she cannot rely upon the alleged attempt... to defraud a third person.\u201d <em>Zak </em>v. <em>Zak, </em>305 Mass. 194,196 <em>(1940). Levy </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>309 Mass. 486, 491 (1941). Cf. <em>Kavanaugh </em>v. <em>Kavanaugh, </em>279 Mass. 238, 240 (1932).
