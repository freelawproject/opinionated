G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 ID, as amended. The case is before us on the reported evidence (which consists of various documents and oral stipulations of counsel), the judge\u2019s order, and the writ (which was stayed pending appeal). We decide the case on our own judgment <em>(Iverson </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Dedham, </em>354 Mass. 688,689).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">At the time the petitioner filed the application in question the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 II A, III Dl and III B7 of the by-law were such that the board, in the exercise of its judgment, could have granted the petitioner a special permit for the construction of a multiple dwelling complex in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 V FI and V F2 of the by-law. Among the requirements of \u00a7 V FI was one that an applicant file a properly prepared site plan which would show, among other things, the topography of his land and proposed features of the types referred to in paragraphs 1 through 7 and 10 of Appendix B to this opinion. Section V FI contained further requirements: that the board immediately forward a copy of such plan to the planning board of the town; that both boards consider, among other things, all the features referred to in paragraphs 1 through 10 of Appendix B; that the planning board should report its recommendations in writing to the board of appeals, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>such report to become part of the official record of the public hearing to be held by the latter board; that the recommendations of the planning board \u201cshall not be binding\u201d on the board of appeals; that the board of appeals should either approve or disapprove an application within thirty days of the public hearing; and that \u201c[i]f the application is disapproved, the reasons for disapproval shall be listed with appropriate recommendations for correction of deficiencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The petitioner\u2019s application for a special permit to construct a multiple dwelling complex of sixty-nine units and some form of plan (which is not before us) were filed with the board of appeals on August 3, 1970. That board sent a copy of the plan to the planning board, which, by its written report dated September 14, 1970, recommended that the board of appeals not approve the petitioner\u2019s plan. That report stated five respects in which the planning board considered that the plan failed to supply information required by \u00a7 V F of the by-law and identified eight respects in which it believed the plan should be modified or supplemented. The planning board asked that its comments be incorporated in any decision the board of appeals might make and that it be given an opportunity to review any changes which might be made in the petitioner\u2019s plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">On September 15, 1970, the board of appeals held a public hearing on the petitioner\u2019s application which met all the procedural requirements of notice and hearing set out in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 17 and 18, as then in effect. The planning board\u2019s report was incorporated into the record of the hearing, and opposition to the application was recorded. On November 3,1970, the board of appeals rendered the decision which is set out in full in Appendix A to this opinion and under which no permit was issued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A copy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>that decision was filed with the town clerk on November 17, 1970.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The petitioner did not appeal to the Superior Court within twenty days orto a District Court within twenty-one days of November 17, 1970, as permitted by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, as amended through St. 1969, c. 706.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On December 1, 1970, which was prior to the expiration of either of the foregoing appeal periods, the board took the action set out in Appendix B to this opinion and which, for the sake of convenience, we shall sometimes refer to as the amended decision. The ten numbered paragraphs of that decision represent a summary of the more salient objections of the planning board as set out in that board\u2019s report of September 14, 1970, to the board of appeals. The amended decision was rendered without prior compliance with any of the requirements of notice or hearing then found in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 17 and 18. It does not appear that the amended decision was made part of the record of the hearing held on September 15, 1970. We do not know who was notified of the amended decision, or when (see fn. 3 this opinion), except by the filing of a copy of the decision with the town clerk on January 25,1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">On January 25, 1971, the petitioner filed with the board of appeals a revised plan of a multiple dwelling complex which is before us and which the petitioner claims meets all the requirements of the amended decision. At some undisclosed point in time a copy of that plan was transmitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the planning board. At a town meeting held in February or March of 1971 the town voted to change the zoning of the petitioner\u2019s land in such fashion as no longer to permit the use of that land for a multiple dwelling complex.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 13, 1971, the planning board wrote the board of appeals advising it that the petitioner\u2019s revised plan met the technical requirements of the amended decision of the board of appeals and had been approved by the planning board, and calling the attention of the board of appeals to the fact that the revised plan called for the construction of fifty-eight dwelling units rather than the sixty-nine units originally proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">At some following point in time the petitioner requested the board of appeals to issue him a special permit in accordance with the amended decision. By letter to the petitioner dated August 20, 1971, the board replied that it had been advised by town counsel to the effect that its original decision of November 3, 1970, was a final and appealable decision, that it had \u201clost all jurisdiction of the case\u201d when it filed its original decision on November 17, 1970, and that the \u201cpurported amendment\u201d of December 1, 1970, was of \u201cno legal force or effect.\u201d The board suggested to the petitioner that he file anew application.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Instead, the petitioner filed the present petition for a writ of mandamus on November 19,1971. The writ commanded the board \u201cto determine if the revised plan of the petitioner contains the additional information required by the [b]card\u2019s amended decision of December 1, 1970, .. . and ... on the basis of such a determination, to issue a certificate either granting or denying the requested permit.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">We are of opinion that the board\u2019s original decision of November 3, 1970, must be construed as a final decision denying the petitioner\u2019s application for a special permit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>that the petitioner can derive no assistance from the amended decision of December 1, 1970, and that the petitioner is barred from seeking relief by mandamus because of his failure to pursue the exclusive remedy of judicial review accorded him by the provisions of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">1. The public hearing was held and concluded on September 15, 1970, at which time the board took the case under advisement. There is nothing in the original decision (Appendix A) to suggest that the board intended to hold a further public hearing or to keep the proceedings open in any other manner in order to give the petitioner an opportunity to submit a plan which might or might not meet with the approval of the planning board. The board twice referred to its action as a \u201cdecision\u201d and on three occasions employed a variation of the word \u201cvote\u201d in characterizing the action which it said it took. The filing of the decision with the town clerk was inconsistent with a notion that the decision was to have anything other than present effect as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We construe the original decision as a present and unqualified denial of the petitioner\u2019s application for a special permit. The board\u2019s feeling that \u201cin order to preserve the purpose and intent of the [by-law], the recommendations of the [pjlanning [bjoard should be met\u201d was intended both as an expression of the board\u2019s agreement with the recommendations of the planning board and as the statement of the board\u2019s \u201creasons\u201d required by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 18 (see fn. 3 this opinion) for reaching the conclusion that \u201c [r] elief may not be granted without substantial detriment to the public good\u201d which was implemented by the tandem authorization and vote \u201cto not grant\u201d a permit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Placed as they are in this context, the words \u201cvoted to disapprove the application until revised plans are submitted to the [p]lanning [bjoard and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>[planning [b]oard recommendations and approval are obtained\u201d are of significance only to the extent that they reflect an effort by the board to comply with the requirement of \u00a7 V Fl of the by-law that \u201c[i]f the application is disapproved, the reasons for disapproval shall be listed with appropriate recommendations for correction of deficiencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">To say, as the petitioner almost suggests, that the language just quoted should be read as an expression of present intention to issue a permit subject to a limitation that the planning board approve a revised plan in the future, and without further consideration by the board of appeals, would lead us to either of two improper conclusions: namely, that the board of appeals intended an impermissible delegation of its authority to the planning board (see <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Planning Board of North Andover, </em>337 Mass. 648); or that the board of appeals intended to make a decision \u201cwhich partially commit[ted] it to the issuance of a permit\u201d based on a plan or on other evidence not before it. <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>345 Mass. 376, 379. Cf. <em>Shoppers\u2019 World, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beacon Terrace Realty, Inc. </em>353 Mass. 63, 68, 69-71; <em>Zartarian </em>v. <em>Minkin, </em>357 Mass. 14, 18-19. We cannot accept either conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">2. We turn to the amended decision (AppendixB).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">A board of appeals has inherent power to amend a decision by adopting and filing a statement of further reasons for its decision <em>(Dion </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Waltham, </em>344 Mass. 547, 550, 552-553) so long as no one entitled to notice of the original decision is prejudiced by a late filing of the amendment <em>(Shuman </em>v. <em>Board of Aldermen of Newton, </em>361 Mass. 758, 763, 764-765, 767-768) and so long as the amendment is within the scope of the original petition and does not change the result of the original <em>decision. Fish v. Building Inspector of Falmouth, </em>357 Mass. 774, 775.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The amendment in this case did \u201cclarify\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>original decision in the sense that the numbered paragraphs of the amendment specified the respects in which the board believed the petitioner\u2019s original plan was deficient in supplying the information required by \u00a7 V FI of the by-law and which the board was to consider in deciding whether to grant the petitioner\u2019s application. However, the amended decision cannot be given its intended effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">(a) . The vote \u201cto approve the application providing the applicant submits a revised plan which complies with\u201d certain requirements and the promise that the board \u201cwill issue a certificate granting a special permit... in accordance with said revised plan\u201d are wholly inconsistent with the original \u201cvote to not grant the [pjermit.\u201d We conclude that the amendment must be construed as a reversal of the original denial of the application (point 1 of this opinion) and thus as a change in the result of the original decision which is of a type forbidden by <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Falmouth, </em>357 Mass. 774.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">(b) . Having concluded that the second decision was ineffective as an amendment to the original decision, we must also conclude that it cannot stand on its own as an entirely new decision because of the board\u2019s failure further to comply with the notice and hearing requirements of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 17 and 18, following the filing of the original decision. <em>Planning Board of Peabody </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Peabody, </em>358 Mass. 81, 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">(c) . Prescinding from the foregoing difficulties, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the amended decision call for types of information which \u00a7 V FI of the by-law required be on the original plan and be considered by both the planning board and the board of appeals. The planning board\u2019s report of September 14, 1970, discloses that such information did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>not appear on the original plan. Paragraphs 3 and 4, as well as paragraphs 6 and 7, are peculiarly illustrative of sensitive areas in which the by-law required both boards to exercise independent judgment. By hypothesis, however, that judgment could not be brought to bear until such time as a revised plan should be submitted. For this reason we are forced to the conclusion that the amended decision was an invalid commitment by the board of appeals to issue a permit on the basis of a plan or other evidence not yet before it. See <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>345 Mass. 376, 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">3. Having failed to pursue the exclusive statutory course of review provided in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21 <em>(Lincoln </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Framingham, </em>346 Mass. 418, 420), with respect to the original decision of the board, the petitioner may not now seek relief by mandamus. <em>Codman </em>v. <em>Assessors of Westwood, </em>309 Mass. 433, 438 and cases cited. Cf. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Westport, </em>348 Mass. 515, 517-522.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The writ of mandamus is quashed, and the judgment is reversed. Judgment is to be entered dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AgF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"AOg5\">Town of Mansfield</p>\n<p id=\"AKn\">Zoning Board of Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"ATZ\">In Re: Application of Fireside Realty Trust</p>\n<p id=\"A0p\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"Aet_\">The Board of Appeals for the Town of Mansfield conducted a public hearing on the petition of Fireside Realty Trust of 254 Main Street, Walpole, for the granting of a Permit under Section V, Paragraph \u201cF\u201d of the Zoning By-Law. The hearing was held on the 15th day of September, 1970, in the Town Hall, Mansfield, Massachusetts at 8:25 p.m. Present at the hearing were the following members:</p>\n<p id=\"A9O\">Harry S. Cook, <em>Chairman</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFo\">Thomas A. Malay, <em>Clerk, Pro-tem</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqZJ\">Antonio Caponigro, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"AnV\">Fernand G. Bedard</p>\n<p id=\"aed-dedup-0\">Willard Roots, appointed as a voting member in the absence of Richard 0. Driscoll</p>\n<p id=\"ATx\">The petitioner filed his application on the 3rd day of August, 1970, with the Board of Appeals and requested a permit to construct a 69 unit multiple dwelling complex on a parcel of land located on the westerly side of Branch Street. The lot has a frontage of 648 feet with an area of 166,460 square feet in an Agricultural Zone. Due notice of this hearing was given by mail, postage prepaid, to all persons deemed to be affected thereby, as shown on the most recent tax list and also notice was given by publication in the Mansfield News, a newspaper published and circulated in said Mansfield, Massachusetts. An attested true copy of said notice was introduced as Exhibit \u201cA\u201d. Also introduced were the following: Application to the Board as Exhibit \u201cB\u201d; Plans of the complex as Exhibit \u201cC\u201d; Planning Board recommendations as Exhibit \u201cD\u201d. There was opposition recorded. At the conclusion of the hearing the Board took the case under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"AkS2\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"AuK\">On the 3rd day of November, 1970, the Board of Appeals, with all the aforenamed members present, felt that in order to preserve the purpose and intent of the Zoning By-Law, the recommendations of the Planning Board should be met. Relief may not be granted without substantial detriment to the public good. Therefore: all members present and voting, it was voted to disapprove the application until revised plans are submitted to the Planning Board and Planning Board recommendations and approval are obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"av-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The Building Inspector is hereby authorized to not grant a permit in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"A6S\">Board of Appeals of the</p>\n<p id=\"Avp\">Town of Mansfield</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq2\"><em>By: </em>Harry S.
