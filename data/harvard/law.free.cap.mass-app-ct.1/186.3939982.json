No objections were taken to the master\u2019s report, which was confirmed on motion of the plaintiff. A justice of the Superior Court entered a final decree dismissing the bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>complaint and the defendant\u2019s counterclaims. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The master found that when the plaintiff located its drive-in theatre many years ago it was the only occupier and user within many hundreds of feet, but that the neighborhood is now a highly developed commercial area located on a heavily traveled public way. He found that the other occupiers of this area are mainly commercial in nature, and are well lighted at night; that the defendant\u2019s use of lights in the evening is normal in the defendant\u2019s business and is only harmful to the plaintiffs business because of a drive-in theatre\u2019s unique high sensitivity to light; and that each party by incurring expenditure could take measures to alleviate the problem. There is no finding as to the relative cost of such measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The casting of light upon the property of another person may constitute a nuisance and be enjoined when it interferes with that person\u2019s reasonable and customary use and enjoyment of his property. <em>Nugent </em>v. <em>Melville Shoe Corp. </em>280 Mass. 469, 471-473. See, generally, Restatement: Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 822, 826-830. The master\u2019s subsidiary findings indicate, however, that the defendant\u2019s use of lights is not unreasonable in the highly commercial, heavily lighted neighborhood where the plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s businesses are located. \u201cThe character of the locality is a circumstance of great importance.\u201d <em>Kasper </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>291 Mass. 24, 27. There is no finding that the defendant\u2019s lights injuriously affect-ordinary users in the vicinity. Injury to a particular user of specially sensitive characteristics does not render the lights an actionable nuisance. <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>188 Mass. 6. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Rockport Granite Co. </em>216 Mass. 486, 488, 489. <em>Tortorella </em>v. <em>H. Traiser &amp; Co. Inc. </em>284 Mass. 497, 501. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Beverly Airways, Inc. </em>311 Mass. 628, 631. Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 822, comment g. See also <em>Amphitheaters, Inc. </em>v. <em>Portland Meadows, </em>184 Ore. 336, 5 ALR 2d 690. <em>Belmar Drive-In Theatre Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois State Toll Highway Commn. </em>34 Ill. 2d 544. \u201cThe plaintiff cannot, by devoting his own land to an unusually sensitive use, such as a drive-in motion picture theatre easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>affected by light, make a nuisance out of conduct of the adjoining defendant which would otherwise be harmless.\u201d Prosser, Torts (4th ed.) \u00a7 87, p. 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The plaintiff argues that, whether or not the defendant\u2019s use of lights was unreasonable with respect to other users in the vicinity, it was negligent for the defendant, knowing the peculiar sensitivity of the plaintiff to light, not to take precautions to avoid that harm in the installation of the lights. This argument assumes that the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the plaintiffs sensitivity to harm, without more, imposes a duty on the defendant to avoid a use of his property which will cause that harm. That is not the law. See <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>146 Mass. 349. On the basis of the master\u2019s findings, it does not appear that this defendant was under any duty to restrict his use of lights so as to accommodate the special sensitivity of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">There is no suggestion in the master\u2019s findings that the defendant\u2019s use of the lights is \u201cinspired solely [or even partly] by hostility and a desire to cause harm to the [plaintiff].\u201d Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
