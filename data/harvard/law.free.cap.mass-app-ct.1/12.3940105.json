The action is based on G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 66, as amended through St. 1959, c. 478, under which proof of negligence is not required. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 571,598.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">The case was submitted to a jury after the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was denied; the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The issue before us is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>sufficiency of the evidence. We deal with only one aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The plaintiff alleged and had the burden of establishing <em>(Ferris </em>v. <em>Grinnell, </em>353 Mass. 681, 683; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Quin-livan, </em>308 Mass. 339) that the Commissioner of Labor and Industries had determined the plaintiffs employment to be hazardous and therefore all \u201cemployees therein [were] .. . required to be covered . ...\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4) (c), as amended through St. 1960, c. 306. For this purpose there was introduced in evidence a publication entitled, \u201chazardous employments on all types of Construction Projects as determined by the Commissioner of the Department of Labor and Industries under the provisions of Paragraph (d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of Definition (4), of Section 1, of Chapter 152, of the General Laws, as amended by Chapter 680, of the Acts of 1956\u201d (underlining in original). This title is followed by a list which includes (among other occupations) \u201cLandscaper,\u201d \u201cCarpenter and Joiner\u201d and indented under the latter classification: \u201cFloor Layer Carpenter,\u201d \u201cShop <em>&amp; </em>Mill Carpenter,\u201d and \u201cWharf &amp; Bridge Carpenter.\u201d Each page of the list has a two-line caption: \u201cConstruction Projects\u201d and, directly below, \u201cHazardous Occupations.\u201d The document bears a date, January 11, 1957, and a notation that the publication was approved by the State Purchasing Agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">However, all that appears in the bill of exceptions as to the plaintiffs employment on the date when he was injured is his testimony that he was \u201c. . . working as a landscaper and carpenter, was walking on a steep bank next to a pond where there were some bushes and trees and he was going to get them cleaned up ....\u201d He slipped while cutting bushes. There is nothing in the bill of exceptions to indicate that the plaintiffs employment was in any way connected with a construction project as that term is ordinarily used. For this reason the defendant\u2019s exceptions must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">We are aware of <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, </em>345 Mass. 199, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>201, in which the plaintiff proved the requirement of coverage and retained a verdict in an action under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 66, on the basis of a document dated June 19,1961, in which the Commissioner of Labor and Industries certified that the occupation of carpenter was on January 11, 1957 (the date on the document introduced in this case), \u201cdetermined to be hazardous employment,\u201d and that such determination had \u201cbeen in effect since that date and ... [was] still in effect.\u201d In that case the plaintiff was a carpenter and was injured while fixing leaks on the roof of a house. The Commissioner\u2019s certification seems to have been accepted by both parties in lieu of the regulation which was apparently not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In this case the publication introduced in evidence does not purport to be the exact determination as made by the Commissioner of Labor and Industries and filed with the Secretary of State as a regulation pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 5 (see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (5) ).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The regulation itself is not before us, and we generally do not take judicial notice of administrative regulations. <em>Building Inspector of Wayland </em>v. <em>Ellen M. Gifford Sheltering Home Corp. </em>344 Mass. 281, 285. <em>Finlay </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Assn., Inc. </em>308 Mass. 20, 26-27. <em>Passanessi </em>v. <em>C. J. Money Co. Inc. </em>340 Mass. 599, 604. But see <em>Gentile, petitioner, </em>339 Mass. 319; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berney, </em>353 Mass. 571; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Minicost Car Rental, Inc. </em>354 Mass. 746. We are particularly reluctant to do so in this case since the defendant has not had an opportunity to litigate the applicability of the regulation itself, the meaning of which \u201cmight depend on the precise wording.\u201d <em>Passanessi v. C. J. Maney Co. Inc. </em>340 Mass. 599, 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">In deciding whether in our discretion to order judgment for the defendant or grant a new trial (G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 122;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Vallavanti </em>v. <em>Armour &amp; Co. </em>264 Mass. 337, 341-342) we have taken into consideration the history of the litigation and that it is questionable whether the plaintiff proved that his injury was connected with his employment at the Hanson camp. Under all the circumstances, judgment should be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In view of our decision, it is unnecessary to deal with the defendant\u2019s exception to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to hear the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground that the defendant had declined to waive his bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-12\"> The plaintiffs declaration originally entered on January 4, 1965, alleged an injury in Vermont on June 29, 1962. Subsequently on April 22, 1966, the declaration was amended by adding a second count alleging the injury at the Hanson camp. The case was transferred to the Third District Court of Plymouth on March 31,1967 (see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 102C, as amended through St. 1962, c. 305). There was a finding for the defendant, and the case was retransferred to the Superior Court. Prior to actual trial in the Superior Court, the plaintiff waived the count based on the Vermont injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b30-9\"> Redesignated \u201cc\u201d by St. 1960, c. 306.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b31-7\"> See 1962 Report of the Attorney General, page 54 (referring to the Commissioner of Labor and Industries, and his duties under G.
