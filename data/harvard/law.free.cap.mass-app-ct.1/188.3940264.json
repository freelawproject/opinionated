The answer of the defendant raises the defence that Mills\u2019 death did not occur as the result, directly and independently of all other causes, of bodily injuries effected solely through external, violent and accidental means. The defendant has paid the death benefits under the policies but has refused to pay the amount claimed to be due under the accidental death provisions because of the exclusionary provision in each policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to the provisions of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59, and in support of that motion filed an affidavit of a medical underwriter employed by the defendant. The pertinent parts of this affidavit are set out below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The plaintiff filed an affidavit in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion which affidavit included by reference the death certificate of John Mills. The motion for summary judgment was allowed by a Superior Court judge \u201cunless the plaintiff presents [a] proper counter affidavit.. . within twenty days.\u201d A second counter affidavit was filed and is set out below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The motion for summary judgment was thereafter allowed and the plaintiffs exception to the allowance is now before us. The only issue is whether the motion for summary judgment with its supporting affidavit and the plaintiffs counter affidavits meet the requirements of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We first turn our attention to the defendant\u2019s motion and its supporting affidavit. In order to be entitled to summary judgment, the moving party must affirmatively show that there is no real issue of fact. <em>Kesler </em>v. <em>Pritchard, </em>362 Mass. 132, 134. Section 59 requires that the affiants on affidavits supporting a motion for summary judgment have \u201cpersonal knowledge of admissible facts as to which it appears affirmatively that the affiants would be competent to testify.\u201d The only affidavit filed by the defendant bearing on the issue before us is the affidavit of William B. Merritt, the defendant\u2019s medical underwriter. (See fn. 2.) General Laws c. 46, \u00a7 19<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that the record of death shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>prima facie evidence of the facts recorded and that a certified copy of the record shall be admissible as evidence. See <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway Co. </em>309 Mass. 205, 213; <em>Rappe </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. </em>320 Mass. 376, 381-382; <em>Pahigian </em>v. <em>Manufacturers\u2019 Life Insurance Co. </em>349 Mass. 78, 85. The death certificate was prima facie evidence that the causes of Mills\u2019 death were \u201cAcute hepatic necrosis \u2014 Cirrhosis \u2014 Alcoholism \u2014 Thermal burns \u2014 Accidental clothing fire from stove at home \u2014 Boston \u20141-5-68.\u201d Merritt\u2019s affidavit also asserts the fact that cirrhosis is a disease. Thus, as the record then stood, a trier of fact would have been required to find that at least one disease was the cause of, or contributed to, Mills\u2019 death and that no genuine issue of material fact remained to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">We turn now to the question of the sufficiency of the counter affidavit (fn. 3). The statutory requirement that the opposing party (in this case the plaintiff) file an affidavit \u201con personal knowledge of admissible facts as to which it appears . . . that the affiants would be competent to testify,\u201d has not been satisfied. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59. The counter affidavit depends upon the expected testimony and facts within the knowledge of certain undisclosed experts and must, therefore, be treated under the alternative provision of the statute requiring the opposing party to file \u201can affidavit showing specifically and clearly reasonable grounds for believing that contradiction can be presented at the trial but cannot be furnished by affidavits.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59. The counter affidavit is deficient under this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In that affidavit, the plaintiffs counsel states that he intends and expects to prove, by expert testimony, that the sole cause of Mills\u2019 death was accidental burns. The affidavit is silent as to whether the plaintiff has consulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>with experts about the allegation. The counter affidavit, beyond this conclusory language, states neither the nature of the expected testimony nor the sources upon which it would be based. Under the facts of this case, we conclude that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate \u201cspecifically and clearly reasonable grounds for believing\u201d that she would be able to show contradiction at trial. See <em>Albre Marble &amp; Tile Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>John Bowen Co. Inc. </em>338 Mass. 394, 397. \u201cThe very object of a motion for summary judgment is to separate what is formal or pretended in denial or averment from what is genuine and substantial .. <em>..\u2019\u2019Doral Country Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>355 Mass. 27,30, quoting <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Credit Suisse, </em>242 N. Y. 346, 350. We conclude that there was no error in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\"> \u201cNo such Accidental Means Death Benefit shall be payable if the injury or death results (a) directly or indirectly from bodily or mental infirmity or disease, even though drowning or an injury contributed to the death or was the proximate or precipitating cause thereof; (b) directly or indirectly from medical or surgical treatment; (c) from suicide while sane or insane; or (d) from the voluntary or involuntary inhalation of carbon monoxide gas or of illuminating or fuel gas.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-12\"> \u201c1.
