The petitioner claimed that the taking would curtail its quarrying operations on the remaining portion of its land which contained two quarries of \u201cMilford Pink Granite.\u201d One (the Dodd quarry) was in operation at the time of the taking, May 17, 1967, and the other (the Norcross quarry) was inactive and had not been worked since at least 1930. The petitioner\u2019s exceptions relate solely to the admission and exclusion of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The respondent called a witness who testified that in 1963 he had bought a quarry (the Maguire quarry), not then in operation, about five miles from the petitioner\u2019s property and that this quarry had also contained \u201cMilford Pink Granite.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further testified that he had paid $10,000 for the Maguire quarry, with a right in the seller to take whatever loose stone was then on the premises. The petitioner contends that it was error to admit in evidence the purchase price of the Maguire quarry because it was not comparable to the petitioner\u2019s property and because the sale price was not sufficiently definite. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">The petitioner sets out in its brief a list of differences which, it contends, existed between the Dodd quarry and the Maguire quarry. The respondent sets out a list of similarities between the Maguire quarry and the Dodd quarry and between the Maguire quarry and the Norcross quarry. From our examination of the record we conclude that the trial judge was well within the broad scope of his discretion in determining, as he implicitly did, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>similarities between the Maguire quarry and the petitioner\u2019s property, particularly the inactive Norcross quarry,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were such that evidence of the sale of the Maguire quarry might be helpful to the jury. There was evidence that the Maguire property was about five miles from the petitioner\u2019s property; its purchase in 1963 was not too remote in time. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>240 Mass. 546,549 (1922). It was located within the same granite belt and contained \u201cMilford Pink Granite.\u201d See <em>H. E. Fletcher Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>350 Mass. 316, 325 (1966). Nor was it an abuse of discretion likewise to determine that the dissimilarities were not such that the jury, properly instructed (see <em>Valley Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Holyoke Housing Authy. </em>346 Mass. 561, 569 [1963]), would be misled or confused. <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>164 Mass. 99,105 (1895). <em>Iris </em>v. <em>Hingham, </em>303 Mass. 401, 408-409 (1939). <em>Congregation of the Mission of St. Vincent de Paul </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>336 Mass. 357, 359 (1957). See <em>H. E. Fletcher Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>350 Mass. 316, 324-325 (1966); <em>Nonni </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 264, 268-269 (1969); <em>Silk </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante, </em>149, 155 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The petitioner\u2019s argument in its brief that \u201cthe actual price [of the Maguire quarry] in the case at bar could not be accurately or definitely stated in money, nor was it\u201d is answered by the trial judge\u2019s statement in the course of denying the petitioner\u2019s motion to strike,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cthat the loose stone was already quarried.... [T]he deed contains noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ing in the way of encumbrance on the title and it would appear that the $10,000 price was the price that was paid for the real estate itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">He thus properly distinguished between the real estate for which $10,000 was paid and the loose stone, regarded as personalty, which the seller had reserved. Indeed, had the petitioner asked that the references to the loose stone be struck (see n. 3), it might well have been \u201ca wise exercise of discretion to exclude the value of the separable material as a \u2018confusing and ... speculative\u2019 factor in determining the market value of the property as real estate.\u201d <em>Joseph De Vries &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>339 Mass. 663, 664 (1959). <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>173 Mass. 100, 102-103 (1899). <em>Consolini </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>346 Mass. 501, 502 (1963). The petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Iris </em>v. <em>Hingham, </em>303 Mass. 401 (1939), is misplaced. In that case it was held error to admit the price of the allegedly comparable real estate because a ten-year interest reserved by the seller could not be valued except as a matter of opinion. That factor made the entire price of the real estate, in which the reservation was an element, also a matter of opinion and therefore inadmissible. <em>McCabe </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>265 Mass. 494 (1929). Here, the value of the loose stone formed no part of the price paid for the real estate as a source of quarriable granite. Indeed, the estimate by the petitioner\u2019s witnesses of damage to its property was made on that basis. They disregarded the value of the loose stone on the petitioner\u2019s property and appear to have considered it to be waste and therefore a liability rather than an asset in the determination ofvalue.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The petitioner took exception to the exclusion of its question to the buyer of the Maguire quarry asking, \u201c[D]o you have an opinion as to whether, at the time you bought this quarry, it was comparable to the Dodd Quarry?\u201d It complains that the witness was thus precluded from \u201ccomment[ing] upon whether his quarry was comparable to petitioner\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the record indicates that the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>was given ample opportunity, of which it took full advantage, to elicit from the witness on cross-examination the various points of alleged difference between the Maguire quarry and the Dodd quarry. And \u201c[i]t was much better to have the witness describe the two estates than to permit him to express his opinion on their ... similarity.\u201d <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>164 Mass. 99, 104 (1895). The action of the trial judge, which resulted in excluding the vague and conclusory \u201ccomment,\u201d was well within his discretion. In any event, it \u201chas not injuriously affected the substantial rights of the parties....\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 132. See <em>Saeli </em>v. <em>Mangino, </em>353 Mass. 591, 593 (1968). Cf. <em>Brush Hill Dev. Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>338 Mass. 359, 367-368 (1959), cited by the petitioner, in which the owner was seriously hampered in pursuing a line of inquiry \u2014 in contrast to the latitude permitted by the trial judge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-11\"> There was a conflict in the expert testimony, previously elicited, whether the granite in the petitioner\u2019s land was geologically or commercially unique.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\"> The petitioner had claimed, as an element of damage, that the taking had made it impossible to operate the Norcross quarry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> The answer to which the motion to strike was directed was in response to the question as to the purchase price of the Maguire quarry. The answer was: \u201cThis is what we paid. We paid $10,000.00 for the property, plus the option by Mr. Paltrineri to remove the stone as long as he wished, the loose stone, and he did that for about five years.\u201d To the extent that the answer dealt with the loose stone, it may have been irrelevant, but there was no attempt to strike only that portion of the answer. <em>Bryer </em>v. <em>P. S. Thorsen Co. of Mass. </em>327 Mass. 684, 687 (1951). Subsequently, the petitioner objected (saving its exception) to the receipt in evidence of the deed, which showed only the $10,000 consideration. It did not thereafter raise any objection to the further testimony on direct examination as to the seller\u2019s option to take the already quarried stone. We assume that the jury were properly instructed, in accordance with the judge\u2019s ruling, to consider the cash as the sale price of the real estate. See <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Northampton, </em>157 Mass. 218,220 (1892); <em>Valley Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Holyoke Housing Authy. </em>346 Mass. 561, 569 (1963). The record contains no objection to the charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\"> We treat this contention on its merits, though not precisely within the scope of the exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
