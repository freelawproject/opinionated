The case comes to us on an appeal by the plaintiff from an order on a statement of agreed facts allowing the motion of the defendant insurer for summary judgment and denying the plaintiffs motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>judgment. <em>See New Amsterdam Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>352 Mass. 492 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">As set out in the agreed facts, the damage to the plaintiffs property occurred \u201csometime over the Labor Day weekend of 1967, [when] a 1 <em>*l 23A </em>inch water pipe in the basement of the... premises [adjacent to those of the plaintiff] burst. Some of the water which collected in the cellar of the next door premises escaped through its foundation walls and foundation floor, and through the ground, and then into the basement of the insured\u2019s premises thru its foundation walls and/or foundation floor causing water damages to the insured\u2019s contents within in the amount of $6,760.00.\u201d \u201cThese next door premises contain a building which is approximately 8 feet from the building of the insured\u2019s premises and the cellar depth of the insured\u2019s premises is 3 to 3 <em>lA </em>feet deeper than that of the next door premises. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The insurance policy then in effect \u201cinsure[d] against all risks of physical loss\u201d and contained various exclusions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant interprets paragraph B3 to exclude damage from water which has come through the ground, regardless of the source of the water. The plaintiff argues that the exclusion does not refer to water damage caused by a broken pipe. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Loss from the bursting of a pipe on the premises of another would seem to be the kind of \u201cfortuitous loss\u201d which is \u201cnot usually covered under other insurance\u201d and against which an \u201call risk\u201d policy is designed to extend protection. Couch, Insurance (2d ed.) \u00a7 48.138, p. 596. <em>C. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number><em>H. Leavell &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>372 F. 2d 784, 787 (9th Cir. 1967). Richards, Insurance (5th ed.) \u00a7 212, p. 721. See <em>British &amp; Foreign Marine Ins. Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Gaunt, </em>[1921] 2 A. C. 41, 46-47; <em>Mellon </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>14 F. 2d 997, 1002 (S.D.N.Y. 1926); <em>Glassner </em>v. <em>Detroit Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>23 Wis. 2d 532, 536-537 (1964); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Boston Ins. Co. </em>420 Pa. 566, 571 (1966); Gorman, All Risks of Loss v. All Loss, 34 Notre Dame Lawyer 346 (hereinafter cited as Gorman); Annot., 88 A. L. R. 2d 1124 (1963). The \u201crisk\u201d comprehended in an \u201call risk\u201d policy has been characterized as: \u201ca fortuitous event \u2014 a casualty\u201d <em>(Mellon, supra, </em>p. 1004); \u201closses by any accidental cause ... due to some fortuitous circumstance or casualty\u201d <em>(British &amp; Foreign Marine Ins., supra, </em>p. 47); \u201ca fortuitous and extraneous happening\u201d <em>(Glassner, supra, </em>p. 536); \u201cfortuitous (accidental)...\u201d resulting \u201cfrom a fortuitous or a chance occurrence\u201d (Gorman, <em>supra, </em>pp. 351, 355). Cases such as the <em>Mellon </em>(p. 1004), <em>British &amp; Foreign Marine Ins. </em>(p. 57) and <em>Glassner </em>(p. 536) cases have further indicated that an \u201call risk\u201d policy covers primarily casualties. Thus in the <em>British &amp; Foreign Marine Ins. </em>case Lord Sumner said, \u201cAccordingly the expression does not cover inherent vice or mere wear and tear or British capture. It covers a risk, not a certainty; it is something, which happens to the subject-matter from without, not the natural behaviour of that subject-matter, being what it is, in the circumstances under which it is carried. Nor is it a loss which the assured brings about by his own act, for then he has not merely exposed the goods to the chance of injury, he has injured them himself.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Accordingly, such a policy presents \u201cvery serious and extremely difficult questions relating to whether an occurrence is fortuitous or natural, what is inherent or extraneous, what is wilful or accidental, and perhaps even what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>is lawful and unlawful. . ..\u201d Gorman, p. 356. An examination of the policy in this case demonstrates that it was generally these questions that the list of exclusions was intended to answer. Besides the exclusions listed in paragraph B (see n. 1), section vm a provides that the policy \u201cdoes not insure ... against loss caused by: [e.g.] Earthquake ... shortage'of property disclosed on taking inventory ... latent defect... [ijnherent vice, wear and tear ... [a]ny fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act\u201d, etc.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These are not ordinarily thought to arise out of an accident. In context, therefore, it does not seem to us that (or it is at least doubtful whether) the exclusion in paragraph B3, on which the defendant relies, refers to water damage caused by an accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The interpretation of the defendant insurer which isolates the exclusion and looks only at its text \u2014 even though we were to consider it a \u201cwarranted interpretation\u201d \u2014 cannot be said \u201cbest [to] effectuate the main manifested design of the parties....\u201d <em>Joseph E. Bennett Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>344 Mass. 99, 103-104 (1962). \u201c[C]ourts attempt to resolve insurance disputes with a view to accomplishing the purpose of the insurance.\u201d <em>Marston </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co. </em>439 F. 2d 1035, 1038 (1st Cir. 1971). <em>See Bulyga </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, ante, </em>359, 363 (\u201cExclusions from coverage are to be strictly construed . . . and the doctrine is well established that any ambiguity in the language of a policy must be construed in favor of the insured.... [citing cases]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">The contention of the defendant is inconsistent with the well established principle that recovery on an insurance policy is allowed \u201cwhere the insured risk itself set into operation a chain of causation in which the last step may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>have been an excepted risk.\u201d Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7 3083, p. 311. See Couch, Insurance (2d ed.) \u00a7 74:706, p. 614 (\u201cTrain of events test\u201d). In <em>Wyatt </em>v. <em>Northwestern Mut. Ins. Co. </em>304 F. Supp. 781, 783 (D. Minn. 1969) the rule was applied to an \u201call risk\u201d policy and recovery was allowed for damage resulting from earth movement, artificially caused, in spite of an exclusion for \u201cany earth movement.\u201d The court held \u201cthat a distinction should be drawn between an excluded event which is a cause and such an event which is the inevitable result of another event\u201d (p. 783). See also <em>New Zealand Ins. Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Lenoff, </em>315 F. 2d 95 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The Supreme Judicial Court has followed the same rule in applying insurance policies covering injuries solely caused by accident and with exclusions for disease, etc. <em>Barnett v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>304 Mass. 564, 566-567 (1939), and cases cited. In that case, the policy insured against death \u201ccaused solely by ... accidental means... independently and exclusive of all other causes\u201d; recovery was allowed for death from pneumonia of which the accident was the proximate cause. See <em>Jiannetti </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co. </em>277 Mass. 434, 438-439 (1931); <em>Bulyga </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, ante, </em>359. See also <em>Edgerton &amp; Sons Inc. </em>v. <em>Minneapolis Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>142 Conn. 669 (1955); <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Sun Ins. Office, Ltd. </em>238 Cal. App. 2d 408 (1965); <em>Fawcett House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Great Cent. Ins. Co. </em>280 Minn. 325 (1968); <em>The G. R. Booth, </em>171 U. S. 450, 460-461 (1898).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Hardware Dealers Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>448 F. 2d 870, 871 (1st Cir. 1971) \u2014 construing Massachusetts law \u2014 an exclusion identical with the one before us was held not to bar recovery under a fire insurance policy for damage caused by water which went under the ground from adjacent premises. The court said: \u201cMost of Article V in referring to water designates water which could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>conceivably have resulted from fire. That being the general tenor of the other subparagraphs, it is natural to read this inference into subparagraphs C4, having in mind that water resulting from a fire is normally within the policy. Such a reading could have been easily avoided, if a different concept was intended, by adding thereto the simple words, \u2018whether resulting from fire or not.\u2019 \u201d The point is clear if we substitute the word \u201caccident\u201d for \u201cfire\u201d in that quotation. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>84 N. M. 550 (1973), also construing the identical exclusion in a policy insuring against accidents to a plumbing system. The court said (p. 555), \u201c[T]he words \u2018water below the surface of the ground\u2019 [refer to] .. . losses . .. resulting] from causes having no connection with the \u2018plumbing system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sauer </em>v. <em>General Ins. Co. of Am. </em>225 Cal. App. 2d 275, 279-280 (1964) \u2014 also permitting recovery in spite of an exclusion for \u201cwater below the surface of the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The insurer concedes that the <em>McDonough </em>case was properly decided because a fire insurance policy was involved and the loss was \u201cproximately connected\u201d with the fire. The insurer suggests that an \u201call risk\u201d policy stands on a different footing, and greater emphasis must be given to the exclusions. We reject this distinction. To accept it would create the anomaly that, if the plaintiff in the <em>McDonough </em>case had been insured only under this \u201call risk\u201d policy rather than a fire insurance policy the insurer would not have been liable, though this policy covers fire and water damages generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">As long ago as <em>Parkhurst </em>v. <em>Gloucester Mut. Fishing Ins. Co. </em>100 Mass. 301, 302, 306 (1868), the court said, \u201cA policy of insurance against all marine risks [the forerunner of the modern \u201call risk\u201d policy] . . . which underwriters usually take, is just as binding and effectual as if the risks are specified in detail. . .\u201d and \u201can express exception in a policy is to be construed against the underwriters, by whom the policy is framed, and for whose benefit the exception is introduced.\u201d <em>See British &amp; Foreign Marine Ins. Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Gaunt, </em>[1921] 2 A. C. 41, 57 (\u201c \u2018All risks\u2019 has the same effect as if all insurable risks were separately enumerated ...\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>See also <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Boston Ins. Co. </em>420 Pa. 566, 577 (1966). In <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hanley, </em>252 F. 2d 780, 786 (6th Cir. 1958) the court said, \u201cWe think the insurer is under at least as high an obligation to be precise and clear in drawing the policy when dealing with risks described in general terms as when the risks insured against are precisely itemized. The insured will have more difficulty in threading through the mazes of exclusions relating to a general comprehensive coverage than in properly appraising exclusions which relate to coverage of specific risks.\u201d The order for judgment for the defendant is reversed and judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\"> The policy states under section \u201cviii. exclusions\u201d: \u201cA.
