In one, the board voted \u201cto grant the requested variance and permission for extension of non-conforming use,\u201d permitting the construction of six silos for the storage of flour in connection with the operation of a bakery then owned by Kasanof s Baking Company, Inc. (Kasanofs).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The silos would front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>on Blue Hill Avenue and extend along the existing building wall of the bakery. This locus is in a district zoned for local business; the bakery is a non-conforming use. The second decision granted a variance for the erection of a \u201cwarehouse-garage structure\u201d on that part of the bakery property on Edgewood Street. This is in a district zoned for apartments in which a warehouse is forbidden. The Superior Court sustained the decisions of the board and the plaintiffs, abutting owners, appealed. The trial judge made \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order For Decree\u201d; the evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We first examine each decision of the board to see whether it is valid on its face as a grant of a variance. Neither decision contains, as required by Section 7-3 of the Boston Zoning Code (code), findings \u201c[tjhat there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described . . . applying to the land or structure for which the variance is sought. .. which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or structure but not the neighborhood, and that said circumstances or conditions . . . would deprive the appellant of the reasonable use of such land or structure. . ..\u201d Both decisions are therefore invalid. See <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Scituate, </em>343 Mass. 455, 457 (1962); <em>Zinck </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>345 Mass. 394, 395 (1963); <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Whitman, </em>352 Mass. 782 (1967); <em>Planning Bd. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Springfield, </em>355 Mass. 460, 462 (1969); <em>Wolfson </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>357 Mass. 87, 90-91 (1970); <em>McNeely </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>358 Mass. 94, 103 (1970); <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>362 Mass. 290, 292 (1972). See also <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Fall River, </em>351 Mass. 714 (1967); <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Leominster, </em>352 Mass. 620 (1967). Nor did the trial judge make findings (and the record does not permit findings) of such \u201cspecial circumstances or conditions.\u201d Thus the decisions of the board cannot stand, and we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>deal with the adequacy of the findings of the board or of the trial judge as to the other conditions for a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Kasanof s argues that the decision granting permission to build the silos can stand as permission for the extension of a non-conforming use under Section 9-1 of the code (\u201csubject to the provisions of Section . . . 6-3\u201d; see fn. 2). However, on this basis also, \u201cas is the case where the granting of a variance is involved, the board . . . must set forth \u2018clearly the reason or reasons for its decisions\u2019 that the applicable statutory and by-law standards have been met. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 18 [substantially adopted in the Boston zoning enabling act, St. 1956, c. 665, \u00a78].\u201d <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>362 Mass. 290, 295 (1972). These standards in Section 9-1 of the code are that \u201cthe building or structure as . .. extended shall not exceed by more than twenty-five per cent either in volume or in area the building or structure existing on the effective date of this code ... [and] that the aggregate amount expended for . . . extending a nonconforming building or structure ... shall not exceed fifty per cent of the physical value of the building or structure on the effective date of this code ... as determined by the Board of Appeal from its reproduction cost less physical deterioration.\u201d The board\u2019s decision seems to be addressed primarily to the question of the grant of a variance and does not address itself directly to these standards or to the conditions set out in Section 6-3 of the code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We do not pause to consider whether the satisfaction of some of these requirements can be gleaned from a close reading of the board\u2019s decision; it is clear, in any event, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>it contains no reference to the maximum value restriction contained in Section 9-1. The decision is therefore invalid. <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>362 Mass. 290, 296-298 (1972). The trial judge\u2019s findings contain no reference to the standards in Section 9-1, and the record does not relate the required ratios (which are mentioned in the testimony) to the \u201cbuilding or structure existing on the effective date of this code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">However, the deficient findings as to the requirements in Section 9-1 for the extension of a non-conforming use are probably remediable at a further hearing. For this reason, though both decisions must be annulled, we order the case to be remanded to the board for further proceedings in both these interconnected appeals. <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>362 Mass. 290, 300 (1972). We need not deal with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the original appeals to the board were vitiated because the appellant had already sold the property when it appealed to the board. See <em>Belfer </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Boston, </em>363 Mass. 439 (1973). See also <em>Marinetti </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>275 Mass. 169, 173 (1931); <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>321 Mass. 649, 652-653 (1947). We assume that Kasanofs, as the present owner of the locus, will be permitted by the board to participate in further proceedings as the proper appellant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Accordingly, the final decree is reversed and a new decree is to be entered (1) declaring that the decisions of the board were in excess of its authority and are annulled, (2) remanding the case to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and (3) providing that the Superior Court shall retain jurisdiction of the case. <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, supra, </em>at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-14\"> Kasanof s was permitted to intervene as a defendant in the proceedings in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Superior Court.
