A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AhW\">Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, Law Division, upholding a variance granted under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:55-39(d) to Mar-Ray Inc. to build an A. &amp; P. supermarket in a residence zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The premises for which the variance was granted are known as Lots 28, 12 and 13 in Block 414 on the Wood-bridge tax maps. They are described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">(a) Lot 28 has a frontage on the westerly side of St. George Avenue of 315.16 feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">(b) Its southerly boundary extends 722.82 feet in a westerly direction parallel to North Hill Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">(c) The northerly boundary extends 376.20 feet from St. George Avenue, parallel to the southerly line to a point, and then southwesterly 423.72 feet to its intersection with the southerly line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">(d) Lots 12 and 13 have a total width of 50 feet fronting on Chain O\u2019Hills Road, and extend southerly approximately 200 feet to Lot 28.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">The entire tract contains 3.656 acres. Abutting this tract are residence lots upon which dwellings exist, those fronting on North Hill Eoad being 125 feet deep and those fronting on Chain O\u2019Hills Eoad being about 200 feet deep. Within a radius of two miles there are nine other supermarkets.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">St. George Avenue is \u201cstrip zoned\u201d for business to a depth of 100 feet. The remainder of lot 28 and all of lots 12 and 13 are in an area zoned as \u201cEesidence B.\u201d In this zone there are permitted, in addition to dwellings, boarding houses and rooming houses for not more than five paying guests, hotels, churches, schools, public libraries or public museums, clubs, philanthropic institutions other than correctional institutions or asylums, central telephone exchange buildings, parks and playgrounds, and farming, truck gardening, nurseries or greenhouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">In addition to building the supermarket, which will contain about 15,000 square feet, the applicant intends to pave all of the property (except the half-acre triangle formed at the westerly end of lot 28 by the intersection of its side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>linos) to provide a 2%-aere parking area for 300 automobiles and (over lots 12 and 13) a driveway from the parking area into Chain O'Hills Road. The parking area will be illuminated with mercury vapored lamps. The store will be open every day until 9 i&gt;. m., on Friday until 10 and on Saturday until 6 jp. m. The applicant plans to build a rustic fence about the boundaries of the parking area and the driveway into Chain O\u2019Hills Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">After the briefs were filed in this appeal the Supreme Court decided <em>Andrews v. Board of Adjustment of the Township of Ocean, </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>245 (1959). At the oral argument defendants took the position that the <em>Andrews </em>case (especially as interpreted in the dissenting opinion) is completely dis-positive of this appeal. It has been pointed out, however, that the dissent is not to be taken literally. <em>Sussna, \u201cZoning in Transition,\u201d 82 N. J. L. J. </em>473, 480 (1959); <em>Cunningham, \u201cControl of Land Use in New Jersey,\u201d </em>14 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>37, 92 (1959); <em>cf. Cardozo, \u201cLaw and Literature,\u201d </em>14 <em>Yale Review </em>(599, 715 (1925). As Professor Cunningham said, <em>Andrews </em>is important only because it marks \u201c[t]he court\u2019s return to the philosophy of <em>Ward v. Scott,\u201d </em>11 <em>N. J. </em>117 (1952) (presaged by <em>Grundlehner v. Dangler, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>256 (1959)) after the \u201ctemporary aberration\u201d of <em>Ranney v. Istitulo Pontificio Delle Maestre Filippini, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>189 (1955), and the \u201cclear retreat\u201d of <em>Moriarity v. Pozner, </em>21 <em>N. J. </em>199 (1956). <em>Cunningham, \u201cControl of Land Use in New Jersey,\u201d supra, </em>at <em>pp. </em>88, 89, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The \u201cphilosophy\u201d of <em>Ward v. Scott </em>referred to by Cunningham is stated in <em>Andrews </em>as follows: that \u201calthough hardship may constitute a special reason\u201d for a variance under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:55-39(d), it does not \u201cexhaust the subject\u201d and is not an essential prerequisite to its grant. There may be \u201cspecial reasons\u201d other than hardship but \u201cno definition of \u2018special reasons\u2019 has been attempted beyond the reference [in <em>Ward v. Scott, supra, </em>11 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pages </em>125-126] to <em>R. S. </em>40 :55 \u2014 32. In the nature of the subject, a precise formula is not feasible. Each case must turn upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>its own circumstances.\u201d <em>Andrews, supra, </em>30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>251.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The court said in <em>Andrews, </em>30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>249, that \u201c[t]wo critical findings are required by the statute: (1) that the variance \u2018can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance\u2019 ; (2) that \u2018special reasons\u2019 exist for the variance.\u201d Contrary to the wavering of the cases as to whether hardship is essential, there never has been any uncertainty about the absolute necessity of a finding that the variance \u201cwill not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d As was said in <em>Skaf v. Zoning Board of Adjustment of Asbury Park, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>215, 222 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), \u201cthe \u2018fixed and far reaching protective restriction\u2019 just referred to represents a requisite <em>in addition to, </em>and not substitutionary for, the affirmative requirement of \u2018special reasons\u2019 in aid of the zoning purposes set forth in <em>R. S. </em>40:55-32.\u201d See also <em>Whitehead v. Zoning Board of Adjustment of Kearny, </em>51 <em>N. J. Super. </em>560, 570 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We turn, therefore, to the findings of the zoning board of adjustment upon which the challenged variance was based. No. 1 merely recites that notice was given to all property owners within 200 feet of the site, and No. 2 gives the dimensions of the property in question. Then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201c(3) the Woodbridge Township Zoning Ordinance now in force and adopted 27 years ago in the year 1931, provides that the first 100 feet in depth of the premises fronting on St. George Avenue be zoned for business and that all the rest of the tract in question be zoned for residence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">(4) St. George Avenue is a very heavily travelled public thoroughfare and is also a State Highway, and Chain O\u2019Hills Road is a fairly well travelled public street;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">(5) there has been a considerable business growth in the past several years on St. George Avenue in this area, and many of the business establishments are not attractive ones;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">(6) the erection of the proposed structure will be a considerable aesthetic improvement in the area as it is a very attractive structure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>No. 7 says that \"adequate buffers are provided in order to screen off the proposed project from the adjacent residential area\u201d (the \"buffers\u201d being the triangular westerly tip of the property and the rustic fence around the premises), and No. 8 that \"off-street parking will be more than adequate for the operation of the establishment.\u201d Then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201c(9) the operation of modern business in this era definitely requires more than a property depth of 100 feet and the trend is to much larger sites;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">(10) Supermarkets are proper elements of good planning and should be located at or near residential areas to supply a need and a community service, as would be done in the present instance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">(11) the conversion of lots 12 and 13 into another means of access is a suitable, proper and beneficial adjunct to the proposed operation for the, double access would lessen congestion in the streets and promote safety, and would be a very convenient artery for the public coming and going on Chain O\u2019Hills Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">(12) there will be no adverse effect on property values in the neighborhood, and real estate values will not be depreciated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">(33) the highest and best use of the premises in question is as a plot for business use, as exemplified by the contemplated use in this instance, for it would prevent the overcrowding of land or buildings, avoid undue concentration of population, lessen congestion in the streets, enhance the character of the district, and would conserve the value of the property and be its most appropriate use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">(14) the applicant has shown many special reasons why the variance should be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">(35) the relief requested can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">No. 15 is merely a conclusion, expressed in tlie exact words of the statute. Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, and part of 13 are the findings of fact upon which this conclusion is based. Therefore, if they do not support No. 15, the so-called \u201cnegative requirement\u201d of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:55-39 has not been satisfied. We find that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Nos. 5 and 6 refer to the 100-foot strip along St. George Avenue zoned for business. There is nothing in the findings or the evidence that suggests that this supermarket would be an \"aesthetic improvement\u201d of the affected <em>residential </em>area. In fact, as we shall see, the evidence is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>No. 7, in effect, says that the variance will not distress the neighboring residents, and Nos. 8 and 11 that it will not increase the area\u2019s traffic or parking problems. We find that No. 7 is not supported by the evidence. The triangular tip and the rustic fence cannot be \u201cadequate buffers\u201d against this floodlighted operation involving the coming and going of hundreds of automobiles until late in the evening. As we have said, the lots on North Hill Road are only 125 feet deep and those on Chain O\u2019Hills Road an average of 200 feet deep, and the proposed operation will be conducted right up to the rear boundary of all the lots except those bordering on the triangular tip. As to Nos. 8, 11 and that portion of No. 13 which finds that the variance would \u201clessen congestion in the streets,\u201d there is no proof of any present parking problem or congestion in the streets which will be alleviated by the proposed use.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The basic error in the approach of the board is that it found the strip business zone ordinance antiquated and attempted to amend it with this variance. That is obvious from Nos. 3, 5, 9, 10 and 13. Eor example, the board pointed critically to the fact that the ordinance was \u201cadopted 27 years ago in the year 1931, [and] provides that the first 100 feet in depth of the premises fronting on St. George Avenue be zoned for business and that all the rest of the tract in question be zoned for residence; * * * the operation of modern business in this era definitely requires more than a property depth of 100 feet and the trend is to much larger sites; * * * Supermarkets are proper elements of good planning and should be located at or near residential areas to supply a need and a community service * * <em>*\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\"> If the ordinance is so outmoded and ill-fitting, its alteration must be by amendment or revision. It may not be done by variance. We are aware of the difficulty often encountered in distinguishing the \u201clegislative\u201d from the \u201cquasi-]udicial,\u201d the \u201cadministrative\u201d and the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d powers and activities of administrative bodies. In this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>wo do not need to express an opinion upon the unresolved dispute as to what extent a zoning board of adjustment may take into consideration the need for \u201clegislative\u201d changes of the ordinance. <em>Cf. Sussna, \u201cZoning in Transition\u201d supra, </em>at <em>page </em>479, <em>notes </em>8 to 11, and at <em>page </em>480, <em>notes 21 </em>and <em>22. </em>We merely hold that while a zoning board of adjustment undoubtedly has the right to take into consideration the contemporary effect and operation of the zoning ordinance under which it operates, together with all of the other facts and circumstances, it may not attempt with a massive variance to compensate for ordinance deficiencies as pervasive as those found here.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"> This business enterprise can not be thrust so deeply into the residential zone on this large tract without substantial detriment to the residents and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance. The defendants point to finding <em>12 </em>that \u201cthere will be no adverse effect on property values in the neighborhood, and real estate values will not be depreciated.\u201d Even if that be true (which we doubt) it is not a sufficient answer. The residents are entitled to protect not only the dollar value of their property but as well the enjoyment of their homes and the preservation of their zone as residential. It may be that the introduction of a prohibited use might even enhance the dollar value of the affected residences, but the residents may not be forced to accept dollars in place of their right to retain, free of substantial impairment, \u201cthe intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :55-39. The extension by variance of land use zones is not to be measured by the dollar.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The <em>Andrews </em>case was quite different from the case at bar. In <em>Andrews </em>the zoning ordinance expressly permitted (30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>248) \u201capartment houses, garden apartments, apartment hotels, hotels, boarding houses, municipal buildings, churches, public schools, including playgrounds and accessory buildings, public parks, and public playgrounds,\u201d upon the recommendation of the board of adjustment under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :55 \u2014 39 (6). The variance involved in <em>Andrews </em>was for a parochial school which the court said, with obvious justification, was a \u201cuse * * * not dramatically different from those envisioned in the zoning plan.\u201d <em>Andrews, </em>30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>250. Here the proposed use is dramatically different. Furthermore, in <em>Andrews </em>the large old house on the 16-acre tract there involved was to be retained, and \u201cthe exterior of the existing building [was] not to be changed or altered; * <em>* </em>* the property east of the building-known as the front yard shall be maintained in its present state of landscaping; [and] * * * the convent and parochial school shall be limited to the existing main building.\u201d <em>(Andrews, </em>30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>248; but see Justice Hall\u2019s dissent, 30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>261.) The Chief Justice therefore said, 30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>250, this \u201cwill contain the influences of the school within the perimeter of the property. In affirmative terms, some possible advantages may be added. The variance will preserve the attractive character of the premises against pressures, evident from the subdivision developments mentioned above, to raze a beautiful but uneconomic type of residence and to subdivide the tract. Thus the variance may well prove to be a buffer for the remaining properties in this relatively small Eesidence A district.\u201d Eor the variance at bar, the prognosis must be the reverse of that in <em>Andrews, </em>for the influences of the supermarket cannot possibly be contained within the perimeter of the property, and no counterbalancing advantage cognizable under the zoning law can accrue to the neighboring residence zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In short, the findings and the record fail to show that the \u201cnegative\u201d criteria exist. That alone is sufficient to invalidate the variance. But the affirmative criteria of \u201cspecial reasons\u201d do not exist here either.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In <em>Andrews </em>the court said, 30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>251:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\u201cThe standard of <em>section </em>32 here pertinent is the \u2018general welfare.\u2019 That the education of children directly furthers the \u2018general welfare\u2019 cannot be questioned. The education here to be provided is an accepted equivalent of public schooling. A need exists. Presently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the community\u2019s children of the Catholic faith attend a parochial school in Asbury Park, the facilities of which are hard pressed because of swelling population, as indeed are those of the public school in the township itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">No such argument can be advanced for this supermarket. As we have said, there are nine supermarkets within a radius of two miles of these premises. A supermarket here may be convenient, but it is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Defendants contend that they have proved hardship so severe as to be a special reason. The answer to this is that there is no such finding by the zoning board of adjustment. The board did find that \u201cthe highest and best use of the premises in question is as a plot for business use, as exemplified by the contemplated use in this instance * * hut that is not a finding that it is not useable for purposes permitted in the zone. It is very likely true that the proposed use would he more profitable to the owners than the permitted uses, hut that is not sufficient. <em>Whitehead v. Zoning Board of Adjustment of Kearny, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">No. 14 said that \u201cthe applicant has shown many special reasons why the variance should he granted,\u201d but the findings do not state what those special reasons are, and we are not privileged to speculate. As we said, we find no special reasons whatever in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Eor the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Law Division is reversed and the case is remanded with directions that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs setting aside the variance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
