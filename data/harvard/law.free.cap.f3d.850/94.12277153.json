Defendant-Appellant Douglas Dey controlled South Bay Apparel Inc. (\u201cSouth Bay\u201d),- a clothing vendor. Between 1996 and 2006, Finazzo caused A\u00e9ropostale to use South Bay as its supplier of T-shirts and fleeces in exchange for secret payments to Finazzo of portions of South Bay\u2019s profits. As a result of this scheme, Finazzo and Dey were charged in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York with one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and to violate the Travel Act, as well as fourteen counts of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-16\">Dey pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Travel Act and was sentenced to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finazzo was convicted of all counts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after a three-week jury trial. The jury rendered a special verdict. On the conspiracy count, the jury found Finazzo guilty of conspiracy to commit mail fraud \u201c[o]n the basis of intent to deprive A\u00e9ropostale of money\u201d and \u201c[o]n the basis of A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s right to control use of its assets.\u201d Dist. Ct. Dkt. No. 260, at 2. It found Finazzo guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud on the basis of A\u00e9ropos-tale\u2019s right to control use of its assets, but not on the basis of intent to d\u00e9prive A\u00e9ro-postale of money. On each of the fourteen substantive mail fraud counts and the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>stantive we fraud count, the jury found Finazzo guilty on the basis of A\u00e9ropos-tale\u2019s right to control use of its assets, but not on the basis of intent to deprive A\u00e9ro-postale of money.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court (Mauskopf, <em>J.) </em>sentenced Finazzo to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment on the substantive mail and wire fraud counts and 5 years\u2019 imprisonment on the conspiracy count, all to run concurrently. The court also imposed a $18,690,822.94 restitution order jointly and severally against Finazzo and Dey.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Finazzo does not challenge his conspiracy conviction in this appeal. He challenges only his convictions on the mail and wire fraud counts. Both Finazzo and Dey also challenge the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In this opinion, we address: (1) Finazzo\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s jury instructions regarding the \u201cright to control\u201d property under the mail and wire fraud statutes, (2) the sufficiency of the evidence to support Finazzo\u2019s convictions for depriving A\u00e9ropostale of the \u201cright to control\u201d its assets, and (3) Finazzo\u2019s and Dey\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s restitution order. We affirm the district court\u2019s \u201cright to control\u201d jury instructions and conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the challenged portions of the jury verdict. However, we vacate and remand the district court\u2019s restitution order as to Finazzo and Dey. In a summary order issued simultaneously with this opinion, we affirm the district court on the remaining issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Finazzo and Dey were first indicted on June 8, 2010. The original indictment alleged that Dey and Finazzo \u201cagreed that Finazzo would cause A\u00e9ropostale to use South Bay as a vendor to purchase merchandise at rates that were less favorable to A\u00e9ropostale than the prevailing market rate.\u201d Dist. Ct. Dkt. No. 1, at 3. \u201cIn exchange, Dey covertly paid Finazzo approximately fifty percent of South Bay\u2019s profits\u201d through C&amp;D Retail Consultants, Inc. (\u201cC&amp;D\u201d) \u2014 a consulting business controlled by Finazzo \u2014 and through various joint ventures. <em>Id. </em>The indictment alleged that Finazzo and Dey did not disclose this scheme to A\u00e9ropostale. The indictment further stated that, between August 1996 and November 2006, Finazzo caused A\u00e9ro-postale to pay South Bay more than $350 million in payments for its merchandise. Over that period, Dey paid Finazzo more than $14 million through bank transfers to C&amp;D and transferred over $13 million to three jointly owned entities: Vertical Line Apparel, Inc., Vertical Line Apparel II, Inc., and Vertical Line Apparel III, Inc. (the \u2018Vertical Line entities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The September 6, 2011 Second Superseding Indictment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> added that Finazzo and Dey defrauded A\u00e9ropostale by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">(1) depriving A\u00e9ropostale of the opportunity to make informed decisions, thereby preventing A\u00e9ropostale from seeking lower prices for merchandise it purchased from South Bay and the opportunity to select other vendors based upon price, quality and timely delivery; and (2) causing A\u00e9ropostale to pay higher prices on merchandise it purchased from South Bay than were available from other vendors, thereby increasing South Bay\u2019s profits and the amounts Dey paid Finazzo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Dey App\u2019x at 59. That indictment included seventeen counts. Count One alleged conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>to violate the Travel Act from August 1996 to November 2006 in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Counts Two through Fifteen alleged mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C-. \u00a7 1341. Count Sixteen alleged wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and Count Seventeen alleged a false statement in a report required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78ff(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Like the conspiracy-charge, the scheme to defraud for the mail and wire fraud counts was also alleged to have taken place between August 1996 and November 2006. The mail and wire fraud counts were linked to fifteen specific payments by A\u00e9ropostale to South Bay between June 9, 2005 and November 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">On September 27, 2012, Dey pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Travel Act. In his plea agreement, Dey agreed to a $7,500,000 forfeiture order, but specifically reserved the right to appeal any restitution order imposed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">A. Finazzo\u2019s Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Finazzo\u2019s case proceeded to a three-week jury trial on the Second Superseding Indictment, beginning on April 8, 2013. At trial, the Government called fifteen witnesses \u2014 most of whom were current or former A\u00e9ropostale employees \u2014 and the defense called three witnesses. Because one of the issues on appeal is sufficiency of the evidence, we recount in some detail the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">1. The Government\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">a. The Creation of the South Bay Relationship with A\u00e9ropostale</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">In July 1996, Julian Geiger \u2014 A\u00e9ropos-tale\u2019s President and CEO \u2014 hired Finazzo as its Men\u2019s Divisional Merchandising Manager.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Prior to being hired by A\u00e9ropostale, Fi-nazzo owned a small sports-clothing retailing business called C&amp;E Marketing, at which Dey was an employee. Shortly after Finazzo was hired by A\u00e9ropostale, Peter Conefry \u2014 Finazzo\u2019s and Dey\u2019s former private accountant and a cooperating Government witness \u2014 attended a meeting with Finazzo and Dey in which Finazzo stated that he and Dey were going to a start a new company that would do business with A\u00e9ropostale.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Conefry testified that he told Finazzo that Finazzo \u201cbetter be careful because if you have a relationship with a vendor as an employee of [a] company it could create a problem.\u201d Dey App\u2019x at 1229. Conefry advised Finazzo to check with A\u00e9ropostale before proceeding with the new company. Finazzo responded that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think A\u00e9ropostale would go for it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, in August 1996, Dey incorporated South Bay Apparel, Inc. South Bay\u2019s business with A\u00e9ropostale comprised approximately 99% of South Bay\u2019s total business from 1996 to 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">In 1998, Finazzo started C&amp;D. Finazzo told Conefry \u2014 who also acted as South Bay\u2019s and C&amp;D\u2019s accountant \u2014 that he formed C&amp;D so that he could receive \u201cconsulting fees\u201d for directing A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s business to South Bay. <em>Id. </em>at 1232. Indeed, Conefry testified that C&amp;D primarily received payments from South Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-14\">Initially, Finazzo and Dey had an informal agreement pursuant to which Finazzo simply told Dey to send funds to C&amp;D. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the South Bay supply business with A\u00e9ro-postale grew larger, Conefry was directed to split South Bay\u2019s net profits nearly evenly between South Bay \u2014 owned by Dey\u2014 and C&amp;D \u2014 owned by Finazzo. Although these payments from South Bay to C&amp;D were not for actual consulting, Conefry classified them as such on South Bay\u2019s books. <em>Id. </em>at 1234-36. The payments steadily increased from $355,000 in 1998 to $5,161,550 in 2004. In 2005, the payments from</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">South Bay to C&amp;D totaled approximately $13 million, and Conefry classified them as cost of sales, because $13 million in consulting fees \u201cwould be a red flag.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1236. Conefry testified that, throughout this time period, he discussed these payments with Finazzo annually during the preparation and filing of Finazzo\u2019s tax returns. When Conefry pushed Finazzo to disclose the arrangement to A\u00e9ropostale, Finazzo responded that \u201cit was too late at this time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1238. In response to Conefry\u2019s concern that A\u00e9ropostale becoming a public company in 2002 could bring scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Finazzo told Conefry \u201cit\u2019s gone along so far so we will just continue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Finazzo and Dey also jointly owned the Vertical Line entities. These entities served as vendors to A\u00e9ropostale as well. In addition, Finazzo and Dey jointly owned other South Bay entities, including South Bay Sports Plex, South Bay Ticketing, and South Bay Knitting (the \u201crelated South Bay entities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Michael Cunningham \u2014 the Chief Financial Officer of A\u00e9ropostale during this time period \u2014 testified that once A\u00e9ropostale went public in 2002, Finazzo was required to regularly complete director and officer (\u201cD&amp;O\u201d) questionnaires and other related-party transaction documents. The D&amp;O questionnaires asked whether Finazzo had a significant ownership interest in any A\u00e9-ropostale vendor or received money from the vendor. Finazzo received training on multiple occasions to ensure that he understood his responsibility to disclose any such interests. Nevertheless, Finazzo stated on these questionnaires that he was not an officer, director, or partner of any other company; received no bribes or kickbacks from any third-party vendor; and did not engage in any related-party transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">b. South Bay\u2019s Transactions with A\u00e9ropostale</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">CEO Geiger testified that A\u00e9ropostale started using South Bay as a vendor on Finazzo\u2019s recommendation in either late 1996 or early 1997. South Bay sold A\u00e9ro-postale graphic T-shirts and, eventually, fleeces. Various former and current employees of A\u00e9ropostale testified about the complete control Finazzo had over A\u00e9ro-postale\u2019s vendor selection and pricing, and his use of that control to direct business towards South Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">CFO Cunningham testified that the \u201cquantities of goods\u201d bought from particular vendors needed to be approved by Fi-nazzo and that Finazzo was \u201cresponsible for the overall final price that was being negotiated with the vendors.\u201d Dey App\u2019x at 615. Edward Slezak \u2014 A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s General Counsel \u2014 stated that Finazzo was \u201cthe number two person\u201d at A\u00e9ropostale. <em>Id. </em>at 829. He testified that Finazzo \u201cwas responsible for all aspects of our product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Finazzo] decided what type of product we would buy, how much of it, which vendors would manufacture the product, how it looked, [and] how it was merchandised in our stores.\u201d Id.; <em>see also id. </em>at 857 (\u201c[Finazzo] was the one who directed all of our product placement, what we made, how much we made, ... who got .the orders, who made the product.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>i. Graphic T-Shirt Suppliers</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Regarding graphic T-shirts, Geiger testified that from 2002 through 2006 Finazzo was the executive primarily responsible for vendors, vendor selection, and vendor pricing. He also stated that Finazzo had \u201cthe final say\u201d regarding the number of graphic T-shirts ordered by A\u00e9ropostale. Dey App\u2019x at 1400-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Cunningham and Geiger both recounted that, in early 2005, Geiger recommended to Finazzo that A\u00e9ropostale shift 25% of the T-shirts it was buying from South Bay to overseas vendors in order to achieve \u201csignificant cost savings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639. Geiger believed that, for certain \u201ccore\u201d graphic T-shirts with demand that was easy to predict, A\u00e9ropostale could accommodate the longer delivery time from overseas,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> while taking advantage of lower costs. <em>Id. </em>at 639-40, 1384. Geiger estimated that A\u00e9-ropostale could save $1.50 per T-shirt made overseas. Given the volume of T-shirts being sold, Cunningham estimated that this would have saved A\u00e9ropostale at least $5 million, while Geiger estimated savings of $6 million. '</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Finazzo initially stated that \u201che would look into it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640. As the year progressed, Finazzo became \u201cagitated\u201d that Geiger continued to press him on the matter. <em>Id. </em>At one meeting where the topic was discussed, Finazzo smacked the table, told Geiger that the meeting was over, and slammed the door shut as he left. Finazzo never moved 25% of the graphic T-shirt business overseas as Geiger had directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Geiger also testified that A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s profit margin on graphic T-shirts during the time Finazzo was the head of merchandising tended to be less than the profit margin of other similar products A\u00e9ropos-tale sold. Geiger discussed these low margins at executive meetings attended by Finazzo. On many occasions, Finazzo would respond by hitting the table with his hands \u201cand basically say[ing] why are people looking so closely at this?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1381. Geiger recalled that Finazzo once declared that Geiger \u201cwasn\u2019t allowed to ask [Finaz-zo] any questions about graphic T-shirts for a month.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Jennifer Heiser- \u2014 an A\u00e9ropostale employee who merchandised graphic T-shirts and reported to Finazzo \u2014 testified that the graphic T-shirt business in particular \u201cwas [Finazzo\u2019s] baby\u201d and that he was involved in that business \u201ca lot more than [he was involved in] any other department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708. She also testified that she \u201creally was not allowed to bring in other manufacturers [besides South Bay].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707. Heiser believed that bringing in additional manufacturers would allow A\u00e9ropostale to obtain \u201cthe best price and the best quality\u201d because vendors would be forced to bid against each other for A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s business. <em>Id. </em>at 707-08. She stated that she therefore tried to place graphic T-shirt orders with vendors in Singapore. However, .Finazzo \u201cdiscouraged\u201d Heiser from placing orders in Singapore, such that she \u201creally felt that [she] had to put all of [her] business with South Bay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707. On one occasion, when Heiser pushed Finazzo regarding the poor margins achieved by only using South Bay for graphic T-shirts, Finazzo \u201cbroke a pencil and said, we are using South Bay, end of story.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718. Heiser ultimately placed 97-99% of her graphic T-shirt orders with South Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Heiser also testified that Jody Green\u2014 an associate merchandiser in men\u2019s graphic T-shirts \u2014 often challenged Finazzo about the pricing of graphic T-shirts and asked why they could not use other manufacturers to get a better cost. Finazzo fired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Green just three months after she started working at A\u00e9ropostale.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">John DiBarto \u2014 A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s Divisional Merchandising Manager for the Men\u2019s Division at the time of Finazzo\u2019s scheme\u2014 testified that Finazzo \u201cwas responsible for negotiating prices on the graphic tee products with South Bay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1098. DiBarto stated that he did not try to negotiate prices with South Bay \u201c[bjecause ... that was [Finazzo\u2019s] thing. He controlled production. And that was ... his baby from the beginning, so ... we did whatever he wanted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, DiBarto never asked for an overall reduction in price from South Bay \u201c[b]ecause it wasn\u2019t going to happen. ... Those were variables that wouldn\u2019t change, because they were [Fi-nazzo\u2019s] \u25a0... he\u2019s in charge of that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">When employees tried to \u201cmess[] with [pricing] a little bit, it wasn\u2019t worth it, [Finazzo] would get angry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1129. For instance, when DiBarto asked Dey for a price breakdown of South Bay\u2019s T-shirts by component to compare to another vendor, Finazzo and Dey yelled at him, saying \u201cwe\u2019re not going to do this, why are you doing this, we\u2019re not going to do business with anybody else but South Bay, don\u2019t waste your time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1182-34. When Finazzo heard that Thomas Carberry \u2014 a new employee working under DiBarto\u2014 had questioned South Bay\u2019s costing structure, Finazzo emailed DiBarto: \u201cJohn, I would like to let you know that I hear that Tom Carberry is talking about South Bay to other people in the company. I will not tolerate that, and I will be swift in my actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1144. In an October 21, 2006 email to DiBarto and others, Finazzo summarized his position on using South Bay as the primary graphic T-shirt supplier: \u201cI will not change our vendor structure or the way we set up this business and I guess I can make that decision. I want South Bay to be the main T-shirt supplier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1175-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Jill Kronenberg \u2014 the former head of the Women\u2019s Division at A\u00e9ropostale \u2014 testified that prior to 2008, A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s women\u2019s graphic T-shirt business was split between South Bay and a vendor called Mias, with Mias having the majority of the business. Finazzo instructed Kronenberg to transfer business from Mias so that South Bay would have 50% of the women\u2019s graphic T-shirt business. Finazzo issued this instruction despite the fact that the graphic T-shirts made by Mias were of better quality and lower priced. Although she did not want to move business away from Mias, Kronenberg ultimately did so in 2004 \u201c[b]eeause it reached a point where ... basically [she] had no choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 994-95. Kronenberg voiced concerns with Finazzo about the decision to transfer more business to South Bay but was unable to change his mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">ii. Fleece Suppliers</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Megan Lauritano \u2014 a senior product manager at A\u00e9rospostale from 2004 to 2006 \u2014 testified that, in 2004, Finazzo made the decision to expand A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s use of South Bay as a supplier t\u00f3 fleece products as well.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> South Bay was not a \u201cknown vendor\u201d for fleece products at the time. Dey App\u2019x at 1958. Lauritano testified that Finazzo determined the price and quantity of fleece orders with South Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">She explained that South Bay\u2019s performance in the fleece business in 2004 was poor, including significant delivery delays that A\u00e9ropostale did not experience with-other fleece vendors. Nevertheless, Finaz-zo dictated that A\u00e9ropostale continue buy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ing fleece product from South Bay. When Lauritano informed Finazzo in 2005 that she had done a cost comparison analysis of South Bay and other fleece vendors and found that South Bay was not competitive, Finazzo nevertheless directed her to place an order with South Bay. South Bay continued to have delivery problems in 2005, and Lauritano proposed that South Bay give A\u00e9ropostale discounts to account for the markdowns A\u00e9ropostale was forced to take on late fleece deliveries. Finazzo ultimately decided that South Bay would not be required to discount those products.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Despite these problems, Finazzo still directed placement of fleece orders with South Bay in 2006, negotiating the prices himself. Lauritano testified that South Bay continued to have delivery delays, \u201csome of them [by] several months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1984. She stated that she again proposed that South Bay give A\u00e9ropostale a discount, but Finazzo decided not to pursue one.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">George Justin Meno \u2014 a product manager of men\u2019s knits at A\u00e9ropostale starting in September 2005 \u2014 estimated that South Bay\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d delivery delays for fleece products in 2005 and 2006 cost A\u00e9ro-postale approximately $1.8 million in lost sales. <em>Id. </em>at 760, 767. Because of these delivery delays, Meno suggested looking into pricing for overseas vendors. Finazzo did not authorize this effort. When Meno requested discounts from South Bay to compensate for the delays, Finazzo made it clear that Meno \u201cneeded to back off a little bit from South Bay\u201d and refused to request any discounts. <em>Id. </em>at 766-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Similarly, Jinah Jung \u2014 an A\u00e9ropostale product manager \u2014 testified that she did not want to purchase fleece products from South Bay \u201c[bjecause their costs [were] always high and their quality was subpar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1051. Nevertheless, she purchased fleece products from South Bay at Finaz-zo\u2019s direction, because Finazzo had \u201cthe final say\u201d on the orders. <em>Id. </em>at 1052, 1055. On February 14, 2005, Jung sent Finazzo an email stating that the $6.85 price Finaz-zo agreed upon for a South Bay fleece order was \u201creally high,\u201d and that she \u201ckn[e]w\u201d she could \u201cget it for a low $6 range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1053. She specifically noted that A\u00e9ropostale \u201ccould have saved approximately $300,000\u201d on the order. <em>Id. </em>Finazzo refused to change the order, responding: \u2018Tes, that is the price I agreed with [Dey] on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">iii. Scope of the Transactions</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">A\u00e9ropostale eventually learned of Finaz-zo\u2019s and Dey\u2019s scheme when, during an unrelated investigation of Finazzo\u2019s conduct, A\u00e9ropostale discovered an August 24, 2006, email to Finazzo from his estate planning attorney that disclosed Finazzo\u2019s ownership interest in South Bay, the related South Bay entities, and the Vertical Lines entities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finazzo was terminated on November 7, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Michael Braconi, an FBI Special Agent, testified that, overall, A\u00e9ropostale paid South Bay and the Vertical Line entities $267,078,261.41 between June 2002 and November 2006. South Bay, in turn, paid C&amp;D \u2014 which was wholly owned by Finaz-zo \u2014 $21,223,831.14 during that same time period. South Bay also paid the related South Bay entities \u2014 which were co-owned by Finazzo and Dey \u2014 $2,959,520. Additionally, South Bay paid the Vertical Line entities \u2014 which were also co-owned by Fi-nazzo and Dey \u2014 $6,174,463.60. Half of South Bay\u2019s payments into those jointly-owned entities \u2014 equalling Finazzo\u2019s share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>of the companies \u2014 amounted to $4,566,991.80. South Bay\u2019s total payments to Finazzo therefore amounted to the sum of South Bay\u2019s payments to C&amp;D ($21,223,881.14) and Finazzo\u2019s one-half share of South Bay\u2019s payments to the jointly-owned entities ($4,566,991.80). Thus, Braconi testified that South Bay paid Finazzo $25,790,822.94 in kickbacks between June 2002 and November 2006.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In connection with the mail fraud counts, CFO Cunningham testified that A\u00e9ropostale sent fourteen checks via UPS to South Bay as listed at Counts Two through Fifteen of the indictment. In connection with the wire fraud count, David Libenson, Vice President of Financial Operations at A\u00e9ropostale, testified that A\u00e9-ropostale sent a wire transfer to South Bay as listed in Count Sixteen of the indictment. These payments were made from June 9, 2005 through November 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">c. Effect of Related-Party Transactions on A\u00e9ropostale</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In addition to the testimony regarding Finazzo\u2019s steering of business to South Bay, several witnesses testified about the effect of these related-party transactions on A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">CFO Cunningham testified that it was important for A\u00e9ropostale to know about all related-party transactions involving A\u00e9-ropostale employees. He explained that \u201cif the employee is receiving a benefit [from a vendor] and if that employee is also involved in transacting business with that vendor, the prices that we pay may not be the best price or the fair market value for that product or service.\u201d Dey App\u2019x at 601. Similarly, General Counsel Slezak testified that A\u00e9ropostale wanted to know about related-party transactions \u201cbecause you want to make sure that the company is getting the best possible deal, the best benefit of the bargain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 827. CEO Geiger testified that related-party transactions \u201ccould easily reduce [A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s] profitability and how much money [A\u00e9ro-postale] made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1415.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">Given that Finazzo was on both sides of the transactions between A\u00e9ropostale and South Bay, Slezak testified that \u201c[t]here is no way that ... A\u00e9ropostale got the benefit of the bargain or got the best market prices or got the best ... engagement with our vendor that we could possibly get.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 858. He concluded: \u201cHonestly, I felt every penny that [Finazzo] ever got from South Bay should have been ours.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, Geiger testified that Finazzo profiting from South Bay-related vendors \u201cwould directly diminish A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s ability to maximize its profits because monies were going elsewhere that could have gone to the company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1418. He concluded that \u201cany profits that [Finazzo] would have gotten, in my mind, would have [otherwise] accrued to the company[,] increasing its profitability, the value to the shareholders!,] and made A\u00e9ropostale stronger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">2. The Defense Case</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">Finazzo called three witnesses at trial: Wade Mosteller, Doris Wilshere, and Megan Lauritano.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">Wade Mosteller \u2014 a retail management consultant whose employer had been engaged by A\u00e9ropostale in 2004 \u2014 testified about the importance of quick replenish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ment of stock to A\u00e9ropostale. Mosteller explained that A\u00e9ropostale could increase profitability by decreasing the time between when goods were ordered and when A\u00e9ropostale received them in stores. Doing so would allow shirts that were selling well to remain in stock and continue selling. Mosteller testified that South Bay, a local vendor in nearby Long Island, was able to supply graphic T-shirts to A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s distribution center on the east coast quicker than an overseas vendor could.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Doris Wilshere \u2014 the former head of the Men\u2019s Division and Women\u2019s Division at A\u00e9ropostale \u2014 testified that South Bay was \u201cexceptional\u201d as a replenishment vendor. Dey App\u2019x at 1833. She testified that South Bay\u2019s women\u2019s graphic T-shirts were higher quality and had a shorter delivery time than those purchased from Mias \u2014 A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s other major women\u2019s graphic T-shirt vendor. Wilshere also stated that South Bay\u2019s willingness to hold and store inventory was valuable in light of A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s \u201cfickle\u201d teenage customer base, which often required A\u00e9ropostale to quickly start printing new styles. <em>Id. </em>at 1832,1836.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Additionally, Wilshere claimed that it was not unusual for A\u00e9ropostale to remain loyal to long-time vendors even when those vendors encountered production difficulties such as South Bay\u2019s fleece-product delivery delays. Laurita-no \u2014 the A\u00e9ropostale senior product manager \u2014 also testified that it was not unusual for A\u00e9ropostale to remain committed to long-term vendors, even if that meant paying higher prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">3. Jury Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">On April 25, 2013, the jury rendered a verdict finding Finazzo guilty on all counts. For each count, except the portion of Count One concerning Travel Act conspiracy, the verdict sheet asked the jury to determine whether it found Finazzo guilty \u201c[o]n the basis of intent to deprive A\u00e9ro-postale of money\u201d and/or \u201c[o]n the basis of A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s right to control use of its assets.\u201d Dist. Ct. Dkt. No. 260. On the conspiracy count, the jury found Finazzo guilty of conspiracy to commit mail fraud on the basis of intent to deprive A\u00e9ropos-tale of money and on the basis of A\u00e9ropos-tale\u2019s right to control use of its assets. It found Finazzo guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud on the basis of A\u00e9ropos-tale\u2019s right to control use of its assets, but not on the basis of intent to deprive A\u00e9ro-postale of money. On each of the fourteen substantive mail fraud counts and the substantive wire fraud count, the jury found Finazzo guilty on the basis of A\u00e9ropos-tale\u2019s right to control use of its assets, but not on the basis of intent to deprive A\u00e9ro-postale of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Following the trial, Finazzo renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, moved for a new trial under Rule 33, and moved to arrest the judgment for lack of jurisdiction of the charged offense under Rule 34.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district court denied Finaz-zo\u2019s motions in a written order dated January 14, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">B. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">On August 6, 2014, the district court sentenced Dey to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. On August 20, 2014, the district court sentenced Finazzo to eight years\u2019 imprisonment on each of Counts Two through Sixteen and five years\u2019 imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ment on Count One \u2014 all to run concurrently \u2014 followed by three years\u2019 \u25a0 supervised release. Pursuant to an August 1, 2014 Memorandum and Order, the district court imposed a $13,690,822.94 restitution order jointly and severally on Finazzo and Dey. These consolidated appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">A. \u201cRight to Control\u201d Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Finazzo challenges the district court\u2019s \u201cright to control\u201d jury instructions for the substantive mail and wire fraud counts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He argues: (1) that the \u201cright to control\u201d assets does not constitute \u201cproperty\u201d under the mail and wire fraud statutes, because it is not \u201cobtainable,\u201d and (2) that the jury instructions improperly permitted him to be convicted without proof that he caused or intended to cause harm to A\u00e9ropostale.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We review challenged jury instructions <em>de novo, </em>but will only reverse if the instructions, taken as a whole, prejudiced the defendant. <em>United States v. Rutigliano, </em>790 F.3d 389, 401 (2d Cir. 2015). \u201cA jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Rowland, </em>826 F.3d 100, 115 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting <em>United States v. Roy, </em>783 F.3d 418, 420 (2d Cir. 2015) (per curiam)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">1. \u201cObtainable\u201d Property</p>\n<p id=\"aft-dedup-0\">Relying on <em>Sekhar v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2720, 186 L.Ed.2d 794 (2013), Finazzo contends that the district court\u2019s \u201cright to control\u201d jury instructions were erroneous because the district court failed to instruct the jury that the property sought through the fraud must be \u201cobtainable\u201d to satisfy the mail and wire fraud statutes. He argues that his mail and wire fraud convictions must therefore be vacated because A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s right to control its assets is not \u201cobtainable\u201d property. <em>See </em>Finazzo Br. at 62 (\u201cBecause A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s decision making, its corporate governance, was not property that could be obtained by Mr. Finazzo, his wire/mail fraud convictions must be vacated.\u201d). We reject his argument and hold that the mail and wire fraud statutes do not require that the property involved in the fraud be \u201cobtainable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">In <em>Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., </em>537 U.S. 393, 123 S.Ct. 1057, 154 L.Ed.2d 991 (2003), respondents brought a class action suit alleging that petitioners \u2014 abortion opponents who attempted to shut down health-care clinics that performed abortions \u2014 committed Hobbs Act extortion. <em>Id. </em>at 397-98, 123 S.Ct. 1057. Under the Hobbs Act, \u201cextortion\u201d is defined as \u201cthe <em>obtaining of property from another, </em>with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court ruled that the Hobbs Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201crequire[s] that a person must \u2018obtain\u2019 property from another party to commit extortion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 123 S.Ct. 1057. Because petitioners \u201cdid not obtain or attempt to obtain property from respondents\u201d by protesting abortion clinics, the Court concluded that they did not commit Hobbs Act extortion. <em>Id. </em>at 409, 123 S.Ct. 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In <em>Porcelli v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 157 (2d Cir. 2005), the appellant \u2014 an operator of multiple gas stations who devised a scheme to avoid paying New York state sales tax on his gasoline sales, <em>see id. </em>at 158 \u2014 invoked <em>Scheidler, </em>arguing that his mail fraud conviction should be vacated because the mail fraud statute \u201cshould ... be construed <em>in pari materia </em>with the Hobbs Act, to require as an element of the crime, that Appellant actually obtained or sought to obtain money or property,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 161. He claimed that since he already possessed the property he was convicted of scheming to acquire, \u201cobtaining\u201d that property was impossible. <em>Id. </em>at 161-62. We rejected the appellant\u2019s argument. We noted that \u201c[ajlthough written in the disjunctive, the mail [and wire] fraud statutefs] do[ ] not criminalize two separate acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162. Instead, the statute is interpreted to criminalize any scheme or artifice for obtaining money or property. <em>Id. </em>However, we ruled that a \u201cdefendant does not need to literally \u2018obtain\u2019 money or property to violate the statute[sj.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe fact that the Hobbs Act and the mail and wire fraud statutes contain the word \u2018obtain\u2019 does not necessitate imposing Scheidler\u2019s construction of a wholly separate statute onto this Court\u2019s pre-existing construction of the mail fraud statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the mail fraud statute requires that defendants obtain or seek to obtain money or property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">This view has been endorsed by our sister circuits. For instance, in <em>United States v. Welch, </em>327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003), the Tenth Circuit specifically stated that \u201c[i]n contrast to the Hobbs Act, neither the mail nor wire fraud statute requires that a defendant \u2018obtain\u2019 property before violating the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1108 n.27. In <em>United States v. Hedaithy, </em>392 F.3d 580 (3d Cir. 2004), the Third Circuit rejected defendants\u2019 argument that \u201cany violation of the mail fraud statute must involve a scheme for obtaining the victim\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602. The Court reasoned that the mail fraud statute \u201cwas ... intended to cover any scheme or artifice to defraud one of his money or property, <em>including </em>[but not limited to] any scheme for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent promises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court distinguished <em>Scheidler, </em>pointing out that \u201c[u]nlike the mail fraud statute, the Hobbs Act expressly requires the Government to prove that the defendant \u2018obtain[ed] property from another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at n.21 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2)). Similarly, in <em>United States v. Kincaid-Chauncey, </em>556 F.3d 923 (9th Cir. 2009), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Skilling v. United States, </em>561 U.S. 358, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010), the Ninth Circuit stated that \u201c[fjraud to obtain property is one means of violating [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1343, but it is not the only means for doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Subsequently, in <em>Sekhar, </em>the Supreme Court applied <em>Scheidler </em>and held that Hobbs Act extortion requires that the extorted property be \u201cobtainable.\u201d 133 S.Ct. at 2726. In <em>Sekhar, </em>the defendant threatened to disclose information about an alleged affair by the New York Comptroller\u2019s general counsel unless the general counsel recommended that the Comptroller invest in the defendant\u2019s investment fund. <em>Id. </em>at 2723. The defendant was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>victed of attempted Hobbs Act extortion. <em>Id. </em>Quoting <em>Scheidler, </em>the Court stated that \u201c[o]btaining property requires \u2018not only the deprivation but also the acquisition of property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2725 (quoting <em>Scheidler, </em>537 U.S. at 404, 123 S.Ct. 1057). The Court concluded that \u201c[t]he property extorted must therefore be transferable\u2014 that is, capable of passing from one person to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying this interpretation of the statute, the Court held that the property right at issue \u2014 a positive recommendation by the general counsel to invest in the defendant\u2019s fund \u2014 was not \u201cobtainable\u201d and therefore vacated the defendant\u2019s extortion conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 2727.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Finazzo argues that <em>Sekhar </em>should be extended to the mail and wire fraud statutes to require that defrauded property be obtainable, and that under such an interpretation his mail and wire fraud convictions cannot stand. We reject this argument.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Sekhar\u2019s conclusion that Hobbs Act property must be obtainable expressly rested on the fact that Hobbs Act extortion requires \u201cthe acquisition of property.\u201d 133 S.Ct. at 2725. Having ruled in <em>Porcelli </em>that, in contrast to the Hobbs Act extortion provision, the mail and wire fraud statutes do not require a defendant to obtain or seek to obtain property, we reject Finazzo\u2019s attempt to extend Sekhar\u2019s obtainability requirement to the mail and wire fraud statutes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">2. Scope of the \u201cRight to Control\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Finazzo also argues that the \u201cright to control\u201d jury instructions permitted him to be convicted without causing or intending to cause cognizable harm under the mail and wire fraud statutes, because the instructions erroneously described the \u201cmoney or property\u201d element.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>In relevant part, the district court instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">[I]n order to prove a scheme to defraud, the government must prove that the alleged scheme contemplated depriving another of money or property. Property' includes intangible interests such as the right to control the use of one\u2019s assets. This interest is injured when a victim is deprived of potentially valuable economic information it would consider valuable in deciding how to use its assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAbu\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">To act with \u201cintent to defraud\u201d means to act knowingly and with the specific intent to deceive, for the purpose of causing some financial or property loss to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Finazzo App\u2019x at 97-98. These instructions are consistent with our prior decisions and therefore not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In <em>United States v. Wallach, </em>935 F.2d 445 (2d Cir. 1991), we first addressed the extent of the \u201cright to control\u201d aspect of mail fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 462-63. We explained that \u201capplication of the [right to control] theory is predicated on a showing that some person or entity has been deprived of potentially valuable economic information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, the withholding or inaccurate reporting of information that could impact on economic decisions can provide the basis for a mail fraud prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">We considered the \u201cright to control\u201d further in <em>United States v. Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d 1208 (2d Cir. 1994). In <em>Mittelstaedt, </em>the defendant served as a consulting engineer for two Long Island communities. <em>Id. </em>at 1210. He used his position to influence the town planning boards with respect to real estate projects in which he had an undisclosed interest. <em>Id. </em>at 1211. He was charged with mail fraud, and the district court instructed the jury that \u201cthe right to material information concerning the expenditure of public monies[ ] is a property right, intangible though it is, and it is included in the mail fraud statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1216. The defendant contended that the district court erred in refusing to give a proposed charge that the undisclosed information must have \u201cplaced the Village at an[ ] <em>economic </em>disadvantage ... [in other words,] ... such hidden interest [must have] caused the Village to purchase the property at a higher cost than it would have otherwise paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1216-17 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Government contended that it did not matter whether the towns would have suffered economic loss if the scheme had been successful \u201cbecause the loss of the \u2018right to control\u2019 the expenditure of public funds, through the loss of the ability to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>fully informed decision, is sufficient to constitute mail fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We disagreed with the Government and ruled that \u201c[wjhere an individual standing in a fiduciary relation to another conceals material information that the fiduciary is legally obliged to disclose, that non-disclosure does not give rise to mail fraud liability unless the omission can or does result in some tangible harm.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>To give rise to liability, \u201cthe information withheld either must be of some independent value or must bear on the ultimate value of the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201clack of information that might have an impact on the decision regarding where government money is spent, without more, is not a tangible harm and therefore does not constitute a deprivation of section 1341 \u2018property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, \u201c[t]o convict, the government had to establish that the omission caused (or was intended to cause) actual harm to the village of a pecuniary nature or that the village could haVe negotiated a better deal for itself if it had not been deceived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we concluded that the jury instructions were erroneous because they could have supported a conviction for a mere breach of fiduciary duty that did not cause tangible harm. <em>Id. </em>at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">In subsequent cases, we further examined jury instructions describing the scope of the \u201cright to control\u201d property under the mail and wire fraud statutes. For example, in <em>United States v. Dinome, </em>86 F.3d 277 (2d Cir. 1996), the defendant was charged with mail and wire fraud in connection with falsely stating his income to a bank to obtain a mortgage. <em>Id. </em>at 278-79. The district court instructed the jury that: \u201cUnder the mail fraud statute, the definition of property includes intangible property interests such as the right to control the use of one\u2019s own assets. This interest is injured when a person is deprived of <em>information he would consider valuable in deciding how to use his assets.\u201d Id. </em>at 284. Notably, we stated that that instruction \u201cmight be deemed facially at odds with the <em>Mittelstaedt </em>formulation that \u2018lack of information that might have,an impact on the decision regarding where [the defrauded party\u2019s] money is spent, without more, is not a tangible harm and therefore does not constitute a deprivation of section 1341 \u201cproperty.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d at 1217). Nevertheless, we upheld the jury instructions because, under the facts of that case, we did not believe the instructions prejudiced the defendant since the information withheld from the bank \u201csig-2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>nificantly diminished the ult\u00edmate value of the [mortgage] transaction to the bank.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In a summary order, <em>United States v. Viloski, </em>557 Fed.Appx. 28 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order), we more recently reviewed the requirements to support a conviction under the \u201cright to control\u201d theory of mail and wire fraud. In <em>Viloski, </em>the defendant acted as a broker and consultant for development projects of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, and passed on portions of his consulting fee to a Dick\u2019s employee as kickbacks for directing the business from Dick\u2019s to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 31. On appeal, the defendant argued that the indictment charging him with fraud did not adequately allege a violation of the right to control assets. <em>Id. </em>at 32-33. The indictment alleged that the object of the defendant\u2019s scheme was \u201cto obtain money and property, and to deprive Dick\u2019s of potentially valuable information that could impact on its economic decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33 (internal quotation marks omitted). We rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, explaining that \u201c[t]he deprivation of information that affects economic decisions is precisely the type of situation in which we have approved [the right to control] theory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant also challenged the district court\u2019s jury instructions on the \u201cright to control.\u201d The district court instructed the jury that it could find deprivation of property \u201cif [it found] beyond a reasonable doubt that an employee or officer of Dick\u2019s either failed to disclose or inaccurately reported <em>economically material information </em>that the officer or employee had reason to believe would have caused Dick\u2019s to change its business conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34 (internal quotation marks omitted). We upheld that instruction, ruling that \u201c[t]he requirement that the information be economically material avoids the <em>Mittelsta[e]dt </em>problem of deprivation of information that could not lead to tangible harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also held that there was sufficient evidence to satisfy the tangible-harm requirement: \u201c[T]he deprivation of information regarding ... kickbacks was material and potentially could result in tangible harm because Dick\u2019s could have negotiated better deals for itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In <em>United States v. Binday, </em>804 F.3d 558 (2d Cir. 2015), the defendants fraudulently applied for life insurance policies on \u201cstraw insureds\u201d by claiming that the policies were being obtained for legitimate estate-planning purposes, but instead sold the policies to investors. <em>Id. </em>at 564-67. The jury instructions stated that \u201cthe loss of the right to control money or property constitutes deprivation of money or property only when the scheme, if it were to succeed, would result in economic harm to the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581. The instruction further clarified: \u201cIf all the government proves is that under the scheme the insurance companies would enter into transactions that they otherwise would not have entered into, without proving that the ostensible victims would thereby have suffered some economic harm, then the government will not have met its burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendants claimed that the jury instructions permitted conviction on a \u201cright to control\u201d theory absent a showing of cognizable harm. <em>Id. </em>at 581-82. We had no difficulty rejecting that argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ment, reasoning that the charge \u201cdirectly explained\u201d that conviction required the government to prove cognizable harm to the insurers through deprivation of information that was of economic consequence. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The common thread of these decisions is that misrepresentations or nondisclosure of information cannot support a conviction under the \u201cright to control\u201d theory unless those misrepresentations or non-disclosures can or do result in tangible economic harm. This economic harm can be manifested directly \u2014 such as by increasing the price the victim paid for a good \u2014 or indirectly \u2014 such as by providing the victim with lower-quality goods than it otherwise could have received. <em>See Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d at 1217 (\u201c[T]he government had to establish that the omission caused (or was intended to cause) actual harm to the [victim] of a pecuniary nature <em>or </em>that the [victim] could have negotiated a better deal for itself if it had not been deceived.\u201d); <em>United States v. Schwartz, </em>924 F.2d 410, 420-21 (2d Cir. 1991) (affirming wire fraud convictions for misrepresentations to seller that night-vision goggles would not be used illegally, even though the seller suffered no direct pecuniary harm, in part because the use of the night-vision goggles to violate arms export laws cost the seller \u201cgood will\u201d). However, not every non-disclosure or misrepresentation that could affect someone\u2019s decision of how to use his or her assets is sufficient to support a mail or wire fraud conviction. <em>See Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d at 1217. The fraudulent scheme must implicate tangible economic harm.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">We are satisfied that the district court\u2019s jury instructions adequately conveyed the scope of the \u201cright to control\u201d theory. The district court informed the jury that the \u201cright to control\u201d one\u2019s assets is injured \u201cwhen a victim is deprived of potentially valuable economic information it would consider valuable in deciding how to use its assets.\u201d Finazzo App\u2019x at 98. Depriving a victim of \u201cpotentially valuable\u201d information <em>necessarily </em>creates a risk of tangible economic harm. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1784 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201cvaluable\u201d as \u201c[w]orth a good price\u201d or \u201chaving financial or market value\u201d); Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 1305 (10th ed. 1997) (defining \u201cvaluable\u201d as \u201chaving monetary value\u201d). Therefore, by requiring the jury to find that A\u00e9ropostale was deprived of \u201cpotentially valuable economic information,\u201d the jury instructions adequately conveyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the requirement that the deprivation of the right to control assets must be capable of creating tangible economic harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Moreover, we have repeatedly used the phrase \u201cpotentially valuable economic information\u201d to describe the scope of the \u201cright to control\u201d theory. In <em>WaMach, </em>we stated that \u201capplication of the [right to control] theory is predicated on a showing that some person or entity has been deprived of potentially valuable economic information.\u201d 935 F.2d at 462-63. We used this same language again in <em>United States v. D\u2019Amato, </em>39 F.3d 1249, 1257 (2d Cir. 1994) (\u201cTh[e] [right to control] theory is predicated on a showing that some person or entity has been deprived of potentially valuable economic information.\u201d (quoting <em>Wallach, </em>935 F.2d at 462-63) (internal quotation marks omitted)), and in <em>Dinome, </em>86 F.3d at 283 (\u201cThis right to control theory is predicated on a showing that some person or entity has been deprived of potentially valuable economic information.\u201d (quoting <em>D'Amato, </em>39 F.3d at 1257) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also United States v. Tagliaferri, </em>648 Fed.Appx. 99, 103 (2d Cir. 2016) (summary order); <em>Viloski, </em>557 Fed.Appx. at 32-33; <em>United States v. Levis, </em>488 Fed.Appx. 481, 485 (2d Cir. 2012) (summary order). Most recently, in <em>Binday, </em>we used this language in describing in detail the scope of the \u201cright to control\u201d theory. 804 F.3d at 570. We explained that \u201c[i]t is not sufficient ... to show merely that the victim would not have entered into a discretionary economic transaction but for the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe \u2018right to control one\u2019s assets\u2019 does not render every transaction induced by deceit actionable under the mail and wire fraud statutes. Rather, the deceit must deprive the victim \u2018of potentially valuable economic information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Furthermore, the jury instructions in this case closely track the jury instructions in <em>Viloski </em>\u2014 which we upheld \u2014 far more than they track the jury instructions in <em>Dinome </em>\u2014 with which we had more difficulty. In <em>Dinome, </em>the jury instructions stated that the \u201cright to control\u201d is injured when a person is deprived of \u201cinformation he would consider valuable in deciding how to use his assets.\u201d <em>Dinome, </em>86 F.3d at 280. We concluded that that instruction might have vitiated Mittelstaedt\u2019s tangible-harm requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 284. In contrast, the jury instructions in <em>Viloski </em>required that Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods be deprived of \u201ceconomically material information that the officer or employee had reason to believe would have caused Dick\u2019s to change its business conduct.\u201d 557 Fed.Appx. at 34 (emphasis omitted). We specifically stated that the \u201crequirement that the information be economically material\u201d rendered the jury instruction proper under <em>Mittelstaedt. Id. </em>Similarly, requiring that a victim be deprived of \u201cpotentially valuable economic information\u201d \u2014 rather than merely \u201cinformation,\u201d as in <em>Dinome </em>\u2014 distinguishes this case from <em>Dinome, </em>especially where the added language is so frequently used by this Court to describe the \u201cright to control\u201d theory\u2019s tangible-harm requirement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district. court\u2019s jury instructions adequately conveyed the scope of the \u201cright to control\u201d theory.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence: Right to Control</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Finazzo also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his mail and wire fraud convictions under the \u201cright to control\u201d theory. \u201cWe review de novo a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction by viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all inferences in the government\u2019s favor and deferring to the jury\u2019s assessments of the witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Daugerdas, </em>837 F.3d 212, 221 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). &lt;cWe will sustain the jury\u2019s verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">There was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Finazzo intended to cause, (and did cause) tangible economic harm to A\u00e9ropostale. Through his fraudulent scheme to deprive A\u00e9ropos-tale of information regarding his related-party transactions, Finazzo used his control over A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s vendor selection and pricing to steer A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s business towards South Bay, which provided inferi- or products and charged higher prices than other vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">As described more fully above, the Government presented many witnesses who testified that Finazzo had control over A\u00e9-ropostale\u2019s vendor selection and pricing in the graphic T-shirt and fleece businesses. For example, Julian Geiger \u2014 A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s CEO \u2014 testified that Finazzo was primarily responsible for A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s vendor selection and vendor pricing. CFO Michael Cunningham similarly stated that the quantities of goods bought from vendors needed to be approved by Finazzo and that Finazzo negotiated the final price with vendors. Other A\u00e9ropostale personnel testified similarly. For example, General Counsel Slezak testified that Finazzo \u201cdecided what type of product we would buy, how much of it, [and] which vendors would manufacture the product.\u201d Dey App\u2019x at 829. Meanwhile, John DiBarto, a merchandising manager, explained that. Finazzo was responsible for negotiating prices for graphic T-shirts with South Bay. He stated that asking for a reduction in price from South Bay would have been futile because Finazzo was \u201cin charge of that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1128-29. Megan Lauritano; a product manager, testified that Finazzo determined the price and quantity of fleece <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>orders from South Bay. In discussing vendor structure, Finazzo himself said \u201cI guess I can make that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1175. The evidence also indicated that Fi-nazzo would not have been able to achieve this control without misrepresenting his interest in South Bay: Peter Conefry testified that Finazzo decided not to disclose his interest in South Bay to A\u00e9ropostale because Finazzo \u201cdidn\u2019t think A\u00e9ropostale would go for it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The evidence was certainly sufficient for the jury to conclude that Finazzo exercised his control to steer business to South Bay and to set the prices A\u00e9ropostale paid South Bay. Moreover, he actively discouraged \u2014 and rejected \u2014 use of other vendors. For example, Jennifer Heiser, an employee who reported to Finazzo, testified that she placed 97-99% of her graphic T-shirt orders with South Bay, as a result of pressure from Finazzo. She also stated that Finazzo fired an employee who challenged him regarding the use of South Bay as a graphic T-shirt vendor. DiBarto recalled that Finazzo yelled at him when he suggested comparing South Bay\u2019s prices with another vendor. DiBarto also testified to an email in which Finazzo said he would \u201cbe swift in [his] actions\u201d against an employee who had questioned South Bay\u2019s costing structure. <em>Id. </em>at 1144-45. Jill Kro-nenberg, the head of the Women\u2019s Division, testified that she shifted A\u00e9ropos-tale\u2019s women\u2019s graphic T-shirt business from Mias to South Bay because she \u201chad no choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 994-95. Furthermore, Geiger and Cunningham both testified that Finazzo became angry and would end the conversation when scrutiny was placed on South Bay at executive meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">There was also ample evidence that, in steering business towards South Bay, Fi-nazzo tangibly harmed A\u00e9ropostale. Slezak and Geiger both testified that Finazzo\u2019s scheme directly prevented A\u00e9ropostale from receiving the best possible bargain. Indeed, Geiger and Heiser testified that A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s profit margins on graphic T-shirts were less than their profit margins on other similar products. Furthermore, Kronenberg and Jinah Jung, a product manager, stated that South Bay\u2019s women\u2019s graphic T-shirts and fleeces were inferior in quality to other vendors\u2019 products, and Heiser testified that the near-exclusive use of South Bay for men\u2019s graphic T-shirts prevented A\u00e9ropostale from receiving the best quality products. This provided sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that A\u00e9ropos-tale was harmed by its dealings with South Bay.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The Government also presented multiple specific instances of harm. Geiger and Cunningham both testified that Finazzo refused to shift 25% of South Bay\u2019s graphic T-shirt business overseas, despite estimates that it would save A\u00e9ropostale $5-6 million. Jung testified to an email Finazzo sent rejecting Jung\u2019s proposal to save $300,000 on a fleece order by using a different vendor. Lauritano and George Justin Meno, also a product manager, both explained that South Bay had significant delivery delays on fleece products- that A\u00e9-ropostale did not experience with other fleece vendors. Meno estimated that the delays that occurred in 2005 and 2006 cost A\u00e9ropostale approximately $1.8 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Thus, there was sufficient evidence that, by depriving A\u00e9ropostale of information regarding his interest in South Bay, Finaz-zo was able to steer a significant amount of business to South Bay in a manner that inflicted tangible economic harm on A\u00e9ro-postale. The jury could reasonably con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>elude that A\u00e9ropostale \u201ccould have negotiated a better deal for itself if it had not been deceived\u201d by Finazzo, <em>Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d at 1217, and that Finazzo\u2019s participation in the scheme evinced fraudulent intent, <em>see D\u2019Amato, </em>39 F.3d at 1257 (\u201cWhen the necessary result of the actor\u2019s scheme is to injure others, fraudulent intent may be inferred from the scheme itself.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Finazzo\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Starr, </em>816 F.2d 94 (2d Cir. 1987) is misplaced. In <em>Starr, </em>the defendants operated a bulk mail service. <em>Id. </em>at 95.. Customers calculated postage for their mail themselves and paid the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 96. The defendants hid mail subject to higher postage rates among lower-priced mail, allowing the defendants to pay lower postage than the customers had paid them. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that there was insufficient evidence of intent to inflict harm on the customers. <em>Id. </em>at 99. We reasoned that the customers \u201creceived exactly what they paid for,\u201d because the defendants \u201cdid in fact mail their customers\u2019 brochures promptly as promised and caused them to arrive at the correct destination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98-99. Finazzo argues that A\u00e9ropostale also received the value of its bargain with South Bay, which he claims was unaffected by his interest in South Bay. This argument misses a crucial distinction. In <em>Starr, </em>the customers freely bargained for a service and received that service. In contrast, A\u00e9ropostale did not freely bargain with South Bay. Instead, Finazzo exercised his control to steer business towards South Bay and to commit A\u00e9ropostale to paying excessive prices. By inducing A\u00e9ropostale to enter into disadvantageous bargains, Fi-nazzo harmed A\u00e9ropostale because it could have negotiated a better deal absent Fi-nazzo\u2019s fraudulent scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Finally, Finazzo argues that the jury\u2019s special verdict foreclosed a finding of intended harm. He claims that the Government only attempted to prove that Finazzo harmed A\u00e9ropostale by depriving it of money. He then points to the jury\u2019s finding that Finazzo was not guilty on the basis of the intent to deprive A\u00e9ropostale of money for each substantive mail and wire fraud count<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and suggests that no other intended harm could sustain the \u201cright to control\u201d convictions. Even if this conclusion by the jury could be interpreted as precluding consideration of the undisclosed kickbacks Finazzo received, Finazzo\u2019s argument ignores the substantial evidence that he harmed A\u00e9ropostale in more ways than simply \u2022 depriving it of money through his receipt of kickbacks. For instance, as noted above, the jury heard testimony that the products South Bay provided were of inferior quality. It also heard substantial testimony regarding South Bay\u2019s delivery delays for fleece products. Thus, the jury\u2019s findings regarding Finazzo\u2019s intent to deprive A\u00e9ropostale of money do not foreclose the \u201cright to control\u201d convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">We therefore hold that there was sufficient evidence to support Finazzo\u2019s convictions for depriving A\u00e9ropostale of its right to control its assets.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>C. Restitution</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">On August 1, 2014, prior' to sentencing, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order that, <em>inter alia, </em>explained the court\u2019s restitution order against Finazzo and Dey. The court began by concluding that the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, applied. The court noted that, for the purposes of restitution, it would only consider Defendants\u2019 convictions for conspiracy to violate the Travel Act and Finazzo\u2019s conviction for mail fraud conspiracy on the basis of intent to deprive A\u00e9ropostale of money. The court stated that it therefore need not reach Finazzo\u2019s argument that convictions predicated on depriving A\u00e9ropostale of its right to control property did not constitute offenses against property within the meaning of the MVRA. The court concluded that \u201cthe MVRA unquestionably applies to Finazzo\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to commit mail fraud with the intent to deprive A\u00e9ropostale of money.\u201d Dey App\u2019x at 2531. It further concluded that Defendants\u2019 Travel Act conspiracy \u201cwas plainly committed in a fraudulent and deceitful manner, which renders it an offense against property within the meaning of the MVRA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2535.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Having determined that the MVRA applied, the district court then concluded that A\u00e9ropostale was directly harmed by the Defendants\u2019 conspiracy. The court explained that \u201c[Defendants\u2019 scheme inflated prices A\u00e9ropostale paid to South Bay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2539. Specifically, the court found that Defendants \u201cduped A\u00e9ropostale into paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to its own senior executive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2539-40. Those kickbacks were \u201cdrawn directly from A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s payments for South Bay\u2019s goods,\u201d and \u201cA\u00e9ropostale \u2018would not have made th[ose] payments to the defendants] had they known about the fraudulent scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2540 (quoting <em>United States v. Archer, </em>671 F.3d 149, 171 (2d Cir. 2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Next, the district court stated that the value of the kickbacks received by Finazzo was a reasonable measure of the pecuniary loss suffered by A\u00e9ropostale. The court acknowledged that, for the purposes of restitution, a defendant\u2019s illegal gains cannot be substituted for a victim\u2019s actual loss. However, it pointed out that, in <em>United States v. Zangari, </em>677 F.3d 86 (2d Cir. 2012), this Court recognized that \u201cthere may be cases where there is a direct correlation between [the defendant\u2019s] gain and [the victim\u2019s] loss, such that the defendant\u2019s gain can act as a <em>measure </em>of \u2014 as opposed to a <em>substitute </em>for \u2014 the victim\u2019s loss.\u201d Dey App\u2019x at 2544 (quoting <em>Zangari, </em>677 F.3d at 93). The district court ultimately concluded that this case fell within Zangari\u2019s \u201cdirect correlation\u201d exception because \u201cthe kickbacks received by Finaz-zo accurately and reasonably capture[d] the character of the fraud in this case, which relied on extracting substantial hidden profits from the amounts A\u00e9ropostale paid to South Bay.\u201d Dey App\u2019x at 2546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Addressing the Defendants\u2019 argument that the Government failed to offer adequate evidence of inflated prices, the court stated that the Defendants had failed to rebut the fact that \u201ca portion of every payment A\u00e9ropostale made went toward generating secret kickbacks for Finazzo\u201d that were \u201cnot justified by any features of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>South Bay\u2019s business model.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2549. Furthermore, the court noted that the Government <em>had </em>offered evidence of inflated prices, including Jung\u2019s and Geiger\u2019s testimony. Thus, the court ruled that there was \u201ca direct correlation between the prices A\u00e9ropostale paid, the profits South Bay accrued, and the kickbacks Dey paid to Finazzo from those profits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2550.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The court held the Defendants jointly and severally liable for restitution to A\u00e9ro-postale in the amount of $25,790,822.94\u2014 the value of the kickbacks received by Finazzo from 2002 through 2006. However, the court offset that amount by $5 million and $7.1 million previously paid in civil settlements by Finazzo and Dey respectively, leaving $13,690,822.94 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Finazzo and Dey challenge the district court\u2019s restitution calculation, arguing that the district court improperly used Finazzo\u2019s gain as a measure of A\u00e9ro-postale\u2019s loss. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s restitution order for abuse of discretion, which we will identify only if the order \u2018rests on an error of law, a clearly erroneous finding of fact, or otherwise cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

District courts must order restitution where,\u201can identifiable victim or victims has suffered a ... pecuniary loss.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(l)(B). The Government bears the burden of proving a victim\u2019s actual loss by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Zangari, </em>677 F.3d at 92. However, the MVRA \u201crequires only a reasonable approximation of losses supported by a sound methodology.\u201d <em>United States v.

Boccagna, </em>450 F.3d 107, 115 (2d Cir. 2006)). Since' the purpose of restitution is compensatory and the MVRA limits restitution to the amount of each victim\u2019s losses, \u201ca restitution order must be tied to the victim\u2019s actual, provable, loss.\u201d <em>Zangari, </em>677 F.3d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Accordingly, in <em>Zangan, </em>we held that a district court \u201cmay not substitute a defendant\u2019s ill-gotten gains for the victim\u2019s actual loss\u201d when calculating restitution under the MVRA. <em>Id. </em>at 93. We noted, however, that \u201cthere may be cases where there is a direct correlation between gain and loss, such that the defendant\u2019s gain can act as a <em>measure </em>of \u2014 as opposed to a <em>substitute </em>for \u2014 the victim\u2019s loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93. In <em>Zangari, </em>the defendant induced the victims to pay sham finder\u2019s fees as part of their collateral in a stock-loan transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 89. We concluded that there was not a direct correlation between the defendant\u2019s gain and the victims\u2019 loss, because the collateral would eventually be returned at the end of the stock-loan period. <em>Id. </em>at 93-94. Thus, the victims\u2019 loss could only have come in the form of opportunity , cost, which was not directly correlated with the defendant\u2019s gain. <em>Id. </em>However, we cited <em>United States v. Berardini, </em>112 F.3d 606 (2d Cir. 1997), as an example of a case in which there <em>was </em>a direct correlation between the defendant\u2019s gain and the victims\u2019 loss. <em>See Zangari, </em>677 F.3d at 93. There, the defendant\u2019s gain constituted income from fraudulent telemarketing sales. <em>Berardini, </em>112 F.3d at 607-10. A direct corre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>lation existed in those circumstances because every dollar gained by the defendant was necessarily lost by victims who paid for the fraudulent products.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Here, the district court concluded that there was a direct correlation between Fi-nazzo\u2019s gains and A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s losses. It reasoned that \u201ca portion of every payment A\u00e9ropostale made went toward generating secret kickbacks for Finazzo [that were] ... not justified by any features of South Bay\u2019s business model.\u201d Dey App\u2019x at 2549. However, we are not convinced that the district court employed a sound methodology that supported a conclusion that there was a \u201cdirect correlation\u201d between Finaz-zo\u2019s gains and A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Finazzo\u2019s gains constitute the kickbacks he received from Dey for steering A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s business to South Bay and negotiating the prices paid for South Bay\u2019s products. It certainly can be assumed that Dey would not have paid Fi-nazzo the kickbacks unless the fraudulent scheme was profitable for Dey. It is possible that Finazzo made the kickback scheme profitable for Dey <em>solely </em>by inflating the prices A\u00e9ropostale paid South Bay, in which case Finazzo\u2019s gain would equal A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s loss. <em>See United States v. Gamma Tech Indus., Inc., </em>265 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir. 2001) (suggesting that \u201ca natural result of paying kickbacks is inflation of the charges in order to make the scheme profitable for the payer of the kickbacks\u201d); <em>United States v. Vaghela, </em>169 F.3d 729, 736 (11th Cir. 1999) (\u201c[I]t is not unreasonable to assume that [the victim] was overcharged in the amount of the kickbacks, and that the loss [the victim] suffered was equivalent to that amount.\u201d). However, unlike the defendant\u2019s gain in <em>Berardini, </em>loss to A\u00e9ropostale is not a <em>necessary </em>consequence of all the kickbacks Finazzo received. For instance, even without inflating the price \u2014 and therefore, without inflicting pecuniary loss on A\u00e9ro-postale \u2014 South Bay would receive some profit from any sales to A\u00e9ropostale. A portion of Finazzo\u2019s -worth to South Bay may, therefore, simply derive from steering additional business to South Bay at a <em>non-inflated </em>price. Similarly, Finazzo\u2019s conduct may have reduced transactions costs for South Bay. These factors could increase Finazzo\u2019s worth to Dey and therefore make the kickback scheme profitable for Dey, without inflicting pecuniary loss on A\u00e9ropostale.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Given that we require a \u201cdirect correlation\u201d between a defendant\u2019s gain and a victim\u2019s loss in order for restitution to be measured according to that gain, it is not a sufficiently sound methodology for the district court to merely assume that the kickbacks were <em>solely </em>justified by inflated prices. Instead, the district court must employ a methodology to determine whether the entirety of Finazzo\u2019s kickbacks was solely derived from activity that caused loss to A\u00e9ropostale. We therefore vacate and remand the district court\u2019s restitution calculation regarding Finazzo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and Dey, so that the district court may employ a methodology to determine what portion of Finazzo\u2019s gain is directly correlated with A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s loss, or employ some other means of calculating A\u00e9ropos-tale\u2019s loss.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM in part and VACATE and REMAND in part for further proceedings the district court\u2019s judgments.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-11\">.

In an effort to apply <em>Sekhar </em>s holding to the mail and wire fraud statutes, Finazzo points to <em>Sekhar's </em>mention of <em>Cleveland v. United States, </em>531 U.S. 12, 121 S.Ct. 365, 148 L.Ed.2d 221 (2000), a mail-fraud case. <em>See Sekhar, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2727. However, <em>Cleveland </em>did not concern an \"obtainability\u201d requirement. Instead, the <em>Cleveland </em>Court addressed the definition of \"property.\u201d <em>See </em>531 U.S. at 15, 121 S.Ct. 365. The Court concluded that \u00a7 1341 \"requires the object of the fraud to be \u2018property\u2019 in the victim's hands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 121 S.Ct. 365. Since a Louisiana video-poker license was not \u201cproperty\u201d of the state before it was issued, defrauding Louisiana to obtain such a license did not constitute mail fraud. <em>See id. </em>at 20-27, 121 S.Ct. 365. Requiring that the object of the fraud be property of the victim is separate from requiring that it be obtainable by the defendant. <em>See Hedaithy, </em>392 F.3d at 602 (\"[T]he <em>[Cleveland] </em>Court was not setting out a requirement that a mail fraud scheme must be designed to 'obtain' property.

Since <em>Cleveland </em>does not relate to an obtainability requirement, we decline to construe <em>Sekhar's </em>reference to <em>Cleveland </em>as an extension of <em>Sek-har's </em>obtainability holding to the mail and wire fraud statutes. Rather, we read the Court's use of <em>Cleveland </em>to merely support its explanation of why the Government in <em>Sekhar </em>only \"expend[ed] minuscule effort\u201d defending the verdict form's definition of the property extorted: the verdict form\u2019s definition of the extorted property \u2014 \"the General Counsel's recommendation to approve the Commitment\u201d \u2014 likely did not constitute property of the State. <em>Sekhar, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2727 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b147-12\">.The parties discuss the question of whether the jury instructions allowed conviction under the \u201cright to control\u201d theory without harm or intent to harm as relating to both (1) the \u201cmateriality\u201d of one's property rights under a right-to-control theory, and (2) the fraudu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>lent-intent requirement under the \"scheme to defraud\u201d element. In <em>United States v. Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d 1208 (2d Cir. 1994), we framed the harm requirement under a \"right to control\u201d theory as being governed by the extent of the \"money or property\u201d element of the mail and wire fraud statutes. <em>See id. </em>at 1216-18. As discussed <em>infra, </em>we indicated that, to constitute \"property,\u201d the deprivation of the right to control one\u2019s assets must be \"material, \u201d which requires that the deprivation \"can or does result in some tangible harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217. We have also discussed the requisite harm under a \"right to control\u201d theory as being a question of fraudulent intent, requiring that defendants contemplated some actual, cognizable harm or injury to their victims. <em>See, e.g., Binday, </em>804 F.3d at 569-70; <em>United States v. Rossomando, </em>144 F.3d 197, 201 n.5 (2d Cir. 1998). Although analyzed in the context of different elements, these inquiries contemplate the same underlying issue in this case \u2014 whether the jury instructions allowed the jury to convict Finazzo without proof that the scheme harmed or could have harmed A\u00e9ropostale. We believe the issue in this case is best understood as a question of whether Aeropostale\u2019s property rights were implicated. Therefore, we analyze it under the \"money or property\u201d element, while still applying our decisions under the fraudulent-intent requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">. It is important to note that the concept of ''materiality\u201d discussed in <em>Mittelstaedt </em>is distinct from the separate requirement under the mail and wire fraud statutes that the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations be material. <em>See United States v. Autuori, </em>212 F.3d 105, 115 (2d Cir. 2000) (listing \"the materiality of the misrepresentations\u201d as a separate requirement under the \"scheme to defraud\u201d element). \"In general, a false statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence, or is capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.\u201d <em>United States v. Corsey, </em>723 F.3d 366, 373 (2d Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 16, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999)) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The question of whether a defendant's misrepresentation was capable of influencing a decisionmaker should not be conflated with <em>Mittelstaedt\u2019s </em>requirement that that misrepresentation be capable of resulting in \"tangible harm.\" 31 F.3d at 1217. It is certainly possible for a misrepresentation to influence decisionmaking in a manner that nevertheless does not produce tangible harm. In fact, <em>Mittelstaedt </em>specifically held that its \"materiality\u201d requirement is not <em>necessarily </em>satisfied where a misrepresentation influences a decisionmaker. <em>See id. </em>(\"[L]ack of information that might have an impact on the decision regarding where ... money is spent, without more, is not a tangible harm.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b150-5\">. In a footnote in a summary order, <em>United States v. Levis, </em>488 Fed.Appx. 481 (2d Cir. 2012) (summary order), we cast doubt on the continued applicability of <em>Mittelstaedt, </em>citing <em>Di\u00f1\u00f3me </em>as an example of a case in which we had \"limited [Mittelstaedt] to its compelling factual setting.\" <em>Id. </em>at 486 n.2. However, <em>Dinome\u2019s </em>holding does not call into question the applicability of <em>Mittelstaedt\u2019s </em>tangible harm requirement. Instead, <em>Dinome </em>merely held that, even if the jury instruction violated <em>Mit-telstaedt, </em>the defendant could not demonstrate prejudice on the facts of that case. <em>See Dinome, </em>86 F.3d at 284.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">. To illustrate these distinctions, consider a scenario in which a clothing retailer does business with a supplier, and the supplier misrepresents its identity to the retailer. The nature of this misrepresentation determines whether it is actionable under the \"right to control\u201d theory. Let us assume that the supplier falsely represents itself as a different, well-established supplier with a reputation for high-quality goods. Due to this misrepresentation, the supplier is able to charge the retailer higher prices for its goods than it otherwise could have charged. In this case, the \u201cright to control\u201d theory is implicated because the seller's misrepresentation resulted in economic harm to the retailer, in the form of higher prices. Consider, instead, a situation in which the supplier is known to use child labor and misrepresents its identity to conceal that fact from the retailer, who has pledged not to transact with the supplier in order to avoid angering its customers. The \"right to control\u201d theory may be implicated if the Government can prove that the reputa-tional harm to the retailer caused by the misrepresentation could lead or did lead to economic losses. However, what if the supplier misrepresents its identity merely, because the retailer's board of directors has agreed not to transact business with the supplier due to inter-personal animus? In that situation, the Government would likely be able to easily prove that the supplier\u2019s misrepresentation affected the retailer's decisionmaking on how to use its assets. However, since the misrepresentation does not seem to implicate tangible economic harm to the retailer, the \"right to control\u201d theory would not be applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\">. Finazzo also argues that the jury instructions were erroneous because they allowed conviction if Finazzo \"intended to deprive A\u00e9ropostale of information that A\u00e9ropostale would <em>subjectively </em>consider valuable in its decision making.\" Finazzo Br. at 57 (emphasis added). We have not decided whether <em>Mittelstaedt's </em>tangible-harm requirement requires objective harm, or whether subjective harm to the victim would suffice. However, we cast doubt on the jury instructions in <em>Dinome, </em>which merely referenced the victim's subjective valuation of the deprived information. See <em>Dinome, </em>86 F.3d at 284 (stating that jury instructions that provided that someone\u2019s right to control property is injured when he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\"deprived of information he would consider valuable in deciding how to use his assets\u201d might be deemed \"facially at odds with the <em>Mittelstaedt </em>formulation\u201d). We need not decide here whether Mittelstaedt\u2019s tangible-harm requirement is only satisfied by objective harm, because, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that it is, the jury instructions were proper. Although the district court's instruction did include a subjective element, requiring that the victim \u201cwould consider [the deprived information] valuable in deciding how to use its assets,\u201d Finazzo App\u2019x at 98, the instruction explained that the information must be \"potentially valuable economic information\u201d prior to addressing the victim's subjective valuation of the information, <em>id. </em>This conveyed to the jury that the deprived information must also be objectively valuable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\">. While we hold that the district court\u2019s jury instructions were adequate to convey the tangible-harm requirement, we believe the requirement could be more directly communicated as follows: \"The loss of the right to control money or property only constitutes deprivation of money or property if the scheme could cause or did cause tangible economic harm to the victim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\">.

At trial the Government presented evidence through Special Agent Braconi of the amount of kickbacks received by Finazzo for four years of the scheme to defraud (2002 through 2006), but it did not present evidence of the specific amounts of kickbacks Finazzo received for each of the payments set forth in the separate wire and mail fraud counts. As to those substantive counts (two through sixteen), the Government's evidence included gross amounts sent by check and wire from A\u00e9ropostale to South Bay to satisfy the respective \"mailing\u201d and \"use of the wires\u201d elements of each of those counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b155-11\">. Finazzo also argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions because there was no evidence that A\u00e9ropos-tale's corporate governance was obtainable property. Having determined that the mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>and wire fraud statutes do not require property to be obtainable, <em>supra </em>at 105-07, we reject this challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\">. The district court concluded, in the alternative, that the Victim and Witness Protection Act (\u201cVWPA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663, supported restitution as well. However, we need not address this issue, since the Defendants do not challenge the applicability of the MVRA on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. To illustrate, let us assume that it costs vendors $3 to produce a graphic T-shirt, and that a non-inflated price for vendors selling graphic T-shirts is $5. Thus, without inflicting loss on A\u00e9ropostale, a vendor would gain $2 in profit from every sale to A\u00e9ropostale. Without Finazzo's presence, South Bay would make no sales and therefore gain $0 in profit. With Finazzo\u2019s assistance, let's assume that South Bay would sell A\u00e9ropostale 100 graphic T-shirts, and that the price South Bay charged A\u00e9ropostale would be inflated to $6. South Bay would gain $3 profit per shirt, for a total of $300 of profit. In this case, Dey might be willing to split the $300 profits with Finazzo. After all, Dey would still be left with $150 under the scheme, instead of $0 without it. Meanwhile, though, A\u00e9ropostale would only have lost $100 \u2014 the additional $1 per shirt that it paid above the non-inflated price. Thus, in this example, even though Finazzo inflated the price A\u00e9ropostale paid, there is not a \"direct correlation\" between Finazzo\u2019s gain ($150) and A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s loss ($100).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b159-15\">.
