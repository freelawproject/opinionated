On April 10, 2014, the district court (Dearie, <em>J.) </em>sentenced each of the three Defendant-Appellants principally to thirty-two years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">On appeal, Monsalvatge, Byam, and Dunkley raise a variety of claims. This opinion considers one of Monsalvatge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>claims, which Dunkley joins: whether the district court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence at trial four clips (lasting a total of one minute and sixteen seconds) from the 2010 film, <em>The Town. </em>A summary order filed in connection with this opinion addresses the balance of the Defendant-Appellants\u2019 claims on appeal. For the reasons stated below and in that summary order, we AFFIRM the judgments of conviction as to Monsalvatge anfi Byam; and we AFFIRM Counts One, Four, and Five and REVERSE Counts Two and Three of the judgment of conviction as to Dunkley. We remand for resen-tencing as to Dunkley.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aaq2\">I. Factual Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Monsalvatge, Byam and Dunkley were convicted after a jury trial of committing armed robberies of two Pay-O-Matic check-cashing stores and of conspiring to commit these crimes. As set forth below, the two robberies differed in their <em>modus \u2019 operandi. </em>In the first robbery, on February 24, 2010, three bandana-covered men, wielding guns, stole $44,039.73 from a Pay-O-Matic located at 160-30 Rockaway Boulevard in Queens, New York, with one of the robbers gaining access to the protected area of the store by descending through the roof. In the second robbery, on February 14, 2012, almost two years later, three robbers stole $200,755.89 at gunpoint from a Pay-O-Matic located at 247-12 South Conduit Avenue, also in Queens, New York. This time, however, the robbers did not wear bandanas, but rather police-uniform disguises and lifelike \u201cspecial-effects\u201d masks, and they accosted an employee in gaining access to the store. And unlike in the first robbery, so as to remove any fingerprints or DNA, one of the robbers poured bleach on the teller counter. At trial, the Government played three of four <em>The Town </em>movie clips admitted by the district court (lasting a total of one minute and seven seconds) for the jury. The Government argued that Monsalvatge was familiar with <em>The Toum </em>and admired it, and that the co-conspirators altered their <em>mo-dus operandi </em>to carry out the second robbery in a manner resembling robberies depicted in the movie.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">A. The February 24, 2010 Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">The first Pay-O-Matic robbery occurred in the early morning hours of February 24, 2010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That morning, Muhammed Hafeez was working as the cashier at the Pay-O-Matic. His workspace, the cashier area, was separated from the counter by a bulletproof-glass divider and two locked doors. Hafeez left to use the restroom, which was located at the back of the store, still behind the secure cashier area. While he was in the bathroom, he heard a crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Upon leaving the restroom to investigate the disturbance, Hafeez saw a robber (\u201cRobber 1\u201d) holding a gun and standing in the secure cashier area. The crash Hafeez heard occurred when the robber gained entry to the store\u2019s secure area by descending through an air duct that had been pried open on the store\u2019s roof, leaving a large hole in the store\u2019s ceiling. The robber wore a black hooded sweatshirt with jeans; his face was covered with a black bandana; and he wore blue gloves with white text. The robber aimed his gun at Hafeez, di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>rected him to lie on the floor face down, and handcuffed him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">A second robber (\u201cRobber 2\u201d) appeared on the scene in the customer area of the store. Robber 2 also wore jeans and had his face covered but, unlike Robber 1, he wore an orange construction vest with yellow stripes over a blue jacket. In order to confer with Robber 2, Robber 1 left the secure cashier area of the store, with the door locking behind him and leaving Haf-eez by himself. The robbers, realizing they were now locked out of the secure cashier area, demanded that Hafeez open the door. Hafeez refused. The robbers attempted to force open the door but failed. At that point, Robber 1 left the store. Robber 2 stayed behind, pointing the gun at Hafeez through the window while making calls on his cell phone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Robber 1 crashed through the ceiling again, gaining entry to the cashier area. He removed the money from the cashier\u2019s drawers and put it in his bag. Robber 2 continued to use his cell phone. At that point, Robber 1 asked Hafeez to open the safe. Hafeez responded that he did not know the combination to the safe. The scene turned violent. Robber 1 began to beat Hafeez with a metal chair. Robber 2 attempted to pass a gun to Robber 1 through a slot in the teller window, but the slot was not wide enough to allow the gun to pass from the customer area, where Robber 2 stood, to the cashier area, where Robber 1 stood. Robber 2 made another phone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Soon, a third robber (\u201cRobber 3\u201d) entered the store. Robber 3\u2019s appearance was not clearly captured on the surveillance footage. He wore dark clothing, a dark jacket, and dark pants. In the store lobby, Robber 3, who had a gun, switched his weapon with Robber 2. Robber 2 handed the apparently slimmer gun to Robber 1 through the slot in the teller window. Robber 3 left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Robber 1, now again armed, questioned Hafeez about the safe, asking him who would know the combination if not him. When Hafeez told Robber 1 that his supervisor had the combination, Robber 1 demanded that Hafeez call the supervisor, which Hafeez did. Hafeez\u2019s supervisor, however, would not give Hafeez the combination to the safe. After that unsuccessful call, Robber 1 threw Hafeez\u2019s cell phone into one of the drawers. Robber 1 told Hafeez to move to the restroom. While Hafeez was in the bathroom, Robber 1 left the store using the emergency exit, and Robber 2 left through the front door. The robbers absconded with $44,039.73.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">B. The February 14, 2012 Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">As already noted, the second robbery occurred almost two years later, on February 14, 2012, also at a Queens Pay-O-Matic.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At 7:56 a.m., a black Ford Explorer SUV pulled into the parking lot of the Pay-O-Matic check-cashing store on South Conduit Avenue in Queens. What appeared to be a bag covered a damaged right rear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>window of the SUV, which also bore a distinctive dent on the front passenger side of its bumper. Fifteen minutes later, just past eight o\u2019clock in the morning, Lil-outie Ramnanan, a teller at the Pay-O-Matic, drove her car into the parking lot. Ramnanan saw three people in the SUV. As Ramnanan walked toward the store and passed the vehicle, the three stepped out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">They appeared to be white- or light-skinned men. All three men, however, also appeared to have brown lips. Ramnanan assumed they were law enforcement officials because they wore police attire: blue police jackets with hoods (bearing the police shield on the left side of the chest), police badges, and sunglasses. Two men wore baseball caps, but one did not \u2014 the third who did not wear a baseball cap appeared to be a bald man with-a goatee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The goateed man suddenly approached Ramnanan, stopped her, and asked whether she worked at Pay-O-Matic. Ramnanan responded that she did. At that point, he pulled out three papers with photographs of houses on them. According to Ramna-nan, he. showed her one of the photographs, and asked whether she \u201ckn[ew] this photo of this house.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 701. She answered, yes, recognizing the house in the photograph as her own.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He then asked her who was inside the store and Ramnanan realized, \u201cthis is a hold up.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">The goateed man directed Ramnanan to walk inside the store. Inside, there were two other people: a customer and the outgoing overnight teller named Sean Anderson. Anderson stood in a secured teller area. That area was protected by bulletproof glass and separated from the lobby by two doors that could be unlocked only from the teller area. Anderson noticed that the men wore gloves and that one of the pairs of gloves was blue with white text. The goateed man, upon entering the store, demanded that Anderson open the door. Anderson obliged, and the goateed man directed Ramnanan along with the two other robbers inside that space.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Inside the teller area, one robber emptied a safe and put the money into a black bag. The other robber demanded at gunpoint that Anderson and Ramnanan lie down on the floor. The armed robber emptied the teller drawers and splashed the teller counter with a liquid that smelled like bleach.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The three robbers then left the Pay-O-Matic with the cash, driving off in the SUV.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In total, the robbers stole $200,755.89.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Bank records showed that thousands of dollars of cash were deposited into Dunk-ley\u2019s account shortly after the February 14, 2012 robbery. Monsalvatge opened a new account on February 15, and shortly thereafter made several large cash deposits. Within months, Monsalvatge and Byam also took a trip to Canc\u00fan. Records show, and employees from various luxury goods retailers testified, that each of the defendants spent thousands of dollars on high-end goods during the spring and summer of 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"pAsA\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">On August 21, 2012, Monsalvatge was arrested pursuant to an arrest warrant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, Byam, while in his apartment, was also arrested pursuant to a warrant. Upon arrival, the arresting officers brought Byam into the apartment building hallway and proceeded to conduct a protective sweep of the apartment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The next day, Derrick Dunkley purchased a bus ticket from New York City to Hartford, Connecticut. Approximately one month later, law enforcement officers located and arrested Dunkley at his aunt\u2019s house in Hartford.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">On January 4, 2013, a grand jury indicted Monsalvatge, Byam, and Dunkley, charging each of them with Hobbs Act robbery conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (Count One); Hobbs Act robbery on February 24, 2010, in violation of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1951(a) (Count Two); unlawful use of a firearm in a crime of violence in connection with the February 24, 2010 robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (Count Three); Hobbs Act robbery on February 14, 2012, in violation of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1951(a) (Count Four); and unlawful use of a firearm in a crime of violence in connection with the February 14, 2012 robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) (Count Five).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>A. Pre-Trial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The district court considered a number of motions in advance of trial. As relevant here, the Government filed a motion <em>in limine </em>concerning <em>The Town, </em>a 2010 crime drama about a group of Boston bank robbers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The robberies in the film bore certain similarities to the charged 2012 robbery, and the Government had evidence that at least one of the defendants had seen and admired the film. In its motion, the Government requested to play for the jury at trial film clips from <em>The Town. </em>These clips would serve \u201cas evidence regarding the genesis of the defendants\u2019 mo-dus operandi in the 2012 robbery and to explain the change in modus operandi between robberies committed in 2010 and 2012.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The first clip (\u201cClip 1\u201d) is nine seconds long. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t Ex. 79 (Clip 1). It begins by showing two investigators outside a Harvard Square bank that has been robbed. They both wear navy-blue jackets, one with a hood. One, in bold letters, reads \u201cPOLICE\u201d on the back, while the other reads \u201cFBI.\u201d The labels \u201cPOLICE\u201d and \u201cFBI\u201d appear in smaller letters on the front, left sides of the jackets as well. As they enter the crime scene, the police investigator tells the FBI agent that the perpetrators had \u201cbleached the entire place for DN\u00c1,\u201d which \u201ckills all the clothing fibers so [the investigators] can\u2019t get a match.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 0:05-0:09.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The second clip (\u201cClip 2\u201d) is nine seconds long. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t Ex. 79 (Clip 2). There are a number of robbers \u2014 four, it seems\u2014 who wear black hooded sweatshirts and elaborate masks. The masks depict blue skulls with hanging blue dreadlocks. For one second, one of the robbers is shown to be holding an assault rifle<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 but only the butt of the gun appears, because the rest <em>of it is </em>cropped at the bottom of the frame. <em>Id. </em>at 0:01. The <em>mise-en-scene </em>is difficult to absorb in nine seconds, but the mood is tense: in the midst of the robbery, the perpetrators realize there are people gathering outside the bank doors. One robber says, \u201cWe gotta go.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Another yells, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 0:02. For two seconds, the robber holding the weapon runs across the frame \u2014 the firearm is visible, but blurred by the movement. A robber yells, \u201cLet\u2019s bleach it up! Let\u2019s bleach it up!\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 0:04-0:06. The robbers then pour bleach on the bank teller\u2019s counter as the clip ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">The third clip (\u201cClip 3\u201d) is twenty-one seconds long. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t Ex. 79 (Clip 3). The scene opens with a closely framed image of one of the robbers, played by Ben Affleck, who appears stern. He is sitting in the second row of a van with the other robbers as they drive through the North End neighborhood of Boston. They are on their way to commit a robbery. A police scanner discloses the location of the authorities to the robbers. The driver advises the rest of the group, \u201cSay your prayers; here we go.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 0:08-0:09. At that point, the robbers, beginning with Affleck\u2019s character, put on masks which disguise them as elderly nuns. These masks show exces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>sively wrinkled, sagging skin. The masks have holes for the robbers\u2019 real eyes and mouths \u2014 through which the audience can see a bit of the robbers\u2019 actual skin. For the final four seconds of the clip, the audience sees a robber through the van\u2019s window. The robber is now masked as an older nun and holding an assault rifle. Only the top half of the weapon is visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The fourth and final clip (\u201cClip 4\u201d) is thirty-seven seconds long. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t Ex. 79 (Clip 4). This scene shows one of the robbers dressed as a police officer, knocking on the door of the \u201ccash room\u201d at Fenway Park. He wears a dark-blue jacket (bearing the police department crest on the shoulder), a cap, a face scarf or bandana, and sunglasses. On the left side of the front of the jacket, the robber wears a police badge. He knocks on the locked door of the secured cash room. He reveals to the employees on the other side that he knows their home addresses and family members\u2019 names, and that there are \u201cmen outside [their] homes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 0:28-0:31. Their wives, the robber advises, would want them to open the door. They do so, and the robber walks through the threshold pointing a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Government sought to admit the film clips as relevant because, given the similarities between the actions depicted in these scenes and the February 2012 robbery, the clips helped to explain why the 2010 and 2012 robberies had proceeded differently. The similarities included: (1) pouring bleach on the bank surfaces; (2) threatening an employee by revealing knowledge of the employee\u2019s home address; (3) wearing police badges, uniforms, and sunglasses; and (4) wearing masks. In connection Adth its motion, the Government submitted an iPhone photograph that showed Monsalvatge standing next to Byam and wearing a t-shirt with a silk-screened image of one of the masked robbers from Clip 3 of <em>The Town. </em>The Government also included text messages showing that Monsalvatge had designed and custom-ordered the t-shirt at a mall.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Dunkley and Byam each raised a Federal Rule of Evidence 403 objection in their papers opposing the Government\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to admit the evidence. In doing so, the district court explained that it had \u201clooked at the clips\u201d and noted that Monsalvatge had \u201ca T-shirt ... depicting a particular still scene from th[e] movie.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 643. On that basis, the district court \u201cunderstood]\u201d the Government\u2019s theory and granted the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">B. Trial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The trial began on July 30, 2013. As part of the extensive proof at trial, which included both surveillance footage of the two robberies and testimony from Hafeez, Ramnanan, and Anderson, the Government introduced evidence that all three defendants had frequented Pay-O-Matic cash-checking stores during the period of the alleged conspiracy and that each defendant\u2019s cell phone records showed a flurry of communications among the defendants surrounding each of the robberies.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Monsalvatge\u2019s cell \u25a0 phone also contained photographs and incriminating text messages among the three defendants.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Specifically as to the February 24, 2010 robbery, the Government introduced forensic evidence showing that Monsal-vatge\u2019s DNA was found on the handcuffs used on Hafeez. Specifically as to the February 14, 2012 robbery, the Government adduced testimony from digital retailers and manufacturers regarding the defendants\u2019 purchase of law enforcement paraphernalia and lifelike masks worn during the robbery.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">At trial, the Government introduced the four clips from <em>The Toim </em>into evidence, which the district court admitted over objections by all three defendants. The Government then played three of the four clips for the jury. Before playing the clips, the district court provided an instruction to the jury: \u201cFolks, this is a movie, all right. It\u2019s make believe. Anything that you hear on this movie is not before you for the truth of it. This is Hollywood and not Brooklyn federal court, so we\u2019ll leave it at that for the time being.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 1075. A Government witness, an investigating detective, highlighted aspects of the clips as they were played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">The Government began by playing Clip 2 \u2014 the nine-second-long excerpt depicting the robbers pouring bleach on the counter \u2014 for the jury. After playing the clip, the witness described the clip as showing \u201cthe perpetrators robbing a bank and in th[e] container it contained bleach and they are pouring it by the drawers and the teller area where they possibly touched.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Next, the Government played Clip 4 for the jury. This thirty-seven-seeond-long excerpt showed, as the witness testified, a perpetrator dressed as a police officer revealing to the employees that he knew personal details about their lives. The witness explained that the character \u201cknew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>[the employees\u2019] routines, he knew who their family were. He basically threatened them if they were going to make a distress call, that their family would get called.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Last, the Government played Clip 3 for the jury. This twenty-one-second-long clip showed the robbers in a van with two of them putting on a lifelike mask as part of a nun disguise. In conjunction with this clip, the Government introduced into evidence the photograph of Monsalvatge wearing a t-shirt that depicted the image from that scene: the robber wearing the lifelike nun mask. Byam is standing next to Monsal-vatge in the photograph. The Government later introduced into evidence text messages indicating that Monsalvatge had custom-ordered the t-shirt at a mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In total, the Government played one minute and seven seconds of <em>The Town </em>for the jury. The next day, the Government requested that the district court provide the jurors an additional instruction regarding the movie clips. It asked that the district court instruct the jury that \u201cthere were [no] actual people outside of ... Ramnanan\u2019s home as was stated in the film and that the weapons that were used in the particular robbery shown in the clip were large assault-like weapons. And that there\u2019s no contention here that those types of weapons were used in the robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1230. The robbers on trial, the Government explained, used semiautomatic pistols. The Government sought this additional instruction \u201c[j]ust for the sake of making sure that there\u2019s no confusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later that day, the district court provided the additional instruction the Government had requested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">[L]et me take you back to yesterday for just a moment. You will recall, I think it was yesterday, you saw clips from a movie. The movie is entitled ... \u201cThe Town.\u201d During those clips you may have noticed that actors were using these very flerce-looking assault weapons. There is no evidence in this case nor is there an allegation in this case that-such weapons were used; I want to make sure you understand that. There is also a scene that you may have noticed where the claim was that the perpetrators of the crime had somebody outside the house of some of the victims during the course of the crime; again, no such allegation in this case, and you\u2019ll hear no proof to that effect in this case. I just want to make sure there is no misunderstanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">With that, the film clips were not mentioned again until summations, when the Government described for the jury the different techniques the robbers had used in the second robbery and stated, \u201cwe have an idea where they got those techniques.\u201d \u2022 <em>Id. </em>at 2426. The Government explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">You saw clips from a movie, The Town. You saw criminals being portrayed in that movie pouring bleach on surfaces to destroy DNA, using police uniforms, using a knowledge of victim\u2019s homes to make sure that people would do what they wanted them to do. In one of those clips you hear a police scanner, so they can keep track of whether law enforcement is responding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">Now, we know the defendants knew about that movie. Akeem Monsalvatge had a shirt depicting one of the scenes we watched, a shirt that he had made, an inside joke. But how did the techniques line up? They used bleach during their robbery.

We review such rulings deferentially, \u201cmindful of [a district court\u2019s] superior position to assess relevancy and to weigh the probative value of evidence against its potential for unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v.

Dhinsa, </em>243 F.3d 635, 649 (2d Cir. 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">At issue here is the district court\u2019s admission of the movie clips from <em>The Town </em>into evidence. On appeal, Monsalvatge, joined by Dunkley, contends that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>trict court abused its discretion in admitting these clips into evidence and allowing the Government to play three of them\u2014 lasting a total of one minute and seven seconds \u2014 for the jury. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"pAJG3\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Evidence is relevant if \u201cit has any tendency to make. a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence\u201d and if \u201cthe fact is of consequence in determining the action.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 401; <em>see also Abu-Jihaad, </em>630 F.3d at 131. \u201cEvidence need not be conclusive in order to be relevant.\u201d <em>United States v. Schultz, </em>333 F.3d 393, 416 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Contemporary Mission v. Famous Music Corp., </em>557 F.2d 918, 927 (2d Cir. 1977)). A district court \u201cmay exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 403. But in reviewing a district court\u2019s Rule 403 ruling, we \u201cgenerally maximiz[e] [the evidence\u2019s] probative value and minimiz[e] its prejudicial value.\u201d <em>United States v. LaFlam, </em>369 F.3d 153, 155 (2d Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (first and third alterations in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Downing, </em>297 F.3d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Here, the district court properly concluded that the clips were, indeed, relevant under Federal Rule of Evidence 401. <em>See Schultz, </em>333 F.3d at 416 (noting that \u201c[determinations of relevance are entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge\u201d). The clips, in conjunction with other evidence, tended to make more probable the factual inference that the 2010 and 2012 robberies (which otherwise bore few similarities in <em>modus operandi </em>beyond the number of robbers and the choice of targets) were part of the same conspiracy. The 2010 robbery, as Dunkley\u2019s counsel pointed out, was clumsily committed by a \u201cbumbling pack of robbers\u201d who gained entry to the Pay-O-Matie by descending through the ceiling. Joint App\u2019x 2526. In contrast, the 2012 robbery was swiftly and efficiently executed in a matter of minutes by robbers who accosted a store employee. More importantly, the second robbery bore a different set of characteristics: namely, the use of disguises \u2014 police uniforms \u2014 and lifelike special-effects masks, along with bleach to ensure the robbers left behind no trace of DNA. The <em>The Town </em>clips (along with evidence that at least Monsalvatge and Byam were aware of the movie and that Monsalvatge admired it sufficiently to have a t-shirt specially made to depict a <em>The </em>Town-scene) helped to show that the defendants\u2019 <em>modus operandi </em>changed because they decided to incorporate ideas from the movie into then-method for committing robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">In February 2010, when the first robbery occurred, <em>The Town </em>was still seven months away from its wide-release date. But, by the second robbery in February 2012, the film had long been available to the public. The 2012 robbery bears a remarkable \u2014 even obvious \u2014 resemblance to multiple aspects of the clips from <em>The Town. </em>In fact, nearly every distinctive aspect of the 2012 robbery can be traced to the film. The robbers\u2019 disguises, with minor differences, appear to combine the navy-blue police jacket with a hood and text detail on the front left side of the jacket in Clip 1 and the sunglasses and badge in Clip 4. The idea for special-effects masks imitating real skin is in Clip 3. The idea to use bleach to eliminate traces of DNA is in Clip 2 (and the effects of using bleach are explained in Clip 1). Threatening an employee by revealing knowledge of a home address is in Clip 4. That is every key facet of the 2012 robbery. Taken indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>vidually, each of these elements might not be sufficiently distinctive to raise a connection to the film. But taken together, as they occurred here, the attributes of the 2012 robbery are clearly connected to the film.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">. Government Exhibits 99 and 120 make that connection even sharper. The Government submitted an iPhone photograph that showed Monsalvatge standing next to Byam and wearing a t-shirt with a silk-screened image of one of the masked robbers from <em>The Town </em>\u2014 specifically, a still frame of the nun-costumed robber in Clip 3. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t Ex. 99. And this was not an ordinary t-shirt that a fan might purchase at a retail store. Rather, the Government also introduced evidence to show that Monsalvatge designed and custom-ordered this t-shirt. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t Ex. 120. This would have been a distinctive sartorial choice for Monsalvatge at the time. The Government adduced testimony at trial from employees of luxury good retailers \u2014 including Fendi, Gucci, Ralph Lauren, Christian Louboutin, and Louis Vuitton \u2014 that the defendants spent thousands of dollars at these stores during the spring and summer of 2012. Despite this apparent taste for <em>haute couture, </em>Monsalvatge, in March 2012, approximately five weeks after the second robbery, went to the mall and custom-ordered a t-shirt depicting a scene from <em>The Toim. </em>He later posed with Byam for a photo wearing that shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Monsalvatge states, in conclusory fashion, that the clips are prejudicial. But he does not show how any potential for prejudice arising from the introduction of these clips outweighed their evident probative value. Monsalvatge does not even identify any specific prejudicial potential that these clips carried beyond the fact that they \u201cinvited the jury to speculate that this was a copycat crime.\u201d Monsal-vatge Br. 48. It is unclear \u2014 and Monsal-vatge does hot explain \u2014 what effect characterizing the robbery as a copycat crime would have on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In any event, the movie clips here do not have the sort of \u201cstrong emotional or inflammatory impact\u201d that would \u201cpose a risk of unfair prejudice because [they] \u2018tend[ ] to distract\u2019 the jury from the issues in the case and ... [might] arouse the jury\u2019s passions to a point where they would act irrationally in reaching a verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>560 F.2d 507, 514 (2d Cir. 1977) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 404 advisory committee note). First, they are very short. Two clips last nine seconds, one lasts twenty-one seconds, and another lasts thirty-seven seconds. They are so short because they are narrowly tailored to show <em>only </em>the parts of the movie that are relevant to the 2012 robbery. The clips depict no violence: the robbers do not hurt anyone on the screen. Granted, the robbers do carry assault rifles in two of the clips, but those firearms appear for a total of only seven seconds (in Clip 2, for one and two seconds, and, in Clip 3, for four seconds). Further, in each instance, the weapons are either partially cropped by the frame or blurred by the action. In the little dialogue that occurs in the clips, moreover, the robbers appear to be the film\u2019s protagonists.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> With all this in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>mind, it is difficult to see how these clips could \u201cunfairly ... excite emotions against the defendant[s].\u201d <em>United States v. Massino, </em>546 F.3d 123, 133 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (quoting <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. 1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Critically, moreover, the district court took steps to minimize any potential for prejudice that might exist. First, the district court gave not one but two curative instructions. It initially instructed the jury: \u201cAnything that you hear on this movie is not before you for the truth of it.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 1075. The next day, the district court further instructed the jury about two differences between the 2012 robbery and the movie clips. It explained: \u201cThere is no evidence in this case nor is there an allegation in this case that [assault weapons] were used; I want to make sure you understand that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307. The district court also noted that in the film \u201cthe perpetrators of the crime had somebody outside the house of some of the victims during the course of the crime; again, no such allegation in this case, and you\u2019ll hear no proof to that effect in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court clarified that it had provided this second instruction \u201cto make sure there [was] no misunderstanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we have made clear, \u201c[a]bsent evidence to the contrary, we must presume that juries understand and abide by a district court\u2019s limiting instructions.\u201d <em>Downing, </em>297 F.3d at 59. There is no evidence suggesting otherwise in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">This Court has in the past declined to second-guess a district court\u2019s admission of relevant video or media evidence where the evidence bears an identifiable connection to an issue or defendant in the case. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cromitie, </em>727 F.3d 194, 225 (2d Cir. 2013) (finding that a district court was \u201cwell within [its] discretion\u201d in admitting into evidence a twenty-second-long video of a demonstration explosion set off by a bomb that was \u201cconstructed with the type and amount of material that the defendants thought was in the fake devices they were planning to use in the operation\u201d); <em>Abu-Jihaad, </em>630 F.3d at 131-35 (affirming the district court\u2019s admittance of various website materials\u2014 including pro-jihadist videos and Osama bin Laden\u2019s 1996 <em>fatwa </em>against the United States \u2014 on the theory that they were relevant to the understanding the operations at issue in the case, despite the materials\u2019 potential to inflame a juror\u2019s passions); <em>United States v. Salameh, </em>152 F.3d 88, 111 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (affirming the district court\u2019s ruling to admit a videotape that \u201cshowed a man driving a truck into a building that was flying an American flag\u201d and then the building exploding because \u201c[t]he videotape ... closely resembled the actual events at the World Trade Center and provided further evidence of motive and intent,\u201d and the district court was within its discretion to find that this \u201csignificant probative value ... was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\u201d \u2014 namely, \u201c[t]he sulphurous anti-American sentiments expressed in the terrorist materials[, which] no doubt threatened to prejudice the jury against the defendants\u201d). To that end, our rulings have been in line with those of our sister circuits.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We see no reason to depart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>this precedent in the circumstances here, where the movie clips in question had real probative value and the potential for prejudice, we conclude, was slight.</p>\n<p id=\"pAOM\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In sum, the district court\u2019s ruling to admit the movie clips from <em>The Town </em>into evidence was not arbitrary and irrational. The clips were relevant to the issues and defendants in the case and, importantly, they were short and narrowly tailored. Further, the district court provided not one but two curative instructions to minimize any potential for prejudice from the few differences between the clips and the 2012 robbery. It made clear \u2014 if it was not clear enough already \u2014 that the clips represented \u201cHollywood and not Brooklyn federal court.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Our courtrooms are not movie theaters. But we cannot assume that our jurors\u2014 whom we routinely ask to pore over the violent and often grisly details of real crimes \u2014 are such delicate consumers of media that they would so easily have their passions aroused by short film clips of the sort at issue here. In this case, the district court acted well within its discretion in permitting the jury to see one minute and seven seconds of relevant Hollywood fiction during the course of a four-day criminal trial in real-life Brooklyn federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgments of conviction as to Monsal-vatge and Byam. As to Dunkley, we AFFIRM as to Counts One, Four, and Five, and, for the reasons stated in the summary order filed in connection with this opinion, we REVERSE as to Counts Two and Three.

However, it is worth examining more closely the three movie clips shown to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>jury and the Government\u2019s justifications for admitting each.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The Government first played Clip 2 \u2014 a scene from the movie <em>The Town </em>depicting a bank robbery under way. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t Ex. 79 (Clip 2). Clip. 2 begins inside the bank with a close-up of a robber carrying what appears to be a submachine gun and wearing a skeletal Grim Reaper mask with a hooded black overcoat. As one voice shouts, \u201cWe gotta go,\u201d the robber\u2019s gaze shifts to the bank\u2019s opaque glass front door, where a silhouette on the street walks by. Another voice yells \u201cLet\u2019s Go!\u201d as the music swells with a cymbal roll and a thundering drum beat. The film then cuts to three robbers in the teller area\u2014 also carrying assault rifles and dressed as the Grim Reaper. A voice exclaims, \u201cLet\u2019s bleach it up!\u201d The robbers then pass around a large white plastic bottle and hastily pour a liquid \u2014 presumably bleach\u2014 on the tellers\u2019 workstations. In the background, three hostages sit on the floor. The excerpt features swift cutting, with six shots in the nine-second excerpt.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">After playing the clip, the Government witness, a detective who had just finished testifying about the processing of fingerprint and DNA evidence, explained to the jury that the excerpt shows \u201cthe [film\u2019s] perpetrators robbing a bank and in that container it contained bleach and they are pouring it by the drawers and the teller area where they possibly touched.\u201d J.A. at 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The Government then played Clip 4. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t Ex. 79 (Clip 4). Clip 4 depicts a man outside of a locked room. He is carrying a handgun and is dressed in a police uniform. A black cloth covers all but his eyes and ears. Dark sunglasses obscure his eyes. Using the gun, he pounds on a locked door and shouts to get the attention of two middle-aged, male employees in \u201cthe cash room.\u201d He proceeds to identify the men, announcing their names, home addresses, and wives\u2019 names. He warns them not to call for help and to open the door, yelling \u201cwe have men outside your homes.\u201d The camera cuts to a close-up of their anxious faces and dramatic music highlights the tension of the situation. The robber is buzzed in, he enters the cash room, and points his. gun at an employee\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">After the clip was played, the detective noted that the perpetrator \u201cwas dressed as a police officer\u201d and explained to the jury that the robber \u201cknew their routines, he knew who their families] were. He basically threatened them if they were going to make a distress call, that their family would get hurt.\u201d J.A. at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The Government then played Clip 3. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t Ex. 79 (Clip 3). Clip 3 depicts the robbers inside of a car, driving down a sunlit city street, busy with traffic and\u2019 pedestrians. When the driver says, \u201cSay your prayers; here we go,\u201d each robber dons a mask depicting an elderly nun: the skin is deeply furrowed, and the features exaggerated. Each robber also wears a nun\u2019s habit. The clip ends with a close-up of one robber \u2014 assault rifle in his gloved hand \u2014 staring out of the car window, straight into the camera. The music builds to a crescendo and the excerpt closes on a dramatic, dissonant chord. The Government did not question the witness about this clip.</p>\n<p id=\"pAOy\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Although the standard of review is highly deferential, <em>see United States v. Massino, </em>546 F.3d 123, 132-33 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam), \u201cthe broad discretion afforded to the district court\u201d in weighing the admissibility of evidence under Rule 403 \u201cis not limitless,\u201d <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>786 F.3d 227, 232 (2d Cir. 2015). Evidence maybe unfairly prejudicial if, for example, \u201cit tends to have some adverse effect upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence,\u201d such as a \u201ctendency ... to prove some adverse fact not properly in issue or unfairly to excite emotions against the defendant.\u201d <em>Massino, </em>546 F.3d at 132-33 (quoting <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. 1980)). On review of-a district court\u2019s evaluation of evidence, this Court will \u201cgenerally \u2018maximiz[e] its probative value and minimiz[e] its prejudicial effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. LaFlam, </em>369 F.3d 153, 155 (2d Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Downing, </em>297 F.3d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 2002)). Even so, weighing the movie clips\u2019 minimal probative value against their potential for unfair prejudice,- I would hold that the district court abused its discretion in allowing them to be introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The Government argued, in its motion <em>in limine </em>before the district court, that the excerpts bear a \u201cstriking resemblance\u201d to the 2012 robbery.in this case because in both situations the robbers (1) pour bleach on surfaces, (2) wear police uniforms as disguises, (3) use personal information to threaten an employee at the scene, and (4) wear life-like masks. J.A. at 423-24. The Government argued that the clips \u201cprovide the context and motivation for the drastic change in the defendants\u2019 robbery techniques\u201d from 2010 to 2012 and that there is \u201clittle risk\u201d of unfair prejudice because \u201cit will be identified as a fictional Hollywood film depicting actors.\u201d J.A. at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In reviewing the three excerpts, I find that, despite the similarities between the 2012 robbery and the fictive crimes, the clips were unfairly prejudicial. According to the Government, Clip 2 was probative to the extent that it illustrates why the defendants used bleach to destroy DNA evidence at the crime scene. J.A. at 1076. But Defendant-Appellant Akeem Monsalvatge would already have been aware of the importance of destroying DNA evidence: when he was arrested for the 2010 robbery, he was told that his DNA was found at the scene. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. at 2427. The defendants, therefore, did not need a Hollywood movie to instruct them on the role DNA evidence plays in identifying perpetrators. Although it is' possible that the defendants\u2019 use of bleach was informed by the movie, a simple search on Google comes to the same lesson: one of the first results in a search for \u201cwhat destroys DNA at a crime scene?\u201d is a discussion board that suggests using bleach. <em>What destroys dna?, </em>SciForums.com, http:// www.sciforums.com/threads/what-destroys-dna.45471/. The probative value of this clip regarding the use of bleach is, at best, slight.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Clip 4 depicts a robber, disguised as a police officer, using the bank employees\u2019 personal information to threaten them. The Government contends that when committing the 2012 robbery, the defendants were mimicking the fictional robbers in the movie. But, given the uncommonly clumsy manner in which the defendants committed the 2010 robbery \u2014 entering through the roof of a cash-checking business and leaving behind tools \u2014 it is likely that the defendants actively considered alternative approaches for future robbery attempts. Impersonating a police officer is not a novel technique: the New York City Police Department even has a Police Impersonation Investigation Unit. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. at 1004-05. However, the use of the Pay-O-Matic employee\u2019s personal information while dressed as a police officer is similar to <em>The Toum, </em>and there is some probative value in this similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Finally, the excerpts\u2019 probative value regarding the defendants\u2019 use of masks is negligible. Not only is wearing a disguise for a robbery a <em>scene a faire, </em>but, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>committing the 2010 robbery, the defendants had already employed the technique of covering their faces using, according to one witness at trial, a \u201ccloth mask.\u201d J.A. at 1400, 1402. Thus, with respect to their use of a device to obscure their faces, any similarity between the 2012 robbery and <em>The Town </em>does not tend to prove that'the defendants adopted a new approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">. As this Court has long held: \u201cThe length of the chain of inferences necessary to connect the evidence with the ultimate fact to be proved necessarily lessens the probative value of the evidence, and may therefore render it more susceptible to exclusion as unduly confusing, prejudicial, or time-consuming....\u201d <em>United States v. Kaplan, </em>490 F.3d 110, 122 (2d Cir. 2007) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Ravich, </em>421 F.2d 1196, 1204 n.10 (2d Cir. 1970) (Friendly, J.)). The Government did not argue that the defendants acknowledged that these techniques were gleaned from <em>The Town. </em>Instead, the Government\u2019s theory at trial was that a photograph showing Monsalvatge wearing a t-shirt that featured an image from the movie suggests that he and his co-conspirators used the film as a how-to-guide for their 2012 robbery. J.\u00c1. at 1079-80. Although it is a reasonable inference that the t-shirt indicates that Monsalvatge was familiar with the movie, it is a stretch to infer that he admired the movie\u2019 for its educational value. The inference that the defendants sought to emulate the actions of Active criminals because one individual ordered a t-shirt depicting a scene from a widely released, blockbuster film is beyond tenuous, which further minimizes the probative value the clips might have. <em>Cf. United States v. Gamory, </em>635 F.3d 480, 493 (11th Cir. 2011) (finding a rap video inadmissible where video was prejudicial and \u201cnot clearly probative of [defendant\u2019s] guilt,\u201d and where connection between defendant and video\u2019s creation was tenuous).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The majority opinion cites eases from outside of this circuit where film excerpts were admitted to explain a defendant\u2019s behavior. In each of those cases, however, the connections between the defendant and the film, and the film and the crime, were much stronger. <em>See United States v. Schneider, </em>801 F.3d 186, 199-200 (3d Cir. 2015) (affirming decision to admit clips from a film about a ballet dancer and his older patron and lover in a case where older defendant had shown the film to his victim, a young ballet dancer); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>749 F.3d 465, 496-97 (6th Cir.) (affirming admission of film excerpts in which \u201csalesmen working for a fictional investment firm employ high-pressure sales tactics to defraud clients\u201d in a prosecution for fraud where defendants \u201cmade copies of [the film] and encouraged salesmen to learn from the . movie\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 307, 190 L.Ed.2d 223 (2014); <em>United States v. Jayyousi, </em>657 F.3d 1085, 1108-09 (11th Cir. 2011) (affirming admission of clips from a CNN interview with Osama bin Laden that two defendants had discussed in phone calls); <em>United States v. Wills, </em>346 F.3d 476, 484 n.6, 489 (4th Cir. 2003) (affirming decision to admit excerpts of the film <em>The Casino </em>to explain what one defendant meant when he stated in a tape-recorded conversation, \u201cI\u2019m Casino.... You see the movie? ... Well anyway, I was doing a <em>Casino </em>joint\u201d). Here, in contrast, the Government adduced no evidence that the defendants watched <em>The Town, </em>discussed the film with one another, or, most importantly, developed a plan based on the film. Because <em>The Town </em>excerpts are so far removed from the ultimate fact to be proven \u2014 that is, whether the defendants actually committed robbery \u2014 the probative value of the clips is diminished. <em>See Kaplan, </em>490 F.3d at 122 (\u201cThe jury was required to draw a series <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>of inferences, unsupported by other evidence, to connect Gaikovich\u2019s testimony ... [to] the ultimate issue in the case. Under the circumstances, the district court should have concluded that whatever slight probative value the testimony might have had was outweighed by the risk that the jury would draw improper inferences from the testimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Although some of the techniques employed by the fictional robbers in <em>The Town </em>are similar to the <em>modus operandi </em>in this case, there are significant differences that vitiate the clips\u2019 probative value. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Reese, </em>933 F.Supp.2d 579, 582-83 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citing <em>United States v. Danzey, </em>594 F.2d 905, 911 (2d Cir. 1979)) (finding that prior acts were dissimilar enough to be inadmissible to show <em>modus operandi </em>under Rule 404(b)). Unlike the robbers in the movie, the defendants did not carry \u201cvery fieree-looking assault weapons,\u201d as the district court noted to the jury. J.A. at 1307. Although one defendant showed one of the Pay-O-Matic employees a photograph of her house and asked if she recognized it, he did not claim that someone was currently outside the house ready to harm the victim\u2019s family. J.A. at 700-01, 1307. The defendants\u2019 masks were life-like disguises, unlike the Grim Reaper masks and distorted nun masks worn by the robbers in <em>The Town. See, e.g., </em>J.A. at 699-700, 732. Given the generic and superficial similarities between the movie excerpts and the 2012 robbery, the long inferential chain required to connect the evidence to the crime, and the differences between the excerpts and the crime, the clips\u2019 probative value is slight.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">To the extent that the excerpts are marginally probative and the clips \u201ctend[ ] to prove the fact or issue that justified [their] admission into evidence,\u201d that value is outweighed by the serious risk of \u201cunfairly ... excising] emotions against the defendant.\u201d <em>Massino, </em>546 F.3d at 132-33. The potential for unfair prejudice extends beyond the fact that the clips depict robbers carrying heavy assault weapons, which are far more deadly than the pistols used by the defendants. Unlike the objective of a criminal trial \u2014 to ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice \u2014 the goal of commercial cinema is to thrill and entertain. It is a manipulative art designed to elicit an emotional response from the viewer. To this end, filmmakers employ a variety of tools such as costumes, music, cinematography, lighting and editing\u2014 strategies not utilized in surveillance videos routinely presented at trials. The psychological effect on a juror of watching an actor dressed as the Grim Reaper gripping a submachine gun as he robs a bank to a thundering drum beat should not be underestimated. The risk that a juror \u2014 even a juror who has been instructed by the court to ignore the \u201cmake believe\u201d elements of the evidence, J.A. 1075 \u2014 might conflate fiction and reality is obvious. And, it is a risk that threatens to undermine a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>Cf. United States v. Sampson, </em>335 F.Supp.2d 166, 191-93 (D. Mass. 2004) (excluding memorial video of victim that featured \u201cevocative\u201d and \u201cpoignant\u201d music that \u201cwould have inflamed the passion and sympathy of the jury\u201d). As <em>The New York Times </em>noted in its review of <em>The Town, </em>Clip 2, which was part of the film\u2019s opening sequence, is \u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201cevidence of Mr. Affleck\u2019s skill and self-confidence as a director.\u201d A. O. Scott, <em>Bunker Hill to Fenway: A Crook\u2019s Freedom Trail, </em>N.Y. Times (Sept. 17, 2010), http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/ 17/movies/17town.html.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The potential for prejudicial impact is further amplified by the fact that the magistrate judge who conducted the <em>voir dire </em>did not ask the <em>venire </em>whether they had seen <em>The Town. </em>The <em>voir dire </em>was conducted on the morning on July 29, 2013, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Magistrate Judge James Orenstein. <em>See </em>J.A. at 434. Indeed, when discussing the issue of whether to ask potential jurors if they had seen the movie, Judge Orenstein stated that \u201cIf I were at the defense table, quite honestly, I think I would want to know just to have more information rather than less, but if you object, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d J.A. at 439. Because the district court had not yet ruled on the clips\u2019 admissibility \u2014 the district court judge ruled on the Government\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>later that day, J.A. at 643 \u2014 defense counsel for Defendant-Appellant Derrick Dunkley declined Judge Orenstein\u2019s invitation to question potential jurors about the film, stating, \u201cI object to it. And even if the movie does come in, which I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that likely ... [,] I think even bringing it up suggests that it\u2019s similar to the actions in this case which I don\u2019t think is true.\u201d J.A. at 439-40. That some of the jurors may have seen the movie \u2014 which is not unlikely, given that <em>The Town </em>was the highest-grossing movie in its opening weekend (over $92 million domestically) and was nominated for an Academy Award, <em>see The Town, </em>Box Office Mojo, http://www. boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=townlO. htm \u2014 eliminates the limiting effect of the clips\u2019 tailoring and exponentially increases the risk of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">This circuit has not addressed the use of Active videos as evidence, but other courts have expressed deep distress about such evidence\u2019s impact on the jury. <em>See Gamory, </em>635 F.3d at 493 (finding a rap music video to be unfairly prejudicial because it contained content unnecessary and unrelated to the criminal case); <em>Bannister v. Town of Noble, </em>812 F.2d 1265, 1269 (10th Cir. 1987) (discussing the concern that a \u201cjury will better remember, and thus give greater weight to, evidence presented in a film as opposed to more conventionally elicited testimony\u201d); <em>Sampson, </em>335 F.Supp.2d at 192-93 (discussing how a video \u201cwould have inflamed the passion and sympathy of the jury\u201d); <em>Thomas v.

Territory of Guam v. Shymanovitz, </em>157 F.3d 1154, 1158-59 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding that pornographic magazines found in the apartment of a defendant accused of sexual contact with minors was inadmissible to show propensity, lamenting that the case against an individual could be made stronger because of his book collection); <em>United States v.

Mich. 2012) (holding anti-government books found in the defendant\u2019s home inadmissible, saying that connecting the acts in the books to the allegations in the case was \u201cpure speculation\u201d and worrying about the risk of \u201cassociating [the defendants in the minds of the jurors with the perpetrators of these other crimes [featured in the books]\u201d); <em>see generally United States v.

Op. at 496.) The cases cited by the majority do not hold otherwise; indeed, all show a strong nexus between the challenged evidence and the criminal activity at trial. In <em>United States v. Cromitie, </em>this Court admitted a \u201c20-second video of a demonstration explosion set off by a bomb placed on the back seat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>of a car and constructed with the type and amount of material that the defendants thought was in the fake devices they were planning to use in the operation.\u201d 727 F.3d 194, 225 (2d Cir. 2013). The video was introduced \u201cto establish that the fake bombs, if real, would have qualified as \u2018destructive devices\u2019 \u201d under relevant statutes. <em>Id. </em>These fake bombs were created by the FBI and provided to the defendants, <em>United States v.

Abu-Jihaad, </em>this Court upheld the admission of pro-jihadist videos found on a terrorist organization website because there was extensive evidence of correspondence between the defendant and the organization. 630 F.3d 102, 113, 133-34 (2d Cir. 2010). And in <em>United States v. Salameh, </em>this Court affirmed the admission of anti-American materials \u2014 including a video clip depicting a bombing that closely resembled the World Trade Center bombing committed by the defendants as well as documents that provided instructions on how to construct bombs and mix explosives to destroy buildings \u2014 that were in the possession of two defendants because the evidence demonstrated not only the \u201cmotive and intent\u201d of the defendants, but also \u201cformulae for the same explosives that were used to construct the World Trade Center bomb, and [defendants\u2019] fingerprints were found on those pages,\u201d and \u201ctraces of those same explosives were found in the homes of, and on objects linked to\u201d the defendants. 152 F.3d 88, 111 (2d Cir. 1998). The film \u25a0 clips from <em>The Town </em>are far less probative than the evidence in these three cases where only a minimal inferential leap is required to connect the video clips to the crimes alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Finally, to the extent the similarity between the movie excerpts and the 2012 robbery is probative, the district court should have considered other means of admitting the facts of that similarity into evidence that would have avoided the unfairly prejudicial nature of the film clips. \u201c[W]hen Rule 403 confers discretion by providing that evidence \u2018may\u2019 be excluded, the discretionary judgment may be informed not only by assessing an evidentia-ry item\u2019s twin tendencies, but by placing the result of that assessment alongside similar assessments of evidentiary alternatives.\u201d <em>Old Chief v. United </em>States, 519 U.S. 172, 184-85, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Evid. 403 advisory committee notes (\u201cThe availability of other means of proof may also be an appropriate factor.\u201d). Rule 403 \u201cpermits a judge to consider both the defendant\u2019s willingness to stipulate and the potential for prejudice [in later phases] in conducting the requisite [Rule 403] balancing.\u201d <em>United States v. Al-Moayad, </em>545 F.3d 139, 160 (2d Cir. 2008) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Pepin, </em>514 F.3d 193, 206-07 (2d Cir. 2008)). Where there is alternative but equally probative evidence available, a court may consider the \u201cmarginal probative value\u201d of the proposed evidence relative to the other evidence in the case. <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 185, 117 S.Ct. 644 (citing 1 McCormick 782, and n. 41); <em>see </em>1 McCormick On Evid. \u00a7 185 (7th ed.) (\u201cIf other evidence, which does not carry the same dangers with it, could be used to establish the same fact, then the marginal probative value of the evidence in question is slight or nonexistent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Accordingly, in <em>Al-Moayad, </em>this Court concluded that the district court acted arbitrarily in admitting the evidence that \u201calmost entirely unrelated to the elements of the charges.\u201d 545 F.3d at 161. Such evidence is not afforded the same weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>when applying the general rule that \u201cthe prosecution is entitled to prove its case by evidence of its own choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 186, 117 S.Ct. 644). Rather, where testimony \u201cnever referred to either defendant or to any aspect of the investigation or charges against them,\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s concern about the government\u2019s \u201cnatural sequence of narrative evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 189, 117 S.Ct. 644), \u201chas little to no application,\u201d <em>id. </em>The testimony \u201camounted to a blatant appeal to the jury\u2019s emotions and prejudices,\u201d and omitting the testimony \u201cwould not have disrupted the narrative flow of the government\u2019s trial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the availability of the less prejudicial option \u2014 the defendants agreed to stipulate to the probative facts \u2014 this Court concluded that admitting the evidence was arbitrary and reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 160-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Similarly here, to the extent the film excerpts had probative value by showing similarities between certain criminal techniques utilized in both <em>The Town </em>and the 2012 robbery, the district court could have allowed a less prejudicial form of evidence \u2014 such as a stipulation or additional testimony from the detective who testified that he had \u201cseen the movie several times\u201d and gave a brief overview of the movie, J.A. 1073-74. The movie clips did not add probative value; they increased the risk of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In sum, I do not think Rule 403 allows a court to risk that a juror will watch clips featuring criminal acts and resist the film\u2019s strong emotional appeal, an effect that a Hollywood movie is designed to have. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>560 F.2d 507, 513-14 (2d Cir. 1977) (\u201cAbsent counterbalancing probative value, evidence having a strong emotional or inflammatory impact ... may pose a risk of unfair prejudice because it tends to distract the jury from the issues in the case and ... [might] arouse the jury\u2019s passions to a point where they would act irrationally in reaching a verdict.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In particular, Clips 2 and 3, which were relevant only with respect to the similarities of robbers wearing a mask and spreading bleach, had only limited and speculative probative value. Considering the prejudicial effect of jurors conflating the defendants with the actors and actions depicted in the Active sequences, and given the availability of equally probative but vastly less prejudicial forms of evidence, I would hold that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the film clips.</p>\n<p id=\"apm-dedup-0\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Furthermore, the district court abused its discretion by failing to adequately weigh the movie excerpts\u2019 probative value against their potential for unfair prejudice. \u201cTo avoid acting arbitrarily, the district court must make a conscientious assessment of whether unfair prejudice substantially outweighs probative value.\u201d <em>United States v. Kadir, </em>718 F.3d 115, 122 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting <em>Al-Moayad, </em>545 F.3d at 160); <em>see also Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d at 943. This Court will reverse an evidentiary determination if \u201c \u2018there was inadequate consideration of the probative value of the evidence,\u2019 or a failure to adequately \u2018consider the risk of unfair prejudice and to balance this risk against probative value.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morgan, </em>786 F.3d at 232 (quoting <em>Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d at 942); <em>cf. Salameh, </em>152 F.3d at 111 (affirming where the \u201crecord amply demonstrates that [the district court] made a \u2018conscientious assessment\u2019 of the proffered evidence and properly determined that unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of these materials\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In its motion <em>in limine, </em>the Government argued that the film clips were relevant under Federal Rule of Evidence 401 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 402 based on Monsalvatge\u2019s \u201ccustom-made T-shirt\u201d depicting one of the movie\u2019s scenes and the \u201cfilm\u2019s striking similarity to important aspects of the 2012 robbery,\u201d which \u201chelps explain the origin of defendants\u2019 <em>modus'operandi </em>during that robbery.\u201d J.A. at 424-25. The Government stated that it would limit unfair prejudice by identifying the film as fictional and showing only limited clips. <em>See </em>J.A. 424-25. Counsel for Dunkley and Defendant-Appellant Edward Byam each submitted a letter opposing the Government\u2019s motion; the former argues that the clips are inadmissible under Rule 403. J.A. at 430; <em>see </em>J.A. at 428-30, 431-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">When the district court decided the issue, it focused exclusively on relevance and did not make a finding on the record regarding Rule 403. In a hearing in the afternoon of July 29, 2013, the district court ruled on the Government\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>stating in full: \u201cThe movie \u2018The Town\u2019 is an interesting thing. We\u2019ve looked at the clips. I understand that there was a T-shirt recovered from Mr. Monsalvatge depicting a particular still scene from that movie. I understand the theory. I think it\u2019s admissible, and I will allow it.\u201d J.A. at 643. Significantly, the trial judge did not evaluate the probative value of the evidence or the risk of unfair prejudice, nor did he appear to balance the two. <em>See Morgan, </em>786 F.3d at 232. I would find, therefore, that the district court abused its discretion by failing to make a clear record of its \u201cconscientious assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"pApI\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Finally, this Court reverses a district court on an evidentiary error only when the error affects \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a); Fed. R. Evid. 103(a); <em>see also, e.g., Kaplan, </em>490 F.3d at 122. On such review, an appellate court must ask \u201cwhat effect the error had or reasonably may be taken to have had upon the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). This Court must answer: \u201cIs it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error?\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>745 F.3d 15, 27 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 18, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999)). Among the factors this Court principally considers are: \u201c(1) the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case; (2) the prosecutor\u2019s conduct with respect to the improperly admitted evidence; (3) the importance of the wrongly admitted testimony; and (4) whether such evidence was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Zappulla v. New York, </em>391 F.3d 462, 468 (2d Cir. 2004)). \u201cWe have repeatedly held that the strength of the government\u2019s case is the most critical factor in assessing whether error was harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. McCallum, </em>584 F.3d 471, 478 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing <em>United States v. Lombardozzi, </em>491 F.3d 61, 76 (2d Cir. 2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Although the admission of the film excerpts was an abuse of discretion, the admission was harmless error. The evidence presented against the defendants regarding the 2012 robbery was overwhelming, and the film clips\u2019 significance to the crimes charged minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The Government\u2019s case was strong. In addition to extensive evidence regarding the 2010 robbery and the attempted robbery, the Government presented a variety of evidence tying the defendants to the 2012 robbery. First, evidence tied Byam to the scene of the crime. Surveillance videotape depicted the three robbers showing a Pay-O-Matic employee a photograph of the employee\u2019s house. The photo, which fell to the floor and was later recovered by investigators, J.A. at 857, 1057-58, was stamped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u201cWalgreens\u201d and contained identifying information including the Walgreens store number, an order number, and a date, J.A. at 861, 1058. Investigators identified the Walgreens store, which matched the order number to a receipt that identified the name \u201cByam, E.\u201d and a phone number that matches Byam\u2019s. J.A. at 866-67, 1019, 1115. Surveillance video from the Wal-greens store showed Byam dropping something off at the Walgreens photo counter in early December 2011 and picking something up the next day. J.A. at 884-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The Government presented evidence that Dunkley purchased NYPD disguises online. The evidence indicated that a \u201cDerrick Davis\u201d \u2014 Davis is the last name of Derrick Dunkley\u2019s aunt \u2014 ordered three NYPD raincoats on eBay in November 2011 and had them shipped to Dunkley\u2019s residence. J.A. at 1029-33, 824, 1998. An eBay seller testified that \u201cDerrick Davis\u201d also bought three leather NYPD-style badge holders, which were shipped to Dunkley\u2019s address. J.A. at 1239-42. An eBay corporate representative testified that the \u201cDerrick Davis\u201d user account that made these purchases was linked to Dunk-ley\u2019s credit card and address. J.A. at 1547, 1551-52,1554-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Government also presented evidence that Byam and Monsalvatge were involved in purchasing high-end masks that match those used by the robbers during the 2012 robbery. An NYPD detective testified that, based on his review of the surveillance footage, he concluded that the robbers were wearing high-quality, life-like masks. J.A. at 887-90. The detective contacted two companies that make such masks to verify whether either had shipped masks resembling the surveillance footage to anyone in the New York area. J.A. at 890. The owner of Composite Effects, one of those companies, testified that Byam had ordered three special effects masks in October 2011, which totaled just under $1,800. J.A. at 1446. The masks were shipped to Monsalvatge\u2019s girlfriend, with whom Monsalvatge lived. J.A. at 1130, 1445, 2015. E-mails sent by Byam to Composite Effects included the same phone number that was listed on the Walgreen\u2019s receipt for the photograph shown during the robbery to the Pay-O-Matic employee. J.A. at 866-67, 1115, 1445. In late November 2011, Byam e-mailed Composite Effects to state that he was \u201cextremely pleased\u201d with the masks and to ask for advice on wearing the masks. J.A. at 1451-52, 1171. The owner of Composite Effects identified one of the masks in the surveillance video as one created by his company, J.A. at 1452-55, and testified that an individual\u2019s lips may be visible through the mask when not properly fitted, J.A. at 1449-50, which could explain one witness\u2019s account that all three robbers had brown lips despite their faces being light-skinned, J.A. at 761-62, 872-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">When Monsalvatge was arrested, he was found with a police scanner that resembled the one in the surveillance video. J.A. at 2020-22; <em>see </em>J.A. at 880. When Byam was arrested, he- had in his possession a partially completed Pay-O-Matic employment application, J.A. at 2122-24, and luxury items \u2014 including Gucci luggage, a Rolex watch worth over $10,000, Louis Vuitton sneakers, and a gold and diamond earring \u2014 were found at his residence, J.A. at 2130. When Dunkley was arrested, a search of his computer showed an internet search for \u201cNYPD jackets\u201d and multiple searches about the federal criminal justice-system. J.A. at 2264-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The Government connected the black Ford Explorer used in the robbery to Byam; the car was also caught on surveillance tape outside the Pay-O-Matic twice in the week before the robbery. J.A. at 891-92; <em>see </em>J.A. at 713, 799-801, 852-53, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>881-88. The Government presented evidence establishing that all three defendants had conducted transactions at a Pay-O-Matic store, totaling nine transactions in 2010 and 2011, J.A. at 819-28, and presented text messages between the defendants that suggested criminal activity, <em>see generally </em>J.A. at 2291-806.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Finally, the Government presented evidence establishing that all three defendants went on spending sprees in the months after the 2012 robbery: Dunkley deposited thousands of dollars of cash into his checking account, J.A. at 1344-50; Mon-salvatge opened a new bank account on February 15, 2014 and deposited over $6,000 in cash, J.A. at 1182-85; Byam and Monsalvatge took a trip to Canc\u00fan in May 2012, J.A. at 1131; Byam bought his girlfriend a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes and bought himself Gucci luggage, J.A. at 1133-35; and Monsalvatge\u2019s accounts showed thousands of dollars spent on spas, luxury goods, and extensive travel, J.A. at 1184-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The film excerpts from <em>The Tenon </em>were a relatively small part of the evidence presented by the Government: the clips that were played totaled.only one minute in length, a small sliver of the six-day trial, and were only briefly addressed by the testifying witness. <em>See </em>J.A. at 1074-77. The excerpts were not discussed again until summations, when they were again only one small piece of a much larger picture. <em>See </em>J.A. at 2426-28. Counsel for each defendant discredited the importance of the clips in their respective summations. <em>See </em>J.A. at 2474, 2497-98, 2526. In light of the weight of this evidence and the relatively small role the film clips played at trial, it is beyond a reasonable doubt that a jury would have convicted the defendants regardless of the admission of the movie excerpts. <em>See United States v. Chandia, </em>514 F.3d 365, 375 (4th Cir. 2008) (\u201cEven if admission of the video clips was error, it was harmless in this case. The clips were not a central part of the government\u2019s case; in fact, they took up only three minutes during the nearly five days the government spent presenting its case-in-chief. In addition, the excerpts were shown only once, were not used to frame the government\u2019s case at the trial, and were not unduly emphasized during the government\u2019s arguments to the jury.\u201d); <em>see also McCallum, </em>584 F.3d at 478. Accordingly, their admission constitutes harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"pA2zs\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In sum, because the film clips\u2019 minimal probative value is significantly outweighed by the potential for prejudice, the district court abused its discretion in admitting them and in failing to conduct the requisite balancing under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. However, given the overwhelming weight of the evidence against the defendants and the relatively minimal role the film clips played at trial, I find that the error was harmless and I would affirm the convictions. Accordingly, I respectfully concur in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
