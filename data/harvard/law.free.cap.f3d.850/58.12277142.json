The district court first dismissed appellants\u2019 cause of action to enforce the foreign arbitral award on the basis that the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>required appellants to seek confirmation of the foreign arbitral award prior to enforcement. The district court also dismissed appellants\u2019 five causes of action for fraud on the basis of issue preclusion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> due to prior consideration of certain fraud issues by the arbitral panel. After appellants filed a second proceeding seeking to confirm the foreign arbitral award and filed an amended complaint in the enforcement proceeding, the district court dismissed the action to confirm on the basis that the award-debtor was immune from suit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(b) and then dismissed the amended action to enforce for failure to confirm the foreign arbitral award.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We hold the district court erred (1) in determining that the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>require appellants to seek confirmation of a foreign arbitral award before the award may be enforced by a United States District Court and (2) in holding that appellants\u2019 fraud claims should be dismissed prior to discovery on the ground of issue preclusion as issue preclusion is an equitable doctrine and appellants plausibly allege that appellees engaged in fraud. Accordingly, in No. 15-1133, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the action to enforce and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion; in 15-1146, we find the appeal of the district court\u2019s order in the action to confirm is moot and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">We further grant appellees\u2019 petition for rehearing for the limited purpose of vacating the original decision and simultaneously issuing this amended decision to correct our instructions to the district court with regards to the applicable law for an enforcement action at Section I.c., <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aop\">I. The Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">Appellants are a group of foreign companies organized under the laws of, and with their offices located in, Brazil. They produce and supply \u201cpig iron,\u201d which is a type of \u201cintermediate metal made by smelting iron ore with high-carbon fuel.\u201d App\u2019x at 789 \u00b6 27. Pig iron can then be further refined to become steel or wrought iron.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">Appellees are a group of interrelated companies (collectively, the \u201ccorporate ap-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>pellees\u201d) and two individuals, Hans Mende and Fritz Kundrun (collectively, the \u201cindividual appellees\u201d). According to appellants, the individual appellees financially control, directly or indirectly, the corporate appel-lees.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II. Allegations in the Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">As this is an appeal taken from a decision on a motion to dismiss, the facts are largely drawn from the amended complaint and are accepted as true for the purposes of this appeal. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 </em>U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Beginning in the mid-1990s, appellants sold pig iron to a Swiss company called Primetrade AG. Some portion of that pig iron was then supplied to Primetrade USA which, appellants allege, together with Pri-metrade AG, \u201coperated as one company\u201d at all relevant times. App\u2019x at 790 \u00b6 30.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On or about February 28, 2004, a bulk carrier transporting cargo for Primetrade AG exploded off the coast of Colombia, causing the death of the master and five crew members. In April 2005, Primetrade AG transferred its assets, including its agreements with appellants, to Steel Base Trade, AG (\u201cSBT\u201d), a Swiss company, which \u201cbegan operating with the same officers and directors as Primetrade AG and at the same offices.\u201d App\u2019x at 790 \u00b6 32. The transfer to SBT was apparently due to the fact that Primetrade AG garnered negative publicity following litigation arising out of the ship explosion. [JA 41] Silvio Moreira, a representative of Primetrade AG in Brazil, informed two of the appellants that \u201cthe business would be the same, just under a different name.\u201d App\u2019x at 790 \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">On or about October 5, 2007, AMCI International GmbH (\u201cAMCI International\u201d), a company owned and controlled by the individual appellees, purchased SBT and its U.S. subsidiary, Primetrade USA. In 2008, appellants and SBT entered into ten separate contracts for the sale and purchase of 103,500 metric tons of pig iron to SBT for more than $76 million (the \u201cContracts\u201d). Only appellants and SBT are signatories of the Contracts; none of the appellees are signatories. Appellants claim four of the ten Contracts provided for delivery of pig iron in the United States. The delivery dates were set from April 2008 through December 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">Each of the Contracts contained the following identical arbitration provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-13\">All disputes arising in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled under the rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, Paris, by one or more arbiter, appointed in accordance with said rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">App\u2019x at 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 109, 116, 123, 130, 792. The Contracts did not provide that they were entered into on behalf of any other party or specify that they are binding on successors-in-interest or assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">Initially, in accordance with the Contracts, SBT purchased 33,056 metric tons of pig iron. Subsequently, however, SBT ceased purchasing pig iron from appellants as required by the Contracts and, by October 2008, SBT was in default of the Contracts. Indeed, in 2008, as the global economy declined, the so-called \u201ccommodities bubble\u201d burst, causing many commodities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>to drop in price by more than a third. <em>See, e.g., </em>Clifford Krauss, <em>Commodity Prices Tumble, </em>N.Y. Times, Oct. 13, 2008, http:// www.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/business/ economy/14commodities.html (stating that \u201c[m]etals, like aluminum, copper, and nickel have declined by a third or more.\u201d). Soon thereafter, appellants contacted SBT regarding its non-compliance with the Contracts and, on November 20, 2008, SBT representative Dominic Sigrist responded via e-mail, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">You know our group and it is not our style to walk away from obligations.... We will need a long time to work this out together. My message to your group is: we are not walking away!!!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">App\u2019x at 792 \u00b6 42. Appellants allege this was a false representation made in furtherance of Mende and Kundrun\u2019s fraudulent conveyance scheme, which involved selling SBT\u2019s assets to a separate entity\u2014 a shell company owned by Mende and Kundrun. Despite SBT\u2019s statement that it would not walk away from its obligations, appellants allege they learned through publicly available shipping records that SBT had been purchasing pig iron from other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">On September 11, 2009, appellants sent a written notice to SBT stating amounts due from SBT under the Contracts and proposing negotiation prior to submitting the contract breach to arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce, Paris (the \u201cICC Paris\u201d). SBT allegedly asked for some time to evaluate the Contracts and respond to the offer to negotiate. Appellants allege, however, that this was simply a ruse to buy time to allow its alter-egos, appellees, to \u201cengage in a scheme to leave SBT assetless and unable to pay its some of creditors, including [appellants].\u201d App\u2019x at 793 \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">III. Arbitration Proceedings, the Transfer Agreement, and SBT\u2019s Bankruptcy</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">When SBT ultimately responded but failed to either provide a settlement proposal or provide an indication that it would perform the Contracts, appellants filed a request for arbitration in accordance with the arbitration clause of the Contracts with the ICC Paris on November 16, 2009. Soon thereafter, SBT requested an extension of time from the ICC Paris until February 15, 2010 to answer the request for arbitration. The ICC Paris granted an extension until January 27, 2010. During this period, appellants allege that SBT, at Mende and Kundrun\u2019s direction, formulated and enacted \u201ctheir [fraudulent] scheme to transfer all of SBT\u2019s assets to a preexisting shell company owned by Mende and Kundrun\u201d on December 23, 2009. App\u2019x at 793 \u00b6 48. For example, appellants learned through publicly available records that a Swiss entity named Prime Carbon GmbH (\u201cPrime Carbon\u201d) had begun making significant purchases of pig iron. On January 15, 2010, appellants sent a letter to the ICC Paris suggesting that SBT appeared to be \u201ctransferring its business operations and assets to Prime Carbon[.]\u201d App\u2019x at 794 \u00b6 50. Appellants had discovered that: (a) Prime Carbon had the same address as SBT\u2019s parent company AMCI International; (b) Mende was the President of the Board of Directors of Prime Carbon; (c) former directors of SBT had become directors of Prime Carbon; and (d) SBT\u2019s website was no longer available. Ten days later, SBT responded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-15\">[SBT] does not try to evade from its obligations^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-16\">It is true that the website www. st\u00e9elbasetrade.com was shut down at the beginning of January 2010[.] The reason is that [SBT] first has to analyze [its] position regarding pending or imminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>claims for damages from purchasers as well as against suppliers as well as [its] financial situation[.] Therefore, [SBT] has at least temporarily suspended [its] business activities. Please note, however, [SBT] is still existing and has not resolved to be dissolved and liquidated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap2\">App\u2019x at 794 \u00b6 51. According to appellants, this letter represents an additional intentional misrepresentation made by appel-lees to both appellants and the ICC Paris in order for the appellees to \u201cbuy time\u201d while they \u201ceffectuate[d] their plan to make SBT an assetless and 'judgment' proof company.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Indeed, on December 27, 2009, around one month before SBT submitted its answer to appellants\u2019 Request for Arbitration and two weeks before SBT sent its letter to the ICC Paris stating it \u201cha[d] not resolved to be dissolved and liquidated[,]\u201d appellants allege SBT entered into a transfer agreement with Prime Carbon. <em>See CBF Ind\u00fastria de Gusa S/A/ v. AMCI Holdings, Inc. </em>No. 13 Civ. 2581, 2015 WL 1190137, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2015) (hereinafter \u201cEnforcement Decision\u201d). Under this transfer agreement, designated as a \u201csingle entity succession\u201d by the terms of the agreement, Prime Carbon became SBT\u2019s successor in interest. SBT transferred nearly all of its assets, valued at approximately $126 million, along with liabilities of approximately $130 million to Prime Carbon in exchange for $1. App\u2019x at 795-96 \u00b6\u00b6 58-59. The transferred assets included SBT\u2019s ownership stake in Prime-trade USA (its main asset), shares of an Aruba LLC, insurance policies and physical assets, and bank lines. SBT\u2019s sole remaining asset after the transfer was a few thousand Swiss francs (\u201cCHF\u201d). SBT also retained approximately $50 million in liability to appellants and $4.5 million in liability to anoth\u00e9r creditor, Progress Rail. Appellants describe the transfer agreement as a \u201cturn-key operation\u201d so that Prime Carbon could \u201cseamlessly assume SBT\u2019s place in the pig iron market without any contractual obligations to Appellants.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">On January 18, 2010, SBT sent letters to a variety of its pig iron suppliers notifying them that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">(i) as of November 30, 2009, SBT had transferred all Goods and the respective title of the Goods to Prime Carbon; (ii) Prime Carbon was the new and sole owner of the Goods; (iii) Prime Carbon assumes all rights with respect to the transferred Goods; and (iv) Prime Carbon is willing to enter in[to] all contracts between your company and [SBT] and to perform under the same conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">App\u2019x at 794-95 \u00b6 53 (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the letters advised pig iron suppliers \u201cto act from the time being only on [the] instruction of Prime Carbon.\u201d App\u2019x at 795 \u00b6 54. According to appellants, \u201cSBT, at Mende\u2019s and Kundrun\u2019s direction, used the delay granted by the ICC Paris to effectuate their plan to transfer SBT\u2019s assets to a new company ultimately owned by them.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">. Following the transfer agreement, Prime Carbon (a) had at least five of the same directors as SBT; (b) assumed ten of SBT\u2019s employment contracts; (c) appointed Mende to serve as the President of its Board of Directors; and (d) had, at all times, either the same address as SBT or the same address as AMCI International. The boards of SBT and Prime Carbon formally approved the transfer agreement on January 27, 2010, just two days after SBT had informed ICC Paris that SBT \u201cdoes not try to evade from its obligations\u201d and that SBT \u201cis still existing and has not resolved to be dissolved and liquidated,\u201d App\u2019x at 794 \u00b6 51, and the same day SBT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>filed its answer to appellant\u2019s Request for Arbitration, App\u2019x at 797 \u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">On April 27, 2010, SBT mysteriously transferred 15,000 CHF to Prime Carbon. Afterward, SBT was left with only 7,000 CHF in assets. The next day, April 28, 2010, SBT filed for bankruptcy in Switzerland before the Cantonal Court of Zug. Appellants note that, despite having little to no assets following the transfer agreement, SBT waited four -months to file for bankruptcy. Appellants also contend that the transfer of 15,000 CHF to Prime Carbon on April 27, 2010 was an intentional act designed to make it impossible for SBT\u2019s bankruptcy administrator to participate in the arbitration on SBT\u2019s behalf. Appellants, however, admit that \u201cnone of SBT\u2019s records provide a contemporaneous explanation\u201d for the transfer. Appellants\u2019 Br. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">SBT\u2019s bankruptcy administrator thereafter sought a stay of the arbitration proceedings pending before the ICC Paris on June 18, 2010. The ICC Paris did not initially rule on the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">IV. The Arbitration Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">On June 23, 2010, after appellants became aware of the transfer agreement and after they had made several requests to ICC Paris to take action with regards to SBT and the assets transferred to Prime Carbon during the arbitration proceedings, appellants requested that the ICC Paris grant appellants interim relief to allow appellants to seize up to approximately $42 million of SBT\u2019s. In their petition, appellants alleged wrongful asset transfers and requested the ICC Paris grant them relief allowing them to seize assets held by SBT' or held in the name of Prime Carbon. Following a hearing, the ICC Paris ordered appellants to specify the interim relief they sought from SBT. Appellants submitted a petition for interim relief on July 2, 2010, and sought an order for SBT to post a guarantee and to provide documents and information regarding its company (including its shareholders, its directors, its assets, and its liabilities). In that request and related correspondence, appellants specifically requested that the ICC Paris \u201c[r]ecognize the existence of fraudulent acts\u201d as a basis upon which appellants might reach the assets of related third parties, \u201crecognize as illegal the fraud perpetrated by [SBT], which shall then be held liable, permitting [appellants] to pursue [their] credits against [SBT\u2019s] shareholders and managers, by application of the disregard doctrine[,]\u201d \u201crecognize these acts taken in the course of the procedure as frauds[,]\u201d and \u201cdecide upon the interim measures which are necessary to make an upcoming award effective.\u201d App\u2019x at 151 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 155 \u00b6\u00b6 35-36 (internal quotation marks omitted). Appellants also asserted that they were \u201cpursuing a reasonable relief by means of having their credit duly recognized, as well as the fraud carried out by [SBT] in the course of the procedure, so that they c[ould] pierce the corporate veil and make [SBT\u2019s] shareholders, directors[,] and affiliated companies liable for the losses caused to [appellants.]\u201d App\u2019x at 154 \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">On September 21, 2010, the ICC Paris held a hearing regarding whether SBT was transferring its assets. SBT neither attended the hearing nor asked for the hearing to be postponed. Thereafter, the ICC Paris sent questions to all parties on September 27, 2010; these questions included inquiries into whether SBT had \u201ctransferred goods and respective titles of goods to Prime Carbon AG or to any other company after being notified of the Request for Arbitration\u201d and whether SBT \u201csold, donatedf,] or transferred assets, re-ceivablesf,] or rights to third parties after the date [SBT] w[as] notified of the instau-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ration of th[e] arbitration procedure\u201d before the ICC Paris. App\u2019x at 151-52 \u00b6 28. SBT did not provide any response and also did not respond to the ICC Paris\u2019s order to \u201cprovide information of which assets, receivables[,] and rights have been sold, donated[,] or somehow transferred to third parties after the date they were notified of the instauration of th[e] arbitration procedure.\u201d App\u2019x at 592. After considering these allegations, the ICC Paris deferred decision until the merits phase of the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">As the ICC Paris did not initially rule on SBT\u2019s bankruptcy administrator\u2019s seeking of a stay of the arbitration proceedings in June 2010, the administrator renewed his request for a stay on December 15, 2010. On March 29, 2011, the administrator informed the ICC Paris that he had determined that SBT had insufficient funds to participate in the arbitration and that the estate and SBT\u2019s creditors did not wish to defend the claims before the ICC Paris. The bankruptcy administrator therefore admitted the claims against SBT as well as the damages sought by appellants (51,756,269.75 CHF).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">On November 9, 2011, the ICC Paris rendered an arbitral award (the \u201caward\u201d or \u201cforeign arbitral award\u201d) in favor of appellants for $48,053,462.16 plus interest, and granted appellants arbitration costs and legal fees in the amount of $860,000. The ICC Paris did not grant appellants\u2019 requested relief to reach Prime Carbon or any other third parties, shareholders, or directors, holding that appellants \u201cdid not introduce sufficient evidence in the present proceedings to demonstrate the existence of fraud in the bankruptcy proceedings.\u201d Enforcement Decision, 2015 WL 1190137, at *6 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">V. The Action in Brazilian Courts</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Concurrent with its requests for interim relief from the ICC Paris, appellants also took additional actions in an effort to prevent SBT\u2019s attempts to flout its contractual obligations. In particular, appellants sought an order in the Judicial Body of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Second District Court of Rio de Janeiro (the \u201cBrazilian District Court\u201d), against both SBT and Prime Carbon to prevent the departure of pig iron from Brazilian ports that had been purchased by Prime Carbon during the pendency of the ICC Paris arbitration. On March 22, 2010, the Brazilian District Court granted the preliminary order, finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201cPostponing\u201d the adoption of the measures (requested by [appellants]) can \u201crealistically\u201d cause them a serious, irreparable or hardly reparable damage, also taking into account the \u201cuncertainty\u201d regarding the current economic situation of [SBT and Prime Carbon], considering the \u201cfraud\u201d that might have been perpetrated' in the case at stake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHp\">App\u2019x at 798 \u00b6 73. SBT and Prime Carbon appealed the Brazilian District Court\u2019s order to the Court of Justice, Thirteenth District Court of Rio de Janeiro (the \u201cBrazilian Appeals Court\u201d). On March 31, 2010, the Brazilian Appeals Court upheld the Brazilian District Court\u2019s order because \u201cit [wa]s certain that [SBT and Prime Carbon] d[id] not provide evidence to \u2018prove\u2019 that they have sufficient \u2018means\u2019 for \u2018in theory\u2019 honoring the mentioned debt (that appears to be \u2018partly\u2019 acknowledged).\u201d App\u2019x at 798 \u00b6 74. During the week the appeal was pending, however, Prime Carbon left port with the pig iron cargo and appellants were thereafter unable to secure relief in the Brazilian action.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">VI. Appellants\u2019 Attempts to Collect on the Arbitral Award</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">On January 24, 2012, the SBT bankruptcy administrator issued a final report and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>on January 27, 2012, SBT\u2019s bankruptcy was declared closed. Because SBT had transferred almost all of its assets to Prime Carbon, appellants were unable to enforce their award from the ICC Paris against SBT. When appellants sent notices to SBT-related companies, most did not reply and those that replied denied involvement with SBT. Appellants allege they were also unable to pursue claims against Prime Carbon because appellees had transferred Prime Carbon\u2019s ownership stake in Primetrade USA to AMCI Holdings, Inc., a United States company under the ownership of Mende and Kundrun.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">VII. The Enforcement Action</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">On April 18, 2013, appellants filed an action to enforce their foreign arbitral award in the district court for the Southern District of New York, seeking to enforce the award against SBT\u2019s \u201calter egos\u201d and \u201csuccessor[s]-in-interest\u201d as well as to recover on state law fraud claims (the \u201cEnforcement Action\u201d). App\u2019x at 37. On July 30, 2013, appellees filed a motion to dismiss the Enforcement Action on the grounds that, among other things, forum in the United States was improper (forum non conveniens), that the action was an improper effort to modify the award, and that appellants were precluded from asserting the state law fraud claims because their fraud claims had been denied by the ICC Paris. Appellants assert that while briefing was \u201congoing\u201d in the Enforcement Action, unbeknownst to appellants, SBT was deleted from the Swiss Commercial Register on September 30, 2013. Appellants\u2019 Br. at 19 (citing App\u2019x at 1249 &amp; n.6). Appellants also allege that appellees never disclosed this fact to the district court in their reply brief or in any of their other motions in the Enforcement Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">On April 9, 2014 and again on March 16, 2015,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court dismissed the Enforcement Action, holding. that appellants could enforce the award only after the award was confirmed in Switzerland or another court of competent jurisdiction, and dismissed the state law fraud claims on the basis that appellants were precluded from asserting them. Enforcement Decision, 2015 WL 1190137, at *1, *8-*9 (dismissing enforcement action); <em>CBF Ind\u00fastria de Gusa S/A/ v. AMCI Holdings, Inc. </em>14 F.Supp.3d 463, 473-79 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (hereinafter \u201cInitial Order\u201d) (dismissing enforcement claim for failure to file confirmation action and dismissing fraud claims). The district court held that under <em>Orion Shipping &amp; Trading Co., Inc. v. E. States Petroleum Corp., </em>312 F.2d 299, 301 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>373 U.S. 949, 83 S.Ct. 1679, 10 L.Ed.2d 705 (1963), appellants could not pursue enforcement of an arbitral award under the Convention for the Enforcement and Recognition of Foreign Arbi-tral Awards (the \u201cNew York Convention\u201d) and its implementing legislation, Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>without first confirming the award. Enforcement Decision, 2015 WL 1190137, at *8-*9; Initial Order, 14 F.Supp.3d at 476-79. The district court held that <em>Orion </em>required a two-step process by which appellants were required to confirm the award prior to seeking enforcement of that award. Initial Order, 14 F.Supp.3d at 478-79. Appellants had proposed a \u201ccarve-out\u201d whereby confirmation was not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>when confirmation was made impossible by appellees\u2019 alleged fraudulent acts. <em>See </em>Enforcement Decision, 2015 WL 1190137, at *8. Appellants argued in support that the confirmation \u201c \u2018prerequisite should not apply where alter ego defendants, through their own intentional wrongdoing, foreclosed any opportunity to confirm the award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court rejected appellants\u2019 argument, reasoning that this proposed exception would \u201cundermine \u2018the twin goals of arbitration, namely, settling disputes efficiently and avoiding long and expensive litigation.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *9 (quoting <em>Encyclopaedia Universalis S.A. v. Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., </em>403 F.3d 85, 90 (2d Cir. 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The district court also dismissed appellants\u2019 five causes of action for fraud on the basis that the claims sought \u201ca remedy previously sought by [appellants] in the ICC [a]rbitration\u201d and therefore were barred under a theory of issue preclusion. Initial Order, 14 F.Supp.3d at 480. The district court observed that, as it sat in secondary jurisdiction with regard to appellants\u2019 arbitral award, it could not modify that award either during the enforcement of the award or pursuant to appellants\u2019 fraud-based causes of action. Enforcement Decision, 2015 WL 1190137, at *9 (citing Initial Order, 14 F. Supp. 3d at 480); Initial Order, 14 F.Supp.3d at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">VIII. The Confirmation Action</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In response to the district court\u2019s initial ruling that <em>Orion </em>required \u25a0 appellants to confirm their award prior to seeking its enforcement, appellants initiated an action on April 29, 2014 to confirm the arbitral award in the same district court (the \u201cConfirmation Action\u201d). As a legal entity, however, SBT was effectively a nullity after it was deleted from the Swiss Commercial Register. <em>See </em>Peter Forstmoser et al., <em>Swiss Company Law </em>\u00a7 56, N 153 (1996) <em>(\u201cA practical effect </em>is, however, had by the striking of the corporation from the register, as this means the corporation is <em>no longer able to act externally: </em>it is no longer able to ... be sued or have debt collection proceedings filed against it.\u201d (italics in original)). As a result, the district court held that, under Rule 17(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, SBT lacked capacity to be sued because it was no longer a corporate entity according to Swiss law. <em>CBF Ind\u00fastria de Gusa S/A v. Steel Base Trade AG, </em>No. 14 Civ. 3034, 2015 WL 1191269, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2015) (hereinafter \u201cConfirmation Decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The district court also held that appel-lees were not judicially estopped from asserting SBT\u2019s lack of capacity as a defense. Appellants had argued that \u201c[appellees] asserted repeatedly . that Switzerland and France provided adequate forums for [appellants\u2019] claims [against SBT] and, indeed, were the proper forums for this actionf,]\u201d thereby estopping appellees from arguing SBT lacked capacity to be sued in any fora. Confirmation Decision, 2015 WL 1191269, at *3 (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court noted that, under Second Circuit precedent, a party may be judicially estopped from asserting a position if \u201c(1) the party took an inconsistent position in a prior proceeding and (2) that position was adopted by the first tribunal in some manner, such as by rendering a favorable judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Holtz v. Rockefeller &amp; Co., </em>258 F.3d 62, 80 (2d Cir. 2001) and citing <em>Mitchell v. Washingtonville Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>190 F.3d 1, 6-8 (2d Cir. 1999)). The district court noted that \u201c[t]he purposes of the doctrine are to preserve the sanctity of the oath and to protect judicial integrity by avoiding the risk of inconsistent results in two proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>190 F.3d at 6). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>But the district court held that, because the Enforcement Action was not dismissed on the grounds of forum non conveniens, the second prong of <em>Holtz </em>did not apply and appellees were therefore not judicially estopped from making the argument that SBT presently lacked capacity to be sued. <em>Id. </em>at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">IX. Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Appellants timely filed their appeals from both the Enforcement Decision (No. 15-1133) and the Confirmation Decision (No. 15-1146). In their consolidated appeals, appellants argue, in relevant part, that: (1) the district court erred in holding that <em>Orion Shipping &amp; Trading Co., </em>312 F.2d at 300-01, required appellants to confirm their foreign arbitral award prior to enforcement; (2) the district court erred in dismissing appellants\u2019 fraud claims on the basis of issue preclusion; and (3) the district court erred in determining that equitable estoppel did not preclude appellees from using SBT\u2019s immunity from suit as a basis for dismissing the Confirmation Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Appellees contest each of appellants\u2019 arguments and further argue in response .that this court should affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 Enforcement Action and Confirmation Action on the alternative grounds of forum non con-veniens and international comity.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">I. The District Court Erred in Holding Appellants were Required to Confirm their Foreign Arbitral Award Prior to Enforcement</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">a. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">This court \u201creview[s] a district court\u2019s legal interpretations of the New York Convention as well as its contract interpretation <em>de novo; </em>findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>VRG Linhas Aereas S.A. v. MatlinPatterson Glob. Opportunities Partners II L.P., </em>717 F.3d 322, 325 (2d Cir. 2013) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">b. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">This action arises under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517. The United States acceded to the New York Convention on September 30, 1970, and it entered into force in the United States on December 29, 1970. Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517 (hereinafter \u201cN.Y. Convention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">The New York Convention only applies to \u201cthe recognition and enforcement of ar-bitral awards made in the territory of a State other than the State where the recognition and enforcement of such awards are sought\u201d and to \u201carbitral awards not considered as domestic awards in the State where their recognition and enforcement are sought.\u201d N.Y. Convention, art. 1(1). According to the Restatement (Third) of the U.S. Law of International Commercial Arbitration, an arbitral award is \u201cmade\u201d in the country of the \u201carbitral seat,\u201d which is \u201cthe jurisdiction designated by the parties or by an entity empowered to do so on their behalf to be the juridical home of the arbitration.\u201d Restatement (Third) of the U.S. Law of Int\u2019l Commercial Arbitration \u00a7 1-1 (s), (aa) (Am. Law Inst., Tentative Draft No. 2, 2012). Thus, the New York Convention applies to arbitral awards \u201cmade\u201d in a foreign country that a party seeks to enforce in the United States (known as foreign arbitral awards), to arbi-tral awards \u201cmade\u201d in the United States that a party seeks to enforce in a different country, and to nondomestic arbitral awards that a party seeks to enforce in the United States. <em>See, e.g., </em>Restatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>(Third) of the U.S. Law of Int\u2019l Commercial Arbitration \u00a7 1-1 (i), (k), (o) (Am. Law Inst., Tentative Draft No. 2, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Here, the parties set the seat of the arbitration as the ICC Paris in Paris, France. The arbitral award which appellants seek to enforce was rendered by the ICC Paris under French law. Initial Order, 14 F.Supp.3d at 474. The parties are thus correct that the New York Convention governs this case as a matter of international arbitration law. Since the arbitral award was made in France while recognition and enforcement is sought in the Southern District of New York, this litigation presents a classic cas\u00e9 of a foreign arbitral award.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Under the New York Convention, the country in which the award is made \u201cis said to have <em>primary </em>jurisdiction over the arbitration award.\u201d <em>Karaha Bodas Co., L.L.C. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, </em>500 F.3d 111, 115 n.1 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter <em>\u201cKaraha Bodas 2d Cir.\u201d). </em>\u201cThe [New York] Convention specifically contemplates that the state in which, or under the law of which, [an] award is made, will be free to set aside or modify an award in accordance with its domestic arbitral law and its full panoply of express and implied grounds for relief.\u201d <em>Yusuf Ahmed Alghanim &amp; Sons v. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc., </em>126 F.3d 15, 23 (2d Cir. 1997) (citing N.Y. Convention, art. V(l)(e)). Here, that country is France because the parties agreed to arbitrate before the ICC Paris. \u201cAll other signatory States are <em>secondary </em>jurisdictions, in which parties can only contest whether that State should enforce the arbitral award.\u201d <em>Karaha Bodas 2d Cir., </em>500 F.3d at 115 n.1 (citation omitted). \u201c[C]ourts in countries of <em>secondary </em>jurisdiction may refuse enforcement only on the limited grounds specified in Article V\u201d of the New York Convention. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>Yusuf Ahmed Alghanim &amp; Sons, </em>126 F.3d at 23 (\u201c[T]he [New York] Convention is equally clear that when an action for enforcement is brought in a foreign state, the state may refuse to enforce the award only on the grounds explicitly set forth in Article V of the [New York] Convention.\u201d). The district court here sits in secondary jurisdiction with respect to the foreign arbitral award at issue. Initial Order, 14 F.Supp.3d at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>implements the United States\u2019 obligations under the New York Convention. <em>See Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 520 n.15, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). Section 203 provides that original jurisdiction for \u201c[a]n action or proceeding falling under the [New York] Convention\u201d lies in the United States federal district courts. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 203. Under Section 202, actions or proceedings that \u201cfall[ ] under the [New York] Convention\u201d include \u201carbitration agreements] or arbitral award[s] arising out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered as commercial\u201d between any parties, <em>unless </em>both parties are citizens of the United States <em>and </em>\u201cthat relationship involves [neither] property located abroad, [nor] envisages performance or enforcement abroad, [n]or has some other reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 202. As the instant case involves non-U.S. citizens \u2014 all of the appellants, for example, are Brazilian corporate entities\u2014 this case properly falls under Chapter 2 of the FAA as well as under the New York Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">\u201cThe goal of the [New York] Convention, and the principal purpose underlying American adoption and implementation of it, was to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>agreements in international contracts and to unify the standards . by which agreements to arbitrate are observed, and arbi-tral awards are enforced in the signatory countries.\u201d <em>Scherk, </em>417 U.S. at 520 n. 15, 94 S.Ct. 2449 (citations omitted). Thus, both the New York Convention and its implementing legislation in Chapter 2 of the FAA \u201cenvision a single-step process for reducing a foreign arbitral award to a domestic judgment.\u201d Amicus Curiae Memorandum Br. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Under the New York Convention, this process of reducing a foreign arbitral award to a judgment is referred to as \u201crecognition and enforcement.\u201d N.Y. Convention, arts. Ill, IV, V. \u201cRecognition\u201d is the determination that an arbitral award is entitled to preclusive effect; \u201cEnforcement\u201d is the reduction to a judgment of a foreign arbitral award (as contrasted with a nondomestic arbitral award, discussed below). Restatement (Third) of the U.S. Law of Int\u2019l Commercial Arbitration \u00a7 1-1(0, (z) (Am. Law Inst., Tentative Draft No. 2, 2012). Recognition and enforcement occur together, as one process, under the New York Convention. N.Y. Convention, arts. Ill, IV, V.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Chapter 2 of the FAA implements this scheme through Section 207, which provides that any party may, \u201c[wjithin three years after an arbitral award ... is made, ... apply to any court having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 207. Additionally, Chapter 2 of the FAA provides that \u201c[t]he court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the [New York] Convention\u201d at Article V. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 207. Read in context with the New York Convention, it is evident that the term \u201cconfirm\u201d as used in Section 207<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is the equivalent of \u201crecognition and enforcement\u201d as used in the New York Convention for the purposes of foreign arbitral awards. As the United States as <em>amicus </em>curiae<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> explained, \u201cthe \u2018confirmation\u2019 proceeding under Chapter Two of the FAA fulfills the United States\u2019 obligation under the [New York] Convention to provide procedures for \u2018recognition and enforcement\u2019 of [New York] Convention arbitral awards.\u201d Amicus Curiae Memorandum Br. at 7. A single proceeding, therefore, \u201cfacilitate[s] the enforcement of arbitration awards by enabling parties to enforce them in third countries without first having to obtain either confirmation of such awards or leave to enforce them from a court in the country of the arbitral situs.\u201d <em>Karaha Bodas Co., L.L.C. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, </em>335 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir. 2003) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">This, in fact, was the entire purpose of the New York Convention, .which \u201csucceeded and replaced the Convention on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards (\u2018Geneva Convention\u2019), Sept. 26, 1927, 92 L.N.T.S. 301.\u201d <em>Yusuf Ahmed Alghanim &amp; Sons, </em>126 F.3d at 22. \u201cThe primary defect of the Geneva Convention was that it required an award first to be recognized in the rendering state before it could be enforced abroad[.j\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). This was known as the \u201cdouble <em>exequatur </em>requirement, and the New York Convention did away with it \u201cby eradicating the requirement that a court in the rendering state recognize an award before it could be taken and enforced abroad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (stating that the New York Convention \u201cintentionally liberalized procedures for enforcing foreign arbitral awards\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">For the sake of completeness and in an effort to dispel confusion in this area, we will briefly discuss the components of and process for a nondomestic arbitral award.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">As noted above, in addition to covering foreign arbitral awards (awards made in one country for which enforcement is sought in another, such as the arbitral award at issue here), the New York Convention also applies to \u201carbitral awards not considered as domestic awards in the State where their recognition and enforcement are sought.\u201d N.Y. Convention, art. 1(1). Under Second Circuit precedent, a non-domestic arbitral award is an award that is \u201cmade\u201d in the United States because the parties agreed to arbitrate before an arbitrator in the United States, but which nonetheless falls under the New York Convention and Chapter 2 of the FAA for one of two reasons: (1) it was \u201cmade within the legal framework of another country, e.g., pronounced in accordance with foreign law[,]\u201d <em>Bergesen v. Joseph Muller Corp., </em>710 F.2d 928, 932 (2d Cir. 1983), or (2) it was decided under the laws of the United States but involves either entities that are not U.S. citizens or, even if only U.S. citizens are involved, also involves \u201cproperty located abroad, [or] envisages performance or enforcement abroad, or has some other reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 202; <em>see Yusuf Ahmed Alghanim &amp; Sons, </em>126 F.3d at 18-19 (noting \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit similarly has interpreted [Section] 202 to mean that any commercial arbitral agreement, unless it is between two United States citizens, involves\u2019 property located in the United States, and has no reasonable relationship with one or more foreign states, falls under the [New York] Convention\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). These types of awards are sometimes referred to as <em>Bergesen </em>awards or U.S. Convention awards; we will use the term non-domestic arbitral award for the sake of precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">As a nondomestic arbitral award is made in the United States, a federal district court sits in <em>primary </em>jurisdiction over a nondomestic arbitral award. <em>See Karaha Bodas 2d Cir., </em>500 F.3d at 115 n.1. The process by which a nondomestic arbi-tral award is reduced to a judgment of the court by a federal court under its <em>primary </em>jurisdiction is called \u201cconfirmation.\u201d Restatement (Third) of the U.S. Law of Int\u2019l Commercial Arbitration \u00a7 l-l(g) (Am. Law Inst., Tentative Draft No. 2, 2012). Under its primary jurisdiction in a confirmation proceeding, the district court is, as this court has recognized, \u201cfree to set aside or modify an award in accordance with its domestic arbitral law and its full panoply of express and implied grounds for relief.\u201d <em>Yusuf Ahmed Alghanim &amp; Sons, </em>126 F.3d at 23 (citing N.Y. Convention, art. V(l)(e)); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cThe confirmation of an arbitration award is a summary proceeding that merely makes what is already a final arbitration award a judgment of the court.\u201d (internal quotation marks, brack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ets, and citation omitted)). Once a non-domestic arbitral award has been confirmed, it becomes a court judgment and is enforceable and entitled to full faith and credit in any other court in the United States. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, art IV, \u00a7 1; <em>see also Hatzlachh Supply, Inc. v. Moishe\u2019s Elecs. Inc., </em>848 F.Supp. 25, 28 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (noting domestic arbitral award must be confirmed before it is enforceable).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Accordingly, the district court erred in holding that appellants were required to confirm their foreign arbitral award before they would be allowed to enforce it. The New York Convention and Chapter 2 of the FAA require only that the award-creditor of a foreign arbitral award file one action in a federal district court to enforce the foreign arbitral award against the award-debtor. <em>See Yusuf Ahmed Alghanim &amp; Sons, </em>126 F.3d at 22. <em>Orion Shipping &amp; Trading Co., </em>a pre-New York Convention decision under Chapter 1 of the FAA and involving what would today be considered a nondomestic arbitral award, does not mandate a different result. 312 F.2d at 300-01. Chapter 1 of the FAA, which generally covers domestic arbitral awards that do not fall under the New York Convention, applies to \u201cactions and proceedings brought under\u201d Chapter 2 only \u201cto the extent that [Chapter 1] is not in conflict with [Chapter 2] or the [New York] Convention as ratified by the United States.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 208. To the extent, then, that a confirmation proceeding is required for nondomestic arbitral awards, such a procedure would be in conflict with the single step procedure mandated by Chapter 2 and the New York Convention for foreign arbitral awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">None of the other cases the district court cites are to the contrary. Like <em>Orion Shipping &amp; Trading Co., Productos Mercantiles E Industriales, S.A v. Faberge USA, Inc., </em>23 F.3d 41 (2d Cir. 1994), <em>Overseas Private Investment Corp. v. Marine Shipping Corp., </em>No. 02 Civ. 475, 2002 WL 31106349 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 19, 2002), and <em>Sea Eagle Maritime, Ltd. v. Hanan Int\u2019l Inc., </em>No. 84 Civ. 3210, 1985 WL 3828 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 1985), all involve nondomestic arbitral awards over which the federal district court sits in primary jurisdiction rather than secondary jurisdiction. <em>See Productos, </em>23 F.3d at 43 (arbitration occurred in New York); <em>Overseas Private Inv., </em>2002 WL 31106349, at *1 (parties agreed to arbitration in Washington, D.C. under the rules of the American Arbitration Association); <em>Sea Eagle, </em>1985 WL 3828, at *1 (noting parties \u201cagreed to arbitration in New York\u201d). On the other hand, one of the cases cited by the district <em>court </em>\u2014 Arbitra<em>tion between Monegasque De Reassurances S.A.M. v. Nak Naftogaz of Ukraine, </em>311 F.3d 488, 491 (2d Cir. 2002) (hereinafter <em>\u201cMonde Re\u201d) </em>\u2014 did involve a foreign arbitral award. There, however, although the award-creditor had sought confirmation of the foreign award, this circuit never held that such confirmation was a necessary precondition to enforcement of a foreign arbitral award because the circuit never reached the substantive contentions of the parties, instead dismissing the action on an alternative ground. <em>Id. </em>at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The confusion regarding whether parties need to confirm a foreign arbitral award is understandable because Section 207 uses the term \u201cconfirm\u201d to describe the process by which a district court acts under its secondary jurisdiction to recognize and enforce a foreign arbitral award. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 207; <em>see, e.g., VRG Linhas, </em>717 F.3d at 325 (employing the term \u201cconfirm\u201d as it is used in 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 to describe the process by which the district court sat in secondary jurisdiction over a foreign arbi-tra] award). The Restatement (Third) of the U.S. Law of International Commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Arbitration indicates that the proper term for the single-step process in which a federal district court engages when it sits in secondary jurisdiction over a foreign arbi-tral award is \u201cEnforcement,\u201d in contrast to the process in which a federal district court engages when it sits in primary jurisdiction over a nondomestic arbitral award, which is called \u201cConfirmation.\u201d Restatement (Third) of the U.S. Law of Int\u2019l Commercial Arbitration \u00a7 l-l(g), (J) (Am. Law Inst., Tentative Draft No. 2, 2012). In order to avoid such confusion in the future, we encourage litigants and district courts alike to take care to specify explicitly the type of arbitral award the district court is evaluating (domestic, nondomestic, or foreign), whether the district court is sitting in primary or secondary jurisdiction, and, accordingly, whether the action seeks confirmation of a domestic or nondomestic arbitral award under the district court\u2019s primary jurisdiction or enforcement of a foreign arbitral award under its secondary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">c. Applicable Law for an Enforcement Action</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Here, appellants properly sought to have the district court enforce a foreign arbitral award under its secondary jurisdiction. On remand, therefore, we instruct the district court to evaluate appellants\u2019 Enforcement Action, particularly appellants\u2019 effort to reach appellees as alter-egos of SBT, under the standards set out in the New York Convention, Chapter 2 of the FAA, and applicable law in the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The New York Convention provides that a signatory State \u201cshall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon, under the conditions laid down in the following articles.\u201d N.Y. Convention, art. III. The New York Convention clarifies that this means that \u201c[tjhere shall not be imposed substantially more onerous conditions or higher fees or charges on the recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards to which this Convention applies than are imposed on the recognition or enforcement of domestic arbitral awards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the question of whether a third party not named in an arbitral award may have that award enforced against it under a theory of alter-ego liability, or any other legal principle concerning the enforcement of awards or judgments, is one left to the law of the enforcing jurisdiction, here the Southern District of New York, under the terms of Article III of the New York Convention. <em>See </em>Brief of Amicus Curiae Association of the Bar of the City of New York at 2-3, 6; <em>cf. Orion Shipping &amp; Trading Co., </em>312 F.2d at 301 (explaining Orion could bring an action to enforce its nondomestic arbitral award against a non-party to the award and invoke the alter-ego theory of liability to reach the non-party in that enforcement action); <em>Leeward Constr. Co. v. Am. Univ. of Antigua-Coll. of Med., </em>No. 12 Civ. 6280, 2013 WL 1245549, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2013) (dismissing action to confirm against a non-party to arbitral award \u201cwithout prejudice to [award-creditor\u2019s] filing a separate [enforcement] action against [non-party] to enforce the judgment ... under an alter[-]ego or other theory.\u201d (emphasis omitted) (citing <em>Orion Shipping &amp; Trading Co., </em>312 F.2d at 301)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The New York Convention additionally provides that \u201cRecognition and enforcement of [a foreign arbitral] award may be refused ... only if [the requesting] party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought, proof that\u201d one of five enumerated conditions has been met. N.Y. Convention, art. V(l). Here, the \u201ccompetent authority\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>is the federal district court to which the award-creditor has applied for enforcement. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 203. The five conditions laid out under the New York Convention are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\"><em>(\u0430) </em>The parties to the [arbitration] agreement referred to in article II [of the New York Convention] were, under the law applicable to them, under some incapacity, or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">(\u0431) The party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">(c) The award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\"><em>(d) </em>The composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\"><em>(e) </em>The award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">N.Y. Convention, art. V(l) (italics in original). The burden of proving any one of these five conditions rests with the party challenging the arbitral award, here appel-lees. <em>Id. </em>Appellees have not, to date, explicitly invoked any of these five conditions under which a district court may refuse enforcement of a foreign arbitral award, although they may do so on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">The New York Convention further states that the federal district court, as the \u201ccompetent authority[,]\u201d may refuse to enforce the foreign arbitral award if the court determines that <em>\u201c(a) </em>[t]he subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of [the United States]; or (6) [t]he recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of [the United States].\u201d N.Y. Convention, art. V(2) (italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">Thus, it appears that the sole issue at present for the district court to consider on remand pertains to the liability of ap-pellees for satisfaction of appellants\u2019 foreign arbitral award as alter-egos of the award-debtor under the applicable law in the Southern District of New York. We leave further legal and factual development of this issue, and any other barriers to enforcement that. appellees may argue on' remand, to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">II. The District Court Erred in Dismissing Appellants\u2019 Fraud Claims Under the Doctrine of Issue Preclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">a. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">\u201cOn appeal from a dismissal under [Federal] Rule [of Civil Procedure] 12(b)(1), we review the [district] court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Cortlandt St. Recov</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>ery Corp. v. Hellas Telecomms. S.\u00e0.r.L., </em>790 F.3d 411, 417 (2d Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). This Court must \u201caccept as true all material allegations [in] the complaint\u201d and \u201cconstrue the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The complaining party \u201cbears the burden of alleging facts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest that it has standing to sue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">We also review <em>\u201cde novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint pursuant to [Federal] Rule [of Civil Procedure] 12(b)(6), accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Cuomo, </em>796 F.3d 252, 256 (2d Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). \u201cTo survive a 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint must contain factual allegations that plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">b. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The district court dismissed appellants\u2019 five causes of action for fraud on the basis that these claims sought \u201ca remedy previously sought by [appellants] in the ICC Arbitration ... [and] are therefore barred.\u201d Initial Order, 14 F.Supp.3d at 480 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">We understand the district court\u2019s finding to be one of as issue preclusion, <em>ie., </em>that appellants, having already had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate their fraud claims and having received an unfavorable^ determination from the ICC Paris, are not permitted to relitigate the issue in the federal district court in an attempt to achieve a more favorable outcome. <em>See Kulak v. City of New York, </em>88 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\u201cIt is settled law that the doctrine of issue preclusion is applicable to issues resolved by an earlier arbitration.\u201d <em>Khandhar v. Elfenbein, </em>943 F.2d 244, 247 (2d Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted). The mere fact, however, that an issue appears to have been resolved by an earlier arbitration does not necessarily mean that issue preclusion applies. \u201cAn arbitration decision may effect [issue preclusion] in a later litigation ... [only] if the proponent can show with clarity and certainty that the same issues were resolved.\u201d <em>Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc. v. 1109580 Ontario, Inc., </em>409 F.3d 87, 91 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">[Issue Preclusion] is permissible as to a given issue if[:] (1) the identical issue was raised in a previous proceeding; (2) the issue was actually litigated and decided in the previous proceeding; (3) the party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue; [ ] (4) the resolution of the issue was necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits[;] ... [and (5) ] application of the doctrine is fair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-12\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks .and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">The Second Circuit, applying New York law, has further instructed district courts to consider the following factors in determining whether a party has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in a prior action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avd\">the size of the claim, the forum of the prior litigation, the use of initiative, the extent of the litigation, the competence and experience of counsel, the availability of new evidence, indications of a compromise verdict, differences in the applicable law[,] and foreseeability of future litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>King v. Fox, </em>418 F.3d 121, 130 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Because issue preclusion is an equitable doctrine, the Second Circuit and federal courts adhere to the maxim that '\u201c[h]e who comes into equity must come with clean hands.\u201d <em>Keystone Driller Co. v. Gen. Excavator Co., </em>290 U.S. 240, 241, 54 S.Ct. 146, 78 L.Ed. 293 (1933). This principle, known as the \u201cdoctrine of unclean hands,\u201d is \u201cthat the equitable powers of this court can never be exerted [o]n behalf of one who has acted fraudulently, or who by deceit or any unfair means has gained an advantage. To aid a party in such a case would make this court the abettor of iniquity.\u201d <em>PenneCom B.V. v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc., </em>372 F.3d 488, 493 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Here, appellants argue that they were denied a full and fair opportunity to litigate the merits of their fraud claims due to appellees\u2019 fraud and misconduct before the ICC Paris. Specifically, appellants claim that appellees misled the ICC Paris as to the extent of the fraud committed by appellees, thereby leading the ICC Paris to issue an unfavorable decision on the issue which appellees now seek to enforce for purposes of issue preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Appellants\u2019 allegations against appellees .are very similar to those made in <em>Penne-Com, </em>372 F.3d at 491-93. There, Penne-Com alleged that Merrill Lynch \u201cdevised a fraudulent scheme to dupe the arbitrators\u201d which led to a decision unfavorable to Pen-neCom regarding the \u201cextent of loss incurred by PenneCom\u201d under the arbitrated contract. <em>Id. </em>at 493. The district court determined that collateral estoppel barred PenneCom from relitigating the extent of its loss under the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 491. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that \u201cbefore the court invokes [issue preclusion,] ... PenneCom must be allowed discovery to collect evidence which might support a finding either that PenneCom was not afforded a full and fair opportunity to prove its loss in the arbitration, or that Merrill Lynch should be precluded by its own (alleged) misconduct from asserting the equitable doctrine of [issue preclusion].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">We find the same outcome is warranted here. Given appellants\u2019 assertions of fraud on the part of appellees, assertions we must accept as true at the motion to dismiss stage, <em>see Crawford, </em>796 F.3d at 256, we find the district court\u2019s application of the equitable doctrine of issue preclusion was inappropriate. On remand, appellants should be allowed to conduct discovery with respect to the fraud claims. Appellees may be given the opportunity to re-raise the issue preclusion issue after discovery at the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">III. The Court Declines to Affirm the Rulings of the District Court on the Alternative Grounds of Forum Non Conveniens and International Comity</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">In addition to challenging appellants\u2019 affirmative arguments on appeal, appellees also urge this court to affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 Enforcement Action on the alternative grounds of forum non conveniens and international comity.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">\u201cIt is well settled that we may affirm [a district court\u2019s decision] on any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law, including grounds not relied upon by the district court.\u201d <em>In re Arab Bank, PLC Alien Tort Statute Litig., </em>808 F.3d 144, 157-58 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We, however, have \u201cdiscretion to choose not to do so based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>prudential factors and concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158 (citing <em>Bacolitsas v. 86th &amp; 3rd Owner, LLC, </em>702 F.3d 673, 681 (2d Cir. 2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">We decline to affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on the alternative grounds of forum non conveniens and international comity here. We leave these issues for consideration by the district court in the first instance should appellees choose to raise them again.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">We have considered all of appellees\u2019 contentions in support of the judgment dismissing the Enforcement Action and have found them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court erred in dismissing appellants\u2019 Enforcement Action because: (1) appellants are not required to bring an action to confirm their foreign arbitral award before they can seek to enforce it, and (2) appellants\u2019 fraud claims are not barred by collateral estoppel given appellants\u2019 allegations that appellees engaged in fraud and misconduct before the ICC Paris. We also hold that the appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 Confirmation Action is moot given that confirmation of a foreign arbitral award prior to enforcement is unnecessary under the New York Convention .and Chapter 2 of the FAA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lastly, we decline to affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 Enforcement Action on the alternative bases of forum non conveniens or international comity. Accordingly, in No. 15-1133, we VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the Enforcement Action and REMAND for further, proceedings consistent with this opinion. In No. 15-1146, we hold that the appeal of the judgment dismissing the Confirmation Action is moot and accordingly DISMISS that appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">.
