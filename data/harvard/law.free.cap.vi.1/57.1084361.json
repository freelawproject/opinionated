Said Code was enacted by the Colonial Council of St. Croix, by virtue of section 2 of the Act of Congress of March 3, 1917 (ch. 171, 39 Stat. 1132; 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392; prec. 1 V.I.C.), which Act is in substance, though not in form, the local Constitution of the Virgin Islands of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\">(3) Title V, chapter 1, section 9, of said Code (192\u00cd; 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 3501 note) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">\u201cIn a criminal action the defendant is entitled:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201c(1).

It appears from the transcript of the Police Court of Christiansted that \u201cFrank Gibbons, the man concerning whom a statement had just been made in court, to the effect that he was living with ...\u201d (a woman therein named) . . . \u201cin open concubinage and prostitution . . . was called forward by the court and asked if it was true,\u201d etc. Upon Gibbons\u2019 admission of. the charge the Police Judge sentenced him to imprisonment for thirty days at hard labor. This action of the Police Court was in plain violation of the provision of the Code that \u201cNo person can be compelled in a criminal action, to be a witness against himself;\u201d (Code [1921] Tit. V, c. 1, s. 8 [5' V.I.C. \u00a7 3501 note]), as well as of \u201cthe common law of England as adopted and understood in the United States,\u201d to say nothing of the other Code provisions-already quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The judgment being void, Gibbons brought habeas corpus proceedings, which is a proper remedy.
