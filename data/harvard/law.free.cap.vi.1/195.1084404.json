That case is practically decisive of this one, as the same testimony, as well as law, was involved in both. See the proceedings against Vincent Garcia, Frederiksted Sub-Judicial District, January Term, 1929 (1 V.I. 196).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">As the matter appears on the face of this record, therefore, only a question of veracity is involved' and, as that question has been resolved against Garcia, it therefore follows that the rule against Felix R. Geralde must be, and is hereby, discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
