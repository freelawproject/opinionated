The home requires an entry fee of $2000 and, thereafter, residents are charged a monthly fee for room, board, and medical expenses. The plaintiffs each paid, or had paid by a relative on her behalf, the $2000 entry fee. They all qualified for and received medical assistance under the title XIX \u201cMedicaid\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.) and the medicaid payments were used to meet their monthly medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In 1975 and early 1976, medicaid payments to the plaintiffs were suspended by the commissioner of social services. The basis for the suspension was that the $2000 entry fee represented an asset transferred by the plaintiffs without reasonable consideration, and that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-109 (e),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiffs were not entitled to medicaid benefits until this asset was exhausted, after having been applied toward the cost of care at the appropriate rate. The plaintiffs all appealed the suspension of benefits and requested fair hearings. At each of the hearings, the fair hearing officer upheld the suspension. In support of this conclusion, the memorandum of each of the hearing officers referred to General Statutes \u00a7 17-109 (e), and, in addition, alluded to the existence of a life care contract to which General Statutes \u00a7 17-116 would be applicable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The plaintiffs then appealed the decisions of the fair hearing officers to the Court of Common Pleas. While the appeals were pending before that court, the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut released its decision in <em>Buckner </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>424 F. Sup. 366 (D. Conn. 1976), holding that the \u201ctransfer-of-assets\u201d rule in \u00a7 17-109 (e) of the General Statutes violates the supremacy clause by presuming that assets are available to welfare recipients which are in fact not available. On the basis of the <em>Buckner </em>case and of <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>White, </em>168 Conn. 336, 362 A.2d 505 (1975), the Court of Common Pleas found that the commissioner had acted illegally in suspending medicaid payments to the plaintiffs and ordered that the plaintiffs be awarded medical assistance and that the Elim Park Baptist Home be reimbursed for any medical services advanced since the suspension which would otherwise have been paid for by the state under the medicaid program. It is from the judgments rendered in those six cases that the defendant has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Subsequent to the filing of this appeal, the United States Supreme Court summarily affirmed the District Court decision in <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Buckner, </em>434 U.S. 898, 98 S. Ct. 290, 54 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1977). The defendant has consequently withdrawn the claim that the reviewing court erred in holding that because Connecticut\u2019s transfer of assets rule is inconsistent with applicable federal law, it violates the supremacy clause. The remaining claims pressed by the defendant on appeal are essentially that: (1) the plaintiff in each of the cases has a valid life care contract with the Elim Park Baptist Home and is therefore ineligible for medicaid; and (2) these life care contracts are available assets to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">It is clear that under applicable federal law only assets <em>actually available </em>to a medicaid applicant may be considered in determining eligibility. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B); 42 Fed. Reg. No. 9 at 2687-88 (Jan. 13, 1977) (revising 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 248.21); <em>Buckner </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra, 373 n.12; <em>Wilczynski </em>v. <em>Harder, </em>323 F. Sup. 509 (D. Conn. 1971); <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 345. In its memorandum of decisions, the Court of Common Pleas acknowledged the reliance of the fair hearing officers on the life care contract statute (General Statutes \u00a7 17-116) as well as on the transfer of assets rule (\u00a717-109 [e]) as their grounds for sustaining the action of the commissioner. The court emphasized, however, that \u201ceven if it [the life care contract provision] did apply to the arrangement at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Elim Park Baptist Home \u2014 and the court is not so convinced \u2014 it would still fall before the primacy clause.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">At the outset, it should be noted that the fair hearing officers should not have included the reference to the life care contract statute in their findings. The suspension of benefits by the commissioner was grounded on \u00a717-109 (e), the transfer of assets rule, and no evidence was presented at the fair hearings that the plaintiffs had life care contracts within the meaning of \u00a7 17-116. The fair hearing officers should have confined themselves to the question of whether the commissioner\u2019s action was valid under \u00a7 17-109 (e). See <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 340n. Consequently, we do not decide whether the plaintiffs actually possess life care contracts with the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Even if the finding of a life care contract had been properly made, however, it would not withstand attack under <em>Buckner. </em>Regardless of the existence of a \u201clife care contract,\u201d applicants are entitled to assistance under federal law unless the contract is an asset <em>actually available </em>to them. The home in which the plaintiffs reside imposes a monthly charge for medical expenses; the $2000 entry fee cannot be applied by the residents to meet these payments. The funds simply are not actually available to the plaintiffs. Where there is no actual fraud on the part of the medicaid applicants or of the home in which they reside; see General Statutes \u00a7 17-83\u00cd; the commissioner cannot deny benefits on the basis of an irrebutable presumption that anyone who possesses what is allegedly a life care contract has funds which are actually available to meet medical expenses. See <em>Salemma </em>v. <em>White, </em>175 Conn. 35, 39-41, 392 A.2d 969 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>It is thus clear that controlling federal law precludes the commissioner from denying or suspending medicaid benefits merely on the basis of the existence of a life care contract. To the extent that \u00a7 17-116 of the General Statutes deprives a person holding a life care contract of medical assistance on any ground other than the actual availability of assets, it must fall before the supremacy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 17-109. eligibility.

Awards shall be granted to persons eligible hereunder in an amount not exceeding the rate set by the commissioner for care in comparable facilities, less the per eapita share of such income of the home or institution, provided the resources of each applicant or beneficiary shall also be taken into consideration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\"> The defendant\u2019s statement of issues also raises the claim that the court lacked jurisdiction to order reimbursement to the home for medical services advanced to the plaintiffs following the suspension of medicaid payments by the commissioner. Because this claim has not been briefed by either the defendant or the plaintiffs, we treat it as abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
