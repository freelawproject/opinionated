Attiek, individually. Those two defendants, hereinafter referred to as the defendants,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> pleaded a special defense claiming that the plaintiff, Sawyer Savings Bank, was barred from maintaining any action or suit in Connecticut because it violated the provisions of \u00a7 36-5a of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">On the basis of the evidence presented at the hearing on the issues raised by the defendants\u2019 special defense, the trial court\u2019s finding discloses the following material facts: The plaintiff is a savings bank chartered under the laws of the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>of New York and has its principal office in Saugerties, New York. The defendant American Trading Co., Inc., is a Connecticut corporation having its principal office in Danbury. The defendants initially approached the plaintiff through the efforts of an independent mortgage broker. There were no meetings between the plaintiff and the defendants in Connecticut specifically concerned with the mortgage loans in question. On October 1, 1974, the mortgage deeds and notes were executed and delivered in New York, and the necessary funds were transferred to the defendants in White Plains, New York. At the time the notes and mortgages were executed and the funds transferred, the bank understood that the defendants, either individually or in a corporate capacity, owned the property mortgaged by the defendants. The loan was made in New York and was secured by land in Connecticut. Representatives of the plaintiff visited the mortgaged premises in Danbury prior to making the loans. No Connecticut bank participated in the mortgage loans, and the plaintiff had made no other mortgage loans in Connecticut. On the basis of the foregoing evidence, the trial court <em>(Testo, </em>J.) found the issues for the plaintiff on the special defense raised by the defendants, and concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the two mortgages on Connecticut real estate securing the loans made in New York did not violate the provisions of \u00a7 36-5a, and ordered the foreclosures to proceed. The defendants have appealed from the subsequent judgment of foreclosure rendered by the court <em>(Hull, J.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The sole issue presented in this appeal is whether the plaintiff\u2019s activities constituted \u201ctransacting business in this state\u201d within the prohibition of General Statutes \u00a7 36-5a, so as to bar foreclosure under the provisions of \u00a7 33-412 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the trial court that there was no violation of \u00a7 36-5a.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Section 36-5a generally prohibits a foreign bank such as the plaintiff from transacting in Connecticut the business which it is authorized to conduct under its certificate of incorporation or by the laws of the state under which it was organized,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> unless it is empowered to do so by the laws of this state. The statute contains two specific exceptions to the proscription against the transacting of business in this state by foreign banks. A foreign bank may (1) contract with a Connecticut bank to acquire a part or entire interest in a loan made by a Connecticut bank, or (2) may participate with a Connecticut bank in making a loan. Neither exception applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The statute also contains a general exception, expressed in the phrase \u201cwithout excluding other activities which may not constitute transacting business in this state.\u201d The defendants contend that because the legislature expressly provided two exceptions to the prohibition of \u00a7 36-5a, both of which require involvement by a domestic bank in the loan transaction, the legislature necessarily intended to limit the reach of the general exception to other activities by foreign banks that also involve Connecticut banks in some way. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u201cLegislative intent is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 57, 392 A.2d 491. Generally a statutory term should be given the meaning it has in common usage. Ibid. Nothing in the language of General Statutes \u00a7 36-5a suggests that the legislature intended to limit \u201cother activities which may not constitute transacting business in this state\u201d to other activities involving Connecticut banks. The more logical and reasonable interpretation is that the legislature chose to exempt the potentially extensive foreign bank activities described in the two exceptions because of the participation of Connecticut banks, and left to the courts the determination of other foreign bank activities of such a minimal nature as not to constitute \u201ctransacting business in this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">This interpretation is supported by the history of the relevant legislation as judicially construed, of which the legislature must be presumed to be mindful. <em>Knights of Columbus Council </em>v. <em>Mulcahy, </em>154 Conn. 583, 589-90, 227 A.2d 413; <em>Buxton </em>v. <em>Ullman, </em>147 Conn. 48, 56, 156 A.2d 508, appeal dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>missed, 367 U.S. 497, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989. Prior to 1961 the privileges of foreign banks were generally governed by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 33-395 to 33-412, the foreign corporation statutes, where the phrase \u201ctransacting business\u201d appears many times. Section 33-397 (c) then provided: \u201cWithout excluding other activities which may not constitute transacting business in this state, nothing in this section shall prohibit a foreign banking corporation from doing any or all of the acts hereinafter set forth.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 33-397 (c) was repealed in 1961; Public Acts 1961, No. 423, \u00a73; and \u00a7 36-5a was enacted in the same legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We conclude that in amending the statutory exemptions from the prohibition against the transaction of business in Connecticut by foreign banking corporations, the legislature did not intend to change the nature of the test applicable to business activities not specifically exempted by statute. We have ruled that the question of whether a foreign corporation is transacting business so as to require a certificate of authority must be determined on the complete factual picture presented in each case, and that the corporation's activities must be more substantial than those which would suffice to subject it to service of process. <em>Eljam Mason Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Donnelly Brick Co., </em>152 Conn. 483, 485, 208 A.2d 544; see also <em>Alfred M. Best Co. </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>124 Conn. 597, 1 A.2d 140. Relevant considerations in those eases were the situs of the contract, the presence of corporate offices and agents in Connecticut, and the extent of business activities in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In this case, the record discloses that the negotiations for the loans, the preparation of the mortgage instruments, the signing of the mortgage deeds and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>notes, the payment to the defendants of the sums loaned, and the subsequent payments of principal installments and interest took place in New York State. While the mortgage deeds securing the loans were recorded in Connecticut, the final act which had to be done in order to make the agreement between the parties effective, namely, the payment of the monies loaned, was in New York. Clearly, the situs of the contract entered into by the parties was in New York. The plaintiff had made no other mortgage loans in Connecticut. It maintained no office or place of business in the state nor did it have officers or an agent present here for the solicitation of business. We conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that the plaintiff was not transacting business in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 36-5a.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"> The trial court considered the matter as if only one mortgage were involved, since the facts and the legal principles were identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-10\"> The defendant Bank of Trumbull took no part in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-11\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 36-5a. foreign corporations not to do business in this state, excepted activities.
