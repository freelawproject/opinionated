At the request of both parties, we granted a motion to expedite the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The essential facts of the case are undisputed: Pursuant to a warrant, issued on the basis of information obtained from two authorized wiretaps, the defendant was arrested and charged with several crimes pertaining to alleged gambling activities. Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence derived from the wiretaps on the ground that the communications were unlawfully intercepted in violation of chapter 959a of the General Statutes, entitled \u201cWiretapping and Electronic Surveillance.\u201d The court granted the motion, finding that the two applications for wiretap orders were acknowledged by the appropriate state\u2019s attorneys, but were not submitted under the state\u2019s attorneys\u2019 oaths as required by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41b and 54-41c. The court concluded that suppression of the evidence was required by General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m and Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7 2234 and subsequently, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The state\u2019s writ of error raises two issues: (1) do General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41b and 54-41c require that an application for a wiretap order be submitted under the oath of the appropriate state\u2019s attorney and (2) if so, does General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m compel suppression of communications derived from wiretap orders issued on the basis of applications merely acknowledged by the appropriate state\u2019s attorney?</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">A resolution of those issues requires interpretation of the relevant provisions of chapter 959a, which governs the issuance of orders authorizing wiretaps. General Statutes \u00a7 54-41b provides that \u201c[tjhe state\u2019s attorney for the county in which the interception is to be conducted may make application to a panel of judges for an order authorizing the interception of any wire communication by investigative or law enforcement officers . . . .\u201d Under this statute, it is only the state\u2019s attorney for a particular county who is authorized to submit an application for a wiretap order. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin, </em>171 Conn. 524, 543, 370 A.2d 1038. The following provision, General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c, begins: \u201cEach application for an order authorizing the interception of a wire communication <em>shall be made in writing upon oath or affirmation </em>to a panel of judges.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although this sentence does not explicitly state that the required \u201coath or affirmation\u201d is to be that of the applicant state\u2019s attorney, its association with the previous provision implies this. Such a reading is confirmed by subsection 12 of General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c which specifies that \u201c[a]negations of fact in the application may be based either upon the personal knowledge of the <em>applicant </em>or upon information and belief.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The remainder of this subsection details how the evidence relied upon for a determination of probable cause is to be conveyed and supported, concluding: \u201cAffidavits of persons other than the applicant may be submitted in conjunction with the application if they tend to support any fact or conclusion alleged therein. Such accompanying affidavits may be based either on per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>sonal knowledge of the affiant, or information and belief with the source thereof and reason therefor specified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In construing a statute, this court seeks to ascertain the intent of the legislature as it is expressed through the words actually used. <em>Schwab </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 479, 482, 226 A.2d 506. Generally, \u201c \u2018no part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant and unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase ....\u2019\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 58, 392 A.2d 491. Insofar as it is possible, the entire enactment is to be harmonized, each part made operative. <em>Sillman </em>v. <em>Sillman, </em>168 Conn. 144, 148, 358 A.2d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">When read together, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41b and 54-41c clearly reveal that the \u201coath or affirmation\u201d required is that of the applicant, who can only be the state\u2019s attorney for the county in which the interception is to occur. Contrary to the state\u2019s contention that a sworn affidavit submitted by the investigating officer meets the requirement, General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c (12) explicitly provides for the use of affidavits \u201cof persons other than the applicant\u201d only \u201cif they tend to support any fact or conclusion alleged [in the application].\u201d While these supplementary affidavits are not per se required to satisfy the statute, the statute compels the \u201coath or affirmation\u201d of the applicant for every application.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The state argues that General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c \u201cmirrors\u201d its federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518, and that the latter statute\u2019s \u201coath or affirmation\u201d requirement is satisfied by the sworn affidavit of an investigating officer. The state\u2019s claim fails to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>into consideration important differences in the language of the two statutes. Under the federal scheme, the attorney general or a designated assistant attorney general is empowered to <em>authorize </em>a wiretap application. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516. The application is, in fact, made by the \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d and \u201cauthorized\u201d by one of the so-empowered officials. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518 (1) (a). The Connecticut scheme, on the other hand, envisions an application submitted by the appropriate state\u2019s attorney on behalf of \u201cthe investigative or law enforcement officers or agency for whom the authority to intercept a wire communication is sought.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c (2). Consequently, federal authority cannot be relied upon as guidance on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">It is the further claim of the state that General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c was intended to delineate a procedure for the issuance of wiretap orders which meets the requirements of the fourth amendment of the United States constitution. It is true that the comparable federal statute was enacted in response to <em>Berger </em>v. <em>New York, </em>388 U.S. 41, 87 S. Ct. 1873, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1040. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin, </em>supra, 538. In <em>Berger, </em>the United States Supreme Court determined that the New York eavesdropping statute violated the fourth amendment in that it was too broad, not requiring, among other deficiencies, sufficiently specific information as a basis for a finding of probable cause. Reiterating established principles, the court noted (p. 55) that \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment commands that a warrant issue . . . only upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation\u201d and that such \u201cexists where the facts and circumstances within the affiant\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has reasonably trustworthy infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>mation, are sufficient unto themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">There is no doubt that the term \u201coath or affirmation\u201d stems from the fourth amendment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that ordinarily this requirement is satisfied by the submission to a judge or magistrate of affidavits signed by police officers. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>168 Conn. 623, 362 A.2d <em>813; State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>167 Conn. 539, 356 A.2d 125; <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>153 Conn. 127, 214 A.2d 900. A particular statutory scheme limiting the issuance of warrants, however, may offer greater protection than that minimally required by the fourth amendment. The New York statute scrutinized in <em>Berger, </em>supra, specifically provided for the issuance of an eavesdropping order only upon \u201coath or affirmation of a district attorney . . . that there is reasonable ground to believe that evidence of crime may be thus obtained.\u201d Id., 54. The New York \u201ceavesdropping\u201d statute enacted after <em>Berger', </em>N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law art. 700; appears to maintain this approach, requiring that an application be made in writing and \u201cbe subscribed and sworn to by an applicant\u201d; N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 700.20; \u201capplicant\u201d being defined as a district attorney or the attorney general. N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 700.05.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The state argues, however, that a requirement that the application be submitted under the \u201coath or affirmation\u201d of a state\u2019s attorney does not offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>greater protection than the traditional supportive affidavits of investigating officers, and, indeed, may not suffice to meet fourth amendment requirements since more often than not state\u2019s attorneys are without \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of the relevant facts. General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c (12) explicitly states that \u201c[a]negations of fact in the application may be based <em>either upon the personal knowledge of the applicant or upon information and </em>belief.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In other words, the state\u2019s atorney is to swear to the truth of the facts alleged in the application to the extent that he has personal knowledge, information or belief. The statute goes on to state how the facts known or believed are to be supported in the application in order that the panel of judges to whom the application is submitted may make an independent determination of probable cause, as is required by the fourth amendment. The statute cannot circumvent this essential constitutional requirement and the oath of the state\u2019s attorney alone does not establish probable cause. Rather, it serves to ensure, as far as possible, that the applicant state\u2019s attorney has made an intermediate determination, on the existing facts, that issuance of a wiretap order is warranted both constitutionally and statutorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The state asserts that responsibility is sufficiently focused on the state\u2019s attorney by virtue of his acknowledgement on the application form. Such an assertion misconstrues the vital distinction between an oath and an acknowledgement. While General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-22 to 1-25 govern the form and procedure involved in the use of oaths, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-28 to 1-41 concern only acknowledgements. As a general rule, an acknowledgement constitutes a formal statement of the person executing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>an instrument that he or she executed the instrument as a free deed and act. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>214 N.C. 240, 199 S.E. 12; 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Acknowledgements, \u00a7 1; see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-34. An oath, on the other hand, signifies the undertaking of an obligation \u201cto speak the truth at a time when . . . testimony may deeply affect the rights and the character of individuals.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Gillet, </em>2 Conn. 40, 44. Consequently, the protection afforded by an application sworn to by the applicant state\u2019s attorney does provide greater protection than an application merely acknowledged, for the oath imposes upon the applicant greater responsibility. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41b and 54-41e mandate that this responsibility be undertaken with every application.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The question then arises as to whether the communications derived from wiretap orders issued on the basis of applications merely acknowledged by the appropriate state\u2019s attorneys must be suppressed. General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m provides that \u201cthe contents of any intercepted wire communication, or evidence derived therefrom,\u201d may be suppressed \u201con the grounds that the communication was unlawfully intercepted under the provisions of this chapter; the order of authorization or approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or the interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval.\u201d The ground for suppression advocated by the defendant and asserted by the trial judge in this case is that the communications were \u201cunlawfully intercepted under the provisions of this chapter\u201d since the applications were not submitted under the oath of a state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Interpreting the comparable federal ground for suppression, provided for in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518 (10) (a), a provision identical in its essence to General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m, the United States Supreme Court delineated the standard for suppression in terms of whether the breached statutory requirement \u201cdirectly and substantially implement [s] the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures to those situations clearly calling for the employment of this extraordinary investigative device.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>416 U.S. 505, 527, 94 S. Ct. 1820, 40 L. Ed. 2d 341; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>429 U.S. 413, 435, 97 S. Ct. 658, 50 L. Ed. 2d 652. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>416 U.S. 562, 575, 94 S. Ct. 1849, 40 L. Ed. 2d 380, the companion case to <em>Giordano, </em>the court determined that a failure to abide by a requirement which \u201cdid not affect the fulfillment of any of the reviewing or approval functions required by Congress\u201d did not require suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Because the three grounds for suppression in the federal statute are identical to those set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m, we may look to the federal interpretation for guidance in determining an appropriate state standard. Because the Connecticut scheme is, however, in many respects more stringent than the equivalent federal act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is necessary to look to the state act to determine whether the particular requirement not followed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>intended by the legislature to be a substantive part of a scheme seeking to limit the use of \u201cthis extraordinary investigative device.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>supra, 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">As noted above, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5441b and 5441c authorize only the state\u2019s attorney of the county in which interception is to occur to apply for a wiretap order. The requirement that the application be submitted under the oath of the applicant places upon the state\u2019s attorney a stringent burden fully to review and vouch for the evidence set forth in the application. The ultimate responsibility for a determination of probable cause and a determination of whether a wiretap order is warranted under the statute lies with a panel of judges. But the statute clearly envisions an intermediate level of responsibility for such a determination \u2014 \u25a0 that imposed upon the state\u2019s attorney. The oath, signifying that the underlying evidence is known or believed by the applicant to be true, constitutes a central part of this overall protective scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">In the present ease, the failure of the appropriate state\u2019s attorneys to submit their respective applications under oath goes to the heart of the \u201creviewing or approval functions\u201d established by the legislature. We, therefore, conclude that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the evidence derived from wiretap orders issued on the basis of applications not sworn to by the applicant state\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In this opinion Bogdanski, Longo and Healey, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-8\"> The same term is evident in Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-9\"> In this respect, it is noteworthy that the New York provision delineating the contents of an application is almost identical to \u00a7 54-41c, particularly with respect to the way in which allegations in the application are to be supported. See N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 700.20 (3) and General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c (12).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\"> A review of chapter 959a reveals that the state legislature imposed significant limitations on the use of electronic surveillance not found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72510-2518; section 54-41e prohibits the issuance of an order if the information upon which the order is based is discovered more than fifteen days preceding the date of the application, while \u00a7 2518 imposes no such restriction; section 54-41b limits the use of electronic surveillance to three types of offenses, while \u00a7 2516 is far less restrictive; section 54-41d allows for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>maximum issuance of thirty-four interception orders per year, while \u00a7 2518 contains no equivalent restriction; section 54-41 e requires the termination of interception within ten days of the order\u2019s issuance, while \u00a7 2518 (5) allows for interceptions of thirty days. These and other comparisons reveal a clear intent on the part of the legislature to minimize reliance on electronic surveillance, strictly limiting its use to only those situations statutorily set forth in the fashion prescribed by the act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b47-8\">Sidor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL\">(dissenting). I agree that <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>416 U.S. 505, 94 S. Ct. 1820, 40 L. Ed. 2d 341, holds that the statute was intended to require suppression where there is a failure to satisfy any of those statutory requirements that <em>directly </em>and <em>substantially </em>implement the legislative intention to limit the use of intercept procedures to those situations clearly calling for the employment of this extraordinary investigative device. The United States Supreme Court notes that this is so where the approval was intended to play a <em>central role </em>in the statutory scheme and that suppression must follow when it is shown that this statutory requirement has been ignored. Id., 528, 529. The central role in our statutory scheme is the limited number of intercepts permitted, and the required hearing before a three-judge panel of the Superior Court judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The applications in question cannot be said to <em>ignore </em>the statutory requirement. It is not questioned that the state\u2019s attorney executed the application form. Nor is it questioned that he acknowledged the same. These facts show that there was no intent to ignore the requirement of the statute. The substance was there. The prepared form was incorrect. A state\u2019s attorney is a public officer; as such he takes an oath of office. A public officer\u2019s oath is specific. General Statutes \u00a7 1-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>There is no provision for the form of the oath required in General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c. There are model forms in \u00a7 1-25 of the General Statutes. Section 54-41c is not helpful to one who must administer an oath under its provisions. Those delegated to draft the application form for the state\u2019s attorneys must have found a model in \u00a7 1-34 of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">I see no attempt to deceive; nor do I see prejudice to the rights of an accused. The state has made a good faith effort to comply with the statute. As a matter of practice, a state\u2019s attorney is available at all wiretap application hearings to implement the application in accordance with \u00a7 54-41c (12). Federal judges under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518 have used a similar section to take additional evidence to satisfy themselves that a wire intercept order should issue. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Florea, </em>541 F.2d 568 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 945, 97 S. Ct. 1579, 51 L. Ed. 2d 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Section 54-41c requires, in its subsections 1 through 12, many <em>statements </em>to be included in the application. The application requires <em>\u201callegations of </em>fact\u201d which may be based either upon the personal knowledge of the applicant or upon information and belief. Statements and <em>allegations </em>of fact do not constitute an affidavit. I cannot agree that the requirement of an oath directly and substantially implements the legislative intention to limit the use of intercept procedures. I would require the legislature to be more specific as to the contents of an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">We find the requirement of an oath in many situations. We have not set aside actions for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>take an oath to prevent a failure of public justice. See <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Guilford, </em>136 Conn. 71, 82, 68 A.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">I would reverse the action of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
