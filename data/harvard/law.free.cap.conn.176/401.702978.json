The decision and award of the arbitration panel was released in October. The city then brought an application in Superior Court to vacate the award on the ground that the arbitrators had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>exceeded their powers. The defendant police union and the defendant American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, in turn, moved to confirm the award and also requested an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees plus costs, pursuant to \u00a7 31-72 of the General Statutes. After a hearing, the court denied the motion to vacate and granted the motion to confirm. In addition, the court granted attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the defendants, citing as authority \u00a7 31-72 of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">From that judgment the plaintiff has appealed, alleging that the arbitrators improperly interpreted the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement and that the court erred in granting attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Arbitration is a creature of contract and the parties themselves, by the terms of their submission, define the powers of the arbitrators. Moreover, it is well settled that courts should view with suspicion any attempt to persuade them to entangle themselves in the construction and interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>substantive provisions of collective bargaining agreements. <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 585, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409. Therefore, in deciding whether arbitrators have \u201cexceeded their powers,\u201d as that phrase is used in \u00a752-418 (d), a court need only examine the submission and the award and determine whether the award conforms to the submission. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Education Assn., </em>173 Conn. 287, 291, 377 A.2d 323; <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation </em>v. <em>Southern New England Contracting Co., </em>164 Conn. 472, 477, 325 A.2d 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Where the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that the construction placed upon the facts or the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous. Courts will not review the evidence nor, where the submission is unrestricted, will they review the arbitrators\u2019 decision of the legal questions involved. <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Lakeridge Development Co., </em>173 Conn. 133, 135, 376 A.2d 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The parties in this case agreed upon the following submission: \u201cWhether the City\u2019s transfer of grievants from the Detective Division to the Patrol Division of the Waterbury Police Department was valid under the Collective Bargaining Agreement. If not, what should the remedy be?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The decision and award of the arbitrators was as follows: \u201cIt is the decision of the arbitrators that grievant DeMaria be returned to the Detective Division effective June 20,1975, and that he receive the difference between patrolman\u2019s pay and detec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>five\u2019s pay, retroactive to that date, together with any clothing allowance payments that he would have received as a detective. It is the further decision of the arbitrators that the grievance of James Deeley be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The trial court found, and we agree, that the submission in this case was unrestricted. The trial court therefore properly limited its inquiry to the question of whether the award conformed to the submission and found that it did. Having examined the record before us, we conclude that the trial court did not err in confirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">As previously noted, the trial court, in addition to confirming the award, also ordered that the defendants recover attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $1000, pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 31-72 of the General Statutes. In its assignment of errors, the plaintiff claims that \u00a7 31-72 has no application to statutory proceedings having to do with the confirmation of arbitration awards and that the court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The defendants, in turn, argue that \u00a7 31-72 is applicable to such proceedings in view of \u00a7 52-421,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides that a judgment of a court eonfirm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ing, modifying or correcting an award \u201cshall have the same force and effect in all respects as, and he subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment or decree in a civil action ... in the court in which it is entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Section 52-421 provides that the \u201cjudgment or decree [upon an application for an order confirming, modifying or correcting an award] shall be docketed as if it were rendered in a civil action.\u201d This section then provides that the \u201cjudgment or decree so entered shall have the same force and effect ... as ... a judgment or decree in a civil action; and [that] it may be enforced as if it had been rendered in a civil action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Section 31-72 provides that where an employee or a labor organization institutes an action <em>to enforce </em>an arbitration award, such employee or labor organization may recover, <em>in a civil action, </em>the full amount due, with costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be allowed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The question is thus whether a proceeding to confirm, modify or vacate an arbitration award, brought pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-417, 52-418 or 52-419, is a <em>civil action </em>such that \u00a7 31-72 will be applicable. We note first that applications brought to confirm, modify or vacate arbitration awards are special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>statutory proceedings. <em>Boltuch </em>v. <em>Rainaud, </em>137 Conn. 298, 301, 77 A.2d 94. It has long been established by the courts of this state that certain statutory proceedings are not \u201ccivil actions\u201d within the meaning of title 52 of the General Statutes. In <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>Woodin, </em>90 Conn. 48, 50, 96 A. 178, for example, this court held that controversies in the Probate Court were not civil actions because these controversies did not fit within the definition of civil action as that term has traditionally been defined. In <em>Slattery, </em>the court observed (p. 50): \u201cThe accepted meaning of the term \u2018civil action\u2019 in this State is very well illustrated by the provision of our Practice Act (General Statutes, \u00a7 607) [now \u00a7 52-91] that \u2018there shall be but one form of civil action, and the pleadings therein shall be as follows: The first pleading on the part of the plaintiff shall be known as the complaint.\u2019 \u201d In view of the above, it is significant that proceedings to confirm, modify or vacate arbitration awards are initiated, not by the filing of a complaint, but by the filing of an application or of a rule to show cause. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-417, 52-418 and 52-419.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>Robert E. McMichael, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 646, 363 A.2d 1085, this court rejected a claim that an appeal from an award by a compensation commissioner was a \u201ccivil action.\u201d In that case the court examined the language of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and concluded (p. 653) that the legislature had intended to establish \u201ca speedy, effective and inexpensive method for determining claims\u201d and that this objective would be frustrated by applying to such cases the procedural requirements and delays attendant upon an ordinary civil action. The court in <em>CMeppo </em>held that appeals in workmen\u2019s compensation cases were not ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>civil actions and therefore that the provisions of \u00a7 52-32 governing the transfer of civil actions were not applicable to such proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Section 52-420 of the General Statutes provides that \u201c[a]ny application under section 52-417, 52-418 or 52-419 [to confirm, modify or vacate an arbitration award] shall be heard in the manner provided by law for hearing written motions at a short calendar session, or otherwise as the court or judge may direct, <em>in order to dispose of the case with the least possible delay.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">We conclude that proceedings brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-420 to confirm, modify or vacate arbitration awards are not civil actions within the meaning of title 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">It should be noted at this point that in neither \u00a7 52-421 nor in \u00a7 31-72 is there any language indicating that proceedings to confirm, vacate or correct arbitration awards are to be considered as civil actions. In fact, the language of \u00a7 52-421 leads to quite the opposite conclusion. Section 52-421 provides, in pertinent part, that a decree or judgment confirming, modifying or correcting an award shall be docketed <em>\u201cas if it were rendered in a civil action.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 52-421 also provides expressly that an order confirming, modifying or correcting an award \u201cmay be enforced <em>as if it had been rendered in a civil action.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>When the above portions of \u00a7 52-421 are read in connection with the portion of \u00a7 31-72 which permits an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs \u201cin a civil action\u201d brought \u201cto enforce an arbitration award,\u201d it becomes clear that \u00a7 31-72 applies, not to proceedings to confirm, modify or vacate arbitration awards, but only to civil actions which are later brought to enforce orders which have confirmed, modified or vacated an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The present proceeding as to which the court made an award of attorney\u2019s fees was a proceeding to confirm an award. Such proceedings are not civil actions within the meaning of title 52 and \u00a7 31-72 does not apply to such proceedings. The court therefore erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">There is error in part; the judgment confirming the award is affirmed, except as to the order awarding attorney\u2019s fees which is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 31-72. civil action to collect wage claim oe arbitration award. When any employer fails to pay an employee wages in accordance with the provisions of sections 31-71a to 31-71i, inclusive, or where an employee or a labor organization representing an employee institutes an action to enforce an arbitration award which requires an employer to make an employee whole or to make payments to an employee welfare fund, such employee or labor organization may recover, in a civil action, the full amount of such wages, with costs and such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be allowed by the court, and any agreement between him and his employer for payment of wages other than as specified in said sections shall be no defense to such action. At the request of any worker who has failed to receive payment under the provisions of said sections, the labor commissioner may take an assignment of such wage claim in trust for the assigning employee and may bring any legal action necessary to collect such claim, and the employer shall be required to pay the costs and such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be allowed by the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-421. record to be filed with clerk op COURT.
