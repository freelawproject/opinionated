His jury trial in the Superior Court resulted in a conviction of manslaughter in the first degree, based on the defendant\u2019s part in the knife slaying of Martin R. Blizzard on the night of December 31, 1973. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, rendered judgment of guilty, and sentenced the defendant to serve a term of not less than eight nor more than twenty years in prison. The defendant has appealed to this court from the judgment rendered, and in his preliminary statement of issues has assigned as error the following: the court\u2019s charge to the jury relating to the testimony of an alleged accomplice; the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial; the court\u2019s charge to the jury relating to flight; and the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress statements to the police while being transported.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">From the evidence presented the jury could have found the following: On December 31, 1973, the deceased, Martin R. Blizzard, was stabbed to death while fleeing from a party at an apartment following a fight between himself and Michael Pollatto, who was stabbed several times by Blizzard. After Blizzard was forcibly ejected from the apartment, James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Pollatto, the brother of Michael Pollatto, stated that he was going to kill Blizzard and then ran ont the door. James Pollatto was followed out the door by the defendant Ferrara. Initially, Pollatto caught up with the deceased and began to struggle with him. The defendant then arrived, joined the fray and stabbed the deceased in the chest. Immediately following the stabbing, the defendant Ferrara had a conversation with Michael Pollatto in a bar, in which he stated that he (the defendant) had \u201cstabbed him [the deceased] fourteen to twenty times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">At the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, Pollatto had been charged with manslaughter in connection with Blizzard\u2019s death, but had not been charged as an accomplice of the defendant. There was evidence of a possible agreement between Pollatto and the defendant to cover up the crime. The defendant Ferrara left Connecticut in April, 1975, shortly before his indictment for the murder of Martin Blizzard, and voluntarily returned to Connecticut and surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter the F.B.I.) on January 1, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The defendant first claims that the court erred in granting, over his objection, the state\u2019s motion to charge the jury on the law pertaining to accomplices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the case had been tried on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the basis that either he <em>or </em>James Pollatto inflicted the knife wounds upon the victim causing his death; that the simple mention of Pollatto as an accomplice prejudiced the defendant in his ability to defend against the charges; and that where there is only one defendant charged in the indictment, as here, it is error to give the accomplice charge over his objection. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The defendant\u2019s argument is in direct conflict with our recent statement that, where warranted by the evidence, it is the court\u2019s <em>duty </em>to caution the jury as to the testimony of an accomplice in its charge. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>76 Conn. 342, 349, 56 A. 632 (1904), we stated: \u201cThe conditions of character and interest most inconsistent with a credible witness, very frequently, but not always, attend an accomplice when he testifies. When those conditions exist, it is the <em>duty </em>of the judge to specially caution the jury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>174 Conn. 135, 140, 384 A.2d 343 (1977); see <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 136, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>494 F.2d 955, 959-60 (D.C. Cir. 1974). The relevant \u201cconditions of character and interest\u201d in the present ease were the fact that James Pollatto was a witness charged with manslaughter in Blizzard\u2019s death and the fact that possible interest in receiving favorable consideration and treatment for his testimony tended to incriminate the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 140-41. Moreover, as we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>172 Conn. 324, 335, 374 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>A.2d 247 (1977): \u201cIt is well settled law that \u2018[t]he fact that the witness is a defendant in a criminal prosecution, or is a participant in the offense or in a related offense, creates an interest which affects his credibility.\u2019 \u201d 81 Am. Jur. 2d, Witnesses, \u00a7 667; see <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>162 U.S. 613, 16 S. Ct. 895, 40 L. Ed. 1090 (1896); <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>244 U.S. 432, 37 S. Ct. 725, 61 L. Ed. 1242 (1917); <em>People </em>v. <em>Northcott, </em>209 Cal. 639, 289 P. 634 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Although we agree with the defendant that customarily it is the accused who has an interest in seeing that the testimony of an accomplice is given special scrutiny, we reiterate that, where it is warranted by the evidence, it is the <em>court\u2019s duty </em>to caution the jury to scrutinize carefully the testimony if the jury find that the witness intentionally assisted in the commission, or if he assisted or aided or abetted in the commission, of the offense with which the defendant is charged. We are satisfied that, from the following evidence adduced at the defendant\u2019s trial, the jury could reasonably have found that Pollatto was an accomplice or aided and abetted the defendant in committing the offense of manslaughter. There was testimony that Pollatto\u2019s brother was stabbed by Blizzard, the deceased, in the fight at the party and, therefore, Pollatto had a reason for attacking Blizzard; that Blizzard, the defendant and Pollatto were at the scene of the crime together; that Pollatto had the victim\u2019s blood on his clothing; that Pollatto had threatened to kill Blizzard, and that he was seen running away from the scene of the crime. Under such circumstances, we conclude that the court did not err in charging the jury on the law in the manner complained of even though Pollatto was not charged with aiding or abetting and did not admit that he committed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>offense with which he was charged in his own information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>172 Conn. 322, 323, 374 A.2d 244 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>170 Conn. 417, 434, 365 A.2d 1135 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Raffone, </em>161 Conn. 117, 285 A.2d 323 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The defendant Ferrara next claims that the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial for the failure of the state to disclose an understanding with its main witness, James Pollatto, concerning his future prosecution for manslaughter arising from Blizzard\u2019s death. The facts pertinent to this claim are as follows: The record discloses that after the close of evidence, defense counsel learned that a hearing had been held in a prosecution by the state of James Pollatto in which the state had indicated that its then intention was not to proceed against Pollatto on manslaughter charges for his part in the knifing of Martin Blizzard because of a lack of evidence. The defendant asserts that the state\u2019s intention not to prosecute was, in effect, a \u201cdeal\u201d arranged with Pollatto whereby he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>would testify against the defendant in exchange for the state\u2019s promise not to prosecute, and that this \u201cdeal\u201d should have been disclosed to the defendant under the principles enunciated in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), and <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S. Ct. 1173, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1217 (1959).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Absence of disclosure, asserts the defendant, not only precluded effective cross-examination of Pollatto at trial, but violated the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. We have reviewed the record in this case and have concluded that neither <em>Brady </em>nor <em>Napue </em>control; neither do we find that the evidence in the record discloses the existence of any \u201cpromise\u201d or \u201cdeal\u201d between Pollatto and the state relative to Pollatto\u2019s testimony against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, both Pollatto and the state emphatically denied that any understanding had been arranged relative to Pollatto\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The record before us supports this testimony. At best, the record indicates that the state, prior to Ferrara\u2019s trial, merely disclosed an intention not to prosecute Pollatto at that time, and that Pollatto and his defense counsel were aware of this intention. We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that, on the facts of this case, the state\u2019s \u201cintention\u201d not to prosecute falls within the ambit of the <em>Brady </em>principle that evidence favorable to an accused must be disclosed. Neither is there any indication that Pollatto\u2019s testimony that he received \u201cno promises\u201d from the state was false. Pollatto\u2019s attorney was merely told that the state had insufficient evidence to prosecute within the time period required by the rules concerning speedy trials. Under these circumstances, <em>Napue </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">One further point remains. The record does not disclose that the defendant ever made a written motion for exculpatory information or material, as required by Practice Book, 1963, \u00a72152 (1). Notwithstanding this, the defendant did learn of the purported \u201cunderstanding\u201d between Pollatto and the state at the trial after the close of evidence, but rejected the prosecution\u2019s offer to inform the jury again that the state did not intend proceeding with the manslaughter charge against Pollatto, to read portions of the transcript to the jury to clear up any possible misunderstandings and, finally, to fly Pollatto from North Carolina to Connecticut in order that Pollatto could be cross-examined by the defendant as a hostile witness concerning any promises made to him. The court informed defense counsel that he would be entitled to argue to the jury the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>matter of possible motive or bias on the part of Pollatto. The court, however, found that no promises had been made to Pollatto and denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In the light of our discussion above, we find no error in the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. \u201cThe general principle is that a mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial.\u201d <em>Ferino </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>133 Conn. 463, 466, 52 A.2d 433 (1947); <em>State </em>v. <em>Paluga, </em>171 Conn. 586, 599, 370 A.2d 1049 (1976); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>176 Conn. 138, 145-46, 406 A.2d 1 (1978). The trial court was evidently of the opinion, in which we concur, that the defendant had received a fair trial; in this opinion, and the resulting denial of the defendant\u2019s mistrial motion, the court did not abuse the wide discretion it possesses in passing on motions for mistrial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>161 Conn. 445, 449, 290 A.2d 221 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">TTT</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The defendant next contends that the trial court erred in allowing evidence of, and in charging the jury on, flight.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Flight, when unexplained, tends to prove a consciousness of guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>164 Conn. 620, 632, 325 A.2d 263 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>154 Conn. 622, 628, 228 A.2d 136 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>109 Conn. 490, 496, 146 A. 828 (1929). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cThe flight of the person accused of crime is a circumstance which, when considered together with all the facts of the ease, may justify an inference of the accused\u2019s guilt. It does not raise a presumption of guilt.\u201d 1 Wharton, Criminal Evidence (13th Ed. Torcia) \u00a7 143; accord, 2 Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7276; McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 271 (c); see annot., 25 A.L.R. 886. Flight may be established by proof of the efforts of the police to locate the defendant; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Waldman, </em>240 F.2d 449, 452 (2d Cir. 1957); and the vain efforts of police to find a defendant may tend to show that the defendant intended to elude them. <em>Kanner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>34 F.2d 863, 866 (7th Cir. 1929); 29 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 280, 281. Such proof, however, must be supported by either direct or inferential evidence that the defendant knew he was wanted by the police. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayell, </em>163 Conn. 419, 425, 311 A.2d 60 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Within the above context, the trial court heard the following evidence upon which it charged the jury relative to the defendant\u2019s absence from the state of Connecticut after the death of Martin Blizzard on December 31, 1973. Within six weeks after Blizzard\u2019s death a conversation occurred between the defendant and Pollatto discussing \u201cways to get each other off.\u201d The defendant had become aware that Pollatto had already given a statement to the police implicating the defendant, who told Pollatto \u201cnot to put any heat on him.\u201d The defendant told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>two acquaintances that he was going to turn himself in within two or three days. He also told them that he was not going to let Pollatto, who had already been arrested, \u201ctake the rap\u201d for him for the killing. The defendant told Michael Pollatto, within days of the arrest of James Pollatto, that he (the defendant) would not let James Pollatto take the rap and that something would be worked out. At the time the defendant left the state, he had already received a grand jury subpoena requesting his presence for questioning relative to the death of Martin Blizzard. The defendant spoke with his father by telephone approximately five times during his two-year absence concerning the events transpiring in the state. A police officer testified that when he picked the defendant up at the New Haven P.B.I. office, the defendant stated to him that he had been \u201con the run\u201d and had traveled as far west as California. Finally, the court and jury heard testimony relating to the efforts of the F.B.I. and the police to locate the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We find that the court was correct in admitting this evidence, and, in view of the evidence, allowing the case to go to the jury on the issue whether the defendant exhibited a \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d and thus fled the jurisdiction. There was ample evidence that the defendant knew he was \u201cwanted by the police\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayell, </em>supra; and that he had absented himself from the state to avoid apprehension. We find no error in the charge given by the court relative to the issue of flight. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>supra, 432 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that his fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination were violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>when the trial court denied his motion to suppress, as the fruit of questioning not preceded by the warnings required in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), a conversation with a police officer while being transported from the F.B.I. office in New Haven to Meriden for processing following his return to Connecticut. The record discloses the following circumstances: The defendant had been given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the F.B.I. office and again by a Meriden police officer, and had made no statement to anyone. During the ride to Meriden the officer commented that the accused had nice parents. Ferrara said \u201cYes,\u201d and added that \u201che had come back to straighten things out even if he had to do some time in jail.\u201d This testimony was given outside of the jury\u2019s presence. The court, after arguments, decided that the defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary and admitted the testimony over the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">At the outset, we note that <em>Miranda </em>requires warnings to combat a situation in which there are \u201cinherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 467; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>431 U.S. 181, 186, 97 S. Ct. 1814, 52 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1977). The defendant\u2019s position seems to be that it was incumbent upon the state at trial to prove an intentional and knowing waiver by the defendant of his right to remain silent while in police custody. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938). Under the circumstances of this ease, such a claim is without merit. It is now well settled that incriminating statements made by a defendant are admissible in evidence whether or not the <em>Miranda </em>warning has been given when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>statements were not made during the course of a \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>174 Conn. 118, 121, 384 A.2d 347 (1977). Thus, absent a custodial interrogation, the defendant enjoyed no right which could be the subject of a \u201cwaiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Notwithstanding the above, the defendant contends that it was improper conduct on the part of the officer to engage the defendant in a seemingly innocent conversation and then to allow the state to introduce as evidence any admission made by the defendant without the presence of counsel and without proof of a knowing waiver. Under the circumstances presented by the record, we find no merit to those claims. While we may agree that the defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d at the time of the conversation; see <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1977); the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>reveals no indication of any interrogation of the defendant by the police while in transport to Meriden. The defendant was twice warned of his rights under <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The claimed improper comment could reasonably have been anticipated to evoke in the defendant an acquiescence to the officer\u2019s observation, which had no relation to the defendant\u2019s arrest and charge against him. It was an innocent comment, made in the absence of interrogation, taking it \u201cout of the realm of inadmissible evidence.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hymore, </em>9 Ohio St. 2d 122, 127, 224 N.E.2d 126 (1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1024, 88 S. Ct. 1409, 20 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Moreover, nothing in the record would indicate that the defendant\u2019s statement was not voluntary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mascone, </em>171 Conn. 500, 510, 370 A.2d 1030 (1976). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>449 F.2d 204, 209 (5th Cir. 1971), the court stated: \u201cVoluntary statements of any kind, not in response to custodial interrogation, are not barred by the Fifth Amendment, nor has their admissibility been affected by the <em>Miranda </em>decision or its progeny.\u201d Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Darwin, </em>161 Conn. 413, 428, 288 A.2d 422 (1971).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The trial court determined, as a question properly within its province, that the defendant\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>was voluntary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>supra, 424; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hassett, </em>155 Conn. 225, 280, 280 A.2d 553 (1967). That conclusion is not to be disturbed if it was reasonable under the evidence and not violative of some rule of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hassett, </em>id. There, the court stated (p. 230) that it is well settled that \u201c[a] 11 of the surrounding circumstances, including the duration and conditions of the detention, the attitude of the police, and all factors affecting the defendant\u2019s powers of self-control are pertinent to whether his statements were the result of a free and unconstrained choice, in other words, were truly voluntary.\u201d <em>Culombe </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 602, 81 S. Ct. 1860, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1037 (1961); <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 34, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726 (1963). The state of mind which renders a statement involuntary and hence inadmissible is that induced by mistreatment, threats, promises, or physical or mental abuse which deprives an otherwise rational mind of the exercise of its free will and powers of decision and discernment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>supra, 424; see 3 Wharton, Criminal Evidence (13th Ed. Torcia) \u00a7671; annot., 23 A.L.R.2d 919, 921; McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7149 (c). The record is devoid of any indication that the defendant was subjected to this sort of coercion or intimidation at any time. Under these circumstances, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 53a-8. criminal liability for acts of another. A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The court charged the jury, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201c[X]f you find that two or more persons were involved here, that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>were accomplices or accessories one under the other, I will give you this word of caution, that the law says ordinarily you should view the testimony of an accomplice with caution .... And so, if you find that someone testified here who might also be involved in the case and might have his own reasons for testifying, that testimony should be examined very earefully.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\"> Two further points should be noted. The defendant did not print in his brief his request to charge on the law of \u201caccomplices\u201d; neither did the defendant print the charge that the trial court <em>did </em>give, both of which are required by the rules of practice, effective July 1, 1978, \u00a73054 (c) (1). Our consideration of the defendant\u2019s present argument is, to this extent, somewhat hampered.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The defendant also claims that the trial court erred in giving an \u201caccessory\u201d charge; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8; when the state had not charged him with \u201caiding and abetting\u201d in the indictment. The simple answer to this argument is that the propriety of a charge on \u201caiding and abetting\u201d is predicated on the basis of the sufficiency of the evidence heard during the course of the trial, <em>not </em>on the mention of such charges in pretrial documents. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>172 Conn. 322, 323, 374 A.2d 244 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Raffone, </em>161 Conn. 117, 128, 285 A.2d 323 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cianflone, </em>98 Conn. 454, 466, 120 A. 347 (1923) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>82 Conn. 213, 218-19, 72 A. 1083 (1909); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>47 Conn. 95, 120 (1879).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\"> In <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), the United States Supreme Court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused <em>on request </em>violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grayton, </em>163 Conn. 104, 108, 302 A.2d 246 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1045, 93 S. Ct. 542, 34 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1972). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976), the Court refined the <em>Brady </em>doctrine by holding that, absent a defense request for exculpatory materials, nondisclosure of \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence would be error only if the evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to guilt which would not otherwise exist. In <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S. Ct. 1173, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1217 (1959), the Court held that the failure of a prosecutor to correct the testimony of a witness whieh he knew to be false denied a criminal defendant due process of law in violation of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\"><em> </em>\u201c[Richard P.

But, based upon my evidence, I do not intend to press my charge of manslaughter against him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\"> The court charged the jury, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cMention was made that he [the defendant] left the state of Connecticut and went to various parts of the country. There is a doctrine of law on that score that if you find that a person has fled to avoid prosecution, that is a factor to be considered by you and to be given such weight as you desire to give it as bearing upon the consciousness of guilt. This is what we call an admission by conduct, whieh you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>may weigh and give it what value you think it deserves. The Supreme Court said in a recent ease on that score that flight may be established by proof of the efforts of police to locate the defendant. Such proof, however, must be supported by direct or inferential evidence that the defendant knew he was wanted by the police. If you find he left the state to avoid prosecution under those terms, that you must weigh as part of the whole picture as to innocence or guilt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\"> The United States Supreme Court defined that term in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.
