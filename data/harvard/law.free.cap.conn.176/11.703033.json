J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">Pursuant to a hearing, the defendant commissioner found that the plaintiff had vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>lated \u00a7 14-66<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the General Statutes and \u00a7 14-63-35<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the regulations of the motor vehicle department by engaging in the business of operating a wrecker for the purpose of towing, for compensation, a disabled motor vehicle when it did not have on file with the defendant a schedule of rates and charges. As a result of its decision, the defendant ordered that the plaintiff\u2019s repairer\u2019s license be suspended for a period of three days and that it post a $1000 bond. Following a dismissal of its appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, the plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Judicial review of the commissioner\u2019s action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (General Statutes, e. 54, \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189), and the scope of that review is very restricted. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, 372 A.2d 110. Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the defendant. Id., 707-708; General Statutes \u00a74-183 (g). The credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual matters are within the province of the administrative agency, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>cannot disturb the commissioner\u2019s decision if it is reasonably supported by the evidence printed in the appendices to the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The testimony and the exhibits presented at a departmental hearing disclose the following facts: At approximately 12:45 a.m., on January 21, 1975, a state capitol police officer observed the operator of a Fiat automobile driving into a parking space on the grounds of the state capitol and revving up the motor. The operator left the car, and the officer, upon inspecting the vehicle, called the state police. At approximately 2:30 a.m., a state trooper arrived and examined the car, which was an older model Fiat with Vermont registration plates. The inside of the vehicle was \u201clittered with junk,\u201d it was without taillights and was \u201cpretty well smashed up,\u201d and there was a key in its ignition. The trooper was unable to start the vehicle and thereupon he radioed his department for a wrecker to tow the vehicle from the state capitol grounds. A wrecker belonging to the plaintiff arrived at the scene and towed the Fiat to the plaintiff\u2019s service station in Hartford. Subsequently, the plaintiff submitted a bill to the state police department in the amount of $87 for the towing and storage of the automobile at the request of the police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Since the plaintiff, in its brief, does not dispute the fact that it did not have a schedule of rates and charges on file with the defendant on the date in question, it is apparent that the above-recited facts amply support the conclusion that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7 14-66 of the General Statutes and \u00a7 14-63-35 of the department\u2019s regulations and thereby warranted the suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license as authorized by \u00a7 14-64 (1) of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Demma </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 15, 17, 327 A.2d 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The principal claim of the plaintiff is that \u00a7 14-66 of the General Statutes and \u00a7 14-63-35 of the regulations of the motor vehicle department violate the equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions because they require persons who engage in the business of operating wreckers for compensation to file with and for the defendant\u2019s approval a schedule of rates to be charged for the storing of motor vehicles, but do not require such a filing by those not engaged in the business of operating wreckers for compensation but who also charge for storage of motor vehicles in the ordinary course of their business. Both provisions of the federal and state constitutions have substantially the same meaning and impose the same constitutional limitations; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meshill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 639, 376 A.2d 359; they do not prevent the legislature from dealing differently with different classes of persons provided the statute and regulation do not constitute invidious discrimination; <em>Avery </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Midland County, </em>390 U.S. 474, 88 S. Ct. 1114, 20 L. Ed. 2d 45; <em>Karp </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>156 Conn. 287, 294, 240 A.2d 845; they do not demand identical treatment for all persons without consideration of differences in relevant circumstances. <em>Truax </em>v. <em>Corrigan, </em>257 U.S. 312, 332, 42 S. Ct. 124, 66 L. Ed. 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">In <em>C &amp; H Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>167 Conn. 304, 307-308, 355 A.2d 247, we upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 14-66 (a) as a valid exercise of the police power of the state insofar as it permits only licensed repairers and dealers to operate wreckers on the highways of this state. Likewise, the portion of \u00a7 14-66 (a) and of the corresponding regulation challenged in the present case bears a rational relationship to the preservation and promotion of the public welfare by protecting motorists who sustain breakdowns on the highways of this state against overcharges by those who engage in the business of towing disabled motor vehicles for compensation. Since those who, like the plaintiff, engage in the business of operating wreckers for compensation frequently pick up motor vehicles and transport them to storage areas without the knowledge or consent of the owners, the required filing of rates and charges serves the need of the public welfare \u201cin a reasonable and impartial way.\u201d Id., 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In applying the equal protection clause to social and economic legislation, courts give great latitude to the legislature in making classifications. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 68, 71, 88 S. Ct. 1509, 20 L. Ed. 2d 436, rehearing denied, 393 U.S. 898, 89 S. Ct. 65, 21 L. Ed. 2d 185; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kievman, </em>116 Conn. 458, 467-68, 165 A. 601. The statute and regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>lation in question have a rational relationship to the welfare of the motoring public and thus are not constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">We do not consider the further claim of the plaintiff that the regulation in question is void for lack of guidelines, since it was not raised by the plaintiff in its appeal to the court below. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lombardo, </em>163 Conn. 241, 245, 304 A.2d 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The final claim of the plaintiff that its license was suspended by the defendant a second time for the same alleged violation is not persuasive. The suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s repairer\u2019s license was stayed by the Court of Common Pleas pending a final determination of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to that court. Through an oversight, notice of this stay was not given by the defendant to the police department of the city of Hartford and the state police department, and, as a result, the plaintiff\u2019s name was omitted from police towing lists for approximately one full day. When this problem was called to the attention of the defendant, however, a hearing was held. Pursuant to that hearing, the defendant reduced the plaintiff\u2019s period of suspension from three to two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 14-66. wreckers; schedule op rates. (a) No person, firm or corporation shall engage in the business of operating a wrecker for the purpose of towing or transporting for compensation motor vehicles which have been disabled or wrecked unless such person, firm or corporation is a motor vehicle dealer or repairer licensed under the provisions of subdivision (D) of this part and has filed with the commissioner, in simple and concise form, a schedule of rates and charges, including but not limited to storage charges, for services to be rendered within the state. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\"> \u201c[Motor Vehicle Department Regulations] Sec. 14-63-35.

Since the commissioner's conclusions are supported by this unchallenged testimony, the plaintiff\u2019s claim that reversible error was committed by the admission of an interdepartmental state police memo is without merit. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, 714-15, 372 A.2d 110. Similarly, the bill sent by the plaintiff to the state police was properly admitted into evidence at the hearing as an admission of a party-opponent. <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>Winter, </em>175 Conn. 41, 44, 392 A.2d 436; McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 310.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b34-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 14-64. suspension and revocation op licenses.
