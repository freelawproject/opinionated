J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgW\">On June 14, 1971, the defendant commissioner, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13a-73 (b) and 13a-73 (f) of the General Statutes, filed with the clerk of the Superior Court in Fairfield County a certificate of taking and assessment of damages relating to certain real property owned by the plaintiffs and located in the town of Wilton. Before the talcing, the plaintiffs owned a total of 96.34 acres, from which the defendant took by eminent domain a 31.3 acre strip of land, on which a number of buildings were situated, together with easements and rights-of-way over the remaining property for the purpose of the relocation of U.S. route 7, also know as the Norwalk-Danbury Road and Danbury Road. As a result of the taking of the land and buildings thereon, the plaintiffs were left with two separate parcels of land: a 57.223 acre tract located south of the strip taken on which the main residence, a pond and a driveway were situated; and a triangular shaped 7.817 acre tract located north of the taking. The damages assessed by the defendant by virtue of the taking were $243,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The plaintiffs, pursuant to \u00a7 13a-76 of the General Statutes, filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court from the defendant\u2019s assessment of damages, claiming that the damages fixed by the defendant were inadequate, and seeking a review of the assessment and a reappraisal of the damages. Thereupon, the court ordered the appointment of a state referee <em>(Hon. Sidney A. </em>Johnson) to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. General Statutes \u00a7 13a-76. In accordance with a further application, the court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ordered the appointment of two additional referees <em>(Hon. James E. Murphy </em>and <em>Hon. Samuel Mellitz) </em>to act in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Two members of the committee concluded that, before the taking, the fair market value of the entire subject property, including existing buildings and improvements, was $1,010,725. One member of the committee, however, Honorable Samuel Mellitz, concluded that, due to the existence of a reasonable probability of a zone change, the before-taking fair market value of the plaintiffs\u2019 land and buildings totaled $1,920,454. The full committee was in substantial agreement regarding the fair market value of the land remaining after the taking \u2014 the majority found the after-taking value to be $1,344,359, while the dissent set a value of $1,344,429. But since the majority concluded that \u201cthe \u2018after taking\u2019 value was the direct result of special benefits conferred upon the remaining land,\u201d and since its \u201cbefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>taking\u201d valuation of the entire tract was less than the market value of the land remaining after the taking, it concluded that the plaintiffs sustained no damages as the result of the taking and that they received special benefits of $333,643. The dissenting member of the committee, however, concluded that damages resulting from the taking amounted to $576,025.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">From the judgment of the majority of the committee of three state referees ordering that the plaintiffs pay to the defendant the amount of the benefits in the sum of $333,643 and interest to the date of payment, the plaintiffs have appealed to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the plaintiffs make what might be regarded as a \u201cwholesale attack\u201d on the majority\u2019s finding; see <em>Scribner </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 389, 391, 363 A.2d 160; the pertinent claims of error raised by the plaintiffs in this appeal may be summarized in the following manner: (1) the findings and a judgment thereupon must be made by unanimous act of the entire committee of three referees pursuant to \u00a7 52-434a (b); (2) the issue of benefits was not within the jurisdiction of the court and the judgment was therefore void; (3) if the question of benefits was properly considered, benefits may not be assessed in excess of the damages sustained; and (4) the majority erred in its conclusion regarding the market value of the subject property before the taking. Our disposition of the first two issues raised by the plaintiffs makes it unnecessary to address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">It is settled law in this state that \u201cwhere the determination of matters of public concern as distinguished from those of private confidence are committed to a group of persons, the decision of a majority, at least where all have acted together in hearing and considering the matter at issue, is a valid and effectual performance of the duty entrusted to them. <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>20 Conn. 331, 333; <em>Gallup </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>25 Conn. 10, 17; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Lemon, </em>26 Conn. 192, 193; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>59 Conn. 203, 211, 22 Atl. 146.\u201d <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>107 Conn. 272, 274, 140 A. 204; see also <em>Omaha </em>v. <em>Omaha Water Co., </em>218 U.S. 180, 193, 30 S. Ct. 615, 54 L. Ed. 991; 66 Am. Jur. 2d, References \u00a7 30. As early as 1846, this court promulgated the rule that \u201can authority imposed by law for public purposes, and especially for purposes of a judicial character, may be executed by a majority, if all have been legally notified to act.\u201d <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>18 Conn. 189, 197; <em>Congress Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Brockett, </em>111 Conn. 490, 492, 150 A. 742. On the other hand, the case of arbitrators chosen by private persons is distinguishable from \u201cthe awards of referees and auditors, who derive their power to administer justice, by the <em>act of law.\u201d Patterson </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>4 Conn. 50, 53; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>supra, 274-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In the present case, a matter of public concern was entrusted to a committee whose power to administer justice was derived by law. See the present \u00a7\u00a7 13a-76, 52-434 and 52-434a of the General Statutes;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> see <em>Florida Hill Road Corporation </em>v. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>missioner of Agriculture, </em>164 Conn. 360, 321 A.2d 856. The fact that such statutes are silent as to the validity of majority action does not connote a requirement of unanimity; to the contrary, in the absence of a specific statutory direction, the law decrees that a majority may act. <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>111 Conn. 589, 591-92, 151 A. 166. Moreover, \u201c[t]he very fact that in the statute before us an odd number of . . . [referees] is specified suggests that the legislature had in mind the possibility of a disagreement.\u201d Du<em>nn </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>supra, 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">We hold, therefore, that the judgment of a majority of a committee composed of three state referees is not invalid for lack of unanimity.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The plaintiffs attack the committee\u2019s jurisdictional authority to consider the question of special benefits in their reassessment. Section 13a-73 (b) of the G-eneral Statutes<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides that, upon the taking of a person\u2019s land for state highway purposes, the commissioner of transportation shall assess damages and benefits resulting from such taking and shall file the assessment with the clerk of the Superior Court in the county in which the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>affected is located. Following such filing, the clerk is required to give notice of such assessment to each person having an interest of record in the affected property. If the property owner affected chooses not to accept the initial assessment of the commissioner ; see \u00a7 13a-74; that person may appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 13a-76<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which authorizes a \u201creassessment of such damages or sueh benefits\u201d as may have been assessed by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>In the present case, the defendant commissioner\u2019s assessment stated, in pertinent part, that <em>\u201cthis assessment of damages\u201d </em>(emphasis added) was filed with the clerk of the Superior Court in the appropriate county as required by statute, and concluded with the following: \u201cDamages are assessed at $243,500.00.\u201d The assessment made no reference to the finding of benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In accordance with \u00a7 13a-76, the plaintiffs took a timely appeal to the Superior Court from the \u201cAssessment of Damages\u201d filed by the defendant requesting \u201ca review of said Assessment and reappraisal of damages fixed therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>We agree with the claim of the plaintiffs in this appeal that, in view of the foregoing, the committee was without authority to assess benefits found to be occasioned by the taking, therefore rendering the judgment invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The procedure mandated by \u00a7 13a-74 of the General Statutes is to deduct \u201cany benefits which have been assessed\u201d from the amount of damages found to have been due the landowner. Necessarily, \u201c[t]his process requires the ascertainment of two distinct facts, the extent to which the owner is damaged, and the extent to which he is benefitted, by the taking of his land and the putting through of the public improvements. The proceedings for the determination of these facts, are regarded as separate and distinct, and in a sense independent of each other. <em>Newton\u2019s Appeal, </em>84 Conn. 234, 79 Atl. 742.\u201d <em>Heublein, Inc. </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners, </em>109 Conn. 212, 216, 146 A. 20. Only when the commissioner files a separate assessment of damages and benefits, as he did, for instance, in <em>Gabriel </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>130 Conn. 165, 167, 32 A.2d 649, and <em>Munson </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>113 Conn. 651, 654, 155 A. 910, can it be said that the landowner has been properly apprised and put on notice of the action taken by the state. Moreover, since \u00a7 13a-78 provides that the amount of benefits assessed by the commissioner \u201cshall constitute a lien upon the land against which such benefits were assessed from the date such assessment was filed,\u201d it is readily apparent that the legislature contemplated that an assessment of benefits, if any, be made specifically by the commissioner in the first instance. In this regard, it is interesting to note that in the <em>Munson </em>case, supra, 653, Chief Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Maltbie underscored the statutory requirement that the assessment of such damages and benefits \u201cshall be made\u201d by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">It is clear, as the defendant points out, that in cases where, as here, only a portion of the landowner\u2019s property is taken, the usual measure of damages is the difference between the market value of the whole tract with its improvements before the taking and the market value of what remained after the taking. <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Highway Commissioner, </em>169 Conn. 655, 659-60, 363 A.2d 1094; <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>167 Conn. 67, 73, 355 A.2d 42; <em>Connecticut Ry. &amp; Lighting Co. </em>v. <em>Redevelopment Commission, </em>161 Conn. 234, 239, 287 A.2d 362. The fact that this \u201cbefore and after\u201d rule of computation may have governed the commissioner\u2019s determination of damages in the present ease, however, does not prevent him from separately assessing special benefits as we have indicated is required. See <em>Heublein, Inc. </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners, </em>supra, 215-16. Indeed, the majority\u2019s finding in this case specifically apportioned the amount of special benefits which it concluded increased the \u201cafter taking\u201d valuation of the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining property. Although the separate determination of damages and benefits should lead to the same result as the \u201cbefore and after\u201d procedure, the defendant\u2019s failure, in this case, to follow the statutory requirements so as to inform the plaintiffs and put them on notice that benefits were in fact assessed operated as a limitation on the committee\u2019s statutory reassessment authority under <em>% </em>13a-76 and circumscribed the true nature of the appeal and the scope of the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings in taking their appeal. These circumstances can, of course, be distinguished from a case in which the taking authority\u2019s initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>assessment includes a determination of both benefits and damages but the court, on appeal, fails to find the amount of benefits and damages by separate determination. See <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Bethel, </em>113 Conn. 323, 326-27, 155 A. 232 (394 Rec. &amp; Br. 177-78, April Term, 1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">It is necessary to the validity of the judgment \u201cthat the court should have had jurisdiction of the precise question which its judgment assumes to decide, or of the particular remedy or relief which it assumes to grant.\u201d <em>New Haven Sand Blast Co. </em>v. <em>Dreisbach, </em>104 Conn. 322, 329-30, 133 A. 99. In the absence of pleadings upon which a judgment assessing benefits may properly be founded, and in view of the statutory restrictions upon the referees\u2019 authority to reassess an award of the commissioner, the judgment rendered in this case cannot stand. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to recommit it for the determination of damages in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-5\"> Under 1967 Public Acts, No. 772 (b), in condemnation proceedings where the assessment exceeds the sum of $200,000, the court, on its own motion, had the discretion to refer the proceedings to a committee of three referees. The present <em>\u00a7 </em>52-434a of the General Statutes provides that, in such eases, the court refer the proceedings to the chief court administrator for referral to a committee of three referees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\"> In view of our disposition of this appeal, we have not attempted to resolve the apparent arithmetical inconsistencies which appear in the majority\u2019s finding and judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 motion to open the judgment and motion to vacate the judgment were denied by the full eommittee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\"><em> </em>Tho statutes in effect at the time of the reference in this ease were, in all relevant respects, identical to those which exist at the present time.
