The search netted $4718.11 in cash, along with a quantity of drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the day of the search the Circuit Court from which the warrant had been issued instituted an <em>in rem </em>proceeding for adjudication of the seized articles as a nuisance, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Some five months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>later, on June 30, 1972, the United States filed notices of tax liens against Joseph Bueehieri and Andrew Field, codefendants on drug charges that had resulted from the search of the Coventry premises. Notices of the tax levies were served on the chief of police of the town of Coventry on July 3, 1972, at that time the custodian of the funds seized in the February 1, 1972, raid. Subsequently, in April, June, and November of 1973, several proceedings were held in the Superior Court to adjudicate rights to the seized funds. Ultimately the order presently on appeal was entered; it determined that the claim of the state of Connecticut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>under \u00a7 54-33g was entitled to priority over the claim of the United States of America under \u00a7 6321 of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The United States, the appellant, has framed the issue on appeal as a question of priority in time: Was the currency seized in the narcotics raid effectively forfeited to the state of Connecticut prior to the time that a federal tax lien attached to all of the taxpayers\u2019 property, even though there had been no judicial determination of forfeiture at the time the federal tax lien arose? This statement of the issue presupposes appropriate resolution of a threshold question that must first he addressed: Was the property to which the federal tax lien attached the property of the taxpayers? Until it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>is established that the fnnds seized were fnnds in which the taxpayers Bueehieri and Field had property rights, the United States as lienholder has no claim to the funds. Whether taxpayers have \u201cproperty\u201d or \u201crights to property\u201d to which the tax lien may attach is a question of state law on which the United States has the burden of proof. <em>Aquilino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>363 U.S. 509, 512-14, 80 S. Ct. 1277, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1365 (1960); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bess, </em>357 U.S. 51, 55, 78 S. Ct. 1054, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1135 (1958); Plumb, Federal Tax Liens 27-30 (3d Ed. 1972). Only after it has been determined that a lien has attached to a state-created interest does federal law come into play to determine the priority of competing liens asserted against the same property. <em>Aquilino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The record below established very little with specificity concerning the ownership of the seized currency. At the time of the raid, some of the money was found on the person of Bueehieri, and some of it was found in the room in the Coventry house occupied by Bueehieri and Field. Bueehieri himself, however, twice disclaimed, through counsel, any interest in the money, once on the occasion of his plea of guilty to sale and possession of a controlled drug, and again on the occasion of the April, 1973, hearing in the <em>in rem </em>proceeding. The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision indicates that Field, Bucchieri\u2019s eodefendant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a cotaxpayer, also made an in-court disclaimer to the currency. The Coventry house was owned by someone other than Bueehieri or Field; whether and to what extent the landlord had access to Bueehieri and Field\u2019s room is entirely unclear. The affidavit and application for the search warrant do indicate that the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>were the site of at least one illegal drug sale by a person other than Bucehieri or Field. Although the record would seem to indicate that Bucehieri was engaged in drug traffic for profit, the United States made no request for the taking of evidence to determine whether the money seized pursuant to the search warrant was money derived from the sale of controlled drugs. Nor did the United States offer any other proof of Bueehieri\u2019s title to any of the money seized. As counsel for the United States candidly conceded at oral argument, the United States simply assumed that the currency belonged to Bucehieri and Field because of the place where it was found and because no one else had asserted a claim of ownership. Assumptions are no substitute for findings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In this state of the record, the United States has certainly not yet established the taxpayer property rights that are a prerequisite to its priority claim. We could, on this basis, affirm the judgment below, since the United States had the opportunity to participate and did participate in a hearing designed to adjudicate competing claims to the fund in dispute. It seems clear, however, that in the proceedings below the issue of ownership was never squarely addressed by anyone. The state\u2019s primary concern, in the adjudication of property as a nuisance under \u00a7 54-33g, is to show that the property \u201chas been possessed, controlled or designed for use . . . with intent to violate or in violation of any of the criminal laws of this state.\u201d The state\u2019s ease focuses on use for an illegal purpose, rather than on ownership. As this court said with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>a predecessor statute, now repealed, dealing with seizure of intoxicating liquor, \u201c[t]his statute is not a criminal statute, but provides for a civil action <em>in rem </em>for the condemnation and forfeiture of the [property] which was used in violation of the law. ... In such an action the guilt or innocence of the owner of the [property] is not in issue. The only issue is whether the [property] was used in violation of law. This follows from the nature of the action which is one against the <em>res, </em>an action <em>in rem.\u201d Alcorn </em>v. <em>Alexandrovicz, </em>112 Conn. 618, 623, 153 A. 786 (1931); see <em>State </em>v. <em>One 1960 Mercury Station Wagon, </em>5 Conn. Cir. Ct. 1, 240 A.2d 99 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The trial court specifically found that at the relevant hearing on November 15,1973, and in the briefs subsequently submitted, both parties limited their claims to the question of priority. Apparently the state was prepared to presume, having followed the statutory requisites as to notice and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the property was contraband, while the United States was prepared to indulge in a similar presumption concerning ownership. The trial court acted on the first presumption, concluding that the seized currency was money derived from the sale of controlled drugs, and hence contraband subject to forfeiture under the state statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court, however, reached no conclusions whatsoever on the question of ownership. It seems reasonable to remand this case for further proceedings to determine this crucial question.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">If upon remand the United States is able to prove that the seized currency was the property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Bucchieri and Field,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the issue of priority between the claim of the state under \u00a7 54-33g and the claim of the United States under I.R.C. \u00a7 6321 must be resolved. The eourt below did address this issue, and concluded that the state was entitled to priority because seizure of the property as contraband by initiation of the <em>in rem </em>proceeding antedated the attachment of the federal tax lien. The United States assigned this conclusion as error, and the issue has been fully briefed and argued. In light of the likelihood of a rehearing, it is appropriate to resolve this claim of error now. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>174 Conn. 464, 467, 391 A.2d 133 (1978); <em>Loewenberg </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>147 Conn. 689, 694, 166 A.2d 150 (1960); Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The priority of federal tax liens as against liens created under state law is governed generally by the common-law rule that \u201cfirst in time is first in right.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, </em>384 U.S. 323, 327, 86 S. Ct. 1561, 16 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1966); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pioneer American Ins. Co., </em>374 U.S. 84, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1651, 10 L. Ed. 2d 770 (1963); <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>347 U.S. 81, 85-86, 74 S. Ct. 367, 98 L. Ed. 520 (1954). See 2 Grilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property \u00a740.3, p. 1054 (1965). Some specific exceptions to this general rule have been carved out by the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 in its amendments to I.R.C. \u00a7 6323, but the state has not suggested that its claim to priority should shelter under any of these special exemptions. In the ordinary case, the federal lien arises, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>I.R.C. \u00a7 6322, when the tax is assessed, while the state lien arises when it is specific and perfected, or choate. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society of the </em>United, <em>States, </em>supra, 327; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pioneer American Ins. Co., </em>supra, 88; <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>supra, 84. The determination of when a state interest has become sufficiently ehoate to defeat a later-arising federal tax lien is a matter of federal and not of state law. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, </em>supra, 328; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pioneer American Ins. Co., </em>supra, 88; <em>Aquilino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>363 U.S. 509, 513-14, 80 S. Ct. 1277, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1365 (1960); <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>supra, 84. See Plumb, Federal Tax Liens 27-30 (3d Ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In the ease before us, these principles translate into the following question: Did the state\u2019s claim to the seized currency immediately become ehoate at the time of the institution of the <em>in rem </em>proceeding on February 1, 1972, so as to antedate the federal tax lien that attached on June 28, 1972; or did it first become ehoate after the hearing on the <em>in rem </em>proceeding on April 26, 1973, and thus postdate the federal lien?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The test that determines, under federal law, whether a state interest competing with a federal tax lien is sufficiently ehoate is that the competing interest must be \u201cperfected in the sense that there is nothing more to be done to have a ehoate lien\u2014 when the identity of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and the amount of the lien are established.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>supra, 84. This language has been cited repeatedly in subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>quent eases in the United States Supreme Court. Plumb, Federal Tax Liens 149-50 (3d Ed. 1972); 2 Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property 1054 (1965). The time when a state interest is perfected as against local levying creditors is not dis-positive as to choateness; an otherwise effective attachment lien, for example, is always inchoate until the time of judgment, and can be defeated by an intervening recorded tax lien. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Security Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em>340 U.S. 47, 50, 71 S. Ct. 111, 95 L. Ed. 53 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The <em>in rem </em>proceedings under \u00a7 54-33g are difficult to align with the case law on state liens because \u00a7 54-33g provides for forfeiture rather than for a lien. The <em>in rem </em>proceedings are instituted <em>ex parte </em>to seize outright designated property that has been taken as contraband pursuant to a search warrant. A hearing is afforded, as required by constitutional principles of procedural due process, so that interested parties may contest whether the property was in fact \u201cpossessed, controlled . . . or . . . used, with intent to violate or in violation of any of the criminal laws\u201d of the state. The purpose of the state\u2019s seizure is not to establish a lien to facilitate collection of moneys owed to the state, but rather to exercise the sovereign power to forfeit property shown to have been involved in an illegal enterprise. In determining when the state\u2019s interest has become choate, we must bear in mind the purpose of the state\u2019s exercise of its sovereign power of forfeiture as well as the procedure that the state has devised for the manifestation of its interest. The state\u2019s reliance on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vermont, </em>377 U.S. 351, 355, 84 S. Ct. 1267, 12 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1964), is therefore not totally apposite. True, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vermont </em>is one of the very few eases in recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>history<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in which a state interest was held by the United States Supreme Court to be sufficiently choate to survive challenge by a subsequent federal tax lien. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vermont </em>is noteworthy for its holding that a state-created lien may be valid when it attaches to all, rather than to specifically designated portions, of a taxpayer\u2019s property. It is consistent with a conclusion that a state may have the power effectively to exclude property from a federal lien, but it gives little guidance whether in this case, under this statute, this state has exercised such power.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In a case of first impression like this one, it is helpful to consult the holdings of other courts, and the opinions of the textwriters. There are, as far as we can discover, no cases definitively interpreting statutes that, like \u00a7 54-33g, couple an immediate forfeiture with a subsequent hearing that may result in reclamation of the forfeited property in whole or in part. Some twenty years ago, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, while noting the difficulty of the case, expressed in dictum grave doubt that a federal tax lien could attach to property in the possession of the state after its seizure as contraband. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bleasby, </em>257 F.2d 278, 279-80 (3d Cir. 1958). Judge Hastie in <em>Bleasby </em>characterized as \u201cextraordinary\u201d the effort by the federal government to impose its lien on property already in the possession of the state government pursuant to the latter\u2019s \u201csovereign claim of right to keep it in furtherance of its criminal laws.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>a similar vein, William T. Plumb, Jr., the leading textwriter on federal tax liens, takes the position that seizure and forfeiture of property under state law leaves the taxpayer with no property to which a subsequent federal tax lien can attach, whether or not judicial proceedings are required to finalize the forfeiture. In his view, whatever judicial proceedings are had are at best analogous to third-party claims of title whose pendency would not postpone the attachment of a lien to the affected property. Plumb, Federal Tax Liens 185-87 (3d Ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The problem with these arguments in favor of the state\u2019s priority is that they assume the very points that are ultimately at issue. To what extent in fact is the state\u2019s \u201csovereign claim of right\u201d inconsistent with the federal assertion of a tax lien? To what extent in fact has the state exercised its power of forfeiture by the mere initiation of <em>ex parte </em>proceedings to declare property a nuisance?</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The sovereign claim of the state in seizing contraband property must be measured by the purpose forfeiture is intended to serve. That purpose is, clearly, to deprive potential (and actual) criminals of access to useful property, and hence to deter crime. In no way is that purpose the enrichment of the coffers of the state treasury. As the text of \u00a7 54-33g states, the normal disposition of property declared to be a nuisance under the statute is that the property \u201cbe destroyed or disposed of to a charitable or educational institution or to a governmental agency or institution.\u201d The property is to be taken <em>from </em>criminals <em>by </em>the state but not <em>for </em>the state. It is only because the contraband in the present case happened to be cash that the normal course of disposition has apparently not been followed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>liquidity of this property undoubtedly accounts also for the federal interest in attaching it. Yet it is undeniable that the state is claiming what is in effect a windfall, while the federal government is pursuing ordinary means, albeit through jeopardy assessments,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to collect ordinary taxes in the ordinary course of Internal Revenue Service business. The federal lien interferes in no perceptible way with any state policy under the state forfeiture statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The absence of a fundamental conflict of policy between the state and the United States should not of course lead us to characterize as inchoate a state interest that under state law has fully vested at a time antedating the federal tax lien. The provisions of \u00a7 54-33g hardly comport, however, with an overriding legislative intent to characterize as final an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding to declare property contraband, when the section itself provides for a hearing at which competing claims may be heard and at which forfeiture is to be adjudicated. Connecticut law has never recognized any inherent right of forfeiture apart from statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Certain Contraceptive Materials, </em>126 Conn. 428, 11 A.2d 863 (1940); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosarbo, 2 </em>Conn. Cir. Ct. 399, 199 A.2d 575 (App. Div. 1963). In recent years this court, like others, has become increasingly sensitive to the significance of hearings that afford participants a meaningful opportunity to challenge seizures, under state law, of private property. See <em>Roundhouse Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>Telesco Masons Supplies Co., </em>168 Conn. 371, 362 A.2d 778 (1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 889, 97 S. Ct. 246, 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 172 (1976). In light of this trend, we should not devalue the hearing mandated hy \u00a7 54-33g as insignificant in the determination of when state rights attach. If the hearing and the resultant adjudication seriously matter, as constitutionally they must, the state cannot be deemed to have acquired a fully matured, choate right in the seized property until that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that the court below was in error in its conclusion that forfeiture under \u00a7 54-33g of the G-eneral Statutes occurs as of the time the property becomes contraband because of its illegal use. Even though state seizure of the property may effectively remove the property from the claims of its owners, or those who take under its owners, the state\u2019s claim is incomplete and hence inchoate until forfeiture has been adjudicated after interested parties have had an opportunity to be heard. For other purposes, adjudication may enable the state\u2019s claim to relate back to the time of initial seizure. Under the governing federal law, however, an intervening federal tax lien takes precedence over the state lien which is not yet fully choate. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Security Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em>340 U.S. 47, 50, 71 S. Ct. 111, 95 L. Ed. 53 (1950). Whether in this case the United States will be entitled to the currency seized in the Coventry drug raid will depend upon its ability to prove, upon remand, that the moneys were the property of its taxpayers, Bucchieri and Field.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the ease is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> Only the cash that was seized is presently in dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 5\u00e1-33g. summons to owner on seizure OF PROPERTY.
