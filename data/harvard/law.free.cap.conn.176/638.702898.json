Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzE\">This matter was instituted as a habeas corpus petition in the Superior Court and was reserved for the advice of this court. The parties have stipulated to the pertinent facts and submitted two questions upon which the advice of this court is sought.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The stipulation discloses the following facts: On July 3, 1975, Larry Frazier, hereinafter the plaintiff, was sentenced to a term of not less than 54 nor more than 108 years by the Superior Court in Fairfield County following his conviction on several criminal counts. On October 27, 1975, the sentence review division ordered that the plaintiff be resentenced to a term of not less than 30 nor more than 60 years. On November 13, 1975, the plaintiff was resentenced by the Superior Court to a term of not less than 32 years nor more than 64 years. On October 26, 1976, the sentence review division again ordered that the plaintiff be resentenced to a term of not less than 30 nor more than 60 years. On December 8, 1976, the plaintiff was resentenced by the Superior Court to a term of not less than 30 nor more than 60 years. The plaintiff is currently serving the sentence of not less than 30 nor more than 60 years. The defendant is computing the plaintiff\u2019s so-called good time credit on his sentence, based upon the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 18-7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which, purports to apply to persons sentenced on and after October 1, 1976, provides, in effect, more good time credit than its predecessor, General Statutes \u00a7 18-7. The defendant does not give the plaintiff any good time credit under General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a on the sentence he is now serving on the basis that such credit cannot be given to the plaintiff as he was originally sentenced before October 1,1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The first question reserved for our advice is: \u201cAre the provisions of Section 18-7a of the General Statutes applicable to persons sentenced to a term of imprisonment prior to October 1, 1976, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>effect that they are entitled to the \u2018good time\u2019 credits provided for by this statute for the balance of their sentence after October 1, 1976?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In determining the answer to this question we must consider the language of \u00a7 18-7a, as well as that of \u00a7 18-7. It is clear that \u00a7 18-7a, in its terms, applies to \u201c[a]ny person sentenced to a term of imprisonment, <em>on and, after October 1, 1976,\u201d </em>( emphasis added) and that \u00a7 18-7 specifically applies to a prisoner sentenced prior to October 1,1976. At the outset of our discussion we point out that this court has held repeatedly that where the meaning of a statute is plain and unambiguous, the enactment speaks for itself and there is no occasion to construe it. <em>Evening Sentinel </em>v. <em>National Organization for Women, </em>168 Conn. 26, 29, 357 A.2d 498 (1975), and authorities therein cited. This is consonant with the legislative intent which is found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 452, 364 A.2d 167 (1975). The statutory language of \u00a7\u00a7 18-7a and 18-7 is clear and unambiguous and, therefore, courts cannot, by construction, read into sueh statutes provisions which are not clearly stated. <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 247, 251, 363 A.2d 121 (1975); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Guman, </em>163 Conn. 439, 444, 311 A.2d 57 (1972). To state it otherwise, where the legislative intent is clear, and the language used to express it is unambiguous, there is no room for statutory construction. <em>Hurlbut </em>v. <em>Lemelin, </em>155 Conn. 68, 73, 230 A.2d 36 (1967). \u201cThere is a presumption that the legislature, in enacting a law, did so in view of existing relevant statutes and intended it to be read with them so as to make one consistent body of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>142 Conn. 375, 378, 114 A.2d 694; <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number><em>necticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>140 Conn. 650, 657, 103 A.2d 535; <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>116 Conn. 643, 646, 166 A. 70.\u201d <em>Hurlbut </em>v. <em>Lemelin, </em>supra, 74. This presumption has particular applicability in this ease. \u201cEach of these statutes has a reasonable field of operation which does not impinge on the domain of the other; <em>Busko </em>v. <em>DeFilippo, </em>162 Conn. 462, 471, 294 A.2d 510; and they can be easily read so as to make one consistent body of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 234, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, 96 S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399; <em>Cicala </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>161 Conn. 362, 365, 288 A.2d 66.\u201d <em>Pepin </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>171 Conn. 74, 86, 368 A.2d 88 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">There is no repugnancy between the two statutes. In construing a statute courts must presume that a reasonable and rational result was intended. <em>Norwich Land Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>170 Conn. 1, 4, 363 A.2d 1386 (1975); <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>142 Conn. 634, 644, 116 A.2d 508 (1955). The legislature intended that a person sentenced to a term of imprisonment on and after October 1, 1976, receive good time different from one so sentenced prior to that date; such a result is neither unreasonable nor irrational. The statute, i.e., \u00a7 18-7a, must be applied as its words direct. <em>Obuchowski </em>v. <em>Dental Commission, </em>149 Conn. 257, 265, 178 A.2d 537 (1962). That direction is clear and we follow the principle that we have no choice but to interpret the statutes as they are written. <em>Mancinone </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>162 Conn. 430, 438, 294 A.2d 564 (1972). The clarity of these two statutes is such that we need not even consider the rule that when two constructions are possible, courts will adopt the one which makes the statute effective and workable, and not that one which leads to difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>and possibly bizarre results. See, e.g., <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 506, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1973). To apply \u00a7 18-7a as the plaintiff urges would thwart the purpose of this statute, which cannot be done; <em>Evening Sentinel </em>v. <em>National Organization for Women, </em>supra, 31; and to do so would overturn a plain expression of the legislative will. It is not our function to substitute our own ideas of what might be a wise provision in the place of a clear expression of the legislative will. <em>Dental Commission </em>v. <em>Tru-Fit Plastics, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 362, 365, 269 A.2d 265 (1970). We are compelled to reject the plaintiff\u2019s claim that \u00a7 18-7a can legally be applied as he urges. The application of controlling legal principles requires the conclusion that the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a are not applicable to persons sentenced to a term of imprisonment prior to October 1, 1976, and that such persons are, therefore, not entitled to the good time credits provided by \u00a7 18-7a for the balance of their sentence after October 1, 1976. Accordingly, our answer to the first question reserved for our advice is \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We turn now to the second question reserved for our advice which is: \u201cIf the provision of Section 18-7a of the General Statutes which provides that it applies to \u2018[a]ny person sentenced to a term of imprisonment, on and after October 1, 1976,\u2019 denies its application to persons sentenced prior to that date but still serving sentences, then, is that provision invalid as being in violation of such person\u2019s rights to equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and Article I, Section 20 of the Connecticut Constitution?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The determination of the applicable standard of review is at the threshold of the consideration of any equal protection claim. \u201cThis court has many tiroes noted that the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions have a like meaning and impose similar constitutional limitations. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rao, </em>171 Conn. 600, 370 A.2d 1310; <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 485, 313 A.2d 53, appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678; <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Newtown, </em>147 Conn. 374, 381, 161 A.2d 770, appeal dismissed, 365 U.S. 299, 81 S. Ct. 692, 5 L. Ed. 2d 688; <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>133 Conn. 511, 515, 52 A.2d 702; <em>State ex rel. Brush </em>v. <em>Sixth Taxing District, </em>104 Conn. 192, 195, 132 A. 561.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 639, 376 A.2d 359 (1977). \u201cEqual protection analysis must commence with a determination of whether a legislative classification is invidious, or \u2018inherently suspect/ or whether the legislation impinges upon a fundamental right. Where the legislation impinges upon a fundamental right or creates a suspect classification, then it must be struck down unless justified by a compelling state interest. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 335, 342, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274. Where the statute does not involve fundamental rights or suspect classifications, the legislation will withstand constitutional attack if the distinction is founded on a rational basis. <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 270, 93 S. Ct. 1055, 35 L. Ed. 2d 282; <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 484, 485, 90 S. Ct. 1153, 25 L. Ed. 2d 491; <em>F. S. Royster Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>253 U.S. 412, 415, 40 S. Ct. 560, 64 L. Ed. 989; <em>In re Application of Griffiths, </em>162 Conn. 249, 258, 294 A.2d 281, rev\u2019d, 413 U.S. 717, 93 S. Ct. 2851, 37 L. Ed. 2d 910; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 358, 83 S. Ct. 814, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811.\u201d <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 540,542-43,363 A.2d 1063 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The plaintiff argues that the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard applies, maintaining that he is in a \u201csuspect\u201d classification and claims that there is an infringement of a fundamental right, i.e., his liberty. The defendant, on the other hand, claims that the \u201crational basis\u201d test is the standard to be applied. Among classifications that have been identified as inherently suspect are those based on alienage, national origin, sex or race. <em>Frontiero </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 688, 93 S. Ct. 1764, 36 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1973). Fundamental interests have been said to include voting, travel, procreation, the right of free speech and the right of a convicted defendant not to be subject to a period of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum solely by reason of his indigency. The United States Supreme Court has pointed out that it is not its province to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws. <em>San Antonio School District </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 34, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16 (1973). In that case the court stated that the key in determining whether a claimed right is \u201cfundamental\u201d lies in assessing whether that \u201cright\u201d is explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the constitution. Ibid. That same court has already said that \u201cthe Constitution itself does not guarantee good time credit for satisfactory behavior while in prison.\u201d <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1974). \u201cFundamental rights\u201d are those rights which are established by the constitution; and they are merely given the protection which the constitution demands. <em>Koelfgen </em>v. <em>Jack</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>son, </em>355 F. Sup. 243, 250 (D. Minn. 1972), judgment affirmed, 410 U.S. 976, 93 S. Ct. 1502, 36 L. Ed. 2d 173 (1973). Therefore it cannot be said that a person serving a term of imprisonment who is eligible for certain good time credits under a statute in effect at the time he was sentenced can effectively assert a \u201cfundamental\u201d right to additional good time credits permitted under another statute which became effective after he was sentenced. Sections 18-7 and 18-7a create two classes, i.e., those persons sentenced to a term of imprisonment before October 1, 1976, and those so sentenced on and after October 1, 1976. The plaintiff is in the former class of prisoners. The statutory scheme which generates this appeal cannot be said to be composed of a group or class, i.e., prisoners sentenced to a term of imprisonment before October 1, 1976, that is itself \u201csuspect\u201d as that has been generally interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Our opinion is that the standard to be used in assessing the equal protection claim is the traditional \u201crational basis\u201d test and not the more exacting \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test. An examination of cases that have addressed similar equal protection attacks reinforces our opinion. Moreover, there is the view that the \u201ccompelling necessity\u201d test has been ruled inapplicable by the United States Supreme Court in good time cases since <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 270, 93 S. Ct. 1055, 35 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1973). See <em>United States ex rel. Sero </em>v. <em>Preiser, </em>372 F. Sup. 663, 671 (S.D. N.Y. 1974), affirmed in part and remanded in part, 506 F.2d 1115 (2d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 921, 95 S. Ct. 1587, 43 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In <em>Mastracchio </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>98 R.I. 111, 200 A.2d 10 (1964), a ease strikingly similar to the one before us, the petitioning prisoner applied for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>an order restraining the warden of adnlt correctional institutions from denying him those enlarged benefits for good behavior for time served subsequent to May 6,1960, the effective date of the statute which conferred those enlarged benefits. Conceding that the preexisting statute controlled as to the time he served prior to May 6,1960, the plaintiff in <em>Mastracchio </em>made the same claim as the plaintiff before us by contending that his credits subsequent to May 6, 1960, should be determined no differently from those of persons imprisoned subsequent to May 6, 1960. <em>Mastracchio </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra. The Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected the equal protection claim, referring to their Opinion to 'the Governor in 91 R.I. 187, 162 A.2d 814 (1960), wherein they advised that the enlarged benefits of the statute invoiced in <em>Mastracchio </em>could not be extended to any portion of the terms of persons sentenced prior to its effective date. The <em>Mastracchio </em>court went on to say: \u201cThis situation in no way differs from one where a legislature prospectively reduces the maximum penalty for a. crime. In that instance, and without any constitutional violation, one sentenced to the maximum term on the day preceding the effective date of the new statute will serve a longer term than one sentenced to the maximum term on the next day. See <em>Comerford </em>v. <em>Commonwealth of Massachusetts, </em>1 Cir., 233 F.2d 294. Here [in Mastracchio] two prisoners, one of whom was sentenced prior to the critical date of chap. 112 and the other of whom was thereafter sentenced to an identical term, will receive varying credits for good time. In each instance the classification which is determined by the effective date of the legislation is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. So long as the good behavior credits of the class of those sentenced prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>to May 6, 1960 are computed in a like manner and the members of that class are offered identical treatment, there is no denial to petitioner of the equal protection of the laws, even though persons sentenced subsequent to May 6, 1960 may be treated differently. See <em>Berberian </em>v. <em>Lussier, </em>87 R.I. 226, 139 A.2d 869.\u201d <em>Mastracchio </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra. The plaintiff in the appeal before us is in exactly the same position and a member of exactly the same class as the plaintiff in <em>Mastracchio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In <em>Mirenda </em>v. <em>Ulibarri, </em>351 F. Sup. 676 (C.D. Cal. 1972), the incarcerated plaintiff moved to vacate and \u201cameliorate\u201d his sentence. He had been sentenced prior to the effective date of a new statute creating more liberal sentencing provisions for those prosecuted under the preexisting statute but who were not sentenced until after the effective date of the new statute. In <em>Mirenda </em>the plaintiff claimed that the failure to apply the same treatment to those convicted before the new act as to those convicted thereafter created a class subject to invidious discrimination in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses. In overruling those claims the court said: \u201cThis is of necessity the result of any new law which is to go into effect at and on a certain date. The seeming inequity in fixing a cut-off date is outbalanced by the factors of reliance and burden on the administration of justice which argue for prospective application only. <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 300-301, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199 (1967).\u201d <em>Mirenda </em>v. <em>Ulibarri, </em>supra, 677. Where legislation confers a benefit not previously provided, and is effective on a certain date, this apparent inequity is the result of all such ameliorative legislation and has been held not to deny equal protection. <em>Jackson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>Alabama, </em>530 F.2d 1231, 1238 (5th Cir. 1976), and authorities therein cited. In <em>Jackson </em>the court said: \u201cWe find in the circumstances here present that the \u2018factors of reliance and burden on the administration of justice,\u2019 <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>1967, 388 U.S. 293, 300, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 1972, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199, 1205, outweigh the apparent inequity in determining a fixed cutoff date.\u201d Ibid..</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The plaintiff places great stress on <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>345 F. Sup. 48 (D. Conn. 1972). <em>Bolling </em>does not sustain him. In that ease the Connecticut good time credit statutory scheme was involved. The operation of that scheme, which assigned two people, convicted of the same offense and sentenced to the same maximum term, to different treatment based solely on whether they received a definite sentence or an indefinite one was scrutinized carefully on an equal protection attack. Those serving the former type of sentence were permitted to earn good time credits while those serving the latter type were not permitted to earn such credits. The United States District Court found the \u201cConnecticut statutory system governing good time in correctional institutions unconstitutional as applied to prevent inmates on indefinite sentences from earning such commutation.\u201d <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 52. In that ease the invidious classification, based as it was on the type of sentence being served, is evident. In the ease before us, everyone in each group, whether sentenced before October 1, 1976, or thereafter, receives uniform treatment under the statutory scheme. More to the point, after finding a denial of equal protection in <em>Bolling, </em>the court, in enjoining the discrimination complained of, specifically held that its ruling doing so \u201cwill have <em>prospective </em>force only.\u201d <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra. (Emphasis added.) If the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>could order its ruling to be prospective only, certainly tbe legislature, where the authority to enact good time credit rests; <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>supra, 558; can do so prospectively. Especially is this so when all the members of the two groups affected by \u00a7 18-7a are treated uniformly.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">\u201cThe question of classification is primarily one for the legislature, and the courts will not interfere unless a classification presented by statute is clearly irrational and unreasonable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zazzaro, </em>128 Conn. 160, 166, 20 A.2d 737.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rao, </em>171 Conn. 600, 603, 370 A.2d 1310 (1976). \u201cLegislation need not deal with all phases of a problem in the same way, so long as the distinctions drawn have some basis in practical experience.\u201d <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Katzenbach, </em>383 U.S. 301, 331, 86 S. Ct. 803, 15 L. Ed. 2d 769 (1966). The purpose of Public Acts 1976, No. 76-358, which included the enactment of what is now General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a, was to consolidate good time statutes and to eliminate multiple systems of computing and crediting good time. Accordingly, \u00a7 <em>4 </em>of that act repealed General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-53 and 18-77a, the former section being concerned with commutation of sentences for good behavior in a community correctional center and the latter being concerned with reduction of sentences for good conduct in the Connecticut correctional institution, Cheshire. Thus, \u00a7\u00a7 18-7 and 18-7a remain to provide the means for determining eligibility for good time credits regardless of the type of sentence of imprisonment or institution involved. The role of \u00a7 18-7a in the actual consolidation of the good time statutes and its operation toward eliminating the multiple systems of computing and crediting good time has legitimacy and, thus, the distinction between 18-7 and 18-7a worked by the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\u201crationally furthers some articulated stated purpose.\u201d See <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 270, 93 S.
