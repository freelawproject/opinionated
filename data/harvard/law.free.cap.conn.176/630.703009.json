When the defendant board of education of the town of West Haven<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> refused to reinstate their administrative contracts, the plaintiffs, George Delagorges and George Richards, appealed to the Court of Common Pleas. That court, after a limited evidentiary hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> dismissed their appeals and rendered judgments accordingly. The plaintiffs are now appealing from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>those judgments to this court. Since their cases involve similar facts and identical issues, we treat them in one opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The basic facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff George Delagorges had served in the West Haven school system for twenty-one years as of July 1, 1976. He had been an administrator for four years, an assistant principal at the high school for three years. The plaintiff George Richards had served in the West Haven school system for twenty-four years as of July 1, 1976. He had been an administrator for thirteen years, the principal of the high school for twelve years.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">On October 6, 1975, after an extensive study in which both plaintiffs participated, the defendant adopted a reorganization plan for the West Haven High School, whose accreditation was then in jeopardy. The plan substituted for the existing administrative positions of principal and assistant principal a number of new administrative posts: three house leaders, three assistant house leaders, and an instructional improvement coordinator. Both plaintiffs applied for positions under the reorganization plan, but neither was selected. The plaintiffs were notified of the elimination of their old administrative positions on June 29, 1976, and were subsequently reassigned to positions as teachers at substantial reductions in pay. They protested their reassignments, first to the defendant and then to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 appeals raise a number of questions concerning the manner of their transfer. The trial court concluded, however, that it was preliminarily obligated to ascertain its own jurisdiction to entertain these appeals. On this crucial issue, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>court found against the plaintiffs, determining that there was a lack of appellate jurisdiction under either General Statutes 4-166 et seq., the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, or \u00a7 10-151, the Teacher Tenure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">There is no inherent right to judicial review of administrative actions. This court has repeatedly held that appeals to the courts from administrative officers or boards may be taken only when a statute provides authority for judicial intervention. <em>Norwich Land Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>170 Conn. 1, 6, 363 A.2d 1386 (1975); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>166 Conn. 189, 191, 348 A.2d 584 (1974); <em>Tazza </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>164 Conn. 187, 190, 319 A.2d 393 (1972); Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 1. The Supreme Court of the United States has recently confirmed these holdings, stating that \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [does] not guarantee [teachers] that the decision to terminate their employment would be made or reviewed by a body other than the School Board.\u201d <em>Hortonville Joint School District No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hortonville Education Assn., </em>426 U.S. 482, 497, 96 S. Ct. 2308,49 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The only Connecticut legislation that currently authorizes appeals from the decisions of school boards is the Teacher Tenure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Boards of education are now excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>from the jurisdiction of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 et seq.; <em>Mauriello </em>v. <em>Board of Education, 176 </em>Conn. 466, 469, 408 A.2d 247 (1979); <em>Adamchek </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>174 Conn. 366, 369, 387 A.2d 556 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Under the Teacher Tenure Act, judicial review is afforded to school board actions that \u201cterminate\u201d the employment of a tenured school teacher. The question before us is whether the plaintiffs are entitled to invoke \u00a7 10-151 (f) when they are terminated as administrators but retained as teachers. Put another way, have the plaintiffs, by virtue of their certification as administrators and their many years of administrative service, acquired tenure <em>as administrators9</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The plaintiffs argue that they have tenure as administrators because they were employed for more than three continuous years under individual administrative contracts. They point to \u00a7 10-151 (e) which defines the term \u201cteacher\u201d to include any \u201cemployee of a board of education, below the rank of superintendent.\u201d They urge that the reference in \u00a7 10-151 (b) to \u201cthe contract of employment of a teacher\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which is continuously renewed unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>terminated for cause means the specific contract of employment to a particular position rather than the generic contract of employment as a teacher. They claim therefore that a statutory \u201ctermination\u201d has occurred as a consequence of their respective dismissals as assistant principal and principal even though their employment relationship with the defendant board of education has concededly not been severed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">This question is a matter of first impression in this state. The language of \u00a7 10-151 is sufficiently open-ended so that it might be read either to encompass or to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The recorded legislative history suggests that the statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>primarily intended to provide judicial review for teachers dismissed for cause; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 194-95; it sheds no light on the applicability of the statute to administrators transferred because of a school reorganization. In view of the more elaborate legislative enactments in other jurisdictions, which specifically address administrative reassignments and transfers resulting in reduction in pay, the comparative simplicity of our statute makes it likely that the legislature gave no consideration to the problem of administrative tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The question therefore becomes whether we should take this opportunity, in the absence of explicit legislative direction, to construe the Teacher Tenure Act to provide tenure for administrators not as teachers but as administrators. We are of course cognizant of the importance that has been attached by our legislature and by our cases to the protection of teachers in their professional role. <em>Mauriello </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 472; <em>Herzig </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>152 Conn. 144, 151, 204 A.2d 827 (1964). But judicial review of a contest involving a dismissed teacher\u2019s right to a fair hearing is a quite different matter from judicial review of administrative discretion to determine and to implement educational policy. That discretion also has been recognized by our cases: <em>Light </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>170 Conn. 35, 40, 364 \u00c1.2d 229 (1975); <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>162 Conn. 566, 583, 295 A.2d 526 (1972). As the trial court observed, judicial interposition into every reassignment of teaching or administrative personnel would carry substantial potential for administrative chaos. In states whose statutes expressly cover the contracts of administrators, both the procedures and the grounds for judicial review often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>differ sharply from those that govern teacher tenure. See, e.g., Cal. Educ. Code 44893, 44951; Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 279.23 \u2014 279.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The facts of the cases before us illustrate the wisdom of restricting tenure to teachers until the legislature, or a local charter; see <em>Cammisa </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>175 Conn. 445, 399 A.2d 521 (1978); instructs us to the contrary. The plaintiffs lost their administrative positions for reasons unrelated to their personal competence; their reassignments were not, in statutory terms, \u201cfor cause.\u201d The trial court found that the defendant school hoard\u2019s plan for reorganization was a genuine response to perceived educational exigencies and not a surreptitious device to remove the plaintiffs from their administrative offices. The plaintiffs\u2019 own participation in the formulation of the reorganization plan that was destined to abolish their former positions demonstrates that both they and the defendant have acted in good faith throughout these proceedings. Neither the reorganization of West Haven High School, nor the appointment of other individuals to the positions created by the reorganization, nor the reassignment of the plaintiffs was motivated by malice, negligence, had faith, or any personal animus toward either plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A good faith reorganization is a far cry from a contested termination for cause. Cf. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>School District No. 20 in County of El Paso, </em>535 P.2d 206 (Colo. 1975); <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Board of Education of Fairbury-Cropsey Community Unit School Dis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>trict No. 3, </em>38 Ill. App. 3d 742, 348 N.E.2d 470 (1976); <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>School Committee of Melrose, </em>363 Mass. 332, 294 N.E.2d 209 (1973); <em>State ex rel. Farley </em>v. <em>Board of School Directors of City of Milwaukee, </em>49 Wis. 2d 765, 183 N.W.2d 148 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Since the trial court was correct in its conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to hear these appeals, we need not consider its alternate rulings about the propriety of the proceedings below were \u00a7 10-151 to have been held applicable. The fact that the defendant provided the plaintiffs an administrative hearing does not authorize a judicial appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">There is no error on either appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\"> The suits were filed against the defendant board as a body and against the individual members of the board of education. For convenience, all of these parties will be deemed included in all references to the defendant board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\"> The court received testimony to supplement the record before the board of education on only two matters, whether the defendant\u2019s reorganization plan had created positions clearly different from the positions formerly held by the plaintiffs, and whether the defendant had acted \u201cwith gross negligence or in bad faith or with malice\u201d in coming to its decisions. See General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 10-151. employment op teachers.

From all that appears, there is no reason to suppose that the defendant was denying the plaintiffs\u2019 status as tenured teachers, or that the error in form was anything other than a clerical oversight.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
