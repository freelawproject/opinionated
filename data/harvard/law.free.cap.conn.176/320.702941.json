The Court of Common Pleas dismissed the appeal. From that judgment, the defendant, the state of Connecticut, has appealed to this court. The plaintiff, Laura Liptak, has cross appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The issue on the defendant\u2019s appeal is whether the commissioner\u2019s finding and award were correct in light of the state\u2019s defenses of wilful misconduct and intoxication. The plaintiff\u2019s claim was based on injuries received by her husband, Raymond J. Liptak, in a fatal one-car accident that concededly occurred while the decedent was on state business. The accident occurred on route 1-95 in the town of Darien when Liptak failed to negotiate a curve on the highway. His car struck the median divider and turned over onto its roof; he was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident by the state medical examiner. The state\u2019s allegations of wilful and serious misconduct and intoxication were both based on a blood sample taken from the decedent which subsequently showed 0.14 percent alcohol in his blood. The commissioner found that Liptak\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, and refused to amend his findings to incorporate any further conclusions whatsoever about the cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The state\u2019s defenses derive from \u00a7 31-284 (a) of the G-eneral Statutes which provides in part that \u201ccompensation shall not be paid when the personal injury has been caused by the wilful and serious misconduct of the injured employee or by his intox<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ication.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The allegations of wilful and serious misconduct or intoxication raise affirmative defenses on which the defendant bears the burden of proof; <em>Kovacs </em>v. <em>Manning, Maxwell &amp; Moore, </em>106 Conn. 250, 253, 137 A. 761 (1927); <em>Bendett </em>v. <em>Mohican Co., </em>98 Conn. 544, 120 A. 148 (1923); <em>Gonier </em>v. <em>Chase Companies, </em>97 Conn. 46, 58, 115 A. 677 (1921); and see <em>Glenn </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>168 Conn. 413, 420, 362 A.2d 512 (1975), and <em>Poulick </em>v. <em>Radio City Restaurant, </em>153 Conn. 410, 413-15, 216 A.2d 831 (1966), imposing a similar burden of proof on the employer for other affirmative defenses. The employer asserting such a defense must show not only the misconduct itself but also that the injury was caused by the misconduct. Davis, \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation in Connecticut \u2014 The Necessary Work Connection,\u201d 7 Conn. L. Rev. 199, 231-33 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The evidence adduced before the commissioner contained very little of probative value to establish the cause of the accident. The state trooper who investigated the accident testified that there was \u201ca good chance\u201d that the alcohol \u201ccould have had an effect\u201d; the state medical examiner stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>it was a \u201cborderline case.\u201d In light of the sparsity of this testimony, we cannot say that the commissioner acted unreasonably in refusing to find that the state had carried its burden of demonstrating that, as a matter of fact, the injury was \u201ccaused by . . . wilful and serious misconduct ... or by . . . intoxication,\u201d as \u00a7 31-284 (a) requires. <em>True </em>v. <em>Longchamps, Inc., </em>171 Conn. 476, 479, 370 A.2d 1018 (1976); <em>Glenn </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>supra, 419; <em>Gonier </em>v. <em>Chase Companies, </em>supra, 58; see General Statutes \u00a74-183 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The trial court was therefore correct in its determination that the record supported the findings of the commissioner, and that his conclusions were not inconsistent with the facts found or the applicable law. In view of this resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal, we need not consider the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal which sought dismissal of the defendant\u2019s appeal for alleged procedural irregularities.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 31-284. basic rights and liabilities.
