Diette, Jr., </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>Arnold Maride, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>John J. Kelly, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b159-5\">Loiselle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALq\">Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of assault in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), and of risk of injury to a minor child, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21. On appeal to this court, the defendant challenges the court\u2019s rulings denying both his motion to suppress and his request for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is directed to the court\u2019s ruling admitting into evidence a sweatshirt obtained by the police from the defendant on the night of the assault. The surrounding facts, as revealed in the defendant\u2019s brief, are as follows: On June 23, 1975, the victim was discovered on a roadside in the town of Wallingford. He was subsequently taken to his home and then to the local police station. The defendant, a neighbor of the victim, was at home when the victim arrived at his own residence. The defendant and his wife followed the victim to the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Upon their arrival at the station, the defendant and his wife were asked downstairs, where both were given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Because the defendant had been named as the assailant, he was asked to give his version of the events which had transpired earlier in the evening. Later, he alone was taken into the detective room, where he was again advised of the fact that he had been named as the assailant. Although <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not explicitly reiterated for the defendant, he was given a <em>Miranda </em>warning card which he was requested to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>sign. He was then asked to turn over the sweatshirt he was wearing, which, after a pause, he agreed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The state\u2019s version of the relevant events is as follows: Lieutenant Murt Howard, upon entering the detective division of the station, noticed red spots on the defendant\u2019s sweatshirt. The lieutenant was told that the defendant had already been advised of his rights, and the defendant revealed that he understood those rights. When asked about the spots on his shirt, the defendant replied that \u201cit could be red paint\u201d since he had been painting a bicycle at home. Upon further inquiry as to whether it could be blood, the defendant responded that this was possible, since he had cut himself while repairing the bike. Lieutenant Howard then asked the defendant if he would turn over the sweatshirt, advising the defendant that he had a right to refuse this. After some thought, the defendant agreed, stating that \u201cI have been treated fairly here and I will give you the sweatshirt.\u201d Soon after, the defendant left the station, accompanied by his wife. He was not formally arrested for over a week, at which point he was arrested pursuant to a bench warrant issued by the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The defendant claims that the court\u2019s ruling admitting the sweatshirt into evidence violated his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination as well as his fourth amendment right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures. Because the privilege against self-incrimination serves only to protect \u201can accused . . . from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature,\u201d but does not extend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>protect a suspect from serving as the source for \u201creal or physical evidence\u201d; <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 761, 764, 86 S. Ct. 1826, 16 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1966); the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment claim must fail. Consequently, the question narrows down to whether the mode by which the police obtained the defendant\u2019s sweatshirt violated fourth amendment strictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The fourth amendment to the United States constitution provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause . . . .\u201d A specifically established exception to the warrant and probable cause requirements of this provision is that of a search conducted pursuant to consent. <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973). The admissibility of evidence derived from a consensual search is contingent, however, upon proof by the state that consent was freely and voluntarily given and not the result of duress or coercion, express or implied. Id., 222, 248. In determining whether this standard is met, courts look to \u201cthe totality of all the surrounding circumstances \u2014 both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u201d Id., 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The defendant appears to predicate his claim that no consent was given upon the fact that he was the subject of a custodial interrogation and that such a circumstance is inherently coercive, vitiating the possibility of consent voluntarily and freely given. In <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, the United States Supreme Court explicitly adopted a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test for the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>voluntariness, bypassing a proposed \u201ctalismanie\u201d test relied upon by a lower court. Notably, the court, remarking upon the finding in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), that custodial interrogations by the police were inherently coercive, expressly limited its holding to those searches which took place pursuant to consent given outside the custodial atmosphere. Subsequently, however, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 424, 96 S. Ct. 820, 46 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1976), the court, confronting the issue of the voluntariness of consent given by one arrested and within police custody \u2014 although not within the station house \u2014 noted that \u201cthe fact of custody alone has never been enough in itself to demonstrate a coerced confession or consent to search.\u201d See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>560 F.2d 884, 889 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiener, </em>534 F.2d 15, 17 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Candella, </em>469 F.2d 173, 175 (2d Cir. 1972). Consequently, whether the defendant is within police custody at the time consent is given is merely one factor to be considered in determining whether the consent was \u201cvoluntarily and freely given.\u201d The fact of custody may require more careful scrutiny; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiener, </em>supra, 17; but it does not alone preclude the giving of voluntary consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Whether the defendant was technically in custody at the time he gave up his sweatshirt is not, then, determinative. Rather, the question of whether a consent to a search was in fact voluntary is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the relevant circumstances. The record before us substantiates the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s act in giving up his sweatshirt was voluntary, essentially the product of free, uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>strained choice. The defendant came to the station of his own accord, he was advised of his rights, he was told that he had been named as the assailant, the questions addressed to him with respect to his sweatshirt put him on notice that it could be used to implicate him, he was told that he need not comply with the request to hand over his sweatshirt, and, finally, he left the station, accompanied by his wife, at the close of the questioning. Furthermore, when asked at the trial whether he had voluntarily surrendered his shirt, the defendant conceded that he had. Under these circumstances, it would be difficult to say that the court erred in ruling that the defendant acted voluntarily in giving up his shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The defendant\u2019s next claim pertains to the court\u2019s ruling denying his motion for a mistrial. The facts surrounding this claim are as follows: During the course of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Lieutenant Howard, the defendant asked, \u201cNow, is there anything that you asked Mr. Adams to do, sign a statement, sign the consent to the lie detector, signing the consent to have his picture taken, letting you cheek his hands \u2014 is there anything he refused to do?\u201d The lieutenant responded, \u201cNo, sir, he was cooperative. I asked him \u2014 he had made a statement to me he had been in trouble in the state of Maine when he was fifteen years of age, and the problem itself was sodomy and assault \u2014\u201d The defendant objected to the answer as unresponsive, the court sustained the objection, and the state explicitly did not claim the answer. The defendant continued his line of questioning. Subsequently, after the conclusion of this cross-examination, the defendant moved for a mistrial based upon the prejudicial nature of the lieutenant\u2019s remark. The court denied the motion after argument, but offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>to submit a curative charge to the jury. Both parties agreed to this arrangement without objection and curative instructions were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">For the firs.t time on appeal, the defendant seeks to bulwark his claim that a mistrial was warranted by pointing out additional possibly prejudicial remarks which came out later in the trial when the defendant was being questioned on cross-examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The transcript reveals that the defendant failed to interpose the ground for objection he now asserts. Rather, he claimed that the questions raised by the state were repetitive. \u201cOnce counsel states the authority and ground of his objection, any appeal will be limited to the ground asserted.\u201d <em>Borucki </em>v. <em>MacKenzie Bros. Co., </em>125 Conn. 92, 3 A.2d 224 (1938); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rado, 172 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Conn. 74, 81, 372 A.2d 159 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>166 Conn. 439, 444-45, 352 A.2d 294 (1974); <em>Salvatore </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>144 Conn. 437, 443, 133 A.2d 622 (1957). An exception to this rule permits a claim to be raised for the first time on appeal where it involves the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial. <em>Malley </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>547 F.2d 25, 28 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 918, 97 S. Ct. 1335, 51 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1977); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>172 Conn. 140, 148, 374 A.2d 150 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69-71, 327 A.2d 576 (1974). Given the context in which the state\u2019s line of questioning was pursued and the fact that the defendant\u2019s answers foreclosed further inquiry, we cannot say that this line of questioning deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Furthermore, this episode came after the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was ruled upon. The defendant failed to move again for a mistrial. Consequently, this particular interchange cannot logically provide any grounds for a claim that the court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s sole motion for a mistrial. It defies logic to require the court to rule upon a motion on the basis of evidence not yet admitted or questions not yet asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The question of whether the court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial must, then, focus solely upon the remark divulged by Lieutenant Howard upon cross-examination by the defendant. As stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Paluga, </em>171 Conn. 586, 599, 370 A.2d 1049 (1976), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Grayton, </em>163 Conn. 104, 112, 302 A.2d 246 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1045, 93 S. Ct. 542, 34 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1972), \u201c \u2018The general principle is that a mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence on the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>trial. <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>157 Conn. 561, 565, 254 A.2d 904; <em>Ferino </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>133 Conn. 463, 466, 52 A.2d 433.\u2019 \u2018The trial court fias wide discretion in passing on motions for mistrial.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>161 Conn. 445, 449, 290 A.2d 221.\u201d The question becomes, therefore, whether the officer\u2019s remark was so prejudicial as to prevent the defendant from obtaining a fair trial. We eannot say that the comments were of such magnitude. Although the answer was clearly unresponsive, and inappropriately suggestive, little of substance was revealed. Within the context of the full trial, the remark pales in significance. Twice the jury were told, in words calculated not to draw attention to the remark, that it was to be disregarded.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rado, </em>172 Conn. 74, 81, 372 A.2d 159 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\"> \u201c[By Mr. Kelly:]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">Q.
