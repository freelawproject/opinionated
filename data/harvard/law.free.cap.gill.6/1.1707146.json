And the said <em>Hall </em>further stated, that said book shews by the entries therein the date of each draft discounted by said bank, the amount thereof, the time when due, the time when sent by mail for collection, and how charged, and that the entries therein were made by said <em>Hall, </em>as such clerk, in the regular and daily course of his business as such clerk,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, for the purpose of showing when the notices referred to in the aforegoing affidavit of the notary were received at the <em>Western Bank, </em>then proved by said <em>Hall </em>that the entries in said book in relation to the draft now in suit were made by him in the course of his business, and that it was his uniform practice to make all his entries truly and at the time of each transaction; and that the words \u201c JV. <em>JL </em>11 <em>th January, </em>1840,\u201d written against the entries relating to the draft in suit, in said bill book, are in the proper hand-writing of said <em>Hall, </em>and that they mean and are intended to signify that notice of the non-acceptance of said draft on that day received by him as such corresponding clerk, and that the said <em>Hall </em>has no doubt of the accuracy and verity of said entry, although he has no recollection of the fact of such notice being received at any time.

B. </em>and as such it was his business to serve all notices placed in his hands by the officers of said bank, to be served on residents in the city of <em>B. </em>and that it was his invariable practice to serve said notices on the day they were delivered to him. That the said witness recollects having called some time in January, 1840, at the place of business of the defendant with a notice of protest for him, and another for JV. <em>U. C. </em>That he read enough of said notices to see who were the parties to be notified, and that they were notices of protest, but he did not read every word or the date of said notices. That he handed the notice made out for the defendant to him, remarking that it was a protest for him and <em>Chafee, </em>who returned it to him with a request that he would give it to said <em>C. </em>and said witness accordingly left the same at the dwelling house of said <em>C. </em>on same day. That said witness, <em>Taylor, </em>has no recollection of the day of the month on which he delivered said notice to said defendant, hut he recollects that the ground was then covered with a very deep snow, the heaviest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>snow in that winter, and that he recollects no other notice to defendant in said month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-5\">The plaintiffs then further proved by <em>Th. </em>Phenix, that when he left <em>Baltimore </em>on the afternoon of the 9th January, 1840, and for several days before, there was a very deep snow on the ground, so deep that some days before said 9th January the travelling had been obstructed. That said <em>Phenix </em>was compelled to travel in a sleigh from <em>Harpers Ferry </em>in <em>Virginia, </em>to <em>Winchester, </em>on the 10th January, and from thence to <em>Woodstock, </em>in a sleigh, on the 11th and 12th January, 1840, and that said snow was the heaviest of the winter, according to the recollection of said <em>Phenix. </em>The plaintiffs then further proved by said <em>Phenix </em>that before this suit was commenced, and early in October, 1840, and after the bill in suit was returned to him by the aforesaid letter of 26th September, 1840, he took the bill and protest to <em>Whiteford, </em>the defendant, and asked him for payment. That defendant expressed great surprise, and said he had no notice of protest for non-payment. Witness replied the bank had none either, but you had notice of non-acceptance, to which <em>Whiteford </em>replied, \u201c yes I might have had that,\u201d and objected to payment for want of notice of protest for nonpayment. The plaintiffs further proved by said <em>Phenix, </em>that said draft had been retained in <em>Charleston </em>aforesaid, by plaintiffs, from January, 1840, until the 26th September, 1840, and that the said <em>Phenix </em>never received any notice of its protest for non-payment, or any communication from plaintiffs relating thereto, after the month of January, 1840, until by said letter of 26th September, 1840.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\">And the plaintiff's further proved by said <em>James Hall, </em>that he was corresponding clerk of the <em>W. B. </em>until the 26th September, 1840, and he never received or saw any notice relating to said draft, shewing a protest for non-payment, or of presentment at maturity for payment thereof. The plaintiffs then further proved that this suit was brought on the 9th November, 1840, as appears by the original docket entries, and that by \u00e1 clerical misprision the writ was stated as having been issued on the 9th October, 1840.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Thereupon, the plaintiffs, for the purpose of shewing that the plaintiffs had a right to maintain this suit, and to shew possession and right of possession in them, of the draft now in suit, at the institution of this suit, offered to prove by <em>Thomas Phenix </em>that on the 2d October, 1840, he wrote to the plaintiffs the original letter, post-marked at Baltimore, of that date, now shewn him by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-5\"><em>W.

W e authorize you to take any course you may deem for your interest in the settlement of the dft. on <em>Blum \u00f3f Cobia, </em>observing to you, however, that we should prefer a reasonable sacrifice to get the business settled at once, and, if agreeable to you, we would be glad if you would name what sum you would take from us to relieve us from all responsibility in this business. We understand that the endorser on the draft is quite an honorable man, and if so, we are satisfied that no honest man would take advantage of an unintentional omission to relieve himself from responsibility when no loss could eventuate to him. You will, of course, consider this letter as confidential, and not let the parties be acquainted with any anxiety on our part to compromise.

McMahon, </em>one of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, and requested him to bring suit thereon in the name of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-12\">And the plaintiffs further offered to prove by <em>Wm. H. Collins, Esq., </em>that at the time this suit was brought he was in possession of the draft in suit, and had been for several weeks before, and that he is the same counsel whose name is signed to the declaration in this cause. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stating at the same time, that he offered the whole of said offered evidence for the purpose of showing such an interest or possession in the draft or bill in suit, by the plaintiffs, at the institution of this suit, as would enable them to maintain this action in their names. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the court refused to allow the said offered evidence, or any part thereof, to be given to the jury, and excluded the same and every part thereof, to which action and refusal of the court, the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-5\">5th Exception.\u2014After the evidence stated in the aforegoing exceptions, (made a part hereof) and the evidence being closed, the plaintiffs, by their counsel, prayed the court to instruct the jury that there is evidence in this cause from which the jury may find a sufficient interest in the plaintiffs to maintain this suit, and that the defendant had notice of the protest for nonacceptance of the draft or bill in suit, on the 11th or 13th January, 1840, but the court refused to grant said instruction, and plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-6\">The verdict and judgment of the court below being in favor of the defendant, the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-7\">The cause was tried before Archer, C.

Chapee.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-16\">To Messrs. Blum &amp; Cobia, <em>Merchants, Charleston, S. C.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b20-17\">This bill of exchange was endorsed <em>by </em>the payee, the defendant in this suit, in blank, and under this blank endorsement was written, \u201c Pay to order of Messrs. <em>C. Burckmyer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>8f Co., Th. </em>Phenix.\u201d This latter endorsement appears was erased before its <em>second </em>transmission to <em>South Carolina.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The action then was brought by the appellants claiming to be the owner and holder of the bill against the payee, who had endorsed the same in blank. It was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to prove, in addition lo the signature, a presentment of the bill to the drawers, and notice to the defendant in due time of the non-acceptance; the same, it being alleged, was not accepted when presented. Besides the liability of the defendant, the plaintiffs were also to show that a suit against the endorser could be sustained in their name. In the attempt to prove all this, the bills of exception were taken, which give rise to the questions which the court is now to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">It appears by <em>the first </em>exception, that after the plaintiffs had offered the proof which it is supposed give them a right to recover, the defendant proved by the cashier of the <em>Western Bank, </em>(by which institution this bill had been negotiated) that the bill was returned to him in a letter of plaintiffs\u2019, dated 26th September, 1840; and that after receiving it, he (the witness) struck out the special endorsement thereon, signed <em>Thomas Phenix, Cashier: </em>and thereupon the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel proposed to ask <em>Phenix </em>to state the reasons which induced him to strike out said endorsement. The court refused to permit this enquiry to be made. For this refusal, the first exception was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">It is not perceived by this court that there could be any good reason for refusing to permit the enquiry to be made, unless it be, that the <em>act </em>proved on the part of the defendant was one which could not prejudice the plaintiffs. If it was of any importance in the cause to know who erased the special endorsement spoken of, surely it was but reasonable that the witness should be allowed to state when, why, and under what circumstances, the erasure was made. It might have been done by mistake; it might have been an unauthorized act.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">In regard to the <em>second, third, </em>and <em>fourth </em>exceptions, it is to be observed, that they relate either to the liability of the defendant on this bill of exchange, or to the right of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>tiffs to institute the action in their own name. During a portion of the time between the non-acceptance of the bill, and the institution of this suit, the <em>Western Bank </em>was unquestionably the owner of this instrument, and the proper plaintiff in any action to be instituted upon it. Much of the testimony to be found in these bills of exceptions was offered in order to show wh\u00e9n, and under what circumstances, the bank made a transfer of this bill of exchange to the plaintiffs. For this purpose, all that passed between the bank and the plaintiffs relative to the transfer by the former to the latter of this bill of exchange, may be offered in proof, and thus only, is the plaintiffs\u2019 title to it to be shown. Much of the testimony, and of the <em>documents, </em>are connected with the plaintiffs\u2019 chain of title, and is no more obnoxious to objection than other title papers equally <em>res inter alios acta </em>would be. <em>Barney vs. Patterson\u2019s </em>lessee, 6 <em>H. &amp; J. </em>204. And much testimony is admissible as part of the <em>res gesta, </em>in thus deriving title to the bill of exchange from a person who is no party to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">It will here be noticed that objections found to exist to some of the correspondence which was declared to be inadmissible on a former appeal in this case, (1 <em>Gill, </em>146,) were upon the <em>second </em>trial removed. A letter or other paper, offered in proof of title from one person to another, though admissible for that purpose, may be utterly inadmissible for others. It may contain statements which, if objected to by the party, who alone can insist that the whole paper be read, ought to be excluded. In the former case, each and every part of the letter was in despite of objection admitted. In this case, the whole and every part of it was rejected. For this, the plaintiffs took the three several exceptions\u2014and of this have they not a right to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">It is thought that they have, and that much of this testimony was admissible to prove the title of the plaintiffs to this bill of exchange. These are \u201c surrounding circumstances,\u201d constituting a part of the <em>res gesta, </em>which were cotemporaneous with the principal fact under consideration. The transfer of this bill by the owner of it, at a particular period, to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tiffs, or to some other person from whom they derive title, and the admissibility of them is to be determined by the judge, according to the degree of their relation to that fact, in the exercise of his sound, discretion. <em>2 Greenleaf on </em>Evidence, <em>sect. </em>108.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Much, indeed, of the testimony to be found in the bill of exceptions might have been omitted, if the defendant did not require it to be read in connection with the rest; but, in this case, the defendant selected no part or sentences as inadmissible,\u2014but the court excluded especially in the <em>fourth </em>exception the w'hole testimony, even that of <em>Phenix, </em>in relation to the delivery of the bill of exchange to <em>Mr. </em>McMahon, and that of <em>Mr. Collins, </em>in relation to his being in possession of the bill as counsel for the plaintiffs. Such evidence this court thinks, wras admissible for the purpose for which it was offered. That last spoken of was produced in order to show that the plaintiffs, by their counsel, were in possession of the bill of exchange at the time of instituting the suit; and if believed by the jury, it is thought, proved the plaintiffs to have been rightfully in possession of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The holder of a bill of exchange still has such a possession of it as will enable him to sustain an action in his own name, although he, or his agent, has left with the attorney of the plaintiffs the note, in order to bring suit thereon. <em>Phenix, </em>in delivering this instrument to <em>Mr. McMahon, </em>was the agent of the plaintiffs, and had the same in his possession, in order to make, if it could be made, a settlement with the defendant. The power to compromise, which he had, was given him by the plaintiffs, and could be derived from no other person. \u201cIf the note, after being endorsed in blank, is delivered in pledge by the payee, this will not prevent the payee from suing upon it in his own name, or again transferring it.\u201d <em>2 Greenleaf on Evidence, sect. </em>168. And see 7 <em>Greenleaf \u25a0$ Reports, 28.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">It appears by the last exception, that the plaintiffs next prayed the court to instruct the jury that there is evidence in this cause from which the jury may find a sufficient interest in the plaintiffs to maintain this suit; and that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>notice of the protest for non-acceptance of the draft or bill in suit on the eleventh or thirteenth day of January. This instruction, also, the court refused to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Upon the former appeal, 1 <em>Gill, </em>146, the court said\u2014not only that a bill payable to bearer, or payable to order, and endorsed in blank, will pass by delivery, but that the bare possession is <em>prima facia </em>evidence of title, and that possession of such a bill will entitle the holder to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Again, possession of a note endorsed in blank, will enable the party having it to maintain the action, unless <em>mala fides </em>be proved. Courts of law will never enquire whether the plaintiff sues for himself, or as trustee for another, nor into the right of possession, unless on an allegation of <em>mala fides. </em>There is, in thei4.opinion of the court, proof that the plaintiffs had an interest in this bill, which authorized them to demand the amount sued thereon, and to maintain a suit therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">With respect to the second branch of the prayer, it might have been that the jury might infer from the proof that due notice was given of the non-acceptance\u2014but it is that notice was. received on the 11th or 13th January. It appears, however, that the 12th was on Sunday\u2014and therefore, notice on the 13th of non-acceptance was in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">We think that the jury might have inferred that the defendant had due notice of the non-acceptance: of course, the court below erred in refusing to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
