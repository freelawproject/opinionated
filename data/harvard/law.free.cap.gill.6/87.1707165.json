The policy required that all persons insured, sustaining any loss or damage by fire, are forthwith to give' notice to the secretary, and as soon as possible after, to deliver in as particular, an account of their loss or damage as the nature of the case will admit of; and to produce to the Company satisfactory proof thereof. And proved, by said <em>Cassidy, </em>that said estimate contained, in his judgment and opinion, the fair and just value of the loss sustained by the plaintiff from said fire. And further proved, by said <em>Cassidy </em>and other witnesses, that in the judgment of <em>Cassidy </em>and of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>witnesses, the engine and machinery of the plaintiff, damaged by said fire, was, before such fire, worth from $3,500 to $4,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">The defendants offered to give evidence by <em>Francis H. </em>Smith, the agent of the defendants, by parol, that within two days after the fire occurred in this case, the plaintiff called at the office of the defendants, and notified said witness of the fire; that said witness informed the plaintiff that he must make out his estimate of loss; that within two or three days after said fire occurred, the said <em>Smith, </em>as agent of the defendants, examined the damage done to the property of the said plaintiff, insured by the policy in this case, and finding the damage trifling, in comparison with the sum insured by said policy, elected, in behalf of defendants, to repair said insured property, under the provisions in the policy, and notified said plaintiff of such election, and informed the plaintiff, within three days from the occurrence of said fire, that the defendants were then ready to repair said insured property within the time provided in the policy; but that if said property should be repaired before the building in which the same was to be repaired and put up, was roofed in and repaired, that said insured property, so repaired, would be liable to injury from exposure to weather, &amp;c.; and that at said interview between said plaintiff and the agent of the defendants, as also at several other interviews, it was distinctly agreed and understood between them, that for the benefit of said plaintiff, and to preserve his property from such damage by weather, &amp;c., that the time within which said insured property was to be repaired and restored, according to the provisions contained in the policy in this case, should be enlarged and extended, and the repairs and restoration of said insured property dispensed with, and postponed until the building, in which the same was located, should be repaired and made fit to receive said insured property; that in pursuance of said last mentioned agreement, said witness went on to repair said building with all possible despatch; that within three days after said fire, said witness employed <em>Wells, Miller 8f Clarke, </em>machinists, to repair said insured property, who took said properly in charge; and that as soon as said building was roofed in and repaired, said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>insured property was repaired, and put in as good order and condition as it was before the said fire: and tendered the plaintiff by the following letter:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">\n<em>Agency Franklin Fire Insurance Co.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqN\"><em>Baltimore, 1th October, </em>1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">Alexander Hamill, Esa.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\"><em>Dear </em>Sir,\u2014I have to inform you that the engine and plaster mill 'insured for you in this office, which was lately damaged by fire, is now in complete repair and ready for you.

The witness also stated, that the defendants had a policy on the said house at the time of the fire, and elected to repair the same. The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>further offered in evidence by <em>Wm. C. </em>Neale, that he was at the time of said fire, clerk for the defendants; and that he, the witness, was present at frequent conversations at different times, between the plaintiff and <em>Mr. </em>Smith, the agent of the defendants, one of which occurred the day after the fire\u2014in which it was agreed and understood between said plaintiff and said agent, that the time limited in the policy in this case, for the repairs and restoration of the property insured by the policy of insurance in this case, should be enlarged and extended; and that said repairs and restoration of said insured property should be postponed, until after the roofing in and repairing the building in which said insured property was located; that the defendants were ready at any time after said fire occurred to repair said insured property, and offered the plaintiff to repair said property in the presence of the witness, which offer said plaintiff declined, and preferred that said property should not be repaired and restored until after the building, in which the same was located, should be roofed in and repaired; and that in consequence of said arrangement, said insured property was not repaired within the time limited in the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">The defendants further offered in evidence by <em>Wells </em>and <em>Thomas J. </em>Matthews, practical machinists, that they were employed by the defendants to repair the steam engine and machinery, which was the subject matter of insurance in this case; that said insured property was put into the hands of said witnesses for repairs, within two or three days after the fire occurred, and they commenced said repairs forthwith, and prosecuted the same, from time to time, as their convenience permitted; that they did not hurry the execution of the said repairs, because they were informed by the agent of the defendants, that there was no need of hurry, and that said repairs were fully finished and completed, and put in as good order and condition as the said insured property was before said fire occurred, (if not in better condition,) by the 3d October, 1842; and that the whole cost of said repairs was $350, which was' paid by defendants; that said plaintiff was notified, by letter from the said agent of said defendants, dated 7th October, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>1842, that said insured property was ready for said plaintiff. The said witness of defendants also stated upon cross-examination, that he had no recollection that after the said estimate of loss was left with the defendants on the 18th July, 1842, as aforesaid, any other conversation was had between plaintiff and said <em>Smith, </em>in relation to any agreement to waive the time for repairing said insured property, as such time is limited by the policy, and by said witness, as well as by said <em>Smith; </em>that after <em>Mr. Glenn, </em>as the attorney of the plaintiff, demanded payment of said loss, on the 20th August, no understanding or agreement was had between plaintiff and defendants, in regard to any such waiver, but neither of said witnesses ever heard from plaintiff within thirty days after notice of loss as aforesaid, that he would not waive said time for such repairs. And the plaintiff gave in evidence that he consulted said <em>Glenn, </em>as counsel, in relation to said claim, and that under the advice of said <em>Glenn, </em>said estimate of loss was made out and left with the defendants\u2019 said agent, so as to authorize plaintiff to recover the amount of said loss, after the end of thirty days from the leaving of said estimate with the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIY\">The defendants also gave in evidence, that notwithstanding the leaving of such estimate of loss, and the demand of payment by said <em>Glenn, </em>as attorney of plaintiff, on the 18th July and 20th August, 1842, respectively, the defendants, nor said <em>Smith, </em>did not proceed to repair said loss within thirty days from either period, although the same could have been repaired at any time within ten days; nor did he, they or said agent, then direct said <em>Wells, Miller fy Clarke, </em>to make such repairs with practical expedition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">The plaintiff further gave in evidence, that said insured property was not fully repaired, but stood in need of some $30 or $40 of additional work, in order to place the same in working condition, and that the same was, after being repaired as aforesaid, sold at public auction under a distress for two .quarters rent due by the plaintiff, one-half of which accrued after said fire, and brought the sum of $240.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">1st. \u201c That the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of damage he actually sustained by the fire, which occurred on the 20th July, 1842, if the jury believe that his loss was not repaired by the defendants within the time stated in the policy, and has not since been paid, and that no parol evidence is admissible to shew that said <em>Hamill </em>consented, in opposition to the terms of said policy, to allow such repairs to be made at any time after the period specified in such policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">2d. \u201c That even if such parol evidence were admissible, that the delivery to said defendants of an estimate of loss, the demand of payment and institution of suit was a rescission of such arrangement, and unless defendants repaired or paid as aforesaid, within thirty days after such rescission, plaintiff is entitled to recover for the actual loss sustained by him by said fire.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">The defendants prayed the court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">1st. \u201cThat the testimony of <em>F. II. Smith </em>and <em>W.

J.,) granted the plaintiff\u2019s <em>first </em>prayer, but refused the <em>second, </em>and refused <em>all </em>the defendants\u2019 prayers; to which granting of the plaintiff\u2019s <em>first </em>prayer, and refusing to grant the defendants\u2019 prayers, the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">The defendants below prosecuted this appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b102-8\">The cause was argued before Dorsey, Chambers, Magruder and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-9\">By Teacicle and McMahon for the appellants, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-10\">By Meredith and Reverdy Johnson for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b102-11\">Martin, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqS\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">In this case, an action of covenant was instituted by the appellee against the appellants, on a policy of insurance against loss by fire, executed by the <em>Insurance Company, </em>on the 14th May, 1842.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The defendant pleaded <em>non infregit conventionem, </em>to which was annexed the following agreement, signed by the counsel in the cause:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">\u201c All errors in pleading are released, and any matter may be given in evidence under the above plea, which might be given in evidence under any other plea or <em>pleas\u2014provided, </em>notice in writing of the substance of such defence be given four weeks before the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">It does not appear from the record that notice in writing was given by the defendants, of the defence on which they intended to rely as required by the agreement, and the case stands on the plea of <em>non infregit conventionem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>In this condition of the pleadings, it is clear that the parol agreement for the extension of the time, within which the property might be repaired by the <em>Insurance </em>Company, according to the stipulations of the policy, was inadmissible, as there was no plea to which it could be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The court, therefore, committed no error in rejecting the defendants\u2019 <em>first, second </em>and <em>third </em>prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The court below were also correct in rejecting the defendants\u2019 fourth prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In a contract of indemnity, like the one under consideration, the right to recover must be commensurate with the loss actually sustained by the plaintiff, and any evidence conducing to show that the damage consequent upon the fire was less than that claimed by the plaintiff, would be admissible; but the doctrine relative to the mitigation of damages, has no application to a case of this description.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The plaintiff, in his first prayer, asked the court to instruct the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\u201c That he is entitled to recover the amount of damage he actually sustained by the fire, which occurred on the 20th July, 1842, if the jury believe that his loss was not repaired by the defendants within the time stated in the policy, and has not since been paid; and that no parol evidence is admissible to show that said <em>Hamill </em>consented, in opposition to the terms of the said policy, to allow such repairs to be made at any time after the period specified in said policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">By the <em>eighth </em>article of the policy, it is stipulated:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">\u201c That all persons assured by the Company, sustaining any loss or damage by fire, are forthwith to give notice to the secretary, and as soon as possible after, deliver in as particular an account of their loss or damage, as the nature of the case will admit of, and to produce to the Company satisfactory proof thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">It is evident that the plaintiff in this case was not entitled to recover, unless he proved that the property insured was destroyed by fire; and, that notice of the loss was given, and an estimate of the damage sustained, furnished to the Company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>as required by the eighth article of the policy of insurance. And, although the court were correct in deciding that the parol agreement was inadmissible under the pleadings in the cause; yet, they erred, we think, in granting the prayer, because, by so doing, they assumed as facts, questions which should have been submitted to the consideration of the jury. The cases of <em>Crawford vs. </em>Berry, 6 <em>G. &amp; J. </em>71, and the <em>Charleston Insurance Company vs. </em>Corner, are conclusive on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In the last case, the court says:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u201c The first and second instructions are, in effect, an assertion by the court, that the <em>Eliza Davidson </em>was captured and detained by the Pearl, and in the third instruction, that the <em>Corrientes </em>was blockaded on and after the ship\u2019s release at <em>Montevideo. </em>Doubtless, tbe jury would have found these facts according to the testimony, but the sufficiency of evidence to satisfy the jury, or the circumstance, that it is all on one side, does not authorize the court to instruct the jury, that it proves the fact. They have the power to refuse their credit, and no action of the court should control the exercise of their admitted right to weigh the credibility of evidence. In thus incautiously expressing their opinion, the court erred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">It is apparent from an examination of this prayer, that the court, by instructing the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, assumed the fact, that a fire occurred on the day mentioned in the prayer, and also, that notice of the disaster was forthwith communicated to the secretary of the Company, and a particular account of the loss or damage sustained by the plaintiff, delivered as soon as possible after the fire, in conformity with the stipulations of the contract. These were questions for the consideration of the jury, and the court erred in granting the prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The judgment of the County Court, is, therefore, reversed. But, we desire to be understood, as expressing no opinion on the question, whether the parol agreement offered in evidence by the defendants, would have been admissible in a different condition of the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
