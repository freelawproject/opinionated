Such an objection might come from a purchaser, who is alone injured by it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b216-6\">Where a defendant, whose title is decreed to be sold, knows of any fact which would disperse a cloud on the title decreed to be sold, and omits to communicate it to the trustee in due time, it does not become him, when a sale has been made, to interpose it as an objection to the ratification of sale against purchasers.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b216-7\">When a sale is objected do on the ground of inadequacy of price, which may be traced to doubts, about the tjtle, it becomes material to inquire, whether the trustee might not, by reasonable efforts, have removed the cloud.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b216-8\">Where, from the nature of the doubt, no diligence on the part of the trustee could remove it, he May proceed to a sale, and the parties may refer its solution to the judgment of the court '</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b216-9\">Where a sale reported was-of a private sale, made for a much larger sum than could be obtained at an offer at public sale, duly made by a trustee, inadequacy of price is no objection to the private sale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b216-10\">An event which happens subsequent to a reported sale, and which, in the opinion of many persons, has enhanced the value of the property sold, ought not to affect such reported sale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b216-11\">In <em>Andrews vs. </em>Scotton, 2 <em>Bland, </em>643, it was decided, \u201c that if a trustee directed to sell by decree at a public sale, sell, at private sale, the sale will be confirmed, if satisfactory reasons are given for so doing, and <em>no objection is \u2022made.\u201d </em>These latter words mean <em>objections of sufficient force, </em>to outweigh the reasons given by the trustee for deviating from the terms of the decree.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b216-12\">Where a trustee^id not undertake to sell at private sale until a fruitless effort had been made at public sale, according to the terms of the decree, and even after such failure kept the property in the market by advertisements offering it at private sale, and procured a greater price at private than he had been offered at public sale\u2014the court will <em>not </em>consider his conduct a substantia] deviation from the decree, but only one offered from necessity.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b216-13\">Chancery will ratify an act when done, which upon a previous application, would have been ordered.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b216-14\">Whilst the Chancellor would consider it his duty to vacate sales made by officers of his appointment, under the influence of error, fraud, misrepresentation, or injurious mistake, still it would be fatal policy to be astute in finding out objections to them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b216-15\">Where a trustee\u2019s bond is not stamped, but was filed and approved by the Chancellor, and the trustee proceeded to make <em>the sale as </em>decreed\u2014this is not a ground for vacating the sale; but the Chancellor, on application, will require the trustee to file a new bond.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Appeal from the Court of Chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\">The bill was filed on the 6th December, 1842, by <em>Robert J\\t.

It, amongst other things, stated that <em>Cunningham, </em>in his life-time, on the 21st October, 1835, conveyed to <em>Henry Wayman, </em>(one of the defendants,) certain of his lands in trust; but that said trustee has altogether neglected and refused to execute the trust, or sell the property conveyed to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-6\"><em>Wayman, </em>by his answer, admito ce to him in trust as stated; but averred \u201cj^nat Id the land, and no uld have because he was unable to obta| one interested in the same has been a sacrifice of it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATvK\">The answers of the other defeiJ^ah^^'imma^e\u00edfal. A commission was issued to take testinoftte^JHSfeir which the complainants proved their case. And a decree was passed on the 13th April, 1846, \u201cthat the real estate of <em>James Cunningham, </em>deceased, in the proceedings mentioned, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the payment of his debts, be sold; that <em>George Schley, </em>of <em>Washington </em>County, be appointed trustee to make such sale, whose course and manner of proceeding shall be as follows,\u201d &amp;c. The trustee bonded accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-12\">On the 17th June, 1847, the trustee reported, after giving notice of the time, place, manner and terms of sale, \u201c by advertisement in the \u2018 <em>Jllleganian </em>and Civilian\u2019 \u201d newspapers, printed at <em>Cumberland; </em>the \u201c Torchlight,\u201d a newspaper printed at <em>Hagerstown, </em>and the \u201c Patriot,\u201d a newspaper printed at <em>Baltimore, </em>for more than three successive weeks before the day of sale; he did, pursuant to said notice, attend at <em>Cumberland </em>on Tuesday, the 8th September, 1846, and proceed to offer said real estate for sale; that he was notified of a claim of title to <em>\u201cLatent Worth,\u201d </em>one of the tracts of land embraced by the decree, arising by virtue of a purchase of the same at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>collector\u2019s sale; that he then received, as a bid for the same, the sum of five cents per acre; and that all efforts, at an advance upon said bid, failing, your trustee refused to sell; that the sum of six cents per acre was offered for \u201c <em>Glen Eyry\u201d </em>and the sum of twenty-six cents per acre for another tract, called <em>\u201cMuddy </em>Creek,\u201d and that no advance could be had upon said bids; that your trustee refused to sell at the prices aforesaid, and shortly thereafter offered said lands for sale <em>at private sale, </em>by advertisement in the \u201c <em>Civilian </em>and Jllleganian,\u201d two papers printed at <em>Cumberland; </em>that although said advertisement has been continued in said papers from the period aforesaid to the date of this report, your trustee has received but one proposal for a purchase, which he has accepted by entering into a written contract, herewith filed, with the purchaser, from which it will appear that he has sold the right, title, interest and estate of <em>James Cunningham, </em>deceased, in and to the lands mentioned therein, to <em>Jacob Markell, </em>of <em>Frederick, </em>for the gross sum of $3,000\u2014said sum to be paid in cash upon the purchaser being notified by the trustee of the final ratification of this sale; that said <em>Markell </em>is a man of means, and able to meet his engagement to pay at the time stipulated. The trustee reported briefly, the reasons that induced him to sell so large a number of acres for nominally so small a sum. \u201c He found that he could not sell by the acre, unless he would undertake to have the land surveyed, as the present purchaser refused to be governed by the number of acres expressed in the patents, he having been informed that the area of the said land had been ascertained by calculations based upon reference lines, and not from actual measurement of the land by a survey of the same. The expense of the survey of so large a body of land, in a county thinly settled, forbade this mode of ascertaining the true quantity of land\u2014your trustee having been informed by a practical surveyor that it would cost $600 or $800. The claim of title to \u201c <em>Latent </em>Worth\u201d added another impediment to a sale by the acre. The rough and rugged character of these lands, embracing within their area, mountains\u2014their distance from any market\u2014their great length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>and poverty of breadth, winding for miles among elder tracts\u2014 their present trifling intrinsic, and their very doubtful prospective value, all combined to bring the mind of your trustee to the conclusion, that he could not effect a better sale, and he accordingly concluded the sale now reported. The trustee further reported, that at the time of advertising said sale, he gave notice to the creditors of said <em>James Cunningham, </em>deceased, to file their claims, with the vouchers thereof, in,, &amp;c. within four months from the day of sale, and he exhibits, as part of this report, a copy of the first said notice of sale, marked T. R. No. 1; also a copy of the said second notice of sale, that with a view of placing all the facts which have come to his knowledge before the Chancellor, he reports that on the 22d December, 1846, a certain <em>Henry Wayman, </em>one of the parties to the bill filed in this cause, and a creditor, as he alleges, of said <em>Cunningham, </em>deceased, wrote to your trustee, stating that he had received a letter from <em>Duff Green, </em>of <em>Washington </em>City, inquiring about the lands embraced by the decree in this cause, as he wished to purchase them for a <em>JYorthern Company, </em>and to know the lowest price for them; that he, the said <em>Wayman </em>had answered his letter, and fixed the price at fifty cents, which he thought had better be taken, if such a sale could be made by the trustee, or the writer. To this letter your trustee replied, expressing his readiness to receive and consider any proposition for a purchase from said Green, and desiring <em>Mr. Wayman </em>to so state to <em>Mr. Green; </em>from that time until the 24th May, 1847, nothing was heard from said <em>Wayman </em>or <em>Green. </em>On said day, your trustee received the letter, herewith exhibited, marked T. R. No. 3, and filed as part of this report; also subsequently the letter, herewith filed, marked T. R. No. 4; all which is respectfully submitted to the consideration, and for the further order of the Chancellor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">\n<em>Contract of sale filed by Trustee.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">\u201cArticles of agreement made this 15th May, 1847, by and between <em>George Schley, </em>trustee for the sale of certain parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>of the real estate of <em>James Cunningham, </em>deceased, of the one part, and <em>Jacob Markell, </em>of the other part.

Because the public were not properly advised of the title in the property thus sold, which the trustee had the power to sell. The trustee does not state in any of his advertisements the names of the parties to the suit in Chancery, or the date of the decree,\u2014and as various deeds were executed by <em>James </em>Cunningham, and the trustee lived remote from the land, proper information could not be readily obtained, and especially as it did not appear by the said advertisements that the titles of your petitioner and <em>Richard G.

Whereas, by the proceedings, it does appear that <em>Cunningham, </em>had conveyed all this land, by deed of trust in his life-time, to your petitioner\u2014the original of which deed is herewith filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-11\">2d. Because the trustee did not, in fact, sell all the interest of the parties, as by the decree he was bound to do, but sold only the interest and title of which <em>James Cunningham </em>died seized, as will appear by his report, and the contract of sale, exhibited with his report, and his letter to this petitioner, herewith filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-12\">3d. Because there was alleged to be an outstanding tax-title in some purchaser under the tax laws, which title your petitioner found, on consulting an attorney, was so defective as to be worthless; yet to prevent any supposed injury which a tax-title might cause in the contemplated sale, your petitioner had a legal tender of the taxes, and the premium and costs made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>due time and according to law, so as to entitle him to redeem the same, if it had been regularly sold, which tender was refused by the said tax purchaser, whereby your petitioner is advised that the right of the said tax purchaser, if any he had, was released, and the title became re-invested in the former owners, which information, in relation to the tender, &amp;c. as above stated, this petitioner believes was unknown to the said trustee at the time of the sale, as will appear by the papers herewith filed, and which he intended to commmunicate before the sale thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">4th. Because this petitioner, by reason of the facilities afforded him, having for a long time been negotiating for the sale of this property, as he thought he had a right to do, with the approbation of the trustee, did, before the sale made by the trustee reported, actually contract for the sale of this land, at the rale of fifty cents an acre, for the quantity as called for by the patents, without survey, containing by the estimate about sixteen thousand acres\u2014to <em>Benjamin E. Green </em>and <em>Duff Green, </em>or one of them; the cash to be paid at the ratification of the sale and the delivery of the deed, deducting therefrom five per cent, allowed the said <em>Duff Green </em>for making the sale thereof, as will appear by Exhibits H. W. Nos. 5, &amp;c. and making the purchase money nearly $8,000, (all of which he thought he was doing with the approbation of the trustee,) whereas the trustee\u2019s sale was for only $3,000; that immediately on the communication of these terms of sale by Green, this petitioner made the same known to the said trustee, as he had done during the previous negotiations, and was surprised to hear that the trustee had made sale as aforesaid, to <em>Jacob Markell </em>and others, without any previous notice to this petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">5th. Because this petitioner, in all his conversations and correspondence with the said trustee and <em>Francis Thomas, </em>one of the purchasers, and with all interested, had insisted on obtaining not less than fifty cents per acre\u2014a sum which the property is fully and fairly worth, and made the same known to all the said persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">6th. Because the said sale, as reported by the said trustee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>was a private sale, </em>made without any notice given to the public generally, or to your petitioner in particular,\u2014although your petitioner expected a public notice thereof; and although it was known to the said trustee, and to the said <em>Francis Thomas, </em>as your petitioner believes, that your petitioner was negotiating with the said <em>Green </em>for the sale of these lands, as will appear by reference to the trustee\u2019s report, and the exhibits herewith filed, marked Exhibits H. W. Nos. <em>2, </em>&amp;c.; that the court will ratify and confirm the sale, so as aforesaid made by the said <em>Henry Wayman </em>to the said <em>Duff Green, </em>after setting aside the sale, so as aforesaid reported by the said trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">7th.

Letters from <em>Green </em>to <em>George Schley; </em>all which are sufficiently adverted to in the opinion of the Chancellor in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-9\">The trustee, <em>George Schley, </em>in reply to the first objection to the ratification of his sale, stated that by reference to his report and accompanying vouchers, it will appear that the sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>land of <em>James Cunningham, </em>deceased, was advertised in four newspapers; two in the county where the lands were situate, one in <em>Washington </em>County, and one in the City of <em>Baltimore. </em>The trustee deemed the notice of sale sufficiently diffused by the extended circulation of these papers. The advertisement offered for sale the real estate, (or so much thereof as might be necessary for the payment of debts,) of which <em>James Cunningham </em>died seized and possessed, situate in <em>Allegany </em>C ounty. The decree directed, that the real estate of <em>James Cunningham, </em>deceased, in the proceedings mentioned, or so much thereof as might be necessary for the payment of his debts, should be sold. It will be perceived that the advertisement is <em>uad </em>idem\u201d with the decree, and in compliance therewith, your trustee admits that the idea that it was necessary for him to state in his advertisement the names of the parties to the suit, and the date of the decree, has never been diffused as widely as his notice of said sale. The novelty of the objection attracted the attention of this respondent to the various notices of sale, under decrees of the High Court of Chancery, to be found in the <em>Baltmiore </em>papers; and in no instance has. he been able to find the names of the parties, and the date of the decree stated. Upon consultation with some of the oldest practitioners in said court, he discovered that the idea aforesaid was as novel to them, as it confessedly is to this respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\"><em>2d </em>Objection.\u2014In reference to this objection, the trustee states now, \u25a0 as already stated in his report, that objection was made by the purchaser to your trustee determining the number of acres of land by the number expressed in the patents, and that further difficulty was made, because of the cloud hanging over the title, by reason of the claim of title under a sale made by the collector of taxes of <em>Allegany </em>County. To guard against all difficulty, either as to title, or number of acres, your trustee proposed to sell <em>Cunninghani's </em>interest, as contra-distinguished from any claim of title to be asserted by strangers, or abatement of price, to be claimed because of deficiency of number of acres, conceiving that he was in this mode selling all he was authorized by said decree to sell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>most beneficially for said estate; and the purchaser being all the while under the impression, that he was buying all that said decree authorized to be sold. In making the sale in the mode he did, your trustee was governed, in great measure, by the suggestions of an experienced and distinguished solicitor, as will appear by the letter, herewith filed, marked G. S. No. 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">3d Objection.\u2014The facts set forth in this objection are novel to the trustee, except that he had heard that one or more attorneys had pronounced said sale defective.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">4th Objection.\u2014Your trustee most positively and emphatically denies any communication on the part of <em>Mr. Wayman, </em>of a sale made by said <em>Wayman </em>to <em>Oreen, until after your trustee had made the sale reported by </em>him,\u2014and he herewith exhibits, as part of this answer, the only letter he received from said <em>Wayman </em>prior to said sale, on the subject of a purchase by said <em>Green </em>of said lands. Your trustee also exhibits, as part of this, his answer, a letter from said Wayman, which sufficiently explains why the trustee was ignorant of the oifer of <em>Green, </em>until it was too late to accept it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">5th Objection.\u2014Your trustee has answered this objection in his report, and he refers your Honor to it, as containing his views of the value of said lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">6th Objection.\u2014In answer to this objection, your trustee refers to the printed notices of <em>private sale </em>accompanying his report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">The said trustee, further answering, says that the said sale was made by him under the belief at the time, that it was the highest price he could get for the lands, <em>after having in vain tried to sell at public sale, and after having advertised them for months in the newspapers at private sale, without an offer.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">That the said sale was, as far as he was concerned, a fair and <em>bona fide </em>sale, and one that he supposed at the time he made it, would be regarded and treated by this court as binding and obligatory on all the parties as if it had been made under the hammer, when he first offered the property at public sale. If, however, he is mistaken in this, and the said sale should be set aside, he will then proceed to offer the said land for sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>again, in such manner as this Honorable Court shall order and direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">The objections to the ratification of the sale were further answered in detail by <em>Jacob Markell </em>and <em>Francis Thomas, </em>parties interested in the purchase. They filed a large number of letters, to which no further notice need be paid than what is contained in the Chancellor\u2019s opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">The letters were all admitted to be originals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">The exceptions to the sale having been heard, the Chancellor, (Johnson,) on the 10th September, 1847, delivered the following opinion:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">On the 6th December, 1842, a creditor\u2019s bill was filed in this court by <em>Gibbes and others, </em>as the executors of <em>Robert Oliver, </em>the administrators of <em>Horatio McPherson, </em>and the administrators of <em>John McPherson, </em>against the heirs of <em>James Cunningham, </em>who died in November, 1835, for the sale of his real estate, the personal being insufficient to pay his debts. The said real estate was stated in the bill to consist of a tract called <em>\u201cGlen Eyry,\u201d </em>a tract called <em>\u201cLatent Worth,\u201d </em>and a tract called <em>\u201cMuddy Creek,\u201d </em>lying in <em>Allegany </em>County in this State; one other tract called <em>\u201cCheviot Dale,\u201d </em>and other parcels of land in this State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-9\">It was alleged in the bill, that <em>Cunningham </em>in his life-time had executed a mortgage of a portion of his lands to <em>Henry Wayman </em>and <em>Richard G. </em>Stockett; but of what portion, or for what purpose, the complainants did not know. That on the 21st October, in the year 1835, he, <em>Cunningham </em>and wife, executed a deed of trust to the said <em>Wayman, </em>but that the trustee had neglected and refused to execute the trusts in any manner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-10\">The heirs of <em>Cunningham, </em>his personal representatives, and <em>Stockett </em>and <em>Wayman, </em>were made parties defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-11\">The deed from <em>Cunningham </em>and wife to <em>Wayman, </em>conveys to the latter the before mentioned tracts of land, lying in <em>Allegany </em>County, of which <em>\u201cLatent </em>Worth\u201d is said <em>to contain </em>ten thousand seven hundred and sixty-one acres, more or less; \u201c <em>Glen Eyry\u201d </em>four thousand six hundred and twenty-four acres; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>and <em>\u201cMuddy </em>Creek\u201d five hundred and sixty-five acres, more or less; and the trusts are, that <em>Wayman </em>and his heirs may raise by a sale of the property as much money as will pay the debts for which he is liable as the surety of Cunningham, in the first place\u2014then to reimburse him for such sums as he may advance for the said Cunningham.\u2014then to pay such other debts as the said <em>Wayman </em>may consider just and equitable\u2014then to pay the expenses of the trust\u2014and lastly, to pay over the surplus to the grantor, his heirs, executors or assigns.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\">Upon this bill, the Chancellor, on the 13th April, 1846, passed a decree, directing that the real estate of <em>James Cunningham, </em>deceased, in the proceedings mentioned, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the payment of his debts, be sold, and appointing <em>George Schley, </em>of <em>Washington </em>County, trustee, to make the sale. This decree is in common form, first requiring the trustee to give bond, and then to sell, after giving three weeks notice of the sale, as usual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-6\">The trustee gave the prescribed bond, which is dated on the 29th April, 1846; but which was not filed and approved until the 7th of the then following July.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\">On the 17th June last, the trustee\u2019s report of his proceedings under the decree was filed. In this it is stated, that having bonded as required by the decree, and having advertised the said lands for sale as therein required, in two newspapers in <em>Cumberland, </em>one in <em>Hagerstown, </em>and one in <em>Baltimore, </em>he attended, pursuant to the notice, at <em>Cumberland, </em>on the 8th September, 1846, and offered the lands for sale; that he was then notified of a claim of title to <em>\u201cLatent Worth,\u201d </em>growing out of a sale of the same by the collector; that the highest bid he could get for said tract was <em>Jive </em>cents per acre. For <em>\u201cGlen Eyry\u201d </em>but <em>six </em>cents was bid, and for <em>\u201cMuddy </em>Creek\u201d <em>twenty-six </em>cents per acre was the best bid, which bids the trustees refused to take, and consequently, no sale was made at that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-8\">That shortly afterwards, he re-advertised the land in the two <em>Cumberland </em>papers, to be sold at private sale, and although the advertisement had been continued from that period to the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>of the report, but one proposal had been made for a purchase, which the trustee accepted by entering into a written contract with the purchaser, filed with the report, from which it will appear that he had sold the right and estate of <em>James Cunningham, </em>deceased, in the lands, to <em>Jacob Markell, </em>for the gross sum of $3,000, to be paid in cash, upon the purchaser being notified by the trustee of the final ratification of the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\">The trustee then proceeds to state in detail the reasons which induced him to sell so large a number of acres, for nominally so small a sum, which reasons were satisfactory to his mind, conducting him to the conclusion that he could not effect a better sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">The trustee further states, that on the 22d December, 1846, the defendant, <em>Wayman, </em>wrote him, stating that he had received a letter from a certain <em>Duff Green, </em>of <em>Washington </em>City, enquiring about these lands, as he wished to purchase them for a Northern Company, and to know the lowest price for them; that <em>Wayman, </em>in answering the letter, had fixed the price at <em>fifty </em>cents, which he thought had better be taken, if such a sale could be made by the trustee or the writer; that the trustee replied, expressing his readiness to receive and consider any proposition for a purchase from said <em>Green, </em>and desiring <em>Way-man </em>so to say to <em>Green; </em>but from that time to the 24th May, 1847, nothing was heard from either <em>Wayman </em>or Green\u2014that on that day, he received a letter from <em>Benya. E. Green, </em>marked T. R. No. 3, and filed with the report\u2014and afterwards another letter from <em>Duff Green, </em>dated the 10th June, 1847, also filed, marked T. R. No. 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">The agreement between the trustee and <em>Markell, </em>signed and sealed by them referred to, and filed with the report, is dated the <em>15th May, </em>1847, and states that <em>Schley </em>agrees to sell to <em>Markell, </em>all the estate, right, title and interest of the said <em>James Cunningham, </em>deceased, of, in and to the said lands, viz: <em>uGlen </em>Eyry,\u201d \u201c <em>Latent </em>Worth\u201d and <em>\u201c Muddy Creek,v </em>for the sum of $3,000\u2014the sale to be subject to the approval of the court, and the money to be be paid upon the ratification\u2014the interest, right, title and estate of <em>Cunningham </em>to be conveyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>by the trustee upon the payment of the purchase money, as stipulated by <em>Markell; </em>and then by way of further description of the lands sold, and not as a guarantee of their area or contents, it is stated in the contract that they are supposed to contain the quantity of acres already mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">In the trustee\u2019s advertisement of the public sale, to take place on the 8lh September, 1846, he says, that by virtue of a decree of the High Court of Chancery of Maryland, I will offer at public sale in Cumberland, on Tuesday, the 8th September next, between the hours of 10 A. M. and 4 P. M. the following valuable real estate, (or so much thereof as may be necessary for the payment of debts,) of which <em>Janies Cunningham </em>died seized and possessed. The lands are then described as lying west of Cumberland, at no great distance from the <em>Western </em>or <em>JYational </em>Road, and form a portion of that country, usually styled \u201c <em>The </em>Glades,\u201d and by their names and the number of acres already stated, as being contained in each tract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-6\">Purchasers are then invited to call on <em>Mr. William Cun</em>ningham, who is stated to reside thereon, who will shew the lands; and the terms of sale, as prescribed by the decree, are then given, to wit: one-third cash on the day of sale, or its ratification, and the residue in one and two years from the day of sale; and upon these terms, they are advertised to be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-7\">This advertisement appeared for the first time in the <em>Hagerstown </em>paper, on the 10th August, 1846, and from thence it was copied into other papers, as therein directed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-8\">In the advertisement of the private sale, which appeared in the <em>Cumberland </em>papers for the first time on the 10th November, 1846, the same description is given of the lands, and it corresponds, in all respects, with the previous advertisement, except that the trustee says he will offer the lands at private sale, having failed to sell at public sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-9\">On the 28th June, 1847, <em>Henry Wayman </em>and the heirs of <em>James </em>Cunningham, filed exceptions to the ratification of the sale reported by the trustee upon various grounds; and upon the same day an order was passed, fixing the first day of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>present month for the hearing. Upon notice being served upon the parties in interest and upon the trustee, the trustee and two of the parties, to wit: <em>Markell, </em>the purchaser, and <em>Francis </em>Thomas, who it appears was concerned in the purchase, have answered, and a correspondence, to some extent, between the several persons concerned, and the trustee, has been filed, and upon the said exceptions and answers, and this correspondence, the case has been argued. The letters are admitted to be genuine, and to have the same effect as if regularly proved under an order; but facts affirmed in these letters are not admitted by the purchasers, and are excepted to. It would occupy too much space to recapitulate the facts and averments contained in the answers to the exceptions and the correspondence. The Chancellor has read the papers with the utmost care, and will, in the observations he is about to make upon the exceptions to the sale, state the result to which his mind has been brought, by a deliberate consideration of the whole case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">The first objection taken to the sale is, that the public were not properly advised of the title in the property thus sold, which the trustee had the power to sell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">This objection rests upon the supposition, that the trustee should have stated in his advertisement the names of the parties to the suit in wnich the decree passed, and the several deeds creating incumbrances upon the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">The decree, it will be recollected, directs that the real estate of <em>James </em>Cunningham, deceased, in the proceedings mentioned, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay his debts, be sold. It does not say in terms, that the title of the parties to the suit shall be sold, though no doubt a sale under the decree would pass such title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-8\">The language of the advertisement is:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-9\">By virtue of a decree of the High Court of Chancery, there will be sold certain real estate, naming the tracts, and giving their locality, of which <em>James Cunningham </em>died seized and possessed. It does not say his title alone will be sold, but the lands of which he died seized and possessed. The public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>was notified by this advertisement that these lands were to be sold under a Chancery decree, to which decree, of course, there must be parties; and I am of opinion, that in the absence of evidence, that competition in the purchase was prevented by the character of the advertisement, or that the sale was, in any respect prejudiced thereby. It seems to me it should not on this account be vacated. A reference to the Chancery proceedings, to which the public was directed, would have shown who were the parties, and what title was to be sold. The trustee\u2019s advertisement referred to the fountain of his authority\u2014described the lands to be sold by name and locality, and gave such other information respecting them as would enable persons disposed to purchase to ascertain all that it was material they should be informed of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">The Chancellor does not think, from an examination of the forms of advertisements of Chancery sales usually employed, that such precision as is insisted upon by the counsel for the parties objecting to this sale, has been supposed to be necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">The second objection is, that the trustee did not, in fact, sell the interest of the parties to the suit, but only the interest and title of which <em>James Cunningham </em>died seized.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">The purchasers, in their answers to these exceptions, take a different view of the matter; but conceding that this exception states truly the nature and extent of the interest purchased by <em>Markell, </em>still this seems to be an objection, which only the purchasers themselves could take, as they, and they alone, are Injured by it. Besides, it may not be unworthy of remark, that the sale reported by the trustee disposed of precisely that interest in the lands of which <em>Cunningham </em>died seized; and the answer of <em>Wayman </em>to the bill under which they were sold states, \u201cthat he died seized in fee of the several tracts of lands named and described in the bill of complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-8\">The third objection has reference to the cloud upon the title, which, it is supposed, might readily have been removed; but which the trustee was not in a condition to remove, by reason of his ignorance of facts, known to Wayman, one of the objectors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>This objection may, perhaps, be open to the observation, that if <em>Wayman </em>knew of any fact which would disperse the cloud which hung over the title, and omitted to communicate it to the trustee in due time, it does not become him, when a sale has been made, upon the ratification of W'hich other parties interested in the proceeds are insisting, to interpose an objection upon that ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\">It is true that when a sale is objected to upon the ground of inadequacy of price, which inadequacy may be traced to doubts about the title, it becomes material to inquire whether the trustee might not, by reasonable efforts, have removed the cloud; and if the court can see that such efforts were not used, the question whether the sale shall, or shall not be ratified, may be affected by such neglect. <em>Glenn vs. </em>Clapp, <em>11 Gill &amp; Johns. </em>1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">But from the very nature of the doubt about the title in this case, it was impossible that any diligence on the part of the trustee could remove it; the opinion of counsel might be taken upon the subject, but nothing short of the judgment of the court could solve the question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\">It appears by the proceedings that the party who purchased for taxes, asserted, and was determined to maintain, the title thus acquired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">The fourth and fifth objections are based upon an alleged inadequacy of price, and upon negotiations carried on by <em>Mr. Wayman for the </em>sale of the property, which resulted as stated, in selling at a price much higher.than the price obtained by the trustee; that inadequacy of price will not induce the court to vacate a sale, in other respects, unexceptionable, unless such inadequacy is so gross as to indicate a want of reasonable judgment and discretion in the trustee, was said by Court of Appeals in <em>Glenn vs. Clapp, </em>11 <em>Gill &amp; Johns. </em>9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-9\">It is material, therefore, to enquire whether the inadequacy of price in this case is so gross and palpable as to indicate a want of discretion and judgment on the part of the trustee. Looking to the bid made on the 8th September, 1846, when the lands were offered at public sale, as any criterion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>price which could probably be obtained for them, and the sale reported surely cannot be condemned upon the grounds of inadequacy, since the sale reported is for a much larger sum than was offered at the public bidding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">But it is said, that although the price bid at the public offer of this property, was less than the sum which <em>Markell </em>and <em>Thomas </em>proposed to pay, yet the trustee had information that negotiations were pending, if not concluded, by <em>Wayman3 </em>for a much larger sum,\u2014and that under such circumstances, the trustee should have at least communicated with <em>Mr. Wayman </em>before he made a sale. The Chancellor thinks that the reasons assigned by the trustee for proceeding as he did, are satisfactory; and, indeed, <em>Mr. Wayman </em>himself confesses, that he, and not the trustee, was remiss in not giving information at the proper time; but is there any evidence, that these lands are worth more, or that more could be obtained for them than <em>Markell </em>and <em>Thomas </em>have agreed to give? and emphatically, it may be asked, is there any evidence to show that a better price could have been had on the 15th May, 1847, the date of the sale?</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">The letter of <em>Duff Green </em>of the 19th August, 1847, with its conditions and qualifications, cannot be regarded as an offer; and yet it is the only one which has been made for the property, except such as may be found in the correspondence of the same party and his son with <em>Wayman; </em>and in the contract of the 9th June, 1847, between <em>Wayman </em>and Green, which besides containing stipulations which render it totally inadmissible, is, in effect, withdrawn by the letter of the 19th August last. In fact, though this property has been in the market, by advertisements in the newspapers, with very little intermission from August, 1846, to May, 1847, the offer of <em>Mr. Markell </em>is the only one to which any substantial character can be assigned, besides the almost nominal bid on the 8th September, 1846.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">It is true <em>Mr. </em>Wayman, by a paper filed on the 7th instant, agrees to give $4,000 for the property, on the terms reported by the trustee; but this offer, in my opinion, cannot be allowed to have much weight in determining whether the property sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>previously at a price so much below its value, as to indicate a want of reasonable judgment in the trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">It is made after an event has happened, subsequent to the reported sale, which, in the opinion of many persons, has enhanced the value of the property. The Chancellor thinks as was said by the Court of Appeals in the case of <em>Tyson vs. </em>Mickle, 2 <em>Gill, </em>384, that the validity or invalidity of the sale, must depend upon the state of circumstances existing at the time it was made. The clear equity of such a principle seems undeniable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">The sixth ground relied upon for not ratifying this sale is founded upon the manner in which it was made. It was a <em>private sale, </em>though the decree, which is in common form, directs a public one; for this deviation from the decree, it is supposed the sale must be condemned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">It is an admitted principle, that in sales made by the agency of trustees, acting under decrees of a Court of Chancery, the court is the contracting party on the one side, and the bidder on the other; the trustee being regarded as the mere agent or attorney of the court. I say this is the principle, though unlike all other contracts, one of the contracting parties is permitted to sit in judgment upon the contract, and pronounce upon its validity or invalidity. <em>Glenn vs. Clapp, </em>11 <em>Gill &amp; Johns. </em>8. 2 <em>Bland, </em>638, 639.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">The principle, however, is understood to be incontestible, and as has been conceded, in the argument. Chancellor <em>Hanson </em>has laid down the rule which should govern the court in deciding upon sales made under its authority. In the case of <em>Lawson vs. The State, </em>in 1804, he observed, \u201cthat reasons which would induce him, as proprietor or trustee, to set aside a sale made by his agent, should determine him, as Chancellor, to refuse his approbation to a sale made by a trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-9\">It was decided by the late Chancellor, that if a trustee, directed to sell at public sale, does, notwithstanding, sell at private sale, the sale will be confirmed, if satisfactory reasons are given for doing so, and no objection is made. <em>Andrews vs. Scotton, </em>2 <em>Bland, </em>643.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The counsel by whom this case has been argued, have differed as to what was meant by the Chancellor when he speaks of no objection being made; but my impression is, that he must have meant objections of sufficient force to outweigh the reasons given by the trustee for deviating from the terms of the decree; and that he could not have intended that reasons which would be satisfactory to him, in the absence of objections, should be overborne by the mere unsupported veto of any one looking to the court as the vendor, and the trustee as its agent, acting according to the terms prescribed by the former. If, for reasons deemed sufficient by the court, the agent departs from the form in which he is to exercise his authority, who could have a right, merely upon the ground of such departure, to say that the principal should not ratify the act of its agent?</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\">If the principle be sound, that the court is the vendor, and to be considered the proprietor of the thing to be sold, such a right of arbitrary interdiction on the part of any one cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\">But it is to be recollected in this case, that the trustee did not undertake to sell these lands at private sale, until a fruitless effort had been made to dispose of them according to the terms of the decree; and that even after he had failed in this effort, they were constantly kept in the market by advertisements offering them at private sale. It is not the case, therefore, of a trustee who has undertaken to depart from the terms of the authority under which he acts, without first making an effort to comply with them, but it is the case of a deviation from those terms, after an ineffectual endeavor to conform to them. It is also a circumstance very material to be considered, that the price at which the trustee had contracted to sell these lands greatly exceeds the best offer he could get for them when exposed to public sale; and another very strong recommendation of the sale made is to be found in the circumstance, that the property was never withdrawn from the public eye, but kept always before it and in the market, by advertisements in the newspapers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>In <em>Tyson vs. Mickle, 2 Gill, </em>383, a private sale made by a trustee, was confirmed by the court, though the amount of the private bid was considerably <em>less </em>than had been offered for the same property when exposed publiclyand the court in that case say, that Chancery will always ratify an act when done, which upon a previous application would have been authorized. It is true that in the case of <em>Tyson vs. Mickle, </em>the parties interested consented to the sale; but one of those parties,, and one largely interested, was a minor, and therefore incompetent to consent. Adopting the principle of the Court of Appeals, that an act when done will be ratified, which the court, if applied to beforehand, would have authorized, I am of opinion, that the objection to the act of the trustee in this case, founded upon the form of the sale, cannot prevail; and it seems to me that upon an application, setting out all that had taken place prior to the sale to <em>Mr. Markell, </em>the trustee would have been authorized to accept his offer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\">Whilst the Chancellor would consider it his duty to vacate sales made by officers of his appointment, under the influence of error, fraud, misrepresentation or injurious mistake, he nevertheless thinks that it would be a fatal policy to be astute in finding out objections to them. The impression of the court is, that they are entitled to the benefit of every fair and reasonable intendment,\u2014and that a <em>hona fide </em>purchaser is not to lose the -rights which he supposed he was acquiring when dealing with its agent upon objections founded upon the modal regulations of the sale\u2014the non-observance of which is not shown to have been injurious. <em>Marshall's lessee </em>vs. <em>Greenfield, </em>8 <em>Gill &amp; Johns. </em>349.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-7\">The 7th objection to the sale is because the trustee\u2019s bond is not upon stamped paper as required by the act of 1845, chap. 193. The law went into effect on the 1st May, 1846, and this bond, though dated on the 29th April, 1846, was not filed and approved by the Chancellor until the 7th July following.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-8\">The argument is, that the bond was of no effect until filed and approved; those acts constituting its delivery and acceptance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>By adverting to the terms of the decree, it will be found that the trustee is to proceed to make sale of the property, upon giving bond in a certain penalty, and with sureties to be approved by the Chancellor, conditioned for the faithful performance of the trust reposed in him by the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">This bond has been approved by the Chancellor, and it seems to me it would be of dangerous consequence to say, that although thus approved, the purchaser shall not get the benefit of his purchase, if the bond, for any reason, is defective.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">Few persons, I presume, would be disposed to bid at trustees\u2019 sales, if such a doctrine is to obtain. The Chancellor, for this reason, does not deem it necessary to express an opinion upon the point discussed by the counsel; but upon application to require the trustee to execute another bond, he will be prepared to do so. *</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">Upon the remaining objection, my opinion has been already expressed, and need not be repeated, and I conclude, therefore, <em>that the objections filed to the sale in this case must be </em>overruled, though in view of all the circumstances of the case, the order will direct that the parties pay their own costs respectively. I have arrived at this conclusion, after considering the case with much attention, aided by the very full and able arguments of the counsel employed in it. If my judgment is erroneous, I am gratified to know that a superior court will correct the error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\">From this decree, <em>Henry Wayman, William C. </em>Cunningham, and <em>Charles E.
