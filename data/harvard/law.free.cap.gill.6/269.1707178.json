With the rents of the real estate, and the time of the personal estate, from the death of his ward\u2019s father in 1817, to the time of his being appointed guardian, 15th April, 1818, during which time this property was in the possession of the wife of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-7\">2d.

The sums charged against the female complainant, in the account purporting to be a guardian account, passed by the Orphans court, whereas, it was no such account, and ought to have been rejected as illegal; and its charges against the female complainant, are unjust and illegal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-13\">7th. Credit for the full share of the ward\u2019s personal property, whereas it no where appears that the defendant ever distributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>or paid over any other of that property to his ward, the female complainant, than the negroes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">8th.

For raising and supporting the young negroes of the female complainant, and especially the excessive charges therefor ; and that the mode of averaging the proof of many witnesses who testify as to the same sum, as one witness, is erroneous, because such an average should be ascertained by counting, in the average, every witness who testifies thereto.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-7\">By W. H. Tuoic and Alexander for <em>F. L. Darnall and toife.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-8\"><em>Magruder and </em>wife, filed their bill against <em>Darnall </em>for an account, alleging that Elizabeth, the complainant, was one of the daughters of <em>Richard Hill, </em>deceased, who died in 1816, leaving a widow, <em>Margery, </em>(who afterwards intermarried with <em>Francis L. Darnall,) </em>and four children; that he left a large real and personal estate; and after the settlement of the estate by the executors, the said <em>Francis L. Darnall </em>was appointed guardian to the said children; took possession of the property, used it, received rents, profits, &amp;c. The bill alleges that he has never accounted <em>for his said guardianship, </em>and prays an account for his <em>said guardianship and trust, </em>and that he may set forth the amount and value of the property received by him, the names of the negroes, the annual crops, issues and profits, with his appropriations and the receipts therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-9\"><em>Darnall </em>answered the bill, in which he states that complainant is one of the children of <em>Richard Hill; </em>that he married his widow in 1818; and in 1819, <em>he and his said wife </em>were appointed guardians to the children; that by his marriage, he became one of the administrators of the deceased, whose estate was then unsettled; that many debts were due, which he went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>on to pay, without making sale of the property, in order to preserve the same for the children, and for which he has never received any credit, as administrator: the answer shews, that by direction of the <em>Orphans </em>court, the estate was valued, and believing the annual value as estimated by the commissioners to be too high for the reasons stated, he refused to take the estate at that estimate, but did agree with the court to take the estate, and support the children, and deliver the property over as they might arrive at age. The defendant avers, that he made this arrangement for the benefit of the children, and offers to enter into the most rigid account, that the court may judge between them as to the manner in which his duty has been discharged, averring at the same time, that the complainant will be largely indebted to him, if justice and equity prevail, that a division of the personal estate took place in 1823, by direction of the <em>Orphans </em>court, when thirteen negroes were allotted to the complainant, seven of whom were infant children, from two to eight years of age, and of the residue, three died in or about the year 1825, and the other three he shews to have been employed or used, or disposed of by the complainant, <em>Elizabeth. </em>They were all, however, supported by defendant, until he left the estate in 1832, except those who bad died, and <em>Tilly </em>when she was hired out. That those negroes were delivered to complainant in 1828, and have ever since been in her possession, at least up to the time of her marriage. The balance of the personal estate he left with the children, when he left the land in 1832, since which time a division has been made among them. This defendant expressly denies that he received any profit for the estate; but on the contrary avers, that it required his own private means to support the estate and family. The answer shews, that the real estate was poor and unproductive, and that after deducting his wife\u2019s third of the rents and profits, one-fourth of the balance would not pay the expense of maintaining the complainant and her negroes, from 1818 to 1832. He files with the answer an account, shewing the disbursements and payments made by him; and also an account of all crops sold and received by him, as far as they can now be ascertained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The exhibits shew the willingness of the defendant to lay before the complainant and the court, all the details and explanations of the transactions at issue between the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">The witnesses of defendants give their opinions of the value of the <em>real </em>and <em>personal </em>estate of <em>Richard </em>Hill, from the time of his death until 1832, and of the dealings of the defendant with the property. These opinions are very much at variance with the testimony on the part of the defendant, thereafter taken, which testimony, it is submitted, is sustained by the exhibits and other proof in the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-6\">The inventory of the estate of <em>Richard </em>Hill, exhibited with the complainants\u2019 bill, and filed by them under the commission amounts to \u00a712,208 87, comprising fifty-six negroes, <em>mostly \u2022women and children; 25 </em>between the ages of 1 and 10 years ; and 10 (men and women,) between the ages of 44 and 94, viz: 44, 45, 45, 60, 62, 63, 60, 68, 52, 94. Some of them, by the appraisement, shewn to have been worth nothing. The farming utensils and stock appear to have been of small value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-7\">It will be found that the witnesses exhibit a knowledge of the subject matters in controversy, for having had in many instances, personal intercourse with the defendant and the property, in the management of the estate. They place a very different estimate upon the property, and represent it as by no means so valuable as the complainant\u2019s witnesses had done. This testimony sustains the answer in many material points, and deserves consideration, as proceeding from persons who had good opportunities of becoming acquainted with the subjects of the examination; and besides being more in number, their opinions would seem to command more weight than the three witnesses of the complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-8\">Certain guardian accounts, passed by the <em>defendant and wife, </em>as guardians, to the children of <em>Richard Hill, </em>dated 8th January, 1821, also appear. <em>These accounts appear not to have been recorded in the registers office </em>until May, 1842, when it was done on the application of the defendant and wife. <em>John Tyler </em>was examined, and <em>Leonard H. Chew, </em>to shew the practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the office in respect to such accounts; the complainants insisting, that they are not to be regarded as of any validity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\">Both parties excepted to these accounts of 25th September, 3843.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6\">The defendant will rely on the points presented by his exceptions to these accounts, in bar of the complainants\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-7\">27th February, 1845, the Chancellor passed the order, ante 276, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-8\">In obedience to this order, the auditor reported accounts C, D, E, by the last of which he makes the defendant indebted to the complainant $48 06, with interest on $24 04, from date.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-9\">Both parties excepted. The Chancellor, on the 11th October, 1845, passed a final decree, ratifying and confirming account E\u2014from which both parties appealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-10\">The defendant, Darnall, will contend on his appeal, in addition to the points presented by his exceptions to the auditor\u2019s reports:</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-11\">1st. That the recovery of the complainants, if any be had, must be limited to the time of the alleged guardianship, and be confined to the particular subject matter, in respect of which the bill charges defendant, and prays an account against him; that is to say, the property acquired by the said <em>Elizabeth </em>from her father\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-12\">2d. That the auditor has improperly rejected the evidence of defendant\u2019s witnesses, in estimating the annual value of the estate of <em>Richard Hill, </em>and has placed an excessive value on said estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-13\">3d. That the auditor has not allowed a sufficient sum for the support of the complainant, <em>Elizabeth, </em>and has not allowed him for the support of her young negroes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-14\">4th. That the auditor has improperly charged defendant in respect of the property of complainant, acquired for <em>Ann Magruder^s </em>estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-15\">5th. That the account passed by the defendant and wife, as guardians, was properly admitted to record by the Orphans court, and must be regarded as the judicial act of that court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>and should have been taken by the auditor as evidence of the value of the estate, and of defendant\u2019s allowance as guardian, in stating the account for subsequent years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">6th. That the rate of commission allowed is too low under the circumstances of the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">7th. That if the account be extended beyond the direction of the guardianship, and to other matters than those expressed in the bill of complaint, the defendant wfill be entitled to a decree against the complainants, for the balance that the pleadings and proofs in the cause may shew in behalf of defendant; and it will be contended, that if such account be stated, the complainants will be largely indebted to defendants.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b293-7\">Archer, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AuQl\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The court below did not err in directing the account to be taken from the date of the bond given by <em>Darnall </em>as guardian. However <em>Darnall </em>might be responsible as bailiff, or guardian before he bonded as guardian, for an entry on the estate of the complainant, and for any perception of the rents and profits before such bonding; if it was designed to charge him in this case for such profits, it was indispensable that the entry upon the estate should have been distinctly charged. Instead of this, the whole bill is framed in reference to his duties as guardian, deriving his authority as such from his appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">It is said he was in possession when he applied to be appointed guardian, but when he took such possession, does not appear by the bill. It is afterwards averred, that being appointed guardian, he took possession of the real and personal estate. To allow an account to be taken from a period anterior to the defendant\u2019s appointment, would operate as a surprise, and as there are no allegations on the subject, we do not think the question is in issue before the court. The same remarks may be made in reference to the attempt to charge the defendant, the husband of <em>Mrs. </em>Darnall, with the perception of the profits by her, anterior to her marriage with the defendant. She was administratrix of her husband, <em>(Hill,) </em>and although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>as husband he may be responsible for her acts, she should have been made a party, and some charge should have been made in the bill, which would have given notice to the defendant of the claim, and have put in issue the perception of the profits by her; nothing is said in the bill looking to this subject, and no account was properly, therefore, taken of this matter in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In relation to the value and hire, or profits, of the personal property of the female complainant, bequeathed to her by <em>Mrs. Magruder, </em>of whose estate the defendant was executor, with which the complainant seeks to charge the defendant, it will be unnecessary for us to examine the question whether the bill is so framed as to admit of such a charge; because we think there is no proof in the cause of any value, to be attached to the use of this property, beyond its expense, and in relation to the delivery of the property itself, the release given by the ward may be relied on as evidence of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">It is urged that the defendant should be charged with the appraisement made 20th March, 1820, by authority of the Orphans Court, upon the ground that such evidence ought to be conclusive against the guardian of the value. The act of 1798, ch. 101, sub chap. 12, sec. 6, does not make it conclusive evidence. It only declares it shall be evidence against the guardian, and we think it may be rebutted by evidence. That there are inaccuracies in this appraisement is unquestionable, and there is much evidence going to show that it was an inflated valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The Chancellor was right in pronouncing that the guardian\u2019s account staled and passed by the Orphans court of <em>Prince Georges </em>County, as of the 8th January, 1821, was to be received as a judicial act of the court, and as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the matters therein contained. Evidence w\u201chich has been offered to impeach it is entirely inconclusive, and cannot form the basis' of any judgment against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">It has been urged as a <em>seventh </em>reason for the reversal of the Chancellor\u2019s decree, that the defendant ought not to have had the credit for the full share of the ward\u2019s personal property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>This point is made on a misconception of the evidence. It is proved by <em>Joseph Wilson </em>and <em>William Hill, </em>that this property was passed over to the female complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Errors have been committed in the mode of averaging the proof, in relation to the board and maintenance of the ward, and in the mode of averaging the proof in relation to the expense of maintaining and raising the young negroes; but we think that circumstance ought not to occasion the reversal of the decree, as we feel assured the evidence in the cause fully justifies the credits which have been allowed to the defendant on these accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Nor do we feel disposed to charge the defendant with more interest than he is charged with in the account which had been ratified. The whole evidence in the cause which has been carefully examined, induces us to believe that the estate in the hands of the defendant was not greater than was necessary to pay expenses, and necessary and proper to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">So far, therefore, as the appeal of <em>Magruder </em>and wife is concerned, we affirm the decree of the Chancellor, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">With regard to the appeal of <em>Darnall, </em>we think he was entitled to higher commissions. The Chancellor has allowed only five per cent, commissions. This amount of commission was allowed in <em>Diffenderffer vs. Winder, </em>notwithstanding there was such conduct on the part of the trustee, as induced the court to charge him with compound interest. This has been a trust of considerable duration, and the guardian seems to have performed his duties, except in a failure regularly to pass his accounts. He has, however, promptly answered: appears to have thrown no obstacles in the way of the investigation, and has rendered a general account. We think he is at least entitled to as great a rate of commission as was allowed in the case of <em>Hatton vs. Weems, </em>which was seven and a half per cent. Allowing to him this commission, the balance found against him by Account E, would be more than satisfied. The decree must therefore be reversed, with costs, and the bill dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">DECREE REVERSED AND BIEL DISMISSED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
