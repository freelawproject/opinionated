The note was signed by <em>N. </em>4 AT., payable to the plaintiffs, or order, and across the back of it, <em>S. </em>had written his signature in blank. The plaintiffs proved that the signature, A. 4 AT., was written by <em>S., </em>and that he was a partner of that firm. The note was given for a balance due by A. 4 At- to toe plaintiffs, upon their request, who had asked for the note endorsed by <em>S. </em>The defendant proved that he was not the partner of A. 4 Af., but their agent, and the plaintiffs knew it. The plaintiffs prayed the County Court to instruct the jury, that if they believe that the name of <em>S. </em>was written by him on the hack of the note at the time it was signed by A. 4 Af., or shortly afterwards\u2014that then the defendant, even if he were not a member of the firm of A. 4 A/, is liable in this action, and the plaintiffs entitled to recover, which was granted, and affirmed upon appeal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b189-6\">The defendant <em>S. </em>then prayed for an instruction, that if the jury should believe that the plaintiffs solicited the note from A. 4\u2019 A\u00cd., to be endorsed by <em>S., </em>and that he was authorized by A. 4 AT. to sign their names to such note, and after writing his own name on the back of said note, to send the same to the plaintiffs; and that <em>S. </em>did sign the name of A. 4 AT. to said note, and wrote his name on the back of the same as endorser, as requested by the plaintiffs,\u2014 that then the jury cannot find for the plaintiffs, as the defendant\u2019s liability is not that of a maker of said note.

The plaintiffs counted upon the promissory note of the appellant, dated 28th January, 1841, as payable on the 1st June, 1841, to the appellees, and also upon the money counts. The defendant pleaded <em>non-assumpsit and actio non infra tres annos, </em>on which pleas issues were joined.

Snyder, Jr. </em>proved that in the spring of the year, (during the fishing of 1840,) when <em>Dutton </em>and <em>Myers </em>were fishing just below the late residence of <em>Major Green, </em>and adjoining the fishery then occupied by me, <em>Myers </em>encroached on me by running or hauling his seine in my berth, and thus essentially interfering with my rights, I protested against his trespassing on me, and finding him obstinately persisting in his course, so injurious to my rights, I had a vessel anchored on the border of my fishery, to prevent a recurrence of the interference above-mentioned. The fisheries occupied by <em>Dutton Myers, </em>and myself, were immediately contiguous\u2014theirs being the next below that occupied by me. By the means thus described, <em>Myers </em>was prevented from further 'encroachments, and his progress in his fishing was partially suspended, when he found me determined not to permit him to fish in my berth. During these difficulties, a man came to me, and \u2022said his name was Sullivan,\u2014and also declared that he was one of the partners engaged in the fishery above-mentioned, with <em>Dutton Myers, </em>and that he came to endeavor to produce a reconciliation between his partner, <em>Myers, </em>and myself, which he hoped might be done without further trouble. I answered him by declaring my readiness to do in the premises whatever any two disinterested fishermen might decide to be right. I am not positive that <em>Sullivan, </em>who spoke to me, as above stated, was <em>James T. Sullivan, </em>but I know he walked a little lame, stepping rather on the <em>toes of one of his feet, </em>as if his heel did not touch the ground, and I understood then that he was <em>James T. </em>Sullivan. In his conversation with me, the said <em>S. </em>intimated that he was the only responsible partner of the above firm of <em>Dutton Myers. </em>He gave me fully to understand, that if the said firm should sustain any loss, he, <em>S., </em>must bear the burden; that he knew nothing about any contract, written or oral, between the said parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\"><em>F.

The circumstances attending the transaction, as proved at the trial, were these:</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-14\"><em>Violett Sf Dempsey </em>having a claim against <em>Dutton </em>8f <em>Myers, </em>on the 23d December, 1840, wrote to them as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-15\">\u201c Gentlemen,\u2014Annexed you will find a statement of our account against you for the rent of <em>Wright's Point Fishery, </em>shewing a balance due us, without interest, of $490, for w'hich we will be glad to receive your note, payable the 1st day of May next, or send us your draft on some merchant in <em>Baltimore, </em>accepted, payable as above-mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>On the 28th January, 1841, <em>Dutton &amp;/\u2022 Myers </em>sent to plaintiffs the note on which this suit was instituted,\u2014and at the same time wrote to them as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\">\u201c Gentlemen,\u2014Above we send you our note, payable on the 1st of June next, for the balance of your account rendered.

We have delayed sending the note, hoping that we would be able to send you some money, but have been disappointed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">And evidence was offered to prove that the above letter and note were written and sent to plaintiffs by <em>Sullivan, </em>acting as agent for <em>Dutton </em>&lt;iy- <em>Myers. </em>No proof was offered of demand on <em>D. fy M., </em>or of notice of non-payment of the note by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-7\">The above stated facts being in evidence, the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury\u2014that <em>Sullivan </em>could only be treated as an <em>endorser </em>of a negotiable nole, and as such could only be held liable, upon proof of demand on the maker, and due notice of non-payment; that the form of the note, and the position of defendant\u2019s name on it, indicate the intention to become responsible only as second endorser, endorsing for the accommodation of the plaintiffs. This is the legal inference: in this view full effect is given to defendant\u2019s signature,\u2014and there is no fact in the case from which the court could infer that he ever assumed to become liable to plaintiffs. <em>Clopper vs. Union Bank, </em>7 <em>H. &amp; J. </em>102.

Some of them drew a distinction between notes payable to <em>A. </em>or <em>bearer, </em>and these payable to <em>A. </em>or order,\u2014holding that blank signatures on the <em>former </em>by a third party, would constitute him merely an <em>endorser, </em>or the <em>latter </em>kind, a <em>joint maker. </em>See <em>Herrick vs. Carman, </em>12 <em>Johnson R. </em>159. <em>Nelson vs. Dubois, </em>13 <em>Johnson, </em>175, 178, 179. <em>Campbell vs. Butler, </em>14 <em>Johnson, </em>349, 351. <em>Tillman vs. Wheeler, </em>17 <em>Johnson, </em>326, 327, 328. <em>Seymour vs. Van Slyck, </em>8 <em>Wendell, </em>421. <em>Dean vs. Hall, </em>17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Wendell, </em>214, 215, 216. <em>Hough vs. Gray, </em>19 <em>Wendell, </em>202, 203. <em>Seabury vs. Hungerford, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>80, 83. <em>Miller vs. Gaston, 2 Hill, </em>188, 190.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-5\">It seems that in <em>Hall vs. JYewcomb, </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>234, the Supreme Court being <em>equally divided, </em>the judgment below was affirmed. The case was afterwards taken to the Court of Errors. See 7 <em>Hill, </em>416,\u2014and there twice argued. Judgment of Supreme Court affirmed. Should a single case <em>thus </em>decided outweigh the numerous decisions of six States of the Union, and the deliberate adjudications of a <em>Parsons, </em>a <em>Parker, </em>and a <em>Shaw, </em>of Massachusetts\u2014of a <em>Spencer </em>and <em>Thompson, </em>of <em>New York, </em>and of a <em>Williams, </em>of <em>Vermont ?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-6\">4. The court below was right in not leaving it to the <em>jury </em>to construe the contract. In cases of signatures on <em>blank </em>paper, rule would be different. Here the note was filled up at the time of <em>Sullivan's </em>signing. The <em>law </em>then construes the contract. See 11 <em>Mass. R. 122. </em>11 <em>New Hampshire, </em>388. Parol evidence is inadmissible to explain or vary the written contract. If <em>Sullivan's </em>intention could be given in evidence, still it must be first shown that plaintiffs below had notice of such intention previous to accepting note. 11 <em>Mass. R. </em>436. 12 <em>Vermont R. </em>219. 9 <em>Vermont R. </em>345. 6 <em>Vermont, </em>642. There being no evidence of such notice, the question of intention could not have been submitted to jury. Different rule would enable <em>Sullivan </em>to perpetrate fraud on <em>Violett Dempsey. </em>They are presumed to know the <em>law, </em>but not the notions of a <em>Harford </em>County jury. Relying on the construction which the law gave the signature, they regarded <em>Sullivan </em>as joint-maker, and therefore gave no notice of dishonor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-10\">5. Not necessary that blank endorsement should have been filled up. See <em>act of </em>1825, <em>ch. </em>35.
