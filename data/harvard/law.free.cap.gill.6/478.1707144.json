That the possession of a common carrier\u2019s receipt for the conveyance of goods, forwarded by the <em>owner </em>of the goods on his own account, and given to said <em>owner </em>as <em>consignor </em>of the goods, endorsed over by the owner, with an order to the car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>rier or his agents, to deliver the goods contained in the receipt to a third party, and the exhibition of the receipt, with the order of the owner to the common carrier or his agents, by the party to whom it has been endorsed, accompanied by a tender of all charges due to said carrier, entitles the holder of the receipt, with the order, to the <em>possession </em>of the goods specified in it, as against the common carrier.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-5\">McKaig for the appellee, insisted:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-6\">1st. That the appellants had neither a general or special property in the goods, and therefore, could not bring this action in their own names.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-7\">2d. The endorsement by <em>McCalla </em>Rankin, on the bill</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-8\">of lading conveyed to plaintiffs no property in the goods, but was a mere order or authority to receive the goods, as the agent of the owners, w'as without consideration, and therefore, did not authorize the plaintiffs to institute the action of replevin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-9\">3d. The plaintiffs never had possession of the goods, in virtue of which alone, a special property in the goods could have been obtained by them, and there is no pretence, that they had any general property in the goods,\u2014they could not, therefore, maintain replevin for the goods.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b491-10\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"AGO\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
