P. Shannon </em>and <em>Scofield </em>were contractors on the <em>Balt, and Ohio R. R. </em>and that on the date of the order given in evidence, no final estimate had been made, but that on the 14th September, 1842, a final estimate was made, by which a balance of $12,080 94 was found to be due said <em>Shannon </em>and <em>Scofield </em>from the <em>Balt, and Ohio R. R. Co. </em>and that the plaintiffs in this cause never took any steps or used any legal diligence to recover the said order, or the amount thereof, from the <em>Balt, and Ohio R. R. Co.; </em>and if the jury further believe that such order was given on account of work done by <em>Gallace </em>in the re-construction of the <em>Harpers Ferry Viaduct, </em>that <em>Shannon </em>was one of the. parties contracting for the re-construction of said <em>Viaduct; </em>and that the plaintiffs presented said draft to some person at the <em>Balt, and Ohio R. R. Co. </em>who said there were no funds; that said draft was never delivered back to the defendant by the plaintiffs; and that no notice of its non-acceptance or non-payment was given to the defendant, till January, 1843; that then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover, but for the balance of their account, after deducting the said draft or order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-9\">If the jury believe the facts stated in defendant\u2019s <em>first </em>prayer, and further find that the R. R. Co. at the time when such order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>was presented, had funds more than ample to pay such order, and continued to hold said funds till February, 1843; that the plaintiffs have not used any diligence to collect the sum from them; then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover, for the amount of said order on the said R. R. Co.: which prayers the court, (Archer, C. J. and Purviance, A. J.) refused to grant. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">The testimony on both sides being closed, and which is to be taken as forming part of this exception, the plaintiffs, by their counsel, prayed the court to instruct the jury\u2014that if the jury shall believe <em>that after the refusal of the R. R. Company to pay, </em>or accept the draft of <em>J. P. Shannon, </em>notice within a reasonable <em>time\u2014of which the jury are the </em>judges\u2014was given to <em>JYichols, Perdue Co. </em>of such non-payment or non-acceptance, then the defendant is not entitled to be credited with the amount of the said draft: whicii instruction the court, (Archer, C. J. and Purviance, A. J.) gave. The defendant excepted and appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b267-7\">The cause was argued before Dorsey, Spence, Martin and Magruder, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-8\">By McMahon for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-9\">By Latrobe for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b267-10\">Magruder, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-n\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">We are of opinion that the court below did not err in refusing to give the instruction of the defendant, as stated in the first bill of exceptions. The facts stated in the prayer, even if admitted or proved to the satisfaction of the jury, would not have entitled the defendant to claim a deduction from the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, of the amount of the order offered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">We think that the court below erred in giving the instruction, which is to be found in the second exception. In that instruction, it is assumed that the Rail-road Company refused to pay or accept the order. The court also said the jury were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the judges whether notice of such a refusal was given within a reasonable time to the defendant below.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In a case like this, <em>(Crawford vs. </em>Berry, 6 <em>G. &amp; J.) </em>this court said: \u201c Active diligence is imposed upon the obligee in pursuing the obligor, for a recovery of the sum due on the bill assigned to him, so that nothing shall be lost by his <em>laches; </em>and the question is, whether he did use due diligence, which is a question for the decision of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Affirm first exception, and second exception reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
