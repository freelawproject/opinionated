Mendoza argues that the jury only found that his offense involved a detectable amount of methamphetamine and, consequently, his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum. Mendoza contends that Amendment 484 to the Sentencing Guidelines provides that the actual amount of drugs involved, not size of the mixture or substance containing the drugs, must be used to determine drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">As Mendoza\u2019s motion raised a claim of substantive error, not a claim of clerical mistake or oversight, neither a motion for nunc pro tunc order nor a motion under the provision for nunc pro tunc corrections set forth in Fed.R.Crim.P. 36 was the appropriate procedural vehicle for raising Mendoza\u2019s claim. <em>See United States v. Hitchmon, </em>587 F.2d 1357, 1360 (5th Cir.), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>602 F.2d 689 (5th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1026 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995). Furthermore, the jury found that Mendoza\u2019s offense involved \u201c500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine or 50' grams or more of methamphetamine (actual).\u201d Thus, his statutory maximum sentence was life imprisonment, making his sentence of 360 months of imprisonment within the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viH). Mendoza\u2019s reliance on Amendment 484 is also misplaced; as a guidelines provision, Amendment 484 did not alter the statutory maximum sentence and, unlike the methamphetamine at issue here, only concerns materials that have to be separated from a controlled substance before the controlled substance can be used, like fiberglass in a cocaine/fiberglass bonded suitcase, beeswax in a cocaine/beeswax statue, or waste water from an illicit methamphetamine laboratory. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">Mendoza\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. See <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance and for an extension of time to file a brief are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR SUMMARY AFFIRMANCE DENIED; MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE A BRIEF DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
