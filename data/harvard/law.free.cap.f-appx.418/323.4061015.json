He argues that his sentence, which fell within his advisory sentencing guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that a shorter sentence was warranted because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the Guideline applicable to violations of \u00a7 1326, gave too much weight to his prior convictions and allowed for the enhancement of his sentence based on a remote offense. He also contends that his sentence does not account for his cultural assimilation, the mitigating reasons for his attempted illegal reentry, and his reduced likelihood of recidivism. Finally, he argues that the district court should have imposed a variance to avoid an unwarranted sentencing disparity between defendants sentenced in districts that do not have a fast-track program, and defendants sentenced in districts that do have fast-track programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), Rivera-Jurado contends that his sentence should not be accorded an appellate presumption of reasonableness because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based. However, Rivera-Jurado concedes that his challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-17\">Before imposing Rivera-Jurado\u2019s sentence, the district court judge considered the advisory sentencing guidelines range, the information in Rivera-Jurado\u2019s presentence report, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The judge also considered the arguments presented at sentencing and determined that a guideline sentence would be appropriate. As Rivera-Jurado acknowledges, the district court was precluded by this court\u2019s precedent from granting a variance based on any disparity between sentences imposed in non-fast-track and fast-track districts. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.2008). Rivera-Jurado\u2019s arguments do not establish that the district court abused its discretion in imposing that sentence, or, consequently, that the within-guidelines sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
