Hageon argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding of guilt. He also challenges his sentence under the ACCA by arguing that he does not have the requisite number of prior convictions that qualify as violent felonies, his prior burglary convictions are not separate prior convictions, his due process rights were violated because he did not receive adequate notice that his prior convictions would be used to enhance his sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>and his case should be remanded in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">This court\u2019s standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence in a bench trial is \u201cwhether the finding of guilt is supported by substantial evidence, i.e., evidence sufficient to justify the trial judge, as the trier of fact, in concluding beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 720 (5th Cir.2003) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). To convict a defendant of the offense of felon in possession of a firearm, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant previously was convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that he possessed a firearm, and that the firearm traveled in or affected interstate commerce. <em>See </em>\u00a7 922(g)(1); <em>United States v. Broadnax, </em>601 F.3d 336, 341 (5th Cir.2010). Hageon stipulated that he was previously convicted of a crime that was punishable by imprisonment for a term that exceeded one year and that the firearm at issue traveled in interstate commerce. Thus, the only offense element that was at issue was whether Hageon possessed the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Hageon\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is not persuasive. Kelli Pope and David Moore both testified that they saw the pistol in question in Hageon\u2019s possession on the night of April 29, 2009, and that the pistol, which ATF agents found at the residence of Pope and Moore, partially hidden on the couch, was not in their residence before Hageon arrived there on May 1, 2009. Additionally, ATF agents testified that on May 1, 2009, when they arrived at the residence of Pope and Moore, Pope and Hageon were on the front porch. The arrival of the ATF agents prompted Hageon\u2019s quick entry into the house. Hageon reemerged on the porch just a few seconds later. An ATF Agent searched the residence, with Pope\u2019s permission, and discovered the firearm at issue, partially hidden behind a couch cushion, in the living room, near the front door. Possession of a weapon may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>See United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 759 (5th Cir.2007). The record contains sufficient evidence establishing that Hageon had knowledge of the firearm and access to the dwelling where the firearm was found. <em>See id.; United States v. De Leon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.1999). The record thus contains substantial evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s finding of guilt. <em>See Turner, </em>319 F.3d at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\n<em>Sentencing pursuant to the ACCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Under the ACCA, a defendant who is convicted under \u00a7 922(g) as a felon in possession of a firearm who has three prior convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another\u201d is subject to a mandatory minimum prison sentence of fifteen years. \u00a7 924(e)(1). This court reviews the sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and reviews de novo the legal conclusions underlying the application of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Hawley, </em>516 F.3d 264, 269 (5th Cir.2008). Constitutional challenges are reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Joseph, </em>333 F.3d 587, 589 (5th Cir.2003). The ACCA specifically lists, inter alia, \u201cburglary\u201d in its definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The district court used Hageon\u2019s prior Texas convictions of burglary of a building as a basis for determining that Hageon had the requisite three prior violent felony convictions. Thus, the relevant issue is whether Ha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>geon\u2019s Texas convictions of burglary qualify as \u201cburglary\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598-602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Hageon\u2019s argument that he does not have the requisite number of prior qualifying convictions is without merit, for the following reasons. Hageon\u2019s reliance upon U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (2009) is misplaced. A person who is an armed career criminal pursuant to \u00a7 924(e)(1) qualifies as an armed career criminal who is subject to sentencing under \u00a7 4B1.4, the armed career criminal guideline. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4B1.4(a). The language that governs classification of Hageon\u2019s prior offenses is the definition of violent felony that is set forth in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), not the definition of crime of violence that is set forth in guideline \u00a7 481.2(a). <em>See </em>924(e)(1); \u00a7 4B1.4(a); \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.l). Also, <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), upon which Hageon relies, is inapposite. In <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 139-48, 128 S.Ct. 1581, the Supreme Court analyzed whether a state conviction for driving under the influence was a violent felony under the \u201cotherwise\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and held that the conviction was not a qualifying violent felony. <em>Begay </em>does not set forth the framework for analyzing whether a state crime qualifies as a violent felony because it is a listed crime and thus does not govern the analysis in Hageon\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, the Supreme Court determined that the offense of \u201cburglary\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) is the modern, generic form of burglary. The <em>Taylor </em>definition of burglary, requires, at a minimum, \u201cthe following elements: an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Where, as in Hageon\u2019s case, prior convictions arise from a guilty plea, \u201cenquiry under the ACCA to determine whether a plea of guilty to burglary defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Hageon does not argue that the documents that were submitted with the PSR Addendum are inadequate under <em>Shepard. </em>The documents indicate that, in each case, Hageon was convicted of burglary of a building \u201cwith intent to commit a theft.\u201d The documents therefore establish that Hageon was convicted, in four cases, of burglary of a building under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) of the Texas Penal Code. The language of the current version of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1), and the 1992 and 1994 versions that were effective at the time of Hageon\u2019s prior convictions, substantially correspond to the <em>Taylor </em>definition. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a)(1); <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The Texas crime of burglary as defined in \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) therefore qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 585 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 161-62 (5th Cir.1992). The district court thus did not err in its determination that Hageon had three prior convictions for a violent felony as defined in the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Hageon further argues that his three violent felony convictions were not \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another,\u201d as required by \u00a7 924(e). The <em>Shepard </em>documents that were submitted with the PSR Addendum establish, as the district court concluded, that Hageon\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>qualifying violent felonies occurred on three separate occasions, with two of the burglaries separated by twelve days and a third burglary occurring two years later. Moreover, the documents establish that the crimes occurred at different places and had different victims. The district court therefore correctly determined that Hageon had three qualifying convictions that were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e); <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>453 F.3d 274, 278-79 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Washington, </em>898 F.2d 439, 442 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Hageon also contends that he received inadequate notice that the ACCA was applicable at sentencing. A defendant is \u201cnot entitled to any formal notice of the possibility of an enhanced sentence under the ACCA other than that required by due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Howard, </em>444 F.3d 326, 327 (5th Cir.2006). Hageon received notice of the application of the ACCA in the PSR, to which he objected in writing and at sentencing. Therefore, his argument is unavailing. <em>See id. </em>Finally, Hageon argues that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, and <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, require that prior convictions that are used in the \u00a7 924(e) analysis be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and determined by a jury. This argument lacks merit. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 213-14 &amp; n. 8, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007); <em>United States v. Stone, </em>306 F.3d 241, 243 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
