The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants, and after the denial of his motion for a new trial, Bibbs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Bibbs argues, as he did in his new trial motion, that defense counsel perpetrated a \u201cfraud upon the court\u201d by concealing a work order on the purge fan and by falsely stating in response to a pretrial discovery order that TDCJ Major Fred Early did not personally conduct an investigation into Bibbs\u2019s grievance. We review the denial of a new trial motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Dresser-Rand, Co. v. Virtual Automation, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 831, 839 (5th Cir.2004). Attorney misconduct can warrant a new trial in certain circumstances. <em>Winter v. Brenner Tank, Inc., </em>926 F.2d 468, 473 (5th Cir.1991). In addition, federal courts possess the inherent power to vacate their own judgments on proof that a fraud has been perpetrated on the court. <em>Fierro v. Johnson, </em>197 F.3d 147, 152 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">Bibbs eannot show misconduct by defense counsel, much less fraud on the court. Bibbs evidently believes that the defendants\u2019 production of documents pertaining to an independent \u201cair handler\u201d system located below the purge fan suggests that defense counsel withheld evidence, such as maintenance records, pertaining to the purge fan. However, nothing in the record suggests that such records regarding the purge fan existed, and the records custodian testified that there simply were no work orders for the purge fan. It was reasonable for TDCJ employees investigating a complaint about the purge fan to compile records relating to maintenance issues involving the air handler that is installed just below it. In addition, work order # 05007796, which Bibbs asserts was concealed by defense counsel, was admitted into evidence at trial, and any error in the defendants\u2019 failure to produce the document was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CrvP. 61. Similarly, Bibbs insists that defense counsel lied when he stated in response to a pretrial discovery order that Major Fred Early did not personally conduct an investigation into Bibbs\u2019s grievance. However, a TDCJ grievance investigator testified that Major Early did not investigate the grievance even though he received information regarding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">Bibbs also appeals numerous evidentiary rulings, which we review for abuse of discretion. <em>See Abner v. Kan. City So. R.R. Co., </em>513 F.3d 154, 168 (5th Cir.2008). Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>lying on Federal Rule of Evidence 402, Bibbs argues that the district court im-. properly excluded exhibits showing the temperature when the purge fan was allegedly activated. However, the district court excluded the exhibits as unauthenticated, and Bibbs does not show that the documents were in fact properly authenticated or otherwise explain how the district court abused its discretion in excluding it. <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R.Evid. 104(b), 901. Also, the district court correctly excluded another prisoner\u2019s grievance because it was not relevant to Bibb\u2019s claim that TDCJ officers retaliated against Bibbs. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999) (holding that in order to state a valid claim for retaliation under \u00a7 1983, a prisoner must allege, among other things, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s intent to retaliate <em>against the prisoner for his or her </em>exercise\u201d of a constitutional right (emphasis added)). Bibbs argues that the district court denied him the opportunity to question Windham regarding TDCJ grievance procedures and denied him the opportunity to question Calvin Askins regarding a business records affidavit. In fact, the transcript shows that the court allowed Bibbs to question both witnesses and simply ruled that Bibbs should ask questions instead of making statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Although Bibbs argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for appointment of counsel, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff is not entitled to appointment of counsel absent exceptional circumstances. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). In addition, Bibbs has failed to show any error in the district court\u2019s denial without prejudice of his pretrial motion to transcribe the proceedings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">For the first time on appeal, Bibbs also argues that defense counsel falsely stated during a pretrial hearing that work order # 05007796 did not exist, falsely stated during the trial that he did not know what Bibbs was talking about when Bibbs objected to defense counsel\u2019s alleged failure to comply with a discovery order, and failed to produce Officer Burkholder\u2019s disciplinary records despite a request for production of those documents. In addition, Bibbs argues for the first time on appeal that defense counsel violated Bibbs\u2019s constitutional due process rights, and he complains that the district court failed to determine the admissibility of his exhibits prior to trial, violated his constitutional right to due process by refusing to allow him to approach the bench, and demonstrated bias toward him. We will not consider an issue that a party fails to raise in the district court absent extraordinary circumstances. <em>AG Acceptance v. Veigel, </em>564 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir.2009). Such extraordinary circumstances exist when the issue involved is a pure question of law and a miscarriage of justice would result from the failure to consider it. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we decline to consider these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AND FOR COSTS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
