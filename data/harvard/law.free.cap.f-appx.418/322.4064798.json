Perryman argues that the sentencing court plainly erred by imposing a dangerous weapon sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Perryman was a member of a methamphetamine-trafficking organization run by his uncle, Thomas L. Gerry. The Presentence Report (PSR) recommended the challenged sentence enhancement based on its report that Perryman received methamphetamine and drug proceeds directly from Gerry and other members of the organization who were known to possess firearms in the course of their drug trafficking activities. Perryman did not object to the recommendation or offer any evidence or argument that it was not reasonably foreseeable to him that his coconspirators possessed and carried firearms. As the propriety of the \u00a7 2D1.1 enhancement is a factual issue that could have been resolved if Perryman had objected in the district court, no plain error can have occurred. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 361-62 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2010). Moreover, we note that the record supports the sentencing court\u2019s application of the dangerous weapon enhancement. <em>See Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d at 390; <em>United States v. Reasor, </em>541 F.3d 366, 369 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
