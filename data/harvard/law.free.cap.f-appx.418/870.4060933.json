Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Before we review a district court\u2019s denial of a section 2254 petition, the petitioner must obtain a certificate of appealability by making a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(l)-(2). The scope of our review is limited to the issues specified in the certificate of appealability. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). On appeal, Young asserts that the district court erred by not providing him an opportunity for discovery or for an evidentiary hearing. But we granted a certificate of appealability only to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>[w]hether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992), by failing to address Young\u2019s claim that he was improperly treated as ineligible to earn gain time for six months following his disciplinary infraction, pursuant to Fla. Admin.Code \u00a7 33-601.101 (6)(a)(2)-(3) (1998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In <em>Clisby </em>we exercised our supervisory power over the district courts and instructed them \u201cto resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to [section 2254], regardless whether habeas relief is granted or denied.\u201d 960 F.2d at 936. A \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 is \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation,\u201d and two separate allegations of a constitutional violation \u201cconstitute two distinct claims for relief, even if both allegations arise from the same alleged set of operative facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If a district court fails to address all of the claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cvacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The district court properly addressed Young\u2019s argument that he was erroneously treated as ineligible to earn gain time for six months following his disciplinary infraction. First, the court reviewed and upheld the state court\u2019s decision, which addressed the issue of ineligibility to earn gain time. The state court held that Young failed to show a violation of his due process rights, and the district court determined that this was not an unreasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The district court also found that Young \u201creceived the degree of fairness in the disciplinary proceeding to which he was entitled.\u201d The court properly analyzed Young\u2019s claim as a due process claim, rather than assessing whether it was proper under state law, because only claims that a person has been held in custody in violation of the Constitution or federal law are cognizable in section 2254 habeas petitions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). The court did not err under <em>Clisby, </em>so the denial of Young\u2019s habeas petition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
