The government has moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the appeal is moot because Agyei-Kodie is no longer detained pursuant to \u00a7 1226, and any challenge to his post-removal-order detention is premature. In the alternative, the government seeks an extension of time in which to file its brief. Agyei-Kodie has filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The removal order became administratively final on October 8, 2010, when the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed the appeal of the immigration judge\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(47)(B). Consequently, Agyei-Kodie is no longer detained pursuant to \u00a7 1226, and his claims challenging his detention under that statute are moot. <em>See Andrade v. Gonzales, </em>459 F.3d 538, 542-43 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Agyei-Kodie\u2019s detention is now governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231, <em>see id., </em>which provides that the Attorney General shall remove the alien within a period of 90 days, during which time the alien shall be detained, \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(A), (a)(2). If he is not removed within the 90-day period, he may be detained beyond that time or released subject to the terms of supervision prescribed by the Attorney General. \u00a7 1231(a)(3), (6). It is presumptively constitutional for an alien to be detained for six months after a final order of removal. <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The 90-day removal period commenced on October 8, 2010, when the removal order became administratively final. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1231(a)(l)(B)(i). Although that period has expired, Agyei-Kodie has not been in post-removal-order detention longer than the presumptively reasonable six-month period set forth in <em>Zadvydas. </em>Consequently, any challenge to his continued post removal order detention is premature. <em>See Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Accordingly, the motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987). The motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the motion for extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
