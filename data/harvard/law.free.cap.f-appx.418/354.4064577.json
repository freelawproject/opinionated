However, Liu never presented a motion to the district court regarding the alleged fraud on the court or attempted in any way to seek relief from the district court on this issue. Instead, Liu filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s orders granting Defendants-Appellees\u2019 12(b) motions to dismiss, even though nothing contained in the 12(b) motions relates to the granting or denial of any fraud on the court allegations as set out in the complaint. Because Liu failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>to seek relief on his fraud on the court claim from the district court, this issue is not properly before us. In addition, in his briefs on appeal, Liu fails to allege any error by the district court regarding his 12(b) dismissals. <em>See Sanders v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>553 F.3d 922, 926 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cA party waives an issue if he fails to adequately brief it on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
