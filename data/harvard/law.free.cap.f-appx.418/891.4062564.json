Houston was sentenced to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. He now asks that we overturn his conviction on the ground that the district court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence his 1992 conviction for distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). Because we conclude that the error, if any, in the conviction\u2019s admission was harmless, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">At trial, the government introduced many audio and video recordings of Houston negotiating to buy large quantities of cocaine from a confidential informant. In one telephone recording, Houston requested a meeting with the confidential informant\u2019s supplier to test the purity of the cocaine. At the meeting, the \u201csupplier\u201d\u2014 an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency agent \u2014 \u201cflashed\u201d a k\u00f1o of cocaine, which Houston\u2019s son tested for purity. Houston\u2019s son testified that he and his father had discussed purchasing 10 kilograms of cocaine and that he went to the meeting with his father expecting that they would purchase cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">The government also called Joey Dunlap, a convicted drug dealer, who testified that Houston asked him to help Houston distribute 10 kilograms of cocaine. The undercover DEA agent who \u201cflashed\u201d the kilogram of cocaine testified that Houston agreed to buy 13 kilograms of cocaine from him and that Houston said that he could \u201cmove\u201d 30 kilograms of cocaine a week. After the government finished examining the DEA agent, it offered into evidence Houston\u2019s 1992 conviction for distribution of cocaine base. The conviction was admitted over Houston\u2019s objection. Houston argues that district court abused its discretion by admitting his prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-17\">We need not reach Houston\u2019s argument, however, because we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>error, if any, was harmless. Even if a prior conviction is admitted erroneously, reversal of a conviction is only warranted if the error had a substantial effect on the outcome of the trial and there was no other evidence sufficient to support the verdict. <em>United States v. Harriston, </em>329 F.3d 779, 789 (11th Cir.2003). We have held that such error is harmless where other evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Here, between the testimony of the undercover DEA agent, Houston\u2019s son, and Dunlap, as well as the tape and video recordings of Houston\u2019s meetings with the confidential informant, the other evidence of Houston\u2019s guilt is overwhelming. Houston has not shown how the publication his prior conviction had a substantial effect on the outcome of the proceeding. Because the other evidence of Houston\u2019s guilt is overwhelming, we conclude that any error caused by admitting his 1992 conviction was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm Houston\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
