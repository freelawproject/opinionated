[Banjee] expressly submits and consents in advance to such jurisdiction in any action or proceeding in such court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The district court held that the clause did not preclude suit in a federal court in Georgia thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-7\">The clause does not contain any language indicating exclusivity. It requires that Banjee must submit to the jurisdiction of Georgia state courts, but does not mandate that all litigation relating to the Guaranty occur there. Though the word \u2018shall\u2019 may indicate non-discretion, it does not also connote exclusivity in all circumstances. Here, the word \u2018shall\u2019 indicates non-discretion in the sense that it prohibits Banjee from contesting the jurisdiction of Georgia state courts if such jurisdiction is asserted, but it does not state that <em>only </em>Georgia state courts \u2018shall have jurisdiction\u2019 in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaJ\">Order dated April 1, 2010 at 7. We are persuaded by the district court\u2019s reading of the clause and therefore affirm its judgment denying Banjee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"AoG\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">. The guaranty agreement is collateral for a $4 million loan Alpha Bank &amp; Trust of Alpharetta made to Georgia 4-S Investments, LLP.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
