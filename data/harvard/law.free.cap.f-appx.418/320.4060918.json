She received a sentence of 37 months in prison, at the bottom of the guidelines range applied by the district court. On appeal, Storrs contends that the district court erred in the guidelines calculations. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-22\">Storrs first contends that she was entitled to a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 because she pleaded guilty in a timely manner, because she told the court that she had accepted responsibility for her actions, and because her challenges to the inclusion of certain fraudulent mortgages in the Presentence Report were based on lack of knowledge. The district court found that Storrs engaged in conduct inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. nn. 1(A) &amp; 3, because she falsely denied or equivocated about her knowledge of fraudulent mortgage applications that she or her codefendant helped procure. In light of this finding, the court\u2019s determination that Storrs was not entitled to a three-level reduction was not without foundation. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Storrs next objects to the district court\u2019s two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) for a fraudulent scheme involving the use of sophisticated means. She insists that her conduct was not particularly complex or intricate. We review this ruling for clear error. <em>United States v. Conner, </em>537 F.3d 480, 492 (5th Cir.2008). The commentary to \u00a7 2B.1.1 states that \u201c[cjonduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, ... ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 8(B). We held in <em>United States v. Wright, </em>496 F.3d 371 (5th Cir.2007), that the use of fraudulent materials to help borrowers falsely appear to mortgage lenders as creditworthy supports a sophisticated-means enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 379; <em>see also United States v. Clements, </em>73 F.3d 1330, 1340 (5th Cir.1996). The district court did not clearly err by holding that Storrs\u2019s actions were sufficiently sophisticated to warrant the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Finally, Storrs objects to the district court\u2019s loss calculation, which resulted in a ten-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(F) for a loss amount between $120,000 and $200,000. The district court determined that the applicable loss amount was $199,534, but Storrs maintains that she should have received an offset of $48,595 based on the profits realized from some of the foreclosure proceedings. Even if the court had awarded Storrs the offset, the total loss amount would have been $150,939 and she still would have received the same ten-level enhancement. Under the circumstances, Storrs is unable to establish harm arising from any error in the loss calculations. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>582 F.3d 558, 565 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1116, 175 L.Ed.2d 926 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
