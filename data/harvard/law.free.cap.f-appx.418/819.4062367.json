The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Association and granted its motion for attorney\u2019s fees on the ground that Dawes-Ordonez had sued the Association without providing notice of its alleged infringement. We affirm. Because we find this appeal frivolous, we also grant the motion of the Association to impose sanctions against Dawes-Ordonez under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, and remand with instructions to determine a reasonable fee for the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-25\">The Copyright Act grants the district court the power to award a \u201creasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>attorney\u2019s fee to the prevailing party.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505. Attorney\u2019s fees \u201care to be awarded ... only as a matter of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 534, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 1033, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994). When the district court weighs the factors that the Court in <em>Fogerty </em>recommended should \u201cguide courts\u2019 discretion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 534 n. 19, 114 S.Ct. at 1033 n. 19, \u2018\u201cwe will not question the court\u2019s decision to grant or deny fees absent an abuse of that discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>MiTek Holdings, Inc. v. Arce Eng\u2019g Co., Inc., </em>198 F.3d 840, 842 (11th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Montgomery v. Noga, </em>168 F.3d 1282, 1303 (11th Cir.1999)). An abuse of discretion occurs if the district court makes a finding of fact that is clearly erroneous or commits a clear error of judgment. <em>Gray ex rel. Alexander v. Bostic, </em>613 F.3d 1035, 1039 (11th Cir.2010). We consider whether the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cfurther[s] ... the policies of the law that are being enforced, as informed by the court\u2019s familiarity with the matter in litigation and the interest of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cable/Home Commc\u2019n Corp. v. Network Prods., Inc., </em>902 F.2d 829, 854 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Casella v. Morris, </em>820 F.2d 362, 367 (11th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Dawes-Ordonez sued the Association for allegedly infringing a copyright DawesOrdonez held for photographs of a residence that she had licensed a realtor to disseminate through a multiple listing service owned by the Association. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Association and ruled that Dawes-Ordonez had \u201cconstructively delivered\u201d her photographs to the Association and \u201cintended that the [pjhotographs be distributed by\u201d the Association. DawesOrdonez does not challenge the summary judgment in favor of the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the Association. The district court ruled that Dawes-Ordonez\u2019s decision to sue before giving notice to the Association of its alleged infringement was \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d and \u201cdemonstrate[d] a questionable subjective motivation.\u201d The district court was entitled to question Dawes-Ordonez\u2019s motive in refusing to notify the Association after she had notified the realtors and real estate company that also participated in the alleged infringement. The district court also awarded fees to \u201cdeter copyright holders from filing such suits without first attempting to resolve the matter outside of court.\u201d The purposes of the copyright laws are served only when parties \u201clitigate meritorious\u201d arguments. <em>Fogerty, </em>510 U.S. at 527, 114 S.Ct. at 1030. <em>See also MiTek, </em>198 F.3d at 842-43. When a complaint of infringement is without merit, the district court may consider deterrence, <em>Fogerty, </em>510 U.S. at 534 n. 19, 114 S.Ct. at 1033 n. 19, in the exercise of its discretion to award fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">The Association has requested that we impose sanctions against Dawes-Ordonez for pursuing a frivolous appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 38. Rule 38 provides that, \u201c[i]f a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d Because Dawes-Ordonez\u2019s challenge to the award of attorney\u2019s fees is entirely without merit, we award to the Association double costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred as a result of this appeal. We remand this action to the district court with instructions to determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees reasonably incurred by the Association and assess that amount against Dawes-Ordonez.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">We AFFIRM the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the Association, we AWARD SANCTIONS to the Association under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Rule 38, and we REMAND with instructions to determine a reasonable fee for the defense of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
