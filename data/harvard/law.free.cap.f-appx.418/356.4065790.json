Esparza-Andrade argues that the district court erred in applying a 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), based on his prior Michigan conviction for attempted second-degree criminal sexual conduct. He specifically asserts that the enhancement was improper because the prior conviction could not be classified as \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d an enumerated crime of violence offense, and because Michigan\u2019s definition of \u201cattempt\u201d was broader than the generic, contemporary definition of \u201cattempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">The district court\u2019s characterization of a prior offense as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir.2006). Section 2L1.2 of the Guidelines provides that the offense level for unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States shall be increased by 16 levels if the defendant has a prior conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as (1) any specific enumerated offense, including \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d \u201cforcible sex offenses,\u201d and \u201cstatutory rape\u201d; or (2) \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-18\">To determine whether a specific state offense constitutes an enumerated offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), this court uses a \u201ccommon sense approach.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mungia-Portillo, </em>484 F.3d 813, 816 (5th Cir.2007). This court gives the enumerated offense its \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After determining the generic and contemporary meaning of the offense, we compare it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>to the statute of conviction. <em>See Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d at 379. \u201cIf the defendant was convicted under a statute following the generic definition with minor variations, or a statute narrower than the generic crime, the sentence enhancement may be applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, if the statute of conviction prohibits behavior that is not within the plain, ordinary meaning of the enumerated offense, the prior offense is not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Mungia-Porbillo, </em>484 F.3d at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The Michigan statute at issue reads, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">(1) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree if the person engages in sexual contact with another person and if any of the following circumstances exists:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">(a) That other person is under 13 years of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.520c(l)(a) (2003). Michigan defines sexual contact as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">the intentional touching of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s intimate parts or the intentional touching of the clothing covering the immediate area of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s intimate parts, if that intentional touching can reasonably be construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, done for sexual purpose, or in a sexual manner for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">(I) Revenge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">(ii) To inflict humiliation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">(Hi) Out of anger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.520a(n) (2003). Intimate parts includes \u201cthe primary genital area, groin, inner thigh, buttock, or breast of a human being.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.520a(c) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">In order for a statute to conform to the generic, contemporary meaning of \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d the statute must criminalize conduct with the following three elements: (1) the conduct must involve a \u201cchild\u201d; (2) the conduct must be \u201csexual\u201d in nature; and (3) the sexual conduct must be \u201cabusive.\u201d <em>See United States v. Najera-Najera, </em>519 F.3d 509, 511 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604-05 (5th Cir.2000)). This court has noted that under the \u201cgeneric-meaning analysis, a person younger than 17 years old is a \u2018child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511-12. Under the plain and ordinary meaning of the word, the Michigan statute criminalizes conduct that is \u201csexual\u201d in nature. <em>See id. </em>(analyzing a similar Texas statute). Moreover, the sexual conduct is \u201cabusive\u201d because of the psychological harm that children suffer from even non-physical sexual contact with adults. <em>See Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d at 605. Accordingly, Esparza-Andrade\u2019s Michigan statute of conviction criminalizes conduct that can be properly categorized as \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d an enumerated crime of violence offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)); <em>Najera-Najera, </em>519 F.3d at 511-12; <em>Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d at 604-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">Esparza-Andrade\u2019s assertion that Michigan\u2019s statute defining \u201cattempt\u201d is overly broad is unmeritorious. Current circuit law indicates that the definition of \u201cattempt\u201d need not be separately analyzed because an analysis of the elements of the statute prohibiting the underlying crime is sufficient for classification purposes. <em>See United States v. Cervantes-Blanco, </em>504 F.3d 576, 579-87 (5th Cir.2007) (stating that its analysis was not affected by the fact that defendant was convicted of an attempt rather than the completed offense). Moreover, the Guidelines do not distinguish between an attempt and a successfully completed crime for purposes of determining whether an offense is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.5) (noting that prior convictions for crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>counted under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) for sentencing enhancement purposes \u201cinclude the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting, to commit such offenses\u201d). In addition, Esparza-Andrade does not meet his burden of demonstrating a realistic probability that Michigan would actually apply its \u201cattempt\u201d statute in a manner that fell outside of the generic, contemporary meaning of \u201cattempt.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Galvan, </em>632 F.3d 192, 199-201 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Ramos-Sanchez, </em>483 F.3d 400, 403-04 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
