The district court granted HHA\u2019s motion for summary judgment after concluding that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether HHA knew or could have known about Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s disability and the necessity for accommodation. The United States now appeals that order, and HHA moves for sanctions under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, arguing that this appeal is frivolous. After a thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, as well as the motion for sanctions and the briefs supporting and opposing that motion, we deny HHA\u2019s motion for sanctions, reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of HHA, and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1301 (11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is appropriate only if \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cIn determining whether a genuine issue of material fact remains for trial, [we] must view all evidence and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Loren, </em>309 F.3d at 1301-02 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">These are the relevant facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the United States. The Rodriguez family lived in an HHA apartment at Project 16 until HHA decided to terminate the family\u2019s public housing tenancy after Joel Bonilla, HHA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Area Supervisor, determined that he could not resolve or otherwise prevent disputes between the Rodriguez family and a neighboring family. On or about January 3, 2005, HHA served the Rodriguez family with a thirty-day notice to vacate, and the family requested an informal hearing to contest the termination of their tenancy. HHA appointed Chabela Aneiros as the hearing officer to preside over that informal hearing. The hearing took place on January 20, 2005, with Bonilla also present on behalf of HHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">At the hearing, Mr. Rodriguez presented Aneiros with \u201cdocuments showing that [he] was sick,\u201d and Aneiros acknowledges she was aware at the time of the hearing that Mr. Rodriguez had health problems due to an accident. Aneiros asked Bonilla if HHA had another unit to which the Rodriguez family could be transferred, and Bonilla said that there was a unit at Hoffman Gardens, another HHA property. Aneiros offered the Rodriguez family the option of accepting a transfer from Project 16 to the vacant unit at Hoffman Gardens in lieu of terminating the tenancy. Mr. Rodriguez and his wife, Lazara Rodriguez (\u201cMrs. Rodriguez\u201d), advised Bonilla and Aneiros that Mr. Rodriguez \u201chad difficulty climbing stairs\u201d and therefore the family \u201cneeded a unit with a bathroom that was accessible without climbing stairs.\u201d Aneiros would not allow the Rodriguez family to view the unit before accepting the agreement, but told Mr. Rodriguez that according to Bonilla the unit at Hoffinan Gardens \u201cha[d] a bathroom upstairs and downstairs.\u201d Based on this representation, the Rodriguez family agreed to the arrangement, and before the conclusion of the hearing, Mr. Rodriguez executed a transfer agreement acknowledging his acceptance of the unit at Hoffman Gardens.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">But when the family went to look at the Hoffman Gardens apartment, they found that there was no bathroom on the first floor. On January 21, 2005, the day after the informal hearing, Mrs. Rodriguez delivered a letter to Aneiros, which stated: \u201c[W]e want to appeal ... the decision about the transfer, because we did not realize that we did not see the conditions of the place first.... There is no bathroom downstairs and [Mr. Rodriguez] and I had surgery, we can not go upstairs each time we need to use the bathroom.\u201d HHA did not respond to Mrs. Rodriguez\u2019s letter. Instead, on January 24, 2005, Aneiros sent a letter dated January 21, 2005 stating that the decision to terminate the Rodriguez family\u2019s public housing tenancy had been upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">On May 4, 2005, HHA filed an action to evict the Rodriguez family from the Project 16 apartment. On or about May 17, 2005, the Rodriguez family filed an answer through counsel, which asserted as an affirmative defense that Mr. Rodriguez was disabled due to hip and back problems and that he could not constantly go up and down stairs to use a bathroom. On June 30, 2005, the Rodriguez family and Bonilla, together with the parties\u2019 attorneys, attended a court-ordered mediation in relation to the eviction. The attorney for the Rodriguez family explained that Mr. Rodriguez had a disability that prevented him from going up and down stairs, and for that reason he had rejected the transfer to the Hoffinan Gardens apartment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>HHA acknowledges that at the mediation it became \u201caware that Rodriguez had an alleged disability that prevented him from climbing stairs.\u201d HHA offered to transfer the Rodriguez family to the same units previously offered at Hoffman Gardens, and refused to allow the family to remain in their existing unit at Project 16. HHA offered to put the family on a waiting list for a unit that met Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s needs, but insisted that the family would be required to vacate its unit at Project 16 while waiting for a suitable unit to become available. The Rodriguez family rejected this arrangement, and instead entered into an agreement to vacate the Project 16 unit by August 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">On or about June 28, 2006, Mr. Rodriguez filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) alleging that HHA denied his request to reasonably accommodate him due to his hip and back disability. Based on HUD\u2019s determination that there was reasonable cause to believe that HHA discriminated against Mr. Rodriguez, the United States filed this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(o).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Under the FHA, it is unlawful to discriminate against a person by refusing \u201cto make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B). To prevail on a failure to accommodate claim, \u201ca plaintiff must establish that (1) he is disabled or handicapped within the meaning of the FHA, (2) he requested a reasonable accommodation, (3) such accommodation was necessary to afford him an opportunity to use and enjoy his dwelling, and (4) the defendants refused to make the requested accommodation.\u201d <em>Hawn v. Shoreline Towers Phase 1 Condo. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>347 Fed.Appx. 464, 467 (11th Cir.2009) (unpublished); <em>see Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, </em>544 F.3d 1201, 1219 (11th Cir.2008); <em>DuBois v. Ass\u2019n of Apartment Owners of 2987 Kalakaua, </em>453 F.3d 1175, 1179 (9th Cir.2006). We have explained that \u201c[wjhether a requested accommodation is required by law is highly fact-specific, requiring case-by-case determination.\u201d <em>Loren, </em>309 F.3d at 1302 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">In granting HHA\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court concluded that \u201ceven assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Mr. Rodriguez is disabled, no reasonable jury could conclude that [HHA] knew or should have known Mr. Rodriguez was disabled and that HHA knew the requested accommodation was necessary.\u201d We have explained that \u201ca plaintiff must actually request an accommodation and be refused in order to bring a reasonable accommodation claim under the FHA.\u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1219. As such, HHA \u201ccannot be liable for refusing to grant a reasonable and necessary accommodation if [HHA] never knew the accommodation was in fact necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Keys Youth Servs., Inc. v. City of Olathe, </em>248 F.3d 1267, 1275 (10th Cir.2001)). But \u201c[i]f a landlord is skeptical of a tenant\u2019s alleged disability or the landlord\u2019s ability to provide an accommodation, it is incumbent upon the landlord to request documentation or open a dialogue.\u201d <em>Jankowski Lee &amp; Assocs. v. Cisneros, </em>91 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir.1996). The questions before us then are (1) whether a reasonable jury could conclude that HHA had notice of Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s claimed disability and the necessity of his requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>accommodation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) whether HHA refused to provide the requested accommodation. We believe that disputed issues of material fact remain as to both questions. We address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">First, genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether HHA had notice of Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s claimed disability and his requested accommodation. We have previously recognized that we look to case law under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) for guidance in evaluating reasonable accommodation claims under the FHA. <em>Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1220. This Court has held that under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, \u201cthe duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made.\u201d <em>Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens &amp; Home, Inc., </em>167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see also Wood v. President &amp; Trustees of Spring Hill College in the City of Mobile, </em>978 F.2d 1214, 1222 (11th Cir.1992). \u201c[T]he duty to make a reasonable accommodation does not simply spring from the fact that the handicapped person wants such an accommodation made. Defendants must instead have ... the ability to conduct a meaningful review of the requested accommodation .... \u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1219 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Although we have not \u201cdetermined precisely what form the request must take,\u201d <em>Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., </em>492 F.3d 1247, 1261 n. 14 (11th Cir.2007), some of our sister circuits have addressed what qualifies as an adequate demand under the ADA. For example, the Tenth Circuit has explained that under Title I of the ADA a plaintiff \u201cneed not use magic words,\u201d but \u201cshould provide enough information about his or her limitations and desires so as to suggest at least the possibility that reasonable accommodation may be found in a reassignment job within the company.\u201d <em>Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc. </em>180 F.3d 1154, 1172 (10th Cir.1999). Similarly, the Third Circuit has stated that \u201c[w]hat matters under the ADA are not formalisms about the manner of the request, but whether the employee ... provides the employer with enough information that, under the circumstances, the employer can be fairly said to know of both the disability and desire for an accommodation.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., </em>184 F.3d 296, 313 (3d Cir.1999). This same standard applies in the context of the FHA. <em>See Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1220. In other words, for a demand to be specific enough to trigger the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation, the defendant \u201cmust have enough information to know of both the disability and desire for an accommodation, or circumstances must at least be sufficient to cause a reasonable [landlord] to make appropriate inquiries about the possible need for an accommodation.\u201d <em>Colwell v. Rite Aid Corp., </em>602 F.3d 495, 506 (3d Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">In this case, the United States points to four instances in which it contends the Rodriguez family put HHA on notice of Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s disability and the necessity of the accommodation. First, the United States points to Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s presentation of documents \u201cshowing that [he] was sick\u201d at the informal hearing on January 20, 2005, and to his statements during that hearing that he \u201chad difficulty climbing stairs,\u201d and therefore \u201cneeded a unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>with a bathroom that was accessible without climbing stairs.\u201d Second, the United States points to Mrs. Rodriguez\u2019s letter to Aneiros on January 21, 2005, which stated that Mr. and Mrs. Rodriguez \u201chad surgery,\u201d and \u201c[could not] go upstairs each time [they] need to use the bathroom.\u201d Third, the United States identifies the Rodriguez family\u2019s answer in the eviction action, which asserted as an affirmative defense that Mr. Rodriguez was disabled due to hip and back problems and that he could not constantly go up and down stairs to use a bathroom. Finally, the United States points to the court-ordered mediation in the eviction case, during which counsel for the Rodriguez family explained that Mr. Rodriguez had a disability that prevented him from going up and down stairs, and for that reason he had rejected the transfer to the Hoffman Gardens apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">We decline to decide whether the January 20, 2005 informal hearing or the January 21, 2005 letter were sufficient, by themselves, to put HHA on notice of Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s alleged disability and his need for an accommodation. But we have concluded that at least the statements made during the court-ordered mediation are sufficient to allow a reasonably jury to find that Mr. Rodriguez made a specific demand for an accommodation. That mediation took place as part of a court proceeding in which Mr. Rodriguez had already asserted through counsel that he was disabled due to hip and back problems and could not constantly go up and down stairs to use a bathroom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s attorney explained again during the mediation that Mr. Rodriguez had rejected the transfer because his disability prevented him from going up and down stairs. In fact, HHA acknowledges that during the mediation \u201cBonilla was ... made aware that Rodriguez had an alleged disability that prevented him from climbing the stairs.\u201d We conclude that at this point HHA had enough information to know of both Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s disability and his desire for an accommodation. In other words, Mr. Rodriguez had made a specific demand sufficient to trigger HHA\u2019s duty to provide a reasonable accommodation. <em>See Gaston, </em>167 F.3d at 1863. If HHA was \u201cskeptical of [Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s] alleged disability or [its] ability to provide an accommodation, it [was] incumbent upon [HHA] to request documentation or open a dialogue.\u201d <em>Jankowski Lee &amp; Assocs., </em>91 F.3d at 895. HHA contends that it did exactly that, and we address this argument next, in considering whether genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether HHA refused to provide the requested accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">We also conclude that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether HHA refused to provide the requested accommodation. HHA asserts that once Bonilla became aware of Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s disability and accommodation request during the June 30, 2005 mediation, he advised counsel for the Rodriguez family to provide HHA with medical documentation to support the alleged disability, and explained that once verified medical documentation was provided, Mr. Rodriguez would be allowed to remain at the Project 16 unit until another unit suited to his needs became available. HHA contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>that Mr. Rodriguez did not provide any medical documentation, and instead agreed to voluntarily abandon his tenancy in exchange for HHA allowing him to remain at the Project 16 unit until August 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In contrast, the United States asserts that HHA offered to transfer the Rodriguez family to the same unacceptable units previously offered at Hoffman Gardens, and refused to allow the family to remain in their existing unit at Project 16. The United States concedes that HHA offered to put the family on a waiting list for a unit that met Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s needs, but it asserts HHA would require the family to move out of the Project 16 unit while waiting for a suitable unit to become available.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This factual dispute over the specifics of the arrangement offered by HHA precludes summary judgment on this ground. Under the facts viewed in the light most favorable to the United States, HHA insisted that Mr. Rodriguez would have to move into a unit without his requested accommodation for an indefinite period of time. Under the FHA, the denial of an accommodation \u201ccan be both actual or constructive, as an indeterminate delay has the same effect as an outright denial.\u201d <em>Groome Resources Ltd. v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>284 F.3d 192, 199 (5th Cir.2000). We conclude therefore that HHA\u2019s requirement that Rodriguez family vacate their apartment at Project 16 and move into units without the requested accommodation for an indefinite period of time constitutes at least a constructive refusal to provide the accommodations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Finally, we note that at least two issues of law remain to be addressed at the summary judgment stage. First, the district court assumed without deciding that Mr. Rodriguez was disabled. HHA asks us to reach this issue on appeal, but we decline to do so. Instead, we remand the case to the district court to pass on this issue in the first instance. <em>See Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1218 (\u201cSince the district court did not determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact on the \u2018necessity\u2019 element, we remand only that issue so that it may review the summary judgment record in the first instance.\u201d). Likewise, we decline to decide in the first instance whether HHA was not required to provide a reasonable accommodation because the Rodriguez family was a direct threat under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">For these reasons, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of HHA, and REMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We also DENY HHA\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-5\">. The United States also claims that during the mediation Mr. Rodriguez presented a letter dated June 10, 2005, from his treating physician, Dr. Nunez, which stated: \u201cThis is to certify that [Mr. Rodriguez has been] my patient since May 1997. His diagnos[e]s are ... 3) osteoarthritis; 4) depression; 5) chronic shoulder pain; and 6) chronic back pain. He is see[ing] a pain specialist also. He will benefit [from] a stable and relax[ed] environment.\u201d However, as the district court ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>served, there is no evidence that this letter was actually presented at the mediation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-7\">. We reject HHA's argument that the United States failed to appeal the district court\u2019s ruling that \"no reasonable jury could conclude ... that HHA knew the requested accommodation was necessary.\u201d The United States' opening brief adequately raised this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b899-5\">. Indeed, we leave open the question of whether the Rodriguez family's answer to the eviction complaint might alone have been sufficient. We are aware that the district court may not have had occasion to consider this, as the United States in its brief in opposition to summary judgment did not point to the answer in the eviction matter as an instance in which HHA was told of Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b900-5\">. As noted above, the United States also contends that during the mediation, Mr. Rodriguez presented a letter from his treating physician, Dr. Nunez, but the district court correctly observed that there is no evidence that this letter was actually presented at the mediation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">. This conclusion is not altered by the fact that the Rodriguez family, rather than face eviction or accept HHA\u2019s proposal, subsequently chose to enter into a settlement agreement under which it would be allowed two extra months to find a new place to live. \"Under the Fair Housing Act, ... a violation occurs when the disabled resident is first denied a reasonable accommodation, irrespective of the remedies granted in subsequent proceedings.\u201d <em>Bryant Woods Inn, Inc. v. Howard Cnty., Md., </em>124 F.3d 597, 602 (4th Cir.1997). Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the United States, the constructive denial of Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s accommodation claim was complete at the mediation. The Rodriguez family's actions after, and in response to, that denial are irrelevant to the analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
