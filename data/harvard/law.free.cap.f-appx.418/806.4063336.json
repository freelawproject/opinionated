Kessler raises several issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review, we affirm Kessler\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">Kessler first argues there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions because the testimony of his unindicted co-conspirator, Eric Rogers, was so incredible that, as a matter of law, no rational trier of fact could rely upon his testimony to sustain Kessler\u2019s conviction. He argues Rogers was the only person to connect him to the growing operation and letting his conviction stand on the basis of Rogers\u2019 testimony would result in a complete miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>the disposition of a defendant\u2019s properly preserved motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1556 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">To obtain a conviction under \u00a7 841(a)(1), the Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kessler knowingly or intentionally manufactured marijuana. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). With regard to the conspiracy charge, the Government had to prove: (1) an illegal agreement existed to manufacture or possess with intent to distribute marijuana; (2) Kessler knew of the agreement; and (3) Kessler knowingly and voluntarily joined the agreement. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>313 F.3d 1278, 1284 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-17\">Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, there was sufficient evidence to support Kessler\u2019s convictions. First, contrary to Kessler\u2019s assertion, Rogers did not provide the only testimony linking Kessler to the home at 9014 Bone Bluff Drive. McCullum testified he rented the home to a man named Michael Kessler and he was paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>from Kessler\u2019s bank account. Kessler\u2019s bank accounts revealed he had made monthly payments to McCullum. Moreover, the home\u2019s electricity was in Kessler\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Further, Rogers\u2019 testimony was not incredible as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rogers\u2019 prior conviction, status as a cooperating witness, and capacity for truthfulness were explored on both direct and cross-examination. The trial judge properly instructed the jury on how to assess the credibility of witnesses and the particular caution that should be exercised when assessing the credibility of a cooperating witness. Thus, to the extent Rogers\u2019 testimony was necessary to convict Kessler, the jury\u2019s verdict implicitly reveals the jury found Rogers credible despite the impeaching evidence presented. Kessler cannot establish Rogers\u2019 testimony was incredible as a matter of law merely by pointing out that he had lied in the past, been involved in criminal activity, and stood to benefit from his testimony. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>775 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Kessler also challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the offenses of conviction involved 100 or more marijuana plants. Kessler asserts: (1) only Detective Tara Milstead testified there were 100 or more plants that were live and mature, with leaves and readily observable root formation; (2) Milstead\u2019s credibility was impeached by the testimony of the other witnesses who did not observe 100 or more marijuana plants; and (3) the district court\u2019s reliance on the jury\u2019s special finding that the offenses involved 100 or more plants was not specific enough to establish the threshold amount for triggering the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding drug quantity for clear error. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>935 F.2d 201, 205 (11th Cir.1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide that \u201ca \u2018plant\u2019 is an organism having leaves and a readily observable root formation <em>(e.g., </em>a marihuana cutting having roots, a rootball, or root hairs is a marihuana plant).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) cmt. n. 17; <em>see also United States v. Foree, </em>43 F.3d 1572, 1579-81 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that for sentencing purposes, cuttings and seedlings are not marijuana plants unless there is some readily observable evidence of root formation).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">The district court did not clearly err when it found Kessler was responsible for more than 100 marijuana plants and, thus, subject to a ten-year mandatory minimum. First, Milstead\u2019s testimony supported the district court\u2019s finding. Mil-stead testified three times about the amount of drugs found at 9014 Bone Bluff Drive, and all three times she stated there were more than 200 marijuana plants. She also testified she observed root formations on all the plants she counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">Milstead\u2019s testimony was not impeached by that of the other witnesses. To the extent McCollum and Brinkeroff testified there were a smaller number of plants, their estimates do not include plants that were found in the garage. Moreover, Rog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>ers testified there were 8 plants in one closet, roughly 50 plants in the other closet, and 64 plants in the garage, and he was sure the cuttings had roots when they were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Further, the jury\u2019s verdict supported the district court\u2019s finding. The jury was instructed that a marijuana plant is defined as an organism having leaves and a readily observable root formation and that cuttings could not count as plants unless they had some readily observable evidence-of root formation. The jury then specifically found both counts involved 100 or more marijuana plants. Accordingly, we affirm Kessler\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\">. We have repeatedly acknowledged that credibility determinations should be made by the jury. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir.1997) (collecting cases). Unless the witness\u2019s testimony was incredible as a matter of law, courts should not disturb the jury\u2019s credibility determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-14\">. A district court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous when they are supported by the testimony of law enforcement officers. <em>United States v.
