The gist of plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that the defendant negotiated and obtained the lease while he was serving as plaintiff\u2019s employee and agent, and that, in obtaining the lease for himself, defendant violated duties arising from a fiduciary relationship then existing between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The trial court found that during the term of an earlier lease under which plaintiff was the lessee of the land in question defendant was plaintiff\u2019s sublessee, and that defendant was plaintiff\u2019s agent or manager in the operation of a liquor bar located on the premises. The trial court found, however, that defendant commenced his negotiations to obtain the leasehold, which is the subject matter of this litigation, only after the termination of his relationship as plaintiff\u2019s employee or agent, and that, in obtaining the new lease for himself, defendant violated no fiduciary duty owing to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">On this appeal from the judgment, plaintiff\u2019s principal contention is that there is no substantial evidence in the record to sustain the findings to the effect that any fiduciary relationship theretofore existing between the parties had been terminated when defendant negotiated for the lease in question. Plaintiff argues that the evidence is such as to compel a finding that defendant was its agent and manager in the operation of the golf club properties, and that defendant violated duties stemming from this fiduciary relationship when he sought to lease the premises on his own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">In obedience to the well established rule, we have surveyed the record in a light favorable to the findings and conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>of the court below (see 4 Cal.Jur.2d 485 et seq., Appeal and Error, \u00a7606). We conclude that the challenged findings of the trial court are well supported and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\">In 1947 plaintiff acquired the lessee\u2019s interest in a lease of a golf course and clubhouse located in the Pomona area. The owners of the property were Ealf and Lalla Goddard.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In October, 1952, defendant and his wife met with Dr. Joseph N. Reynolds, plaintiff\u2019s president, and presented to him a written proposal setting forth terms under which defendant would take over operations of the club. An oral agreement was reached, providing that defendant would undertake the operation of the club properties, would keep all gross receipts therefrom and would pay plaintiff $1,000 per month, plus 8 per cent of the gross receipts in excess of $10,000 per month. It was agreed that the relationship would continue until the end of plaintiff\u2019s lease, so long as defendant \u201chonestly\u201d reported the amount of rent due. Defendant further agreed to purchase the inventory of liquor and food then on hand, to maintain and repair the premises and facilities at his own expense and to pay all salaries, taxes, utilities, license fees and other expenses incident to the club\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Defendant took over the operation of the club on or about November 1, 1952, at which time he paid plaintiff for the liquor and food inventory. During the ensuing five and one-half years, and until August 1, 1958, defendant regularly mailed monthly checks to plaintiff as directed. Various of these checks carried the notations \u201cbase rental\u201d and \u201crental\u201d which were never questioned by plaintiff\u2019s president. Defendant also submitted to plaintiff monthly financial reports indicating the amount of gross receipts and some of these reports indicated the amount due to plaintiff as \u201cbase rent\u201d and \u201ctotal rent.\u201d It does not appear that defendant was at any time asked to disclose to plaintiff the net amount of his profits in the operation of the country club.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Following the year 1951, the \u201con-sale\u201d liquor license used at the clubhouse was issued to \u201cReynolds, Joseph N., doing business as Pomona Golf and Country Club.\u201d On January 21, 1953, defendant signed an affidavit in support of an application for the renewal of said license wherein he was designated as \u201cmanager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Soon after taking over the country club, defendant was instrumental in the formation of a private organization, the</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Pomona Country Club Association, the members of which paid a monthly amount to defendant who refunded a portion thereof for the use of the association. In 1955, when defendant undertook construction of an additional nine holes on the property, members of the association contributed their services in aid of this project, after being assured by plaintiff that defendant was a sublessee under a verbal month to month lease. Also pursuant to this assurance, the association made several capital improvements on the clubhouse property.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In 1957, plaintiff\u2019s lessors executed an <em>inter vivos </em>trust, under the terms of which the Title Insurance and Trust Company (hereinafter called the \u201cTrust Company\u201d) took title to the property covered by the lease. In July of the same year, plaintiff\u2019s president contacted the president of the Trust Company in regard to an extension or renewal of plaintiff\u2019s lease. For some time thereafter, Dr. Reynolds carried on more or less continuous negotiations with Trust Company officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Prior to July 9, 1958, one Mr. Harrison of the Trust Company met defendant in connection with certain inspections of the country club premises. At one of these meetings defendant indicated that he would like to lease the premises as an individual, but the record indicates that Harris on did not discuss the matter with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In March, 1958, plaintiff engaged one Thomas L. Garry, an attorney, to undertake negotiations with the Trust Company in connection with the lease. At that time, Garry was informed that the Trust Company had received no offers from any other person and was negotiating with no one else for a lease on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Several weeks prior to July 9, 1958, plaintiff\u2019s president retained the law firm of Krag and Krag to negotiate for a new lease of the country club property. On July <em>9 </em>a meeting was held between representatives of plaintiff and officials of the Trust Company. At this time Dr. Reynolds made the statement that defendant did not represent him, that he did not trust defendant and that he was negotiating for himself alone. After further negotiations, it appeared that Reynolds and the Trust Company were unable to agree upon the terms of a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">On July, 29, 1958, Dr. Reynolds and his attorneys called upon defendant, informing him that the Trust Company was confused with respect to his status, that the Trust Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>had inferred that defendant was plaintiff\u2019s tenant, whereas it was plaintiff\u2019s view that defendant was its \u201cmanager\u201d and subject to plaintiff\u2019s supervision. On August 5, 1958, defendant was handed a letter signed by Dr. Reynolds which informed him that he was discharged. At the same time, defendant was served with a \u201cNotice to Quit\u201d and a \u201cNotice of Non-Responsibility\u201d was posted in two places on the clubhouse premises. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney told defendant: \u201cNow that you are denying that you were an employee, we certainly couldn\u2019t leave the [liquor] license here\u201d and that \u201cWe can\u2019t trust you with the license. You have lied and a license is too valuable to leave with you .'. . \u201d Defendant later called Dr. Reynolds and asked him if he had been fired; Dr. Reynolds replied in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\">The following day, at a conference attended by defendant, plaintiff\u2019s representatives and the attorneys of the parties, defendant stated that the Trust Company had called him and requested that he bring his attorney to the Trust Company offices for the purpose of discussing the terms of a lease. Defendant further indicated that he intended to do so. Thereafter, on September 18, 1958, the Trust Company and defendant and his wife executed a written l\u00e9ase on the country club property, for a term of seven years, commencing November 1, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">On the basis of the facts disclosed in the foregoing recital, the trial court was warranted in concluding (1) that the relationship between plaintiff and defendant was that of sublessor and sublessee; (2) that any fiduciary relationship between the parties was terminated on or about August 6, 1958; (3) that there were no negotiations for a lease as between defendant and the Trust Company prior to August 6, 1958; (4) that before the commencement of any negotiations between defendant and the Trust Company plaintiff\u2019s efforts to obtain a renewal or extension had proved unsuccessful; and (5) that under the circumstances appearing, defendant did not make use of any confidential information and did not violate any fiduciary duty owing to plaintiff in leasing the property on his own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Factually, the instant case is very similar to <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Clare, </em>6 Cal.App.2d 504 [44 P.2d 634], where the plaintiff sued to have it determined that a lease secured by a former employee was held in trust for plaintiff\u2019s benefit. For several years the defendant was employed as a manager of plaintiff\u2019s cigar store, but was discharged when the business became unprofitable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>After his discharge, the defendant procured a lease covering the premises in which the cigar store had been operating. The trial court found that the lease was obtained by the defendant after the relation of employee had been terminated and that it was not procured through the use of any secret or confidential information obtained by said defendant during the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In affirming the judgment, the appellate court held that there was substantial evidence to support the findings and commented as follows: \u201cThe fact that plaintiff and his predecessors had been operating on a month to month tenancy was generally known and discussed. It was not a \u2018secret of the trade.\u2019 Anyone in or out of the business could have ascertained whether a term lease were recorded and, upon inquiry, could have learned the terms of the tenancy under which the premises were occupied. This information is not like a confidential list of customers such as is involved in the \u2018laundry\u2019 and similar eases. There the list is confidential information acquired by reason of the employment only. Here the information is neither confidential nor secret, and it could be learned by anyone outside of the employment. The distinction is found in <em>Avocado Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Wyse, </em>122 Cal.App. 627 [10 P.2d 485], and in those cases in which the business was of such a character that it depended upon keeping its lists of customers and other information secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u201cIn view of the court\u2019s finding here that the lease was obtained after the employee\u2019s discharge and upon information which was neither secret nor confidential, and which was not obtained by reason of, or in the course of, the employment the case of <em>Gower </em>v. <em>Andrew, </em>59 Cal. 119 [43 Am.Rep. 242], and similar authorities have no application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In <em>Cicurel </em>v. <em>Plaza Service Corp., </em>20 Cal.App.2d 211 [66 P.2d 706], another case involving a generally similar factual situation, the applicable law was stated as follows: \u201cIt is well settled that an agent must use the utmost good faith and must not postpone his principal\u2019s interest to his own or use information acquired in the course of his agency as a means of acquiring an advantage for himself <em>(Gower </em>v. <em>Andrews, [sic] </em>59 Cal. 119 [43 Am.Rep. 242]; <em>Rezos </em>v. <em>Zahn &amp; Nagel Co., </em>78 Cal.App. 728 [246 P. 564] ; <em>Consumers\u2019 Co. </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>227 Ill.App. 552; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>108 Ill. 39 [48 Am.Rep. <em>541]); </em>but where there is no breach of duty in these respects, and a lease is obtained upon information which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>is not secret or confidential, or by reason of or in the course of an employment, the rule has no application <em>(Cohn </em>v. <em>Clare, </em>6 Cal.App.2d 504 [44 P.2d 634]).\u201d (And see 41 Cal.L.Rev. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Quite cursorily, plaintiff advances the contention that there is no substantial evidence to support an award of damages to defendant on his cross-complaint.  This assignment of error is entitled to no consideration for the reason that appellant has completely failed to set forth in its brief any sufficient statement of the evidence material to the issue. <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indent. Co., </em>177 Cal.App.2d 539 [2 Cal.Rptr. 325].) Respondent\u2019s brief sets forth a summary of evidence which appears to be entirely sufficient to support the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Fox, P. J., and Ashburn, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
