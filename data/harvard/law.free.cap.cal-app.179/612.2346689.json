J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADN\">This is an action brought by the Menzels, as sellers of certain real property, against Salka and Thornton, real estate agents with whom the Menzels had listed their home for sale, to recover alleged secret profits and commissions. Defendants appeal from a judgment in favor of plaintiffs for $5,000 secret profits and a $2,500 commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">The Menzels gave defendants an exclusive listing on the property from February 3, to May 7, 1957, with an agreed commission of 5 per cent of the selling price. Defendants procured a buyer, Mrs. Lina Rosenstein, and on February 27, 1957, the Menzels and Mrs. Rosenstein opened an escrow at the Bank of America covering the purchase of the property. This escrow was numbered 213-9132. The agreed price to be paid by Mrs. Rosenstein to the Menzels was $62,000 and the commission to be paid to defendants was $2,500. Mrs. Rosenstein paid $6,200 cash into escrow as a deposit. On April 10 and 11, 1957, Mrs. Rosenstein informed Salka that she could not complete the purchase of the property and that she was willing to take $1,200 for her equity and would forfeit the balance of the $6,200 to be relieved of her contract. Salka did not inform the Menzels of Mrs. Rosenstein\u2019s offer, but instead, he opened an escrow between himself and Mrs. Rosenstein on April 12, 1957, by the terms of which Salka was to purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the property from Mrs. Bosenstein for $57,000 and receive a credit of $5,000, being the balance of the deposit made by Mrs. Bosenstein in her escrow with the Menzels. The new escrow was opened at the same branch of the Bank of America and was given the number. 213-9132A and was maintained in a file separate from the Menzel-Bosenstein escrow (No. 213-9132). The same escrow officer, a Mrs. Downing, handled both transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">At no time between April 10, and April 16, did Salka notify the Menzels that he was dealing with Mrs. Bosenstein. On April 17, Salka and Thornton called at the Menzels\u2019 home. The first item discussed at this meeting related to a lien which was outstanding on the property. Salka suggested to the Menzels that if they wished to withdraw from the transaction they could do so without difficulty and that because of the existing lien, they could not give clear title. The Menzels informed Salka and Thornton that they would clear the title and that they wished to go through with the deal. As to the balance of the conversation of the 17th, the testimony is conflicting in several particulars. Salka testified that he told the Menzels that: \u2018\u2018They [the Bosensteins] * are not going to complete the transaction on the basis of the way it has been originally set up because they have approached me and asked me to purchase their interest or equity in the property, and that I have accomplished this, and that an escrow is now open within your escrow at the Beverly Wilshire branch of the Bank of America in Mrs. Downing\u2019s office, and that I have made a, placed a deposit in the amount of $5,700, or ten per cent of the purchase price of $57,000 which I am going to pay for the house in my purchase from Lina Bosenstein, and I want you to know this because it is my fiduciary relationship to indicate to you, as your agent, that I am becoming a principal in this transaction.\u201d Salka further testified that he told the Menzels: \u201cI am going to buy the house. I can see no reason why it shouldn\u2019t close, because I\u2019m going to use a portion of the Bosenstein money in addition to having put up the $5,700 into this escrow.\u201d and also that; \u201cthey could succeed to my position; if they felt they wanted to take advantage of my position, they were welcome to do so. . . .\u201d Under cross-examination, Salka admitted that at no time did he tell the Menzels that he was acquiring the $6,200 deposit for $1,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">* Apparently both Mr. and Mrs. Bosenstein were negotiating for the property but only Mrs. Bosenstein went into escrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The defendant Thornton testified that during the meeting of April 17, he informed the Menzels as follows: \u201cBecause of the law of agency we must inform you of any transaction that takes place or has taken place, and I want it clearly understood that though Mr. Salka is in escrow now with the Rosensteins for the purchase of your house at $57,000, that you can accede to his position. Mr. Salka in his deal made it contingent upon Mr. Rosenstein getting title thereto or Mrs. Rosenstein getting title thereto; and if you wish to get into Mr. Salka\u2019s position in this transaction in any way that you want, I will back you up. You can go to the escrow. . . . Mr. Menzel then said to me, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be bothered with the details of these things\u2019 . . . And I said \u2018Well, he is getting part of the deposit of the $6,200 that is in escrow\u2019 . . . Whereupon Mrs. Menzel said, \u2018Does Mr. Salka get the $6,200?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Virtually all of it,\u2019 and I was going on to explain further when Mr. Menzel interceded and said again, \u2018I don\u2019t want to get into the details on this thing. . . .\u2019 \u201d On cross-examination, Thornton was asked the following question: \u201cNow Mr. Thornton, do you remember either Mr. Salka or yourself saying to Mr. and Mrs. Menzel that the Rosensteins were willing to give up $5,000 to get out of the deal?\u201d Answer: \u201cNo.\u201d Moreover, when Salka was questioned by the Menzels\u2019 attorney under section 2055 of the Code of Civil Procedure, he testified as follows: Question: \u201cYes. Now, having heard this letter, may I ask you again, Mr. Salka, did you on April 17th tell Mr. and Mrs. Menzel that you had bought out the $6,200 deposit of Mr. and Mrs. Rosenstein at a $5,000 discount for $1,200?\u201d Answer: \u201cI did not.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Concerning the conversation relative to Salka\u2019s purchase of the house, Mr. Menzel testified as follows: \u201cQuestion: Well, then, what happened? Answer: And then [there] was general conversation, and Mr. Thornton told us that Mr. Salka likes this house and would even consider one day to buy it from the Rosensteins. Question: What did you say? Answer: It\u2019s her house so faj? as I was concerned. \u2018It\u2019s her house. She can do what she wants. \u2019 Question: Do you remember anything else being said at that time ? Answer: No, not that I recall what is bearing on this ease. Question: Did Mr. Salka or Mr. Thornton tell you that Mr. Salka was in escrow with Mrs. Rosenstein? Answer: No. Question: Was there anything mentioned about Mr. Salka having bought the house for $57,000 ? Answer: No. Question: Was anything said about Mr. Salka picking up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>deposit of the Bosensteins for $1200? Answer: No.\u201d Mrs. Menzel. testified in a like <em>manner and to </em>the same <em>effect.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">It is obvious that the trial court believed the testimony of the Menzels and that it disbelieved the testimony of the defendants, for in its findings the court found that the Menzels had no knowledge nor were they informed by the defendants of any of the following facts: \u201c (1) Lina Bosenstein could not complete the purchase of plaintiffs\u2019 property; (2) Lina Bosenstein was willing to sell the $6,200.00 deposited by her in Escrow for $1,200.00; (3) Saul M. Salka had entered into an Escrow with Lina Bosenstein to purchase the aforementioned property from Lina Bosenstein for the sum of $57,000.00; and (4) Saul M. Salka was credited with $5,000.00 deposited by Lina Bosenstein in the Escrow between plaintiffs and Lina Bosenstein.\u201d Defendants, however, assert that these findings are erroneous as a matter of law. They argue that the evidence discloses without any doubt, that the Menzels had knowledge of Salka\u2019s pending purchase of the property. They point to the admitted fact that the Menzels negotiated with Salka for the repurchase of certain appliances and in particular, a refrigerator and that at the time Mr. Menzel was talking to Salka, he asked Salka \u201cto sell me an electric appliance, a refrigerator, which he <em>got so </em>cheap.\u201d However, Mr. Menzel explained this remark with a further statement. In response to the question \u201cHow could he sell it to you if he [Salka] wasn\u2019t buying the house?\u201d, Mr. Menzel answered: \u201cHe will buy the house from Mrs. Bosenstein after the closing of the \u2014what is this\u2014escrow.\u201d This latter statement was consistent with the position maintained by the Menzels throughout the trial; i.e., that they knew that Salka was intending to buy the house from Mrs. Bosenstein, but that they thought this was a separate transaction, quite apart from their sale to her. This position is entirely in harmony with the findings challenged by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Defendants further point out that on April 30, 1957, the Menzels executed a bill of sale in favor of Salka and his wife for certain of the household furnishings and contend that this act is inconsistent with the Menzels\u2019 testimony that they had no knowledge of the agreement between Salka and Mrs. Bosenstein and that it is also inconsistent with the finding to the same effect. As to this transaction, Mr. Menzel testified that Mrs. Downing (the escrow officer) requested him and his wife to come down to the bank and sign a document and that when <em>he saw that it was made out </em>in favor of Salka, he ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>jected vigorously, saying to Mrs. Downing: \u201cWe can\u2019t; impossible [to] sign this document.\u201d He further testified that Mrs. Downing told him they must sign the bill of sale \u201cBecause we sold this house to Mrs. Rosenstein\u201d and that signing the document was only a \u201ctechnicality.\u201d The trial court could have inferred from this that the Menzels were not cognizant of the import of the document they were signing and that the statements of the escrow agent misled and confused them. Under the circumstances, the court reasonably could have concluded that the execution of the bill of sale did not have the effect of establishing actual knowledge on the part of the Menzels that Salka and Rosenstein had entered into a transaction for the sale of the property. Thus a legitimate inference remains, viz., that the Menzels believed that Salka was contemplating or had arranged for a purchase of the property from Mrs. Rosenstein <em>after </em>the close of the Menzel-Rosenstein escrow and that they did not know that a contemporaneous escrow between Salka and Mrs. Rosenstein had been opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We come next to defendants\u2019 argument that the Menzels had knowledge of the Salka-Rosenstein transaction through the escrow itself. In this connection, defendants argue that there was only one escrow and that the knowledge of the escrow agent regarding the nature of the Salka-Rosenstein transaction would thus be imputed to the Menzels, citing <em>Thein </em>v. <em>Sticha, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 295 [209 P.2d 13] and <em>Early </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>109 Cal.App. 489 [293 P. 136]. These cases stand for the proposition that the escrow officer, as an agent for all the parties to an escrow transaction, has knowledge of all of the contents of the escrow file and that such knowledge is imputed to the principals. The general rule stated in <em>Early </em>v. <em>Owens, supra, </em>has been greatly modified in later cases. (See <em>Kroeher </em>v. <em>Hurlbert, </em>38 Cal.App.2d 261 [101 P.2d 101]; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Stoahes, </em>46 Cal.App.2d 285 [115 P.2d 830]; and <em>Steiner </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>35 Cal.2d 713 [221 P.2d 9].) Moreover, that rule is not applicable in a case where there are in reality two escrows. <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Stoahes, supra.) </em>In the present case, the court found that the Salka-Rosenstein escrow was \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the Menzel-Rosenstein escrow. Defendants assign this finding as error, arguing that in their second amended complaint the Menzels admitted that there was in fact only one escrow and that a finding contrary to such an admission is error.  It is the rule that facts admitted</p>\n<p id=\"Anq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>by the pleadings are outside the issues to be tried <em>(Fuentes </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>31 Cal.2d 1, 4 [187 P.2d 752]), and that findings contrary to such admitted facts will not support the judgment <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Beverley, </em>126 Cal.App.2d 89 [271 P.2d 965]).  Assuming that the complaint admits there was only one escrow transaction, still defendants\u2019 contention is without merit. The record discloses that the parties proceeded to trial on the theory that the question of whether there was one escrow or two escrows was in issue. During the course of the trial, no suggestion was made by defendants that the pleadings admitted there was only one escrow. Considerable evidence was introduced on this question without objection. Under these circumstances, the defendants may not now complain of a finding, amply supported by the evidence, that is contrary to the admission. Apropos this point is the observation in <em>Weidenmueller </em>v. <em>Stearns etc. Co., </em>128 Cal. 623, 625 [61 P. 374] that: \u201cThis court does not look with approval upon the practice of trying a case in the lower court upon the theory that the pleadings are sufficient, and, without making any objection to them or to the evidence, raising the point here for the first time that some of the issues were, in fact, admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Defendants further argue that even if the finding that there were two escrows is correct, nevertheless, the Menzels had constructive knowledge of the scope and extent of the Salka-Rosenstein transaction. The evidence discloses there were in fact two separate files maintained by the escrow officer. The Menzel-Rosenstein file was numbered 213-9132 and the Salka-Rosenstein file was numbered 213-9132A. An examination of these files, which were exhibits before the trial court, discloses that several documents which should have been in the \u201cA\u201d file only, were actually included in the original or Menzel-Rosenstein file. The documents pertaining to the Salka-Rosenstein escrow which were in the Menzel-Rosenstein file were (1) a settlement sheet, (2) a copy of the bill of sale for the household furnishings, (3) a statement of identity from the Land Title Company, and (4) a \u201cbeneficiary\u2019s statement.\u201d Defendant argues that these documents were at all times open to the Menzels and that a perusal of them would have shown that Salka was purchasing the property from Mrs. Rosenstein and that he was paying $57,000 for it rather than the $62,000 which the Menzels were to be paid. From this defendants argue that by simple arithmetic, the Menzels would have been apprised of the fact that Salka was acquiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>the house for $5,000 less than the Menzel-Rosenstein contract provided and thus would have knowledge of the discount in that amount. An examination of the Menzel-Rosenstein file discloses that defendants\u2019 assertions are correct. However, the information contained in that file was not such as to give the Menzels constructive knowledge of the only information crucial to this ease; i.e., that Mrs. Rosenstein had offered to sell her equity of $6,200 at a discount and that Salka had purchased it at the offered discount. The fact that Salka was paying only $57,000 for the property does not of itself impart such knowledge. The reduction of the purchase price could have resulted from some agreement or consideration of a nature entirely removed from the Menzel-Rosenstein transaction. There is no disclosure that Salka was in fact receiving the $5,000 discount as a result of the inability of Mrs. Rosenstein to complete the purchase. This is the vice of defendants\u2019 conduct. They did not disclose the fact that Mrs. Rosenstein was willing to sell her equity for $1,200 and that Salka had purchased it. The case of <em>Steiner </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>35 Cal.2d 713 [221 P.2d 9], is apposite. At page 718 the court said: \u201cNotice of the contents of the escrow agreement is imputed through the escrow holder to the parties. (Citing cases.) The escrow instructions provided for payment of $2,000 to Rowley, and the Steiners are charged with notice that he would be paid that amount. However, knowledge that such payment would be made does not include notice that the consideration for it was the broker\u2019s inducement of his principal to purchase the land. The escrow documents disclosed no illegal purpose for the payment. Rowley might have been entitled to it as reimbursement to him for advances which he had made for the vendor, <em>or in connection with a transaction entirely unrelated to that of the Steiners.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus it is clear that unless the Menzels had access to the Salka-Rosenstein or \u201cA\u201d file, they could not have ascertained anything more than that Salka was purchasing the property for $57,000. Such knowledge would not be sufficient to charge them with notice of the true nature of the Salka-Rosenstein transaction. Furthermore, the testimony of the escrow officer makes it clear that the Menzels did not have access to the \u201cA\u201d file and thus they are not chargeable with knowledge on that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We next come to the defendants\u2019 assertion that even if the Menzels had no knowledge of the Salka-Rosenstein transaction, still there was no \u201csecret profit\u201d accruing to Salka or any detriment to the Menzels which could form the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the judgment. It is true, as defendants contend, that the usual case involving secret profits of a real estate agent takes the form of a direct payment to the agent or of a \u201cdummy\u201d sale by the agent whereby he takes advantage of the difference between the price the buyer is willing to pay and the price the seller is willing to take. But the rarity of the transaction in this case does not militate against its unlawfulness nor does it relieve defendants of their fiduciary obligation of full disclosure to their principal of all facts affecting their principal\u2019s interest in the transaction and their own interjection into the deal. The simple fact is, that the defendants withheld vital information from the Menzels, and by taking advantage of the withheld information, Salka was able to acquire the Menzel property at a $5,000 discount. Salka thus profited by the transaction in the amount of the discount, or $5,000. It is immaterial that the Menzels were paid exactly the amount for which they were willing to sell the house and which they had agreed to accept from Mrs. Rosenstein. Furthermore, it is immaterial that Mrs. Rosenstein might not have sold her $6,200 equity to the Menzels for $1,200. She did sell it to Salka for that amount, but Salka did not disclose to the Menzels that the offer had been made or that he was taking it upon his own behalf. Thus, through a breach of his fiduciary obligation, Salka acquired a $5,000 equity in the Menzels\u2019 property; a secret profit to which he was not entitled.  The various breaches of fiduciary duty committed by Salka (and by his employer, Thornton) are clear when measured by the principles stated in <em>Realty Co. of America </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>160 Cal.App.2d 178 at page 190 [325 P.2d 171] : \u201cUnder California law, there is imposed upon the real estate agent the same undivided service and loyalty that is imposed upon a trustee in favor of his beneficiary <em>(Sands </em>v. <em>Eagle Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>83 Cal.App.2d 312, 318 [188 P.2d 782]; <em>Langford </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>200 Cal. 192, 197 [252 P. 602]). Section 2230 of the Civil Code charges such an agent with the duty of <em>fullest disclosure of all material facts </em>concerning the transaction in question that might affect the principal\u2019s decision <em>(Langford </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>p. 196; <em>Rattray </em>v. <em>Scudder, </em>28 Cal.2d 214, 223 [169 P.2d 371, 164 A.L.R. 1356]).  The agent is required to exercise the <em>highest degree </em>of good faith toward his principal. He may not obtain for himself an advantage over the latter by misrepresentation, deceit or <em>concealment of the essential facts of a transaction (Bell </em>v. <em>Scudder, </em>78 Cal.App.2d 448, 454 [177 P.2d <em>796]). </em> Unless otherwise agreed upon, an agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>is burdened with the duty <em>not to compete </em>with his principal concerning the <em>subject matter </em>of the agency.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Taggart, </em>51 Cal.2d 736 [336 P.2d 534]. In every aspect of the above rules, Salka and Thornton have been remiss. They did not exercise that degree of loyalty required of a trustee in favor of his beneficiary, for not only did they fail to make a disclosure of the essential fact of Mrs. Rosenstein\u2019s offer, but the evidence also sufficiently discloses an active concealment of that fact. Moreover, Salka was guilty of a direct violation of his fiduciary duty when he competed with his principals concerning the subject matter of the agency. The right to the first refusal of Mrs. Rosenstein\u2019s offer belonged to the Menzels, not to Salka. If the Menzels had accepted the offer, they would have been able to keep the house and, in addition, the $5,000 which Mrs. Rosenstein was willing to forfeit. Thus, by the act of buying Mrs. Rosenstein\u2019s equity for himself, Salka was in direct competition with his principals with respect to that equity.  As was said in <em>Cicurel </em>v. <em>Plaza Service Corp., </em>20 Cal.App.2d 211, 213 [66 P.2d 706] : \u201cIt is well settled that an agent must use the utmost good faith and must not postpone his principal\u2019s interest to his own <em>or use information acquired in the course of his agency as a means of acquiring an advantage for himself </em>(citing cases). ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) The actions of Salka constitute a direct violation of this rule. From the foregoing it is apparent that Salka has made a secret profit at the expense of the Menzels and that the argument to the contrary made by defendants is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Finally, defendants argue that the agency relationship between themselves and the Menzels had terminated at the time they procured the buyer, Mrs. Rosenstein, and was therefore terminated prior to the time of her offer to sell her equity.  It is true, that when defendants produced a buyer and the Menzels executed a contract of sale with that buyer, the defendants had earned their commissions. <em>(Herring </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>110 Cal.App.2d 322 [242 P.2d 963].)  It is also true that when the subject matter of the agency is sold or otherwise disposed of, the agency terminates. <em>(E. A. Sirout Western Realty </em>v. <em>Gregoire, </em>101 Cal.App.2d 512 [225 P.2d 585].) But in the present case, the sale of the property was in escrow and thus the transaction was not completed when Salka made his deal with Mrs. Rosenstein. Moreover, as admitted by their own testimony, defendants continued to act as agents and fiduciaries of the Menzels, and so informed them, after the opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>of <em>both </em>escrows, and the Menzels continued to rely upon them in such capacity. In these circumstances, the fiduciary relationship between defendants and the Menzels was not terminated upon the opening of the escrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Defendants\u2019 further argument that the award of $5,000 for secret profits constitutes exemplary damages, since the loss to the Menzels could not be computed with accuracy, is not well taken. The judgment is not based upon a speculation as to what might have occurred had Salka performed his duty faithfully and disclosed the Rosenstein offer to the Menzels, but is rather, predicated upon the <em>fact </em>that Salka profited by reason of his breach of trust in the amount of $5,000. In this respect the judgment simply orders that Salka disgorge his ill-gotten profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In view of the foregoing it is unnecessary to pass <em>upon </em>other questions discussed in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Ashburn, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
