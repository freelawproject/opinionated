Appellant\u2019s counsel relies primarily upon appellant\u2019s testimony, disregarding the facts that such testimony was directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>contradicted by respondent\u2019s witnesses, and that the court believed them, not appellant. There is therefore no merit in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Appellant was employed as a teacher by the San Rafael Military Academy in August, 1957. He was told by the superintendent, respondent Hinton, that his duties would be to teach the fifth grade and to act as a counsellor or supervisor at one of the dormitories, the nature and importance of these duties being explained to him in detail. Later, he signed a contract for the school year, September 1, 1957, to June 15, 1958, in which it was agreed that he was to teach and \u201cperform such additional services as may be required\u2019\u2019 by the academy. He entered upon and performed all of these duties until November 4. On that day he told the superintendent \u201cI am going to tell you something which you won\u2019t like, but I am giving up my dormitory supervision.\u2019\u2019 The superintendent said that he would have to replace appellant. The next day, in the presence of the superintendent, the headmaster of the lower school, and the commandant, he said \u201cI feel today the same as I did yesterday.\u2019\u2019 Two days later, he \u201coffered . . . [his] services as a teacher\u2019\u2019 to Dr. Hinton, but did not offer to do the dormitory duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The evidence shows that it is customary for teachers to do dormitory duty at respondent academy, and that this is a matter of considerable importance to the academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The court made findings setting out substantially the foregoing facts, and concluded that respondent academy was entitled to and did terminate the contract. In this the court was correct. Appellant stated that he would not perform a substantial term of his contract. This was an anticipatory breach. (Rest., Contracts, \u00a7 318; <em>Crane </em>v. <em>East Side Canal etc. </em>Co., 6 Cal.App.2d 361, 367 [44 P.2d 455]; <em>Cold Min. &amp; Water Co. </em>v. <em>Swinerton, </em>23 Cal.2d 19, 29 [142 P.2d 22].) The breach was clearly substantial. (Rest., Contracts, \u00a7 275.) It was wilful and intentional and related to an important part of appellant\u2019s duties. He would not have been hired if he had not agreed to perform the duties in question. Moreover, the contract is one of employment for a specified term, to which Labor Code, section 2924, applies. That section states \u201cAn employment for a specified term may be terminated at any time by the employer in case of any wilful breach of duty by the employee . . .\u201d <em>(Cf. </em>Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2856, 2857; <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>Republic Productions, </em>44 Cal.App.2d 651 [112 P.2d 972] ; <em>May </em>v. <em>New York Motion Picture Corp., </em>45 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>App. 396, 403-404 [187 P. 785].) In this ease, the contract specifically provides that the academy \u201creserves, the right to terminate the terms of this employment in case of any wilful breach of duty ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Bray, P. J., and Tobriner, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
