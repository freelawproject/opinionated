Following a trial by jury defendant was adjudged guilty of robbery of the first degree. As recited in respondent\u2019s brief, \u201cThe jury also found to be true \u2018the charge\u2019 that defendant Hoff was armed at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-17\">\u2018 \u2018 The court found that the verdict as to the defendant having been armed at the time of his arrest was erroneous in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>that it made a finding on a matter not alleged or supported by the evidence and ordered that verdict stricken. The allegation of being armed was stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">\u201cA probation report was ordered and defendant was arraigned for judgment; probation was denied and he was sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison for the term prescribed by law. Judgment was entered June 29, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">\u201cOn July 9, 1956, a document entitled \u2018Notice op Appeal\u2019 was filed with the Clerk of the Court. This appeal is from the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The evidence was conflicting. It would serve no useful purpose to detail the differences. It is sufficient to note that the trial judge\u2019s finding that, \u201cthe verdict as to the defendant having been armed at the time of his arrest, was erroneous in that it made a finding on a matter not alleged or supported by the evidence, \u2019 \u2019 is, as a matter of law, supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">In the light of the law therefore, the judgment should be, and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">White, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
