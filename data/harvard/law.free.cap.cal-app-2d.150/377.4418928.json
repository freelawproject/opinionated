After a hearing on September 27, 1955, of an order to show cause in re contempt for defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the support provisions of the judgment, the court commissioner found that the petitioner was delinquent in the sum of $10,320 as of April 30, 1955, but no finding was made by the commissioner as to defendant\u2019s ability to pay the delinquent amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>or any definite part thereof and, based on the commissioner\u2019s findings, the respondent court found \u201cthat the defendant had the ability to comply with said order of court to a greater extent; that the defendant failed to comply with said order of court; and that his failure to comply was wilful\u201d; adjudged him in contempt of court; sentenced him to serve five days in the county jail and suspended the execution of the sentence on condition that he make future payments as they became due. On February 10, 1956, pursuant to a subsequent order to show cause why the suspension of sentence should not be revoked, the respondent court ordered that \u201cSo much of the suspension of sentence as amounts to confinement of 3 days in the County Jail is vacated and that portion of the sentence is ordered executed.\u201d Thereafter, the court revoked the suspension of two of the five days\u2019 sentence; revoked the stay of the sentence and remanded the defendant to the custody of the sheriff to serve five days pursuant to the adjudication of contempt dated February 27, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The sole question for consideration is whether the court\u2019s finding that petitioner \u201chad the ability to comply with said order of court to a greater extent\u201d is sufficiently definite to constitute a finding that petitioner had the ability to pay any or all of the delinquent monthly payments aggregating $10,-320.  An adjudication of contempt cannot be sustained in the absence of an unequivocal finding of ability to comply with the court\u2019s order. <em>(In re Gowden, </em>139 Cal. 244 [73 P. 156]; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>215 Cal. 548, 552 [11 P.2d 865] ; <em>In re Lande, </em>96 Cal.App.2d 926, 931 [216 P.2d 909] ; <em>In re McCausland, </em>130 Cal.App.2d 708, 709 [279 P.2d 820].)  No presumptions or intendments may be indulged in support of the contempt order and the findings and judgment are strictly construed to favor the accused <em>(Raiden </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>34 Cal.2d 83, 86 [206 P.2d 1081] ; <em>Ruppe </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>127 Cal.App. 118, 121 [15 P.2d 197]; <em>In re Felthoven, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 465, 470 [171 P.2d 47]).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In the instant matter, the finding of ability to comply with the court\u2019s order was qualified by the phrase \u201cto a greater extent.\u201d This is a relative phrase, and not subject to interpretation with any exactitude. A finding of ability to comply \u201cto a greater extent\u201d with an order requiring payment of specified monthly amounts is not a finding of ability to pay any specific delinquent monthly installment and is so vague, indefinite and uncertain as to leave to conjecture the amount, if any, which the petitioner had the ability to pay and is not a sufficient finding of ability to comply with the court\u2019s order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>to sustain the adjudication of contempt. <em>(In re Scroggin, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 281, 283 [229 P.2d 489].)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The writ is granted, the petitioner is discharged and his bond is ordered exonerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Fox, Acting P. J., and Ashburn, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The petition of Maria Michelena, real party in interest, for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 19,1957.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-17\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
