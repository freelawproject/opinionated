On the second day of trial, at least one of counsel for this defendant withdrew. The trial proceeded, and the jury returned a verdict for defendant corporation in the sum of $100. Through its president, who is not an attorney, defendant filed notice of appeal. Later, present counsel were employed, dismissed the appeal, and moved to vacate the judgment.  The motion was made more than six months after judgment, and thus cannot be deemed a motion for relief from a judgment taken through defendant\u2019s \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d Rather, if defendant has any ground for relief, it must be under the final paragraph of Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, which authorizes the setting aside of a void judgment. The motion to vacate was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">As originally filed, recitals introductory to the findings of fact stated that \u201ccounsel for defendant Bayshore Investment Corporation, a corporation, filed a withdrawal as attorney of record, which was allowed by the Court.\u201d After the notice of appeal was filed, the trial court made an order stating that leave for withdrawal of counsel was never sought, and amending the findings by striking therefrom the words \u201cwhich was allowed by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Appellant contends that the order amending the recitals of the findings is beyond the power of the trial court. It then argues that the judgment was void because part of the trial was held and judgment entered after the court had allowed appellant\u2019s attorneys to withdraw. Since a corporation cannot appear in propria persona, the contention runs, \u201cthe corporation was not in court\u201d after withdrawal of counsel. Appellant expressly concedes that, if the amending order is proper, \u201cthe question raised on this appeal disappears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">We hold that the order of amendment was properly made, Admittedly, findings of fact may not be amended to correct judicial error after the judgment becomes final. However, the rule is clear that mere clerical errors may be so corrected <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Koenig, </em>219 Cal. 656 [28 P.2d 351] ; <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Stockton &amp; Tuolumne R. R. Co., </em>148 Cal. 206 [82 P. 961] ; <em>Boylan </em>v. <em>Marine, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 321 [231 P.2d 92]).  The taking of an appeal does not deprive the trial court of the right to correct clerical errors in its records <em>(Haynes </em>v. <em>Los Angeles R. R. Corp., </em>80 Cal.App. 776 [252 P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>1072]).  Here the findings themselves were not amended in any way. The amendment dealt with a mere recital wholly preliminary to statement of the findings proper. There is no attempt to enlarge or add. The record contains nothing by way of minute order, transcript excerpt, or otherwise to show that the original recital was correct or that the amendment is contrary to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">By appellant\u2019s own concession, its motion to vacate must therefore be deemed properly denied by the trial court. Thus, it is unnecessary to pass upon the merits of appellant\u2019s somewhat ingenious contention that a trial court, by permitting withdrawal of counsel for a corporate defendant, loses jurisdiction of such party.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Kaufman, P.
