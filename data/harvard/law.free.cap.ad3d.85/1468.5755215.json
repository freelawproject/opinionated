The Attorney General has advised this Court that the Board conducted another hearing in February 2011, and petitioner\u2019s request for parole release was again denied. Although petitioner advises that he did not attend and that the hearing was held in his absence, there is no indication that he waived the February 2011 hearing. In view of this, the appeal must be dismissed as moot <em>(see Matter of Agosta v Alexander, </em>67 AD3d 1086 [2009]; <em>Matter of Alvarez v New York State Div. of Parole, </em>63 AD3d 1402 [2009], <em>appeal dismissed </em>13 NY3d 823 [2009]).</p><p id=\"b1226-6\">Peters, J.P., Rose, Lahtinen, Kavanagh and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the appeal is dismissed, as moot, without costs.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
