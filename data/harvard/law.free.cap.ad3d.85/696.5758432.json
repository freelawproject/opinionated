Supply Corp., </em>27 AD3d 519, 520 [2006]). Since the plaintiff had the right-of-way, she was entitled to assume that the defendant would obey the traffic laws requiring her to yield to the plaintiffs vehicle <em>(see Almonte v Tobias, </em>36 AD3d 636 [2007]; <em>Berner v Koegel, </em>31 AD3d 591, 592 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">In opposition, the defendant failed to raise a triable issue of fact, since her claim of a material inconsistency in the plaintiff s deposition testimony is illusory, the evidence in the record does not support the defendant\u2019s speculative assertions of comparative fault on the part of the plaintiff, and the slight differences between the parties\u2019 respective versions of .the events do not alter the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the accident <em>(see Loch v Garber, </em>69 AD3d at 816; <em>Berner v Koegel, </em>31 AD3d at 592; <em>Jacino v Sugerman, </em>10 AD3d 593, 595 [2004]; <em>Pryor v Reichert, </em>265 AD2d 470 [1999]).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Accordingly, the Supreme Court correctly granted that branch of the plaintiffs motion which was for summary judgment on the issue of liability insofar as asserted against the defendant.
