The road extends generally north and south. The avenue, an east-west street, ends at the west side of the road, which is a six-lane boulevard or through street with three lanes of traffic in each direction. Neither of the crossings (or crosswalks) on the road was marked by lines or otherwise to indicate that they were pedestrian crossings. And there were no mechanical traffic signals at the intersection. There was, however, a stop sign facing west at the southwest corner of the intersection and another facing east outside of the intersection near the northeast corner, but there was none at either of the other corners.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">In the early evening of September 4, 1959, the plaintiff (Howard Folck) walked from the back of his home, down the alley which intersects the east side of the road (at a point approximately opposite the north sidewalk on the avenue), crossed the road and went to a tavern on the north side of the avenue to buy beer. After purchasing a jug of beer, the plaintiff began to return by walking east along the north side of the avenue. When he reached the west side of the road, he looked both left and right and, seeing no vehicular traffic, started across the road in the northerly crosswalk formed by the prolongation of the lateral lines of the sidewalk on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>he had been walking. As he reached the middle o\u00ed the road he saw an automobile to his right traveling in a northerly direction and stopped to allow it to pass. But before it passed him, the plaintiff was knocked down and rendered unconscious by an automobile operated by the defendant (James M. Anthony) traveling in a southerly direction on the west side of the road. The plaintiff did not see the southbound vehicle. Nor did he hear any warning of its approach. The defendant, who was slowing down to make a left turn into Shamrock Avenue, applied the brakes when he saw the plaintiff and turned the steering wheel to the right. He stopped almost immediately, but could not avoid colliding with the plaintiff. The evidence was conflicting in some respects. According to the defendant, the plaintiff was outside of the southerly crosswalk instead of in the northerly crosswalk. The defendant also testified that when he saw the plaintiff, he was backing, without looking, into the path of the defendant\u2019s automobile instead of standing still.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In the instructions, the trial judge advised the jury generally with respect to primary and contributory negligence and as to the respective burdens of proof of each of the parties, and then specifically informed the jury that the stop sign placed at the southwest corner of the intersection applied to pedestrian traffic as well as to vehicular traffic and, by way of explanation, stated \u201cthat means that before a pedestrian enters the Belair Road at this intersection he must use due care to see that there is no oncoming vehicle, such as this one [the defendant\u2019s], and in the exercise of that due care he should stop before he proceeds to cross.\u201d And, although the jury was further informed as to the reciprocal duties of care that each party owed to himself and to the other party, the judge declined to instruct the jury, as prayed, to the effect that the plaintiff had the right of way at the street crossing he had entered and was standing in when he was struck by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">On appeal, the appellant contends in effect that the stop sign did not restrict the right he had over vehicular traffic at the crossing in which he was injured, and that the court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>erred in refusing to give an instruction as to the doctrine of last clear chance. On the other hand, the appellee, besides a contention, with which we agree, that the last clear chance doctrine has no application to the facts of this case, further argues that the exceptions the appellant took to the instructions do not raise a question on this appeal with respect to his being entitled to a right of way instruction. We are unable to agree. For when the instructions prayed for\u2014even though they were stated in the negative\u2014are read together, we think they were sufficient to inform the judge that he was seeking a right of way instruction. And, having excepted to the refusal of the lower court to grant the requested instructions, the plaintiff thereby raised a question for this Court to review.</p>\n<p id=\"AeR\">The question thus presented is whether the lower court erred in advising the jury that a stop sign applies to pedestrian as well as vehicular traffic and in not informing the jury that the pedestrian was entitled to the right of way at the crosswalks on the through street. But the more basic inquiry is whether the Legislature intended to abandon the fourteen year old rule of the road that a stop sign applies only to vehicular traffic, and substitute therefor a new rule to the effect that a stop sign should apply to pedestrian as well as vehicular traffic: the theory being that such an intention was expressed when the Legislature, at the time it added the <em>second exception </em>(\u201ctraffic-control devices\u201d) to the rule giving a pedestrian the right of way at street crossings, further stipulated that a \u201cstop sign\u201d was one of several other devices named in the statutory definition of \u201cofficial traffic-control devices.\u201d We think there was no such legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Three sections of the motor vehicle laws\u2014Code (1957), Art. 66^2, \u00a7\u00a7 193, 194 and 236<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 specifically concern the rights and duties of a pedestrian when using a public street or highway. Of these, only one section directly concerns the remaining question in this case, but there are other sections, as will be seen, which have a bearing on the question to be decided. Section 193, regulating the movement of traffic at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>intersections controlled by traffic-control signals, obviously has no application here. And the same is true with respect to \u00a7 194, which involves the rights of a blind pedestrian at uncontrolled intersections. Section 236 (a), however, has a direct and important bearing on the problem confronting us. This statutory rule of the road with its exceptions reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">\u201cAll pedestrians shall have the right of way at street crossings in the towns and cities of this State, except where traffic is controlled at such crossings by traffic officers, or <em>traffic-control devices. </em>Between street crossings in such towns and cities, vehicles shall have the right of way.\u201d [Italics supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Furthermore, in the definition section 2 (a) of Art. 66it is stated that when certain words and phrases are used in the motor vehicle laws, such words and phrases shall have the meanings therein respectively ascribed to them. Thus, \u00a7 2 (a) (29) defines \u201cofficial traffic-control devices\u201d as meaning all \u201csigns, signals, markings and devices,\u201d erected for the purpose of regulating, warning or guiding traffic that are <em>not inconsistent </em>with the motor vehicle laws. And, \u00a7 2 (a) (62) includes <em>pedestrians </em>in its definition of \u201ctraffic\u201d while using any street or highway for purposes of travel. It would seem, therefore, that when the definitional sections are read in connection with \u00a7 236 (a), the instruction given by the lower court\u2014to the effect that the stop sign at the intersection applied to pedestrian as well as vehicular traffic\u2014may not have been improper. Yet, as we see it, such is not the case. However, in order to understand the effect of the exceptions on the right of way that a pedestrian has at street crossings, it is necessary to look at the legislative history of \u00a7 236 (a) as well as to consider the meaning and effect of certain parts of \u00a7\u00a7 233 and 242 on the problem and the effect of the practices pursued by the transit and traffic department of the city in complying with the requirements of \u00a7 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Prior to 1918 there was no provision in the statutory law of this State with respect to the use of town and city streets by a pedestrian. But Ch. 85 of the Acts of 1918 added another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>paragraph or \u201csubsection\u201d to \u00a7 163 of Art. 56 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Code of 1912, containing the rules of the road, which provided (in the identical terms of what is now \u00a7 236 (a) minus the exceptions) that pedestrians should have the right of way at street crossings and that vehicles should have the right of way between such crossings. The first exception\u2014control of traffic at crossings by traffic officers\u2014was added by Ch. 506 of the Acts of 1920. Nine years later, by Ch. 224 of the Acts of 1929, other \u201csubsections\u201d were added to the rules of the road section (which had then become \u00a7 209<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of Art. 56 of the Code of 1924) whereby provision was made for the designation of certain highways as <em>through </em>highways and for the erection of <em>stop signs </em>at specified entrances thereto and at intersections designated as <em>stop </em>intersections. But the second exception [to \u00a7 236 (a)] \u25a0\u2014\u25a0 control of traffic at crossings by <em>traffic-control </em>devices\u2014was not added until the enactment of Ch. 1007 of the Acts of 1943 as an overall revision and reenactment of the motor vehicle laws as Art. 66^2 [Motor Vehicles] of the Code of 1924 in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on the Revision of State Motor Vehicle Laws. See the 1943 H. B. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">As hereinbefore noted the definition of \u201ctraffic-control devices\u201d includes a \u201cstop sign\u201d as one of such devices, but it is also therein provided that a stop sign (or other device) shall be excluded whenever its inclusion would be inconsistent with another provision of the motor vehicle laws. We note, further, that what is now \u00a7 236 (a) was re-enacted in precisely the same phraseology as the Commission had drafted it, and, which is more significant, we note that Chart No. 26, explaining the impact of the revised laws, summarized the effect of \u00a7 236 (a) as \u201c[p]edestrians have right of way at crossings, except where traffic is controlled by officers or <em>signals </em>[italics supplied].\u201d It would seem therefore that it was never the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tent of the Legislature to require a pedestrian to stop in obedience to a stop sign at the entrance to a through highway or stop intersection and yield the right of way at a street crossing in a town or city.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Other than this, it seems clear that <em>only </em>vehicular traffic is required to stop and yield the right of way to approaching vehicular traffic at an entrance to a through highway or stop intersection or at a stop sign or stop line before entering an intersection. See \u00a7 233 (a) and (b) and \u00a7 242 (c) of Art. 66)4. See also \u00a7 2 (a) (60), which, though stating that vehicular traffic on intersecting highways is required to stop and yield before entering or crossing a \u201cthrough highway,\u201d makes no mention of a pedestrian. Nowhere in any of these sections, or in any other section of the motor vehicle laws, is there a specific requirement that a pedestrian shall stop at a stop sign and yield the right of way to vehicular traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Furthermore, we think it is significant that it has been the practice to place and maintain stop signs\u2014-in compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 191 of Art. 66)4\u2014only at such points as the city transit and traffic department deemed necessary to effectively warn vehicular (but not pedestrian) traffic of the existence of a through street or stop intersection. That is precisely what was done at the intersection with which we are concerned. There is only one stop sign at this intersection and it is a west-facing one erected on the right side of the avenue near the southwest corner of the intersection to warn eastbound vehicular traffic entering the throughway at this point. There is, however, a nearby east-facing stop sign on the right side of the alley (down which the appellant had traveled on his way to the tavern) to warn westbound vehicular traffic in the alley that it was approaching the throughway, which stop sign, although it is apparently outside of the Belair RoadFierman Avenue intersection, is near the northeast corner of this intersection. But there is no west-facing stop sign on the left side of the avenue near the northwest corner to warn eastbound pedestrian traffic using the northerly crosswalk. Nor is there an east-facing stop sign at or near the southeast corner to warn westbound pedestrian traffic using the southerly crosswalk. So, even if it is assumed that the stop sign near the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>southwest corner governed the movement of eastbound pedestrian traffic across the southerly crosswalk and that the stop sign outside of the intersection but near the northeast corner \u2022governed westbound pedestrian traffic across the northerly crosswalk, it is not likely that either of these signs was ever intended to also control the movement of eastbound pedestrian traffic across the northerly crosswalk. On the contrary, it is apparent, absent a stop sign at the northwest corner, that the transit of the plaintiff across the northerly crosswalk\u2014which he said he was using at the time of the accident\u2014was not unlawful under the circumstances. Cf. <em>Belle Isle Cab Co. v. Trammell, 227 </em>Md. 438, 177 A. 2d 404 (1962). To hold that the movements of an eastbound pedestrian across the crosswalks at this intersection depended on whether he was using the northerly or southerly crosswalk would certainly create an incongruous situation that was never intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Before 1943, when the second exception was added to what is now \u00a7 236 (a), this Court had recognized that a pedestrian had the right of way even at boulevard street crossings. See, for instance, <em>Sheer v. Rathje, </em>174 Md. 79, 197 Atl. 613 (1938) and <em>Sugar v. Hafele, </em>179 Md. 75, 17 A. 2d 118 (1941). In the interim between 1943 and 1957 no question had arisen similar to that presented by this case. From what has been said, we think it is clear that since 1943, as well as prior thereto, the Legislature has not intended the law to be otherwise than that a stop sign does not apply to a pedestrian at street crossings in cities and towns in this state. Cf. <em>Guina v. Harrod, </em>266 N. W. 393 (Mich. 1936) [pedestrian has right to cross a street at a crossing even on a <em>through </em>street].</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">While it is true that a pedestrian, in crossing a street, must use \u201csuch caution for his own safety as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise under similar circumstances.\u201d <em>Domeski v. Atlantic Refining Co., </em>202 Md. 562, 566, 97 A. 2d 313 (1953), we reaffirm the previous holdings of this Court to the effect that where a pedestrian lawfully has the right of way at an intersection, even those posted with a stop sign, he has the further right to assume that the operator of a motor vehicle will obey the law and respect his right to complete the passage across the street crossing. <em>Sugar v. Hafele, supra. </em>See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>also <em>Jackson v. Yellow Cab Co., 222 </em>Md. 367, 160 A. 2d 612 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Since there were prejudicial errors in the instructions of the lower court, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial; appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\">.
