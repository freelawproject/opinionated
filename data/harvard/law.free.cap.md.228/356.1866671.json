But, as we read the record, such is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">The victim was assaulted, knocked down and robbed of $40 on a street in Baltimore. He testified that he had been assaulted and robbed by <em>two </em>persons who had come upon him \u201cfrom behind,\u201d and for that reason had not seen his assailants. There was, however, other testimony by an eyewitness (Charlotte Roberts) who testified that the appellant (whom she knew) had struck the victim and had then crossed the street and told another person (whom she could not identify) to \u201cgo get his money,\u201d but when the unidentified person could not lift the victim by himself, the appellant returned to help and at that time rifled the pockets of the victim. On behalf of the appellant, there was testimony by another eyewitness (Ethel Cox) to the effect that the appellant had come across the street and knocked the victim down, whereupon everyone \u201ctook off,\u201d and that after the assault another person (whom she knew) approached the victim and alone helped him to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>feet, but she gave no testimony as to who robbed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Clearly the testimony of the witness Roberts, as to what she saw, and the testimony of the victim, as to what was taken from him, was, if believed, sufficient to sustain the conviction. The credibility of the witnesses was a matter to be considered by the trier of the facts. <em>Mason v. State, 225 </em>Md. 74; <em>Bush v.
