Hence the only question before us is the right of the chancellor to limit access to the use of a gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The appellees moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the appellant failed to print sufficient testimony to enable this Court to decide the issue presented, in violation of Maryland Rule 831 c 2. We reserved ruling on the motion, and now rule that the motion be denied. The testimony printed by the appellee has only slight relevance to the issue presented. The appellant printed enough of the testimony and exhibits to show that Waldschmidt acquired title through mesne conveyances from Avalon Shores, Inc.; that Vito subsequently acquired all the interest and estate of Avalon Shores, Inc. in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the roads, easements and rights of way, beaches and riparian rights \u201csubject to the rights of ingress and egress by the owners of waterfront lots across the land reserved between their property line and the water\u201d; that Vito erected a wire fence four feet high along the rear line of the appellant\u2019s lots, cutting off his access to the beach. The appellant also reproduced a recorded plat, showing the location of the properties, the beach, and certain designated paths between certain of the lots in the development, affording access to the beach. Since the first paragraph of the decree is uncontested on either side, we think the issue can fairly be decided upon the material supplied. The only question is whether, under the terms of the rights reserved by Avalon Shores, Inc., access can properly be limited to a gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">We find no justification for the limitation imposed by the .chancellor. On its face, the language of the basic grant of ingress and egress is unlimited, and there is no claim of a prescriptive right of a limited character and extent, as in <em>Bishields v. Campbell, </em>200 Md. 622, 625, and the cases there cited. The instant case ,is quite similar on its facts to <em>Simon Distr. Corp. v. Bay Ridge Civic Ass\u2019n, </em>207 Md. 472, 480, and we think that case is controlling. We find it unnecessary to repeat or elaborate upon the careful review of the authorities by Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e in that case. Indeed, in the <em>Simon </em>case the removable chain was designed to exclude \u201cundesirables\u201d, and thus was of some benefit to the community at large. There is no evidence that the fence in the instant case would serve such a purpose. We think the chancellor should have decreed that the fence be removed, as prayed in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed, with costs, and case remanded for a modification of the decree in accordance with the views here expressed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
