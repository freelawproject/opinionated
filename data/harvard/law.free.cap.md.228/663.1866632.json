He now contends that he did not commit the murder, but rather that he initially confessed to it while in a state of suicidal despondency (brought on in part by an extreme overdose of alcohol) and that his confession was readily accepted by the police, especially in light of the fact that no other volunteers came forth to admit to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">The petitioner elected to proceed below as attorney <em>pro se </em>without the assistance of counsel who had been appointed to represent him. He filed a lengthy brief below, which was attached to his petition, and he both testified and argued his case at a rather extensive hearing. Following the hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Judge Duckett held the case <em>sub curia </em>until he could further study the points raised. He subsequently handed down a written opinion and held that as a matter of law the petitioner had presented no valid grounds for post conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Strosnider also elected to act as his own attorney in this leave to appeal, and he filed a further brief in this Court, in which he sets out fifteen grounds for relief, all of which were raised below and all of which were passed on by Judge Duckett.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The fifteen grounds may best be summarized by quotation from the State\u2019s brief in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201c1. Denial of right to telephone or communicate upon arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">2. Improper use of State witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">3. Denied permission to see wife\u2019s statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">4. The then State\u2019s Attorney * * * improperly testified against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-12\">5. Refused lie detector test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-13\">6. His attorney improperly removed the case from Baltimore City to Anne Arundel County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-15\"><em>7. </em>Another improper use of State witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-16\">8. Refusal of court to admit evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-17\">9. Perjury by police during trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-18\">10. Continuous and exhaustive trial of 14 hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-19\">11. Evidence suppressed by State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-20\">12. Insufficiency of State\u2019s evidence to convict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-21\">13. Incompetency of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-22\">14. No transcript on new trial motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-23\">15. Denied full new trial hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-24\">We think the lower court was correct in holding that points 1 through 8, 10, and 12 through 15, were unavailing under the Post Conviction Procedure Act. Points 1 through 8, 10, and 12 could have been, but were not, raised at trial, or on motion for a new trial, or on direct appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>tioner\u2019s conviction, and are therefore unavailable as grounds for post conviction relief, according to the express terms of the Act. Code (1961 Supp.), Art. 27, Sec. 645A; see <em>Torres v. Warden, </em>227 Md. 649, 651-653, and <em>Barbee v. Warden, </em>220 Md. 647, 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Points 13, 14, and 15 all relate to the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for a new trial (on the ground of his trial attorneys\u2019 incompetence), which was heard by Judge Michaelson shortly after Strosnider\u2019s conviction. The petitioner states in his brief to this Court: \u201cMy argument * * * is (and this was stated fully and clearly at my Post Conviction hearing) that though I tried to argue and debate the grounds upon which my \u2018Motion for a New Trial\u2019 was based, I was denied this right and privilege, simply by being told by his Honorable Judge Benjamin Michaelson that my Counsel defended me properly.\u201d Without either assuming that this statement is true, or that it would be meritorious if true and if timely raised, we nevertheless think that Strosnider had available to him at that time a proper method of seeking relief from this alleged impropriety, namely\u2014an appeal from the denial of the motion. See <em>Hanley v. Stulman, </em>216 Md. 461, 469, and <em>Wash., B. &amp; A. R. Co. v. Kimmey, </em>141 Md. 243, 250-253, in both of which cases this Court found reversible error in the failure of the lower court to exercise judicial discretion regarding the hearing of a motion for a new trial. Therefore, Strosnider cannot now raise a complaint on this account, since the Post Conviction Procedure Act \u201cis not a substitute for * * * remedies which are incident to the proceedings in the trial court,\u201d such as a motion for a new trial or an appeal from the denial thereof. Code (1961 Supp.), Art. 27, Sec. 645A (b); <em>cf. Barbee v. Warden, 220 </em>Md. 647, 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">But, as to points 9 and 11, which allege perjured police testimony and suppression of evidence by the State, Judge Duckett was in error when he held them not to present grounds for relief under the Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">\u2022 We have many times stated that the knowing use by the State of perjured testimony is a proper ground for relief under the Act. See, for example, <em>State v. D\u2019Onofrio, </em>221 Md. 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>29-30, and also see Supreme Court cases cited therein. No clearer averment of knowledge on the part of the State that perjured testimony was being used could be made than the present one, alleging perjury on the part of its agents, the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We have also held that the suppression by the State of evidence tending to exculpate a defendant is a ground for relief under the Act. <em>Brady v. State, </em>226 Md. 422, 427. See also <em>Wilde v. Wyoming, </em>362 U. S. 607, 4 L. ed. 2d 985, and Annotation, 33 A. L. R. 2d 1421.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The petitioner makes specific factual allegations as to both of these points, and he maintains that he did not know these facts at the time of his trial but discovered them subsequently. It may be, that upon remand, the lower court will find these allegations not to have been supported by the evidence adduced by the petitioner at his hearing, or will find the petitioner to have known of the facts of which he now complains at the time of his trial and to have waived any objection thereto by failure to then complain. See Annotation, 2 L. ed. 2d 1575, 1577.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The case will be remanded for a determination of these factual questions, and for any other action then necessary or proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">\n<em>Leave to appeal granted, and case remanded for proceedings consistent \u2022with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-25\">. Strosnider sought a belated appeal <em>via habeas corpus. </em>The writ was denied, and leave to appeal to this Court was also denied. Strosnider v.
