The claim of prejudicial error resulted from the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">\u201cMr. Goodman (Defense trial counsel) : O. What else did you think about? How did your father treat your mother? A. He beat her all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">Mr. Duvall (State\u2019s Attorney) : I\u2019ll object to leading. Mr. Goodman first asked him what else he thought about and then suggested an area for him to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">Mr. Goodman: This is a little child, 15 years of age. I want the jury to get the background of his experiences at home, I think that\u2019s important.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">Mr. Duvall: I realize that, I\u2019ve been very liberal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">It was at this point that Judge Michaelson said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-16\">\u201cI don\u2019t like to say this, you have a two way sword, he killed his mother he didn\u2019t protect his mother. All the testimony about the mother and father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>did I don\u2019t think is relevant at all. If he favored one in preference to the other it might have some bearing on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">No exception or objection was taken at the time of the court\u2019s remark so that the question is not properly before us for review. Rule 885, <em>Daniels v. State, </em>213 Md. 90, 105, 131 A. 2d 267; <em>Bryant v. State, </em>207 Md. 565, 585, 115 A. 2d 502; <em>Brown v. State, </em>203 Md. 126, 100 A. 2d 7. If the accused desired to complain of an alleged impropriety of a remark made by the court at his trial he should have either moved to strike it out, or moved to withdraw a juror and declare a mistrial. <em>Daniels v. State, Bryant v. State, </em>and <em>Brown v. State, </em>all <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Even if the matter was properly before us a different result would not follow. It is undoubtedly true that a trial judge because of his authoritative position should be exceedingly careful in any remarks made by him during the progress of the trial in ruling on evidence or prayers, to refrain either directly or indirectly from expressing an opinion on facts which should properly be left to the province of the jury. <em>Marino v. State, </em>171 Md. 104, 110, 187 Atl. 858. However, the admissibility of evidence offered frequently depends upon the evidence already introduced; and it is not unusual for the court to allude to such evidence to make his meaning clear in order to eliminate possible confusion in the minds of the jury. Here, the record discloses that the comments of the trial judge were made after the appellant\u2019s confession had been admitted in evidence and after the appellant had testified that he shot his parents. Moreover, the jury was instructed that they were the judges of the law and the facts, and were given the usual instruction as to the burden of proof. A review of the record satisfies us that the actions and statements of the learned trial judge did not prejudice the jury against the appellant so as to deprive him of a fair and impartial trial. <em>Bryant v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
