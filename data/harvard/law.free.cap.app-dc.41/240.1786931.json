C. 123). In 1906 appellants filed application for the registration as a technical trademark of a rhombic figure with the words, \u201cReuter\u2019s Little Pills for the Liver,\u201d thereon, and above certain Spanish words, and at the right matter of a descriptive nature. Appellee seasonably interposed notice of opposition, based upon its alleged prior use of the trademark, \u201cCarter\u2019s Little Liver Pills\u201d with certain accessories. The applicants thereupon filed a demurrer in which, among other things, it was alleged that the opposer\u2019s mark showed on its face that it was so dissimilar and distinctive from the mark of applicants \u201cthat confusion or mistake or deception by use of applicants\u2019 trademark would be impossible.\u201d The demurrer was overruled. Testimony was taken by both parties, but none was filed by the opposer, who did not appear at the final hearing. Thereupon judgment by default was entered against the opposer, the judgment reciting that \u201cpriority of adoption and use of the trademark in issue is awarded to Barclay <em>&amp; </em>Barclay.\u201d This decision became final. Thereupon the Primary Examiner, for reasons stated in his decision, declined to register applicants\u2019 mark as a technical trademark, and this decision was sustained by the Commissioner. An amended application -was thereupon filed eliminating the descriptive features of the mark, averring exclusive \u2018use for ten years prior to the trademark act of 1905, and praying registration under the ten-year clause of that act. Thereupon the appellee herein again filed a notice of opposition, and the Patent Office sustained applicants\u2019 plea of <em>res judicata. </em>On appeal to this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the decision was reversed. When the case was again reached for hearing in the Patent Office, the opposer contended that the question of similarity of the marks was settled in the original proceeding. It appearing that opposer had used this mark during the ten-year period, the Examiner of Interferences sustained the opposition and declined to register applicants\u2019 mark. Upon appeal to the Commissioner, it was ruled that the question of similarity of the marks had been adjudicated in the prior proceedings. The Commissioner further stated, however, \u201cthat if the question of similarity were found to be still open, I should hold that the applicants\u2019 mark in this case does so nearly resemble that of the opposer. that confusion would be likely to result. * * * The opposer\u2019s mark is so familiar as to scarcely need description. It consists of a square figure bearing the words, \u2018Carter\u2019s Little Liver Pills,\u2019 a large L in the lower left-hand corner of the square serving as the initial letter of both the words \u2018Little\u2019 and \u2018Liver.\u2019 Around this square are arranged words in substantially the same way and of much the same import as the words surrounding the rhombic figure in the applicants\u2019 mark. In view of the unlimited field open to these applicants in selecting a trademark, it is remarkable that they should have hit upon an arrangement of words and figures so similar to that of the opposer, and it seems more than likely that confusion would result from the concurrent use of the two marks.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-5\"><em>Mr. 'Julian C. </em>Dowell, <em>Mr. Arthur E. </em>Dowell, and <em>Mr. Chester A.

In the latter case, the demand in the prior action operates as an estoppel only as to those matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered. <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Sac County, </em>94 U. S. 351, 24 L. ed. 195. The original proceeding before the Patent Office involved substantially the same marks now before us. Indeed, the matter subsequently eliminated from the applicants\u2019 mark tended rather to accentuate than diminish the similarity between the two. Put the applicants were then asking registration as a technical trademark. Subsequently, the application was amended and registration under the ten-year clause was prayed. It was therefore a different proceeding, but it involved the same marks. Obviously, if the question of similarity was finally determined in the first proceeding, it was not open to readjudication in the second. It will be noted that applicants, in the original proceeding, filed a demurrer based in part upon the contention that the marks were dissimilar. This demurrer was overruled, and, the opposer having defaulted, judgment was rendered awarding priority of adoption and use \u201cof the trademark in issue\u201d to applicants. This decision became final. As pointed out in the prior decision of this court, the question of similarity was necessarily in issue in the original proceeding, for, in the absence of similarity, the opposer was without standing, and his petition would have been dismissed. Applicants were then quite willing to take a judgment of priority of adoption and use of <em>\u201cthe trademark in issue.\u201d </em>The expression \u201cthe trademark in issue\u201d was necessarily based upon a finding of similarity. Indeed, when the second opposition was filed, applicants then filed a plea of <em>res judicata, </em>and actually obtained a decision in their favor in that proceeding. Of course, this plea was based upon the theory that, the marks being similar, the finding of priority in the first proceeding was final. We ruled that a.n opposition might lie under the ten-year clause that would not lie under an application for registration as a technical trademark. Thereafter, however, we do not think the question of similarity was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>open. The sole question then was whether applicants had been the&gt; exclusive users of the mark during the ten-year period, and, as the evidence was overwhelming against them on that point, the decision of the Commissioner was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">We fully agree with the Commissioner, however, that, both marks being applied to little liver pills, their concurrent use by the two parties \u201cwould be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public, or to deceive purchasers.\u201d Act of February 20, 1905 (S3 Stat. at L. 724, chap. 592, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1459). Applicants\u2019 counsel have pointed out. that the color of applicants\u2019 label is red, while the color of opposer\u2019s label is yellow. But in the application for registration nothing is said about color. There is nothing in that application to prevent a closer simulation of the opposer\u2019s mark, and, of course, in this proceeding, we must look to the application, and not to the mark as actually used. It might be very material in a suit for unfair competition whether applicants employed a label of a distinctive color,- but it is not material when we are passing upon an application for registration in which no mention of color is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
