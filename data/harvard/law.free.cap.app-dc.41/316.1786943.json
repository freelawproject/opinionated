A road pavement comprising in combination, an integral, smooth-surfaced, monolithic body of cement concrete of sufficient thickness to carry a maximum designed traffic load without deformation, and a semi-elastic, impervious, carpet coat, wearing surface of substantially pure bitumen, in direct and permanent physical union with said concrete, and having superficially applied inert granular material imbedded therein, said blanket-coat being of sufficient thickness to hold said imbedded granular material in place, and to constitute a resilient, protective, wearing surface for said concrete, substantially as described.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-7\"><em>Mr. W.

Even now, his only specification for the construction of his concrete base is that it shall be of \u201ccement-concrete of such depth, usually about 6 inches, as will carry the maximum load,\u201d and that it shall be an integral mass. Each of the three tribunals of the Patent Office that passed upon these claims carefully reviewed the prior art, and unhesitatingly reached the conclusion that appellant has contributed nothing patentably novel thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Owing to appellant\u2019s insistence that his alleged invention was not fully understood and-appreciated by the Patent Office, we have very carefully reviewed the prior art, as well as the history of his application, but we are forced to the conclusion that the decision appealed from was right. In the second patent to TTubbell (No. 158,415) he shows a foundation which does not materially differ from that required by appellant, for it is constructed of broken stone bound together by cement and coal ashes or sand, \u201cand forming a wearing surface immediately above the surface of the broken stone.\u201d After the foundation, with its concrete surface, is completed, it is slushed or saturated with \u201cthin hot bitumen or pitch,\u201d and this is dusted over with dry cement. Appellant, however, points out that in his coating \u201cinert granular material\u201d or sand is imbedded in the-bitumen. But the use of sand for such a purpose is shown in several prior patents, notably in that to Robinson (No. 496,099), whose foundation was to be prepared with concrete \u201cor any other suitable resisting medium.\u201d Instead of putting the bitumen covering directly upon the concrete, as do Ilubbell and appellant, Robinson first places bricks upon the concrete, and then treats the bricks with a very hot composition of asphaltum, which is \u201callowed to flow into their interstices, and also to penetrate the porous material of which the bricks are made, also making a thin covering over the bricks, as well as filling in the spaces between the same.\u201d Before this covering becomes thoroughly hardened, Robinson then spreads sand or other inert material to increase its durability. Martineau (August 11, 1834), Kelly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>(British patent, No. 5,593), and Cass (British patent, No. 18,-965), all nse a coating of bitumen and sand.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The decision will therefore be affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
