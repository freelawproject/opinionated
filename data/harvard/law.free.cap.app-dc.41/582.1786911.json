An earlier interference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>between the same parties had an issue in the counts of which the following is representative:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\">1. The method of separating particles of comminuted material differentiated as to electrical conductivity, which consists in directing a spray discharge of electricity of one sign to a surface charged oppositely, converting a portion of the spray discharge into static charge, meanwhile conducting the mixed particles in contact with the surface first through the spray-affected region thereon, and thence into the region affected by static stress solely and thereafter separately collecting the separated materials.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">Both parties admitted that this issue was anticipated by the prior.art, and the interference was dissolved. After this dissolution a claim corresponding to the issue in the second interference was suggested from Wentworth's application to Sutton and the Steeles, which they declined to make, hut made three claims of somewhat broader scope.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-6\">The claim was again suggested and they amended, adopting the suggestion. The second interference was then declared with that claim as the issue. It reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-7\">\u201cThe method of separating particles of comminuted material differentiated as to electrical conductivity, which consists in passing them through an electro-static field in contact with an electrode surface, opposing the repellant effort of part of the electrode surface hv directing thereon a diffused spray discharge, and shielding another part of said surface by intercepting a portion of the effective spray discharge, thus allowing the repelling effort on the shielded part of the surface to set free the more conductive particles, and thereafter separately collecting the differentiated components of the material.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-8\">The date of conception alleged in Wentworth\u2019s preliminary statement was subsequent to Sutton, Steele, and Steele\u2019s filing date, and he was notified that judgment of priority would be rendered against bim on the record unless good cause he shown why the same should not be done. Wentworth moved to dissolve on several grounds, one of which was that Sutton and Steele had no right to make the claim. The motion was denied, hut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the question was raised on the hearing before 1he Examiner of Interferences, who decided priority in favor of Wentworth on the ground that his opponents had no right to make the claim. Sutton and Steele appealed to the Examiners in Chief, who affirmed the decision. As permitted by rule 126, they added to their decision a recommendation to the Commissioner to the effect that the claim of the issue was not patentable in view of the priqr art. They recommended a claim in different words as a proper patentable one. On Wentworth\u2019s application they granted a rehearing, and decided that the recommended claim could not properly be made by Sutton and Steele, and that it did not define a patentable invention. They withdrew the recommended claim, and substituted another, which is the same substantially with the issue in this, the third, interference, that was subsequently declared. Sutton and Steele presented no claim corresponding to the suggestion and took no appeal to the Commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-5\">The Commissioner referred the recommendation of the Examiners in Chief to the Primary Examiner for action thereon, lie also made a brief statement of their proceedings and the failure to adopt the suggested claim, or to appeal therefrom, and added: \u201cThis interference is therefore finally determined adversely to Sutton, Steele, and Steele.\u201d Upon return to the Primary Examiner, he rejected the claim of Sutton and Steele which corresponded to the issue of said proceeding, becatise of the judgment of priority to Wentworth, and the claim was canceled. Sutton and Steele amended by adding the claim that had been suggested in the decision of the Examiners in Chief. He allowed the claim and suggested it to Wentworth, who also added it, and the present interference was declared with that as the issue. Responding to a notice to show canse why judgment should not be entered against him on the record, Went-worth moved to dissolve on several grounds, the chief of which was that his opponents were precluded from making the claim by reas&amp;n pf the former- adjudication of priority in his favor. The Examiner of Interferences sustained the-view of Went-worth and awarded him. priority, The Examiners in Chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>reversed Mm and awarded priority to Sutton, Steele, and Steele. The Commissioner* reversed them and made the final award to Wentworth.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-5\"><em>Mr. A. S.

The views of the Examiners in Chief, which sustain the contention of the appellants, have been presented with much ability. They leave nothing to be said xxpon that side. We are, however, not satisfied with their conclusion. The decision of the Commissioner is, in our opinion, sustained by our former decisions. See <em>Blackford </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>28 App. D. C. 535, 543; <em>Horine </em>v. <em>Wende, 29 </em>App. D. C. 415, 426; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Hallwood, </em>31 App. D. C. 165; <em>United States ex rel. Newcomb Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>30 App. D. C. 464. The principle of <em>res judicata </em>is fully disoxxssed in those cases in application to similar conditions, and its limitations pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">There is no occasion to add anything to the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">The decision is affirmed; and the clerk will certify this decision to the Commissioner of Patents as the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
