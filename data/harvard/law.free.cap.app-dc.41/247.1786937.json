The question of similarity being conceded, the sole question is whether, at the time appellant adopted this mark, it was then used by appellee upon goods of the same descriptive properties, within the meaning of the trademark law. Both tribunals of the Patent Office have rqled that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The evidence shows that in about 1907 or 1908 there commenced to be a demand for asbestos \u201cfriction facing\u201d for automobile brakes. The appellant thereupon commenced selling asbestos tape treated with some hardening substance, for this purpose, and under the mark \u201cAutobestine.\u201d Untreated asbestos tape, such as that sold by appellee under the mark \u201cAutobestos,\u201d was also used to some extent for the same purpose. The function of this so-called \u201cfacing\u201d is not primarily frictional. Eather is it used to prevent the overheating of the metal surface, and to overcome noise. Of course, its use also prevents undue wear of the metal surface. Without stopping to inquire whether this \u201cfriction facing\u201d of appellant is a. \u201cpacking,\u201d within the common acceptation of the term, we think it is clear that the two are so nearly alike in their fundamental characteristics, and the uses to which they are applied are so closely related, that their sale under the same trademark would be likely to cause the public to believe that they were the output of the same manufacturer. Such a result the trademark act does not countenance. Decision affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
