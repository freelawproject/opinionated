He also found that Combs had shown no conception, prior to his filing date, of the use of unbalancing or eccentric weights for producing a gyratory movement as specified in counts 1 and 10.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-10\">On appeal to the Examiners in Chief this decision was. af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>finned as to counts 1 and 10, and reversed as to counts 2 to 9, inclusive. Combs did not appeal from this decision. Warring-ton appealed and the decision was affirmed hv the Commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-5\">The next interference declared between the application of Combs, of September 24, 1907, and that of Brantingham, filed January 28, 1907, contained an issue of six counts, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-6\">\u201c1. In combination, a suspended structure, suspending means therefor, a support independent of said structure, said support consisting of individually rigid elements, a laterally movable, vertically positioned shaft engaging said structure and said support, a weight connected to said shaft whereby it is given a tendency when in motion to cause the structure to travel in a gyratory path, a fixed hearing surrounding the axis of movement of said shaft, a driver engaging in said bearing, and yielding connections independent of the suspending means between said driver and said shaft whereby the latter may be driven from the former notwithstanding the difference between the axis of rotation of the driver and the axis of gyration of the latter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>In combination, a suspended body, a bearing member arranged centrally thereof, a weight mounted to produce a gyratory movement, a laterally movable rotatable stem engaging said bearing member, a step bearing for the stem whereby the weight of the stem and gyratory weight are supported, a fixedly mounted driver surrounding the axis of rotation of the stem, and a bearing in which said driver is mounted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-8\">\u201c8. In combination, a suspended body, a bearing member arranged centrally thereof, a weight to produce a gyratory movement, a laterally movable rotatable stem engaging said bearing member, a step bearing for the stem whereby tbe weight of the stem and gyrator weight are supported, a driver having a central opening through which said stem extends but free of contact therewith, and a bearing in which said driver is mounted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-9\"><em>\u201c4-. </em>In combination, a suspended structure arranged to have a gyratory movement, a stationary bearing, a driver mounted thereby, said driver having a central opening, laterally movable rotatable means including a shaft engaging the suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>structure, said rotatable means extending through the opening in the driver, and a step bearing for said rotatable means.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-4\"><em>\u201c5. </em>In combination, a suspended structure arranged to have a gyratory movement, a stationary bearing, a driver mounted thereby, said driver having a central opening, laterally movable rotatable means including a shaft for actuating the suspended structure, said rotatable means extending through the opening in the driver, and a step bearing for said rotatable means.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-5\">\u201c6. The combination, in a gyratory sifter of a sifted body, means whereby the same is suspended, a bearing member arranged centrally of said body, laterally movable rotatable means coacting with said bearing including an eccentric weight and a movable shaft, a step bearing supporting said rotatable means, and its eccentric weight, a fixedly mounted driver arranged adjacent thereto and surrounding the axis of movement of the rotatable means, and yielding connection between said driver and said rotatable means.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-6\">The Examiner of Interferences held that Combs, having failed to show any conception of the use of unbalancing or eccentric weights as defined in counts 1, 2, 3, and 6, most be restricted to his filing date both for conception and reduction to practice of the invention as defined in said counts. He found that as to counts 4 and 5 Combs conceived the invention as early as October 31, 1906, while Brantingham was given the date of December 8, 1906. But holding that Combs was not exercising diligence when Brantingham entered the field, he was overcome by the filing of the application of the latter, on January 28, 1907. Combs was denied actual reduction to practice as claimed by him. Priority was, therefore, awarded Brantingham on all of the counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-7\">On appeal by Combs, the Examiners in Chief affirmed the decision in favor of Brantingham. Combs appealed to the Commissioner from the decision as to counts 4 and 5, who disagreed with the Examiners in Chief as to Brantingham\u2019s reduction to practice of the invention of these counts in February, 1906, because they were mistaken in the view that the machine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of that date embodied the issue of these counts. He held also that Combs had reduced to practice in October or November of 1906. Consequently he reversed the decision as to those counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-4\">The last interference embraced the applications of Combs and Harrington, respectively, and that of Brantingham also, and the issue is in the following counts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-5\">\u201c1. In combination, a suspended structure, suspending means therefor, a shaft mounted in said structure, a fixedly mounted driver surrounding the axis of movement, a support for said shaft independent of said structure and said driver, and a yielding connection independent of the suspending means between the suspended structure and the driver whereby said structure is permitted a gyratory movement in operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>In combination, a suspended structure carrying a vertically positioned shaft, weights connected with said shaft whereby it is given a tendency when in motion to travel in a gyratorypath, a driver mounted in a fixed bearing adjacent to the end of said shaft and surrounding the axis of movement, a support for the shaft independent of the driver and yielding connections independent of the suspending means between said driver and said shaft whereby the latter may be driven from the former notwithstanding the difference between the axis of rotation of the driver and the axis of gyration of the latter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-7\">\u201c3. In combination, a suspended body, suspending devices therefor, means for giving said body a gyratory movement, a stationary driver, a shaft to said suspended body, a support for said shaft independent of said driver, and a yielding connection between said driver and the shaft of said suspended body whereby they are engaged for coincident rotation but permitting a relative movement equal to the distance between the axis of rotation and the axis of gyration.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-8\">The argument of the Examiner of Interferences by which his conclusions in each case were chiefly controlled is made in this case. Harrington\u2019s preliminary statement in each case is vague, and under it he was limited to his filing date for reduction to practice. His assignee, who conducted the proceedings, moved to amend, attributing the want of specification of dates to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>mental condition of Warrington, whose memory, it was alleged, had become impaired by failing health in 1907. Testimony on the point was taken by both sides and is in conflict. The leave to amend was denied. Combs was denied his claim of reduction to practice through his machines, exhibits X, T, and Z. He was therefore limited to his filing date and postponed to both Warrington and Brantingham. Warrington\u2019s limitation postponed him to Brantingham, who was awarded December 8, 1906, as his date of conception. Brantingham was denied actual reduction to practice as claimed, and confined to his filing date which, however, antedated Warrington by thirteen or fourteen days. Brantingham was, therefore, awarded, priority on all counts. The objection to Combs\u2019 actual reduction to practice was based largely on the leading questions addressed to his witnesses. That many of the questions were objectionable there is no doubt; but Combs is not alone subject to this criticism; many such questions were asked by his opponents throughout the taking of testimony. Nor, as pointed out by the Examiners in Chief and the Commissioner, was he compelled to rely upon such testimony alone. The' Examiners in Chief held, on appeal, that Combs\u2019 proofs did not show the practice of eccentric weights called for in count 2, and proceeded to discuss counts 1 and 3. They held that Combs had conceived the invention as early as the fall of 1903, and that he had actually reduced it to practice in the spring of 1906 in Exhibit X machine; and in October, 1906, in his Exhibit Z machine. They found also that some machines made after those exhibits had passed into commercial use in 1906, and early in 1907. They reversed the Examiner of Interferences as to the counts 1 and 3 and awarded priority to Combs. As to count 2, they affirmed. Combs took no appeal. Brantingham appealed to the Commissioner from the award of counts 1 and 3 to Combs. The Commissioner found that Brantingham\u2019s sketches of July, 1903, latter part of 1904, and February, 1906, respectively, indicate in a general way all the main elements of a gyratory sifter, but fail to show the subject-matter of the counts, because they lack <em>\u201ca </em>support for said shaft independent of said driver,\u201d called for there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>in; and some other necessary elements. ITe also found that Combs was in possession of the invention of the issue in 1903 and 1904; that he built three full-sized machines embodying the invention during March, June, and October, 1906. These are Exhibits X, Y, and Z. He found, also, that X and Z were fully tested, and found satisfactory, and have passed into commercial use. lie, therefore, affirmed the decision appealed from.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-5\">From each decision appeals have been prosecuted by Warrington and Brantingham.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-6\"><em>Mr. George E.

Considering all the circumstances, the delay in the matter, and the evidence relating to the mental condition of Warrington, that discretion seems to have been properly exercised; clearly there was no abuse of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The point in the controversy upon which the claim of Combs to priority chiefly turns is whether he actually reduced the invention to practice in his Exhibit X and Z machines. The Examiner of Interferences\u2019 conclusion as to this was denied in turn by the Examiners in Chief and the Commissioner. The evidence on both sides has been reviewed in the several decisions quite fully, and the reasoning in support of the opposing view has been well presented. Our examination of the evidence on ail points convinces us that the Commissioner was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">We think it unnecessary to again review the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">The decision appealed from in each case will be affirmed. It is so ordered; and 'that this decision be certified to the Commissioner of Patents, as required by law'. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
