Martin, appellee. Originally, the issue embodied three counts, but the first having been awarded to Harry L. Johnson, appellant, and no appeal having been taken by appellee from this decision, only the 2d and 3d counts are before us for consideration. They read as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-6\">\u201c2. In a machine of the character described, the combination of the following instrumentalities, a series of top flap securing devices, a conveyor for feeding the cartons to such top flap securing devices, means whereby the cartons are fed to the machine in a plurality of streams, and means for alternately conveying the cartons one at a time from said streams to the conveyor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-7\">\u201c3. In a machine of the character described, a series of top flap folding devices, means whereby glue is applied to the flaps, a carton carrying conveyor provided with a plurality of followers secured at intervals to said conveyor and adapted to convey and carry the cartons forward into engagement with said folding and glue applying devices, means whereby the cartons are fed to the machine in a plurality of streams, and means for alternately conveying the cartons one at a time from said streams to tiie conveyor.\u2019'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-8\">The nature of the invention is clearly set forth in the decision of the Examiner of Interferences as follows: \u201cThe machines disclosed in the applications involved in this controversy are designed for closing and sealing the top flaps of cartons after they have been filled. To accomplish this, a conveyor is provided which carries the cartons through the machine, bringing them in their travel in contact with the folding, gluing, and sealing mechanisms. The cartons are received from the filling machines in two rows or streams, and as the conveyor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the folding and sealing machine is adapted to handle the cartons only in a single row or stream, a shifting mechanism is provided which automatically transfers the cartons, one at a time and in alternate order, from each of the two streams to the conveyor of the folding and sealing machine.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\">Appellant filed his application August 4, 1908. He took no testimony, relying upon his filing date for a date of conception and of constructive reduction to practice. Appellee\u2019s application was filed on July 22, 1909.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-6\"><em>Messrs. Chappell &amp; Lari </em>for the appellant;</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-7\"><em>Messrs. Mauro, Cameron, Lewis, &amp; M.assie </em>for'the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b530-8\">Mr. Justice Van Orsdel</author>\n<p id=\"AqBg\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">All of the tribunals below found that appellee in 1905 constructed and successfully operated a machine illustrated in \u201cMartin\u2019s Exhibit Drawing of Eirst Martin Machine,\u201d and that finding is not contested here. It is contended, however,- that this machine does not disclose \u201cmeans whereby the cartons are fed to the machine in a plurality of streams, and means for alternately conveying the cartons one at a time from said streams to the conveyor of the folding and sealing machine,\u201d as required by the issue. The tribunals below were unanimous in finding against this contention, and with them we agree. Appellee\u2019s first machine, on which he relies for a reduction to practice, shows the cartons fed forward in a plurality of streams until a reciprocating member forms them into a single stream on a belt, which carries them to another conveyor, from which they' are delivered by a swinging arm to a conveyor, which carries them into engagement with the folding and sealing devices. It will thus be seen that appellee\u2019s first machine shows \u201cmeans for alternately conveying the cartons one at a time from said streams to the conveyor of the folding and sealing machine,\u201d if the word \u201cmeans\u201d is to be given a construction broad enough to include the several elements there required to 'convey' the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>cartons from the several streams to the folding and sealing machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">There is no limitation in the claims that the means convey the cartons directly from the several streams to the folding and sealing machine. The word \u201cmeans\u201d is used in its generic sense. When thus used, its definition has been settled by this court in the case of <em>Lecroix </em>v. <em>Tyberg, </em>33 App. D. C. 586, where the construction of the words \u201cmeans for transferring the bunches from the mold to the wrapping mechanism\u201d was in issue. It appeared in that case that Tyberg\u2019s \u201cmeans\u201d consisted of three elements, \u2014 \u201ca rocking needle for transferring bunches from the mold, a traveling chain support to receive the bunches from the needle bar and transport them to a point adjacent the cigar-wrapping machine, and a horizontal swinging arm provided with grippers to lift the bunches from the chain support and transfer them to the wrapper-applying machine.\u201d The \u201cmeans\u201d described by Lecroix consisted of swinging arms which lifted the bunches from the mold and transferred them directly to the wrapping mechanism. It was there contended that the machines of the contesting parties were substantially different, but the court said: \u201cWe agree with the Commissioner that the words 'means for transferring the bunches from the mold to the wrapping mechanism,\u2019 as used in counts 1, 2, and 3, are applicable alike to the transferring device of each' party. The term 'means,\u2019 as used in this connection, must be held to be a generic term, and hence applicable to each species of transferring device. It follows that these counts arcs readable on Tyberg\u2019s structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">It is also contended by appellant that the issue should be given a strict construction because appellee\u2019s first machine had been in public use for more than two years prior to his application for patent. The question of priority is the only one with which we are concerned in this proceeding, and the question of a statutory bar to appellee\u2019s right to a patent on these claims is not in issue here. <em>Lecroix </em>v. <em>Tyberg, supra; Burson </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>29 App. D. C. 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law , required. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">A petition by the appellant for a rehearing was overruled March 3, 1914.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
