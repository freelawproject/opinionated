Claims 1 and 2 of his application were allowed by the Primary Examiner, but the following were rejected on reference to a patent to one Williams, which holding was affirmed by the appellate tribunals of the Patent Office:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-7\">\u201c3. A measuring device for aerated liquids under high pressure, comprising a pair of cups, a vent pipe connecting said cups and provided with check valves at each end, so arranged and disposed that the vent pipe will be open only when said cups are being tilled or discharged, and means for filling one cup and discharging the other cup simultaneously, each cup being adapted to hold a predetermined quantity of aerated liquid under high pressure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-8\"><em>\u201c4-. </em>In a liquid-measuring device for high-pressure liquids, a pair of cups, a vent pipe connected with said cups and provided with a check valve at each end, a float for each valve, free and unobstructed supply and discharge pipes connected to said cups and a four-way valve connected to said pipes so that by turning said valves, said cups may be alternately charged and discharged with an aerated liquid under high pressure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-9\"><em>uu. </em>In a liquid-measuring device adapted for high-pressure liquids, a pair of cups, a vent pipe connecting the upper portions of said cups, a valve in each cup for closing the communication with the vent pipe, a float connected with each valve and disposed within its cup and constructed to be actuated to close the valve by high pressure only, and means for filling one cup and automatically discharging the other cup simultaneously, the discharge being occasioned by the passage of gas under high pressure from one cup to the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-10\">\u201c(5.

Levy </em>and <em>Mr. O. E. Edwards </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-8\"><em>Mr. Webster S. Ruclcman </em>for the Commissioner of Patents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b614-9\">Mr. Justice Van Orsdei,</author>\n<p id=\"AqiA\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">We agree with the tribunals below that the Williams\u2019 structure is capable of \u25a0 being operated with a liquid under high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>pressure; lienee every element of claim 3 is readable on the prior device.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Claim I calls for a cheek valve for each end of the vent pipe and a float for each valve, while Williams shows merely a float which also acts as a check valve. It is contended that the float of Williams will not prevent the hack flow of a liquid under pressure. This contention was not sustained in the Patent Office, where it was held properly, we think, that the float of Williams is capable, or may be made capable without the exercise of inventive skill, of withstanding such back pressure, and that the use by appellant of a check valve with a float therefor is but the substitution of one well-known equivalent for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">It is next contended that the claim under consideration calls for a \u201cfour-way\u201d valve, while the Williams\u2019 patent specifies a \u201ctwo-way\u201d valve. Though these valves are called by different names, in structure they are substantially the same. The next difference alleged is that this claim demands that the supply and discharge pipes he unobstructed. In the Williams\u2019 patent, floats are described situated within the cups at the ends of the supply and discharge pipes, which would probably, as claimed by appellant, bo forced against their seats by liquid under pressure, thus preventing the operation of the device. But the purpose of these floats is to prevent, hv means of locking devices with which they are connected, the turning of the handle carrying the valve in the supply and discharge pipes of the cups, until one of the cups is entirely empty and the other entirely Ml. It would ThquiTO hut the cxctc\u00edsc o\u00ed mese mechanical skill to remove these floats. The omission of this element, with a corresponding loss of function, does not amount to invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">In regard to claims 5 and 6, we agree with the Board of Examiners in Chief, who said: \u201cClaim 5 provides that the floats which close the vents shall he actuated by high pressiire only. Williams\u2019 floats, so far as perceived, will he operated by either high or low pressure. Jt is not understood wherein there could he any invention in modifying these floats so that they could be operated only by high pressure., This claim, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>was also rightly rejected. Claim 6 involves merely'the considerations hereinabove discussed, and was also rightly rejected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOu\">Claims 7 and 8 provide that the floats shall be hemispherical and of large capacity. We are unable to discover invention in merely altering \u2019the size and shape of an element described in a patented device, where the difference in function is one already well known in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed, and the clerk is directed to certify thesh proceedings as bjr law required.
