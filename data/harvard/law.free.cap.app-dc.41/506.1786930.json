A. Bromund Company, appellant, and holding that appellee is entitled to the registration of the word \u201cGrand-ma\u2019s\u201d as a trademark for a perfumed waxing pad, notwithstanding the prior adoption and use of the word \u201cMother\u2019s\u201d by the appellant as a trademark for such pads.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">In his decision the Commissioner says: \u201cWhile the words \u2018Mother\u2019s\u2019 and \u2018Grand-ma\u2019s\u2019 both refer to a woman, these words neither look alike nor sound alike, and in view of the common use of these words by persons of all classes as referring to well-known relationships, it is not believed that they are so alike that there is any liability of purchasers being deceived by the mere use thereof. This is so obvious that in my opinion it is unnecessary to set this case down for taking testimony.\u201d In cases of this kind \u201cthe evidence of the eyes is more persuasive and satisfactory than any other.\u201d <em>Layton Pure Food Co. </em>v. <em>Church &amp; D.
