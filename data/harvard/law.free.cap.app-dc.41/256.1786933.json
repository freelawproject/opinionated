The Examiner of Interferences and the Commissioner sustained the opposition, from which ruling this appeal was taken. It is agreed that the goods to which the marks are applied are similar, and that appellees used their mark long prior to the adoption and use of its mark by appellant. The sole question, therefore, presented by the appeal, is whether the words \u201cPeptonzyme\u201d \u2022and \u201cPinozyme\u201d are so similar, within the meaning of the trademark law, as to tend to create confusion in trade.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-3\"><em>Mr. Wallace R. Lane </em>and <em>Mr. George Manhle </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-4\"><em>Mr. Alfred </em>IF. <em>Kiddle </em>and <em>Mr. Wylie C.

But in this case, in the absence of any evidence showing actual confusion, we think there is not such a general similarity between the marks as to cause the average purchaser of the goods to confuse one for the other. The Examiner cited, as decisive of this case, certain cases where the following marks were held to be confusing: \u201cPurock\u201d and \u201cPureoxia,\u201d <em>Ex parte Charles E. Hires Co. </em>180 Off. Gaz. 879; \u201cOarbolineum\u201d and \u201cCreo-Carbolin,\u201d <em>Re Barrett Mfg. Co. </em>167 Off. Gaz. 513; \u201cAutola\u201d and \u201cAu-to-do,\u201d <em>Re Wilcox, </em>36 App. D. C. 107; and \u201cM'omaja\u201d and \u201cMojav\u00e1,\u201d <em>American Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>Sloan, </em>68 Fed. 539. We think the marks in issue, where the only similarity consists in the single syllable \u201czyine,\u201d eome within the ruling in <em>Landespriv </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>36 App. D. C. 532, where the word \u201cKalodont\u201d was held not to be likely to be confused with \u201cSozodont;\u201d and in the' application <em>-of Ex parte The Laxakola Co. </em>100 Off. Gaz. 451, where it was held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u25a0 \u201cDermacura\u201d was not in conflict with \u201cDermakola;\u201d and in <em>Hall </em>v. Ingram, 28 App. D. D. 454, where \u201cSozodont\u201d was held not to be in conflict with \u201cZodenta.\u201d True, we have the testimony of witnesses on- behalf of appellees to the effect that in their opinion the use of the marks would create confusion, but this is counterbalanced by the witnesses for appellant, who testified to the contrary. .We agree with the statement of the Assistant Commissioner that \u201csuch testimony is not of great assistance in determining the question whether there is such \u2019similarity as to justify a-refusal to register under the statute; the effect of the marks upon the mind of the tribunal having to consider the question must be the controlling factor.\u201d Applying this test, we are impelled to the conclusion that the marks are not so similar as to be likely to create confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">;-It appears-in the opinion of the Assistant Commissioner that there is a registered trademark issued upon goods similar to those on which the marks in question are used consisting of the.word \u201cPanzyme.\u201d.- While we are only concerned, with the marks in opposition, it may be suggested that it is still within the power of the Commissioner to-inquire into the similarity .between this.mark and the mark of appellant. The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed, and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"A0D\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
