We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-22\">In June 1986 appellees Dennis and Beth Birenbaum executed customer agreements designating appellant Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc. (RPR) as their broker for the purchase and sale of securities in the Bir-enbaums\u2019 accounts with RPR. In February 1987 a dispute arose between the parties, and the Birenbaums alleged that an RPR broker made unauthorized trades in the Birenbaums\u2019 accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-23\">The customer agreement provided that the parties must arbitrate any controversy relating to the contract; the arbitration clause also stated that \u201c[njotwithstanding the foregoing, you are not required to arbitrate any dispute or controversy that arises under Federal Securities Laws, but instead can resolve any such dispute or controversy through litigation in the courts.\u201d The parties dispute the legal effect of the latter statement. After the Birenbaums threatened suit under the Federal Securities Laws and under state law, RPR filed an action for declaratory judgment requesting the court to declare its rights to arbitrate all matters in dispute, or alternatively, to declare its rights, duties, and liabilities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-24\">RPR then filed a motion under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, asking that the court \u201center an order in this action staying proceedings pending arbitration of the claims asserted.\u201d The Birenbaums answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and under state law. The magistrate to whom the motion was referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>recommended that the motion to stay be denied. The district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate. RPR then filed this appeal from the denial of the stay. We hold that we do not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Courts of appeals have jurisdiction over appeals from interlocutory orders granting or denying injunctions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Until recently, the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine made the grant or denial of a stay of an action at law pending arbitration automatically appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). <em>Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>317 U.S. 188, 63 S.Ct. 163, 87 L.Ed. 176 (1942); <em>Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>293 U.S. 379, 55 S.Ct. 310, 79 L.Ed. 440 (1935); <em>see also Jackson Brewing Co. v. Clarke, </em>303 F.2d 844 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 891, 83 S.Ct. 190, 9 L.Ed.2d 124 (1962). This year the Supreme Court repudiated the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine in <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., </em>485 U.S. -, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988), holding that \u201corders granting or denying stays of \u2018legal\u2019 proceedings on \u2018equitable\u2019 grounds are not automatically appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1),\u201d 108 S.Ct. at 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine had long been criticized by scholars and by the courts of appeals. One of the most eloquent and forceful attacks on the doctrine in this circuit is Judge Rubin\u2019s dissent in <em>Mar-Len of Louisiana, Inc. v. Parsons-Gilbane, </em>732 F.2d 444 (5th Cir.1984). Given the Supreme Court\u2019s recent reversal of that doctrine and its citation of Judge Rubin\u2019s dissent, 108 S.Ct. at 1142, the appellant argues that Judge Rubin\u2019s opinion is now authoritative in this circuit. The <em>Mar-Len </em>case involved an order falling outside of the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine, a stay of an equitable action pending arbitration, and the majority dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. 732 F.2d at 445. Judge Rubin argued that the <em>Enelow-Et-telson </em>doctrine should be abandoned because its distinctions between actions at law and equitable actions were artificial and outmoded and that the appeal should be heard because of the strong policy favoring arbitration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 446-47. Thus Judge Rubin would have abandoned the distinctions between law and equity in the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine to expand appellate jurisdiction; but that was not the holding of the Supreme Court. The demise of the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine makes the majority opinion in <em>Mar-Len </em>controlling for all orders granting or denying a stay under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, whether or not that order falls within the action at law category carved by the old <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">After overturning the cases that established the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine, the Court noted that its holding \u201cwill not prevent interlocutory review of district court orders when such review is truly needed.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQk\">Section 1292(a)(1) will, of course, continue to provide appellate jurisdiction over orders that grant or deny injunctions and orders that have the practical effect of granting or denying injunctions and have \u201c \u2018serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.\u2019 \u201d As for orders that were ap-pealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1) solely by virtue of the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine, they may, in appropriate circumstances, be reviewed under the collateral-order doctrine of \u00a7 1291, and the permissive appeal provision of \u00a7 1292(b) as well as by application for a writ of mandamus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>Gulfstream, Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., </em>108 S.Ct. at 1142-43 (citations and footnotes omitted). Appellant argues that the district court\u2019s order is appealable because the denial of a stay of proceedings pending arbitration has the same practical effect as the denial of an injunction. This reading of the <em>Gulfstream </em>case would revive the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine under another name and flatly contradict the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that stays \u201care not automatically appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\u201d The Court clearly did not intend by its citation of the same practical effect test to save any \u201corders that were appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1) solely by virtue of- the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine\u201d; stays of legal proceedings pending arbitration unquestionably fall within that category. <em>See Municipal Energy Agency v. Big Rivers Elec. Corp., </em>804 F.2d 338, 341 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Mar-Len of Louisiana, Inc. v. Parsons-Gilbane, </em>732 F.2d at 445. The question is not whether a stay can have the same result as an injunction, but whether the stay has the effect of denying an injunction \u2014 such as when a court stays proceedings in which one party seeks a preliminary injunction. <em>E.g., Gray Line Motor Tours, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, </em>498 F.2d 293, 298 (5th Cir.1974); <em>see also Carson v. American Brands, Inc., </em>450 U.S. 79, 83-84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981) (holding that the denial of a motion to enter a consent decree containing injunc-tive relief had the same practical effect as denying an injunction). In fact, an order by a federal court \u201cthat relates only to the conduct or progress of litigation before that court ordinarily is not considered an injunction and therefore is not appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\u201d <em>Gulfstream, </em>108 S.Ct. at 1138. Thus an order termed an \u201cinjunction\u201d that functions merely as a stay of proceedings within the court issuing it is not appealable. <em>Hamilton v. Robertson, </em>854 F.2d 740 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Moreover, an interlocutory order with the same practical effect as granting or denying an injunction is appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1) only if a party shows that the order has serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence. <em>Carson v. American Brands, Inc., </em>450 U.S. at 84, 101 S.Ct. at 996. Thus, when failure to hear an appeal of an interlocutory order effectively denies the party any review of the denial of the requested injunctive relief, an appeal will lie under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). In this case, however, not only must the district court reconsider the arbitration question in deciding the appellant\u2019s declaratory judgment action, but the final judgment of the district court may be set aside on appeal in favor of arbitration. The denial of the stay in this case does not entail any serious or potentially irreparable consequences. <em>Cf. Switzerland Cheese Ass\u2019n v. E. Horne\u2019s Market, Inc., </em>385 U.S. 23, 87 S.Ct. 193, 17 L.Ed.2d 23 (1966) (holding that the denial of a motion for summary judgment containing a request for permanent injunctive relief, although having the same practical effect as a denial of permanent injunctive relief, was not ap-pealable because the relief was available after the trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">RPR alternatively argues that the denial of the stay is appealable under the collateral order doctrine. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, certain orders are appealable if they finally determine issues separate from the merits of the case. <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546-47, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed.2d 1528 (1949). The collateral order doctrine under <em>Cohen </em>requires that an order (1) conclusively determine the disputed question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2458, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978); <em>Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., </em>849 F.2d 955, 957 (5th Cir.1988). If the order fails to satisfy any one of the requirements, it cannot be appealed under the collateral order doctrine. <em>Gulfstream, </em>108 S.Ct. at 1137. As noted above, if RPR has a right to arbitrate the disputed claims, any judgment entered in this case can be set aside and the claims referred to arbitration; therefore, the denial of the stay does not meet the third requirement of the collateral order doctrine. In the rare instances before the <em>Gulfstream </em>decision when courts were confronted with the question, they decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>that a stay of proceedings pending arbitration was not appealable under the collateral order doctrine. <em>In re Hops Antitrust Liti</em>gation., 832 F.2d 470, 472 (8th Cir.1987); <em>Hartford Financial Systems v. Florida Software Serv., </em>712 F.2d 724, 726 (1st Cir.1983); <em>Langley v. Colonial Leasing Co., </em>707 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The other two avenues of appeal mentioned by the Supreme Court in <em>Gulf-stream </em>are also unavailable to the appellants. The district court has not certified this order for a permissive appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b); and the appellants have not applied for a writ of mandamus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the denial of the stay in this case is unreviewable under both \u00a7 1292(a)(1) and the collateral order doctrine, this court has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Our view is consistent with recent decisions in the Second, Third, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits. <em>See Zosky v. Boyer, </em>856 F.2d 554 (3d Cir.1988); <em>Feldspar Trucking Co. v. Greater Atlanta Shippers Ass\u2019n, </em>849 F.2d 1389 (11th Cir.1988); <em>McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp. v. Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co., </em>849 F.2d 761 (2d Cir.1988); <em>Crist v. Miller, </em>846 F.2d 1143 (7th Cir.1988). The appeal is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\">. Judge Rubin\u2019s point about the federal policy favoring arbitration is well-taken and is repeatedly urged by the appellants, but that federal policy cannot confer additional jurisdiction on a court of appeals. The appellants may be put to some additional expense and wasted effort if they are forced to litigate a claim that must ultimately be arbitrated, but as Judge Pos-ner recently noted, \"that is always true when a sound defense interposed early in a litigation is erroneously rejected. It is the price we pay for having a final-judgment rule.\" <em>Crist v. Miller, </em>846 F.2d 1143, 1144 (7th Cir.1988). Furthermore, expanding appellate jurisdiction to include orders affecting arbitration would just as often cut against the federal policy favoring arbitration because parties would be allowed to appeal rather than arbitrate when the stay is granted. In either case, allowing appeals of such stays would work against the stronger federal policy against piecemeal appeals. <em>See Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, </em>348 U.S. 176, 178, 75 S.Ct. 249, 251, 99 L.Ed. 233 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-15\">. Even if this appeal were construed as an application for the writ of mandamus, the appellants have certainly not shown the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that are required to justify the issuance of the writ. <em>See Gulfstream, </em>108 S.Ct. at 1143-44.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
