Finding the requisite jurisdiction and concluding that the counterclaim is not patently frivolous, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-28\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-29\">Transportes and Flota Mar\u00edtima Mexica-na executed a charter party for Flota\u2019s vessel, the M/V FEDER GULF. Flota subsequently substituted the M/V FEDER TRADER. The charter party provided for the arbitration of any dispute arising thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-30\">A dispute arose. Transportes filed the instant complaint, seeking the arrest of the FEDER TRADER pursuant to section 8 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the Arbitration Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The vessel was arrested. Flota answered, counterclaimed for breach of the charter party, and invoked Rule E(7),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requesting the posting of countersecurity in the amount of $180,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Transportes contended that because Flo-ta\u2019s counterclaim was frivolous the request for countersecurity should be denied. The district court rejected the request for coun-tersecurity, apparently because Flota had not posted the security ordered for release of the FEDER TRADER. After filing a vessel release bond in the amount of $110,-000. Flota reurged its motion for counterse-curity and filed a motion for a stay of proceedings pending arbitration. The district court granted the motion to stay but denied the motion for countersecurity because Flota had\" not sufficiently specified its alleged damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Flota then moved for reconsideration and itemized its damages. The district court ordered the posting of countersecurity in the amount of $110,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Transportes maintains that section 8 of the Arbitration Act does not provide the jurisdictional basis for a Rule E(7) motion for security on a counterclaim. We do not agree. As an alternative to proceeding directly to arbitration, section 8 permits an \u201caggrieved party with a claim otherwise justiciable in admiralty\u201d to initiate the claim in district court \u201cby libel and seizure of the vessel or other property of the other party according to the usual course of admiralty proceedings.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 8. Section 8 preserves for \u201cthe party claiming to be aggrieved\u201d the traditional admiralty procedure of seizure of an opponent\u2019s vessel or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">Nothing in the language of section 8 limits its application to plaintiffs. As one advancing a counterclaim otherwise justiciable in admiralty, Flota is a party \u201cclaiming to be aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of section 8. As such, it may request coun-tersecurity under Rule E(7), a traditional procedure in admiralty. <em>See Titan Navigation, Inc. v. Timsco, Inc., </em>808 F.2d 400, 402 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201cThe concept of counterse-curity is found in the first promulgation of rules in American admiralty courts, and it has continued to date with little substantive change.\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>see also The Anaconda v. American Sugar Refining Co., </em>322 U.S. 42, 46, 64 S.Ct. 863, 865, 88 L.Ed. 1117 (1944) (In enacting Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, \u201cCongress plainly and emphatically declared that although the parties had agreed to arbitrate, the traditional admiralty procedure with its concomitant security should be available to the aggrieved party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">Transportes alternatively contends that even if section 8 vests the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>court with jurisdiction to entertain a Rule E(7) motion for countersecurity, the court <em>a quo </em>lost jurisdiction when it stayed the proceeding pending arbitration. We are not persuaded. The countersecurity was granted upon reconsideration of a motion made prior to the stay. Moreover, although the stay suspended the litigation on the merits, the district court retained jurisdiction to rule on procedural matters, <em>see In re Amerada Hess Corp., </em>1986 A.M.C. 505, 506 (S.D.N.Y.1985), [available on WESTLAW, 1985 WL 5981] and to enter its decree upon the arbitration award. 9 U.S. C. \u00a7 8. Flota\u2019s Rule E(7) motion for coun-tersecurity qualifies as a procedural matter. <em>See </em>Rule A of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims. Thus the district court neither erred nor abused its discretion in ordering Transportes to post countersecurity after staying the proceedings pending arbitration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>If the basis of jurisdiction be a cause of action otherwise justiciable in admiralty, then ... the party claiming to be aggrieved may begin his proceeding hereunder by libel and seizure of the vessel or other property of the other party according to the usual course of admiralty proceedings, and the court shall then have jurisdiction to direct the parties to proceed with the arbitration and shall retain jurisdiction to enter its decree upon the award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Finally, Transportes contends that the district court should not have ordered countersecurity because Flota\u2019s counterclaim is frivolous. The district court was aware of our recent decision in <em>Titan Navigation, Inc. v. Timsco, Inc., </em>in which we stated that countersecurity should not be required \u201cwhere the counterclaim is frivolous or so lacking in merit that the court can only conclude that the counterclaim was advanced solely to secure a negotiating advantage over the complainant.\u201d 808 F.2d at 404. Implicit in the challenged ruling is a determination by the trial court that Flota\u2019s counterclaim is not frivolous. Reviewing the record as presently constituted does not convince us otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">.

In this action Flota counterclaimed for damages caused by breach of the charter party as well as by the wrongful seizure of the M/V FEDER TRADER.
