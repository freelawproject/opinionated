The proposed agreement was prefaced by certain \u201cGoverning Clauses\u201d which applied to all of its provisions. The Governing Clauses were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201c1. The Board of Education of the San Juan Unified School District recognizes the Certificated Employees Council as the exclusive representative of all verified certificated employee organizations within the San Juan Unified School District.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\u201c2. The San Juan Teachers Association recognizes that the Board of Education has the responsibility and authority to manage and direct, on behalf of the public, all the operations and activities of the San Juan Unified School District to the full extent authorized by law; <em>provided that such responsibility and authority shall be exercised by the Board in conformity with the provisions of this Agreement,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">\u201c3. The Board of Education hereby declares its intent to <em>maintain </em>the agreements reached, on the various items in this Master Agreement, as district policy for a period of <em>one year </em>from their date of adoption by the Board of Education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">\u201c4. The members of the San Juan Teachers Association hereby declare their intent to provide their professional services within their individual areas of competence, in accordance with this Agreement and with other adopted District Policies and the laws of the State of California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">\u201c5. Amendments, changes, modifications or other alterations of the terms of this Master Agreement, after its adoption by the Board of Education <em>and its ratification by the Association, </em>may be <em>proposed </em>by the Board or the Association in order to meet emergencies, to comply with statutory provisions, or to effect other changes deemed important to initiate during the term of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201c6. No amendments, changes, modifications or other alterations of the terms of this Master Agreement may be made by an administrative officer of the District or by a representative of the Association; except that such officer or representative may bring to the attention of the Board of Education and the Certificated Employees Council the apparent need for change of a portion of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\u201c7. As a result of meetings held between the designated representative of the Board of Education and the San Juan Certificated Employees Council, it has been <em>agreed </em>that the foregoing clauses and the attached Master Agreement be submitted to the San Juan Board of Education <em>for adoption </em>in accordance with Education Code Sections 13080-13090 [the Winton Act] and District Policy No. 4116.2 [Board rules and regulations to be discussed <em>infra]\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The CEC requested the Board\u2019s representative to meet and confer on the proposed Governing Clauses, but the Board refused to permit its representative to do so and informed the CEC that the Board would not agree to the clauses. To resolve this issue, the CEC requested that use be made of the procedures set forth in section 13087.1 for the resolution of persistent disagreements. The Board, however, declined to participate in such procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Among the provisions of the proposed master agreement was one for the creation and staffing of a counseling program in the District\u2019s intermediate schools (seventh and eighth grades) to furnish guidance on an individualized basis to students who presented educational or disciplinaiy problems. The Association, through the CEC, originally proposed that the program be handled by full-time counselors who possessed a counseling credential and had successfully completed 30 units of counseling studies, and who would be selected by the faculty and administrators of the schools they served.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">However, at a Board meeting on August 31, 1971, the Board adopted a \u201cteacher-adviser\u201d program in which teachers were to act as part-time teachers and part-time counselors and need not have obtained their counseling credential, although they were at least to be working toward it. Under the teacher-adviser program, school faculties were to have no role in the selection of counselors. The Board made its decision on August 31 notwithstanding the fact that, at the same meeting, the CEC had proposed that the staffs of individual schools be given the option of using either the teacher-adviser program or the full-time counselor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>program, and had requested that the matter be the subject of meeting and conferring.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Eighteen months earlier (on February 20, 1970), the Board had reissued certain rules and regulations which had been previously adopted by it to govern its relations with certificated employees. Those rules and regulations included a restatement of \u201crights . . . specified for certificated employees by Education Code, sections 13080 to 13088. . . .\u201d One of those rights, as described in the rules and regulations, was as follows: \u201cThe scope of representation by certificated employee organizations includes all matters relating to employment conditions and employer-employee relations, including, but not limited to, wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment and <em>all matters </em>relating to the definition of educational objectives, the determination of the content of courses and curricula, the selection of textbooks and other aspects of the instructional program to the extent such matters are within the discretion of the Board of Education.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">It is self-evident that the Board arrived at this definition of \u201cthe scope of representation\u201d by construing sections 13084 and 13085 as a whole in accordance with settled rules of statutory construction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the time the Board reissued the rules and regulations, section 13085 as first enacted was still in force and included \u201call matters relating to the definition of educational objectives [etc.]\u201d within the \u201cmeet and confer\u201d process insofar as certificated employees were concerned. (Stats. 1965, ch. 2041.) Subsequently, by an amendment of section 13085 effective November 23, 1970, the Statutes of 1970 (chs. 1412, 1413) substituted \u201cprocedures\u201d for \u201call matters\u201d before the phrase \u201crelating to the definition of educational objectives . . . .\u201d However, by the time of all the events above described, the Board had not yet changed its rules and regulations to make its definition of \u201cthe scope of representation\u201d conform with section 13085 as amended.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Having been rebuffed in their attempts to subject the Governing Clauses and the counselor program to the \u201cmeet and confer\u201d process, the Association and the chairman of the CEC sued the District for injunctive and declaratory relief. On October 1, 1971, the trial court granted a preliminary injunction which required the District, in its implementation of a part-time counseling program, \u201cto employ only those people who have the basic credential with at least six units of counselling training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>and absolutely and emphatically guarantee they will go forward with their full credential\u201d\u2014limitations which were satisfactory to the Board. No appeal was taken from that order. Subsequently, at the trial of the declaratory relief issues in April 1972, the plaintiffs in the San Juan case made no attempt to obtain a permanent injunction; and the judgment against the San Juan Unified School District is silent as to injunctive relief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">2. <em>Judgment and Contentions in San Juan Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The declaratory judgment held, inter alia, as follows: \u201cWhile only the Board may decide in the first instance whether or not there will be an intermediate school counselling program, once that determination has been made, <em>all </em>matters relating to the implementation of the program, including the qualifications of the personnel to be used in the program, are within the scope of representation of the Winton Act.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Although satisfied with the trial court\u2019s prefatory declaration which reserved to the Board the sole power to decide whether there would be a counseling program,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the District contends that the court erred when it further held that the scope of representation (inferentially, of certificated employees) extends to \u201call matters relating to the implementation of the program, including the qualifications of the personnel to be used in the program. . . .\u201d We reject the District\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u201cIt is a cardinal rule of construction that the several parts of a statute must be read together and harmonized, when reasonably possible, so as to discover and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Ingram </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 832, 839 [73 Cal.Rptr. 410, 447 P.2d 650, 36 A.L.R.3d 1391].) \u201c[T]he intent behind the legislation is determined from the language of the statute read as a whole . . . .\u201d <em>(Wingfield </em>v. <em>Fielder </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 209, 219 [105 Cal.Rptr. 619].) Moreover, \u201ccourts should give effect to statutes \u2018according to the usual, ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>import of the language employed in framing them.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Merrill </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 907, 918 [80 Cal.Rptr. 89, 458 P.2d 33].) \u201c[I]f the words of a statute given their ordinary and popular meaning are reasonably free from uncertainty, the courts will look no further to ascertain its meaning.\u201d <em>(Wingfield </em>v. <em>Fielder, supra, </em>at p. 219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">In section 13084, the Winton Act generally defines the scope of representation; and in section 13085 the act defines the scope of representation in the context of the \u201cmeet and confer\u201d process. <em>Insofar as here pertinent </em>(see fn. 5, <em>supra), </em>both sections use the same broad definition\u2014namely, \u201call matters relating to employment conditions and employer-employee relations . . . .\u201d (See also \u00a7 13087.1.) The mere fact that section 13084 declares that such \u201cmatters\u201d include but are not limited to \u201cwages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d in no way suggests that the scope of representation for purposes of section 13085 has a more restricted meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">When sections 13084 and 13085 are read together with section 13080, as applied to certificated employees, the only reasonable construction is that the formulation of educational policy is a matter relating to employment conditions and employer-employee relations, for section 13080 expressly states that one of the very purposes of the Winton Act is \u201cto afford certificated employees a voice in the formulation of educational policy.\u201d (See <em>Grasko </em>v. <em>Los Angeles City Board of Education </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 290, 302 [107 Cal.Rptr. 334]; <em>Torrance Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 589, 593 [98 Cal.Rptr. 639]; <em>California Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Oxnard Elementary Sch. </em>(1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 514, 533, 539 [77 Cal.Rptr. 497].)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">When the Legislature amended section 13085 by substituting \u201cprocedures\u201d for \u201call matters\u201d before the phrase \u201crelating to the definition of educational objectives\u201d (Stats. 1970, chs. 1412, 1413)\u2014a phrase not determinative of these appeals (see fn. 5, supra)\u2014it did not amend the declaration in section 13080 that a purpose of the Winton Act is \u201cto afford certificated employees a voice in the formulation of educational policy.\u201d (Italics added.) We therefore conclude that \u201ceducational policy\u201d was intended by the Legislature to have a more pervasive meaning than \u201ceducational objectives,\u201d especially since the latter phrase is used in section 13085 in association with \u201cthe determination of the content of courses and curricula, the selection of textbooks, and <em>other aspects of the instructional program </em>. . . . \u201d (Italics added.) (See, <em>Torrance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.3d at p. 593; <em>California Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Oxnard Elementary Sch., supra, </em>272 Cal.App.2d at p. 533.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We emphasize that the act only gives such employees \u201ca voice\u201d by which they may express themselves on subjects of meeting and conferring; section 13088 reserves to the public school employer the power of final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Thus, upon a literal and <em>integrated </em>construction of sections 13080, 13084, and 13085, it is manifest that all matters relating to the implementation of the counseling program\u2014including qualification criteria for, and selection of, the counselors themselves (except as section 1070 prescribing qualifications may be applicable)\u2014are necessarily included within the inherently broad scope of \u201call matters relating to employment conditions and employer-employee relations\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 13084, 13085). Implementation of the program not only involves determinations of educational policy (e.g., full-time versus part-time counselors) but also will affect the employment conditions of the general teaching staff by removing problem students from the classroom for temporary specialized guidance. Indeed, here as in the trial court, the District has conceded that the teacher-adviser program has an impact upon the working conditions of teachers because it involves a shift from full-time teaching to part-time teaching and part-time counseling, and it requires that other teachers pick up the teaching load being dropped by the teacher-counselors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">We recognize, of course, that \u201c[t]he literal meaning of the words of a statute may be disregarded to avoid absurd results or to give effect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>manifest purposes that, in the light of the statute\u2019s legislative history, appear from its provisions considered as a whole.\u201d <em>(Silver </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 841, 845 [48 Cal.Rptr. 609, 409 P.2d 689].) However, nothing in the history of the Winton Act<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> indicates that the Legislature failed to appreciate the sweeping import of the phrase \u201call matters relating to\u201d in sections 13084 and 13085\u2014giving those words their ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">To the contrary, since public school teachers in California have no right to bargain collectively or to strike <em>(Grasko </em>v. <em>Los Angeles City Board of Education, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.3d at p. 302; <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>United Teachers </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 142 [100 Cal.Rptr. 806]; <em>California Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Oxnard Elementary Sch., supra, </em>272 Cal.App.2d at pp. 521, 523; <em>Berkeley Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 660, 671 [62 Cal.Rptr. 515]; see <em>Almond </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 32, 35-36 [80 Cal.Rptr. 518]), it is reasonable to conclude that the Winton Act represents a legislative attempt not to end but to compensate for those disabilities, thus pacifying certificated employees <em>(California Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Oxnard Elementary Sch., supra, </em>at pp. 521-522, 539-540), by granting such employees a broad scope of representation in \u201crecognition that school teachers, because of their expertise and dedication to the welfare of the schools and their pupils, are particularly well suited to make a constructive contribution to the formulation of [educational] policy\u201d <em>(Grasko </em>v. <em>Los Angeles City Board of Education, supra, </em>at p. 302; see also <em>California Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Oxnard Elementary Sch., supra, </em>at pp. 531-533).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201c \u2018Teachers are earnest and devoted people with a high degree of professional training and experience. They know children and what goes on in the classroom and in the learning process. A lay board should make full use of their willingness, and their knowledge and experience in matters of vital concern to both. Their voices should be heard and their recommendations thoughtfully considered. This should be rudimentary in good procedure. If boards and superintendents aren\u2019t doing this, they should. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(California Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Oxnard Elementary Sch., supra, </em>272 Cal.App.2d at p. 539.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Based upon the Board\u2019s aforementioned failure to change its rules and regulations to conform with the 1970 amendment of section 13085, the trial court made as paragraph No. 2 of its declaratory judgment the following holding: \u201cThe Board may, and here did, expand the mandatory scope of representation by its Policies and Procedures [i.e., rules and regulations], the Winton Act providing only broad guidelines. (See <em>Sacramento County Employees Organization, Local 22, etc. Union </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 424, 430.)\u201d (Citation in original.) The. court also declared, as paragraph No. 5 of the judgment, that \u201c[t]he Board may adopt policies and procedures which bind it to meet and confer upon all matters in respect to which the Board has discretion to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The District contends that the holdings in paragraphs No. 2 and No. 5 of the judgment are erroneous. We agree. Quite apart from our conclusion that the Board\u2019s mere failure to amend its rules and regulations was not substantial evidence that it intended to expand the mandatory scope of representation (see <em>Estate of Teed </em>(1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 638, 644 [247 P.2d 54]), we are of the opinion that, as a matter of law, the Board has no power to expand the scope of representation delineated by the Winton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u201cA school district is an agency of limited authority; it may exercise only those powers granted by statute.\u201d <em>(Yreka etc. School Dist. </em>v. <em>Siskiyou etc. School Dist. </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 666, 670 [39 Cal.Rptr. 112].) \u201cA governing board of a school district has no authority to enact a rule or regulation which alters or enlarges the terms of a legislative enactment.\u201d <em>(Renken </em>v. <em>Compton City School Dist. </em>(1962) 207 Cal.App.2d 106, 114 [24 Cal.Rptr. 347]; see also <em>Grasko </em>v. <em>Los Angeles City Board of Education, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.3d at pp. 300-301; <em>Berkeley Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>254 Cal.App.2d at pp. 672-673.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The Winton Act is an innovative statute <em>(Grasko </em>v. <em>Los Angeles City Board of Education, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.3d at pp. 301-302, 306; <em>Westminster Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 28.

One of the express purposes of the Winton Act is to provide \u201ca <em>uniform </em>basis for recognizing the right of public school employees to ... be represented ... in their professional and employment relationships with public school employers . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 13080.) (Italics added.) Such uniformity would be nonexistent throughout the state if school districts were free to expand or not to expand the mandatory scope of representation, as they saw fit. The very lack of uniformity would be productive of unrest on the part of those public school employees whose scope of representation had not been expanded by their employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In holding that the Board can expand the mandatory scope of representation, the trial court erroneously relied upon <em>Sacramento County Employees Organization, Local 22 etc. Union </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.3d 424 [104 Cal.Rptr. 619]. That case arose under the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3500 et seq.; see fn. 11, <em>supra). </em>Just as the Winton Act authorizes a public school employer to adopt rules which \u201cmay include provisions for . . . such other matters as are necessary to cany out the purposes of [the act]\u201d (\u00a7 13087), the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act permits other public agencies to adopt rules which \u201cmay include provisions for . . . such other matters as are necessary to carry out the purposes of [the latter act]\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3507). However, in the <em>Sacramento County Employees Organization </em>case, the determination of the appellate court that the county could authorize the payroll deduction of dues (and could limit such deductions to members of recognized employee organizations) was based upon the failure of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act to mention the subject of dues, as well as upon other statutes which expressly allowed but did not require public agencies to approve dues deductions (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1157.1, 1157.3). (28 Cal.App.3d at pp. 430-431.) In contrast, the Winton Act is not silent as to the scope of representation, but defines and describes it. (\u00a7\u00a7 13080, 13084, 13085, 13087.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The District next attacks the declaration in paragraph No. 3 of the judgment that \u201c[t]he Board may not act unilaterally with respect to a matter under negotiation.\u201d We reject the District\u2019s broad contention that the Board may, <em>under any circumstances, </em>act unilaterally on a matter as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>which the Board and the CEC are then meeting and conferring. It is self-evident that the latter contention would be destructive of the \u201cmeet and confer\u201d process and contrary to the purposes of the Winton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">By the same token, however, paragraph No. 3 of the judgment is overly broad in that its effect is to prohibit the Board from acting unilaterally on a current \u201cmeet and confer\u201d item regardless of the circumstances, which might even be of an emergency nature. The Legislature, by defining \u201cmeet and confer\u201d in section 13081, subdivision (d), has provided the accommodation necessary to resolve this issue. Accordingly, we hold that a public school employer may not act unilaterally with respect to a matter as to which the employer is then meeting and conferring with representatives of employee organizations under section 13085 unless the employer has complied with section 13081, subdivision (d), or a bona fide emergency compels such unilateral action.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The District also ascribes error to paragraph No. 4 of the judgment, which declared as follows: \u201cThe Board may, but is not required to, enter into a legally binding agreement relating to wages, hours and other working conditions, including the so-called \u2018governing clauses.\u2019 The Board, however, is required to meet and confer in a conscientious\" effort to reach agreement on such matters.\u201d The District\u2019s contention in this regard is meritorious.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">\u201cThe Winton Act does not embody the concept of collective bargaining. [Citations.] Its provisions make clear that the right conferred upon certificated public school employees is to voice their views and ideas through recognized representatives and to have these views and ideas considered by the public school employer but that all final decisions are left to the public school employer. (\u00a7\u00a7 13085, 13088.)\u201d <em>(Westminster Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.3d at p. 128.) \u201c[TJhere is no statutory requirement that the employer \u2018negotiate\u2019 in the sense of striving to reach a contract, bargain or agreement. Rather, the statutory obligation of the employer is expressed in the words \u2018meet and confer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Torrance Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.3d at p. 593.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Although the duty to \u201cmeet and confer\u201d requires \u201ca conscientious effort to reach agreement,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> such agreement must be effected \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>written resolution, regulation, or policy <em>of the governing board </em>. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 13081, subd. (d).) (Italics added.) In <em>Grasko </em>v. <em>Los Angeles City Board of Education, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.3d at pages 303-304, the court held that the legislative history of the Winton Act compels the conclusion that the governing board\u2019s resolutions, regulations, and policies \u201cmust be subject to change at the board\u2019s pleasure\u201d inasmuch as \u201cthe Legislature has determined that binding written contracts or agreements have no place in the field of labor relations between a public school employer and its employees.\u201d Accordingly, the court ruled that California school districts and their governing boards are not authorized to enter into binding agreements with representatives of their employees regarding matters of employment conditions or educational policy, <em>(id. </em>at p. 300.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The Governing Clauses proposed in the case at bench were, on their face, a thinly veiled attempt by the Association and CEC to convert the Winton Act into a vehicle for collective bargaining and to effect a binding contract of the type proscribed in <em>Grasko. </em>Hence, while the Board is required to meet and confer with the CEC upon request in a conscientious effort to \u201creach agreement\u201d (as defined by section 13081, subdivision (d)) on matters within the scope of representation, the Board is not required to meet and confer with the CEC concerning the Governing Clauses or any other proposed binding agreement relating to such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Lastly, the District argues that a school board is not required to meet and confer upon request to determine whether the matter involved falls within the scope of representation. Although the declaratory judgment did not address itself to that issue, the trial court found that there was \u201can actual present controversy between the parties\u201d concerning it. The question being one of law, this opinion will serve as an adequate declaration as to its proper resolution. (See <em>Torrance Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.3d at p. 595.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We reject the District\u2019s contention. We do not think that the Legislature intended to make the Winton Act a source of premature litigation in cases where neither statute nor case law had answered the question whether a particular subject fell within the mandatory scope of representation, as broadly defined and described in the Winton Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Acceptance of the District\u2019s argument would proliferate requests for judicial intervention without benefit of the more adequate administrative record, bearing on the merits of that question, which would result from \u201cmeet and confer\u201d sessions devoted to its resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The \u201cmeet and confer\u201d process is intended by the Legislature to serve as a \u201cmethod[ ] of communication between employees and the public school employers by which they are employed\u201d (\u00a7 13080) so as to \u201cpromote the improvement of. . . employer-employee relations\u201d <em>{ibid.). </em>The \u201cmeet and confer\u201d process, therefore, is an instrument of employer-employee relations; and, in cases where there is a question whether a specific topic must be explored by that process, such questions are clearly \u201cmatters <em>relating </em>to . . . employer-employee relations\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 13084, 13085) and are themselves subject to meeting and conferring upon request. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Our views in this last respect in no way conflict with our holding that a school district is powerless to expand the scope of representation delineated by the Winton Act. No agreement of the parties, reached after meeting and conferring, can effectively bring a matter within the scope of representation if it has no lawful place there.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Yuba City Case (3 Civil No. 13924)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">1. <em>Facts in Yuba City Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">During several \u201cmeet and confer\u201d sessions prior to December 15, 1970, the Yuba City Unified Education Association (\u201cAssociation\u201d), represented by a certificated employee council (\u201cCEC\u201d), proposed to the governing board (\u201cBoard\u201d) of the Yuba City Unified School District (\u201cDistrict\u201d) a permanent salary schedule increase for teachers employed by the District. At those meetings the CEC and the Board\u2019s representatives discussed sources of money available for teacher salary increases and areas of the budget that could be cut to provide for such increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">The Board\u2019s only counteroffer came on December 15, 1970, when, through its representatives, the Board proposed a one-year-only (1970-1971) salary adjustment of $135,000 to be divided among all certificated personnel, including administrators as well as teachers. The Board asserted at that time that its counterproposal was a \u201cfirst, last and final offer.\u201d The Association, however, declined to accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>On December 21, 1970, at a meeting of the Board, the chairman of the CEC declared that there was a persistent disagreement between the CEC and the Board, and asked for the establishment of a fact-finding committee pursuant to the provisions of section 13087.1. Such a committee was established; it met and thereafter submitted a unanimous report, dated February 10, 1971, to the Board. The report made findings of fact that additional monies would probably be forthcoming to the District over and above the amounts anticipated by the Board in offering a salary adjustment of $135,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Subsequently, the chairman of the CEC requested the Board to meet and confer regarding the' 1970-1971 salary adjustment based upon the findings of the fact-finding committee. The Board was willing to voluntarily \u201cdiscuss\u201d that subject; but, on the ground that the Winton Act did not require it, the Board refused to recognize any legal obligation to meet and confer on teachers\u2019 salaries based upon the committee\u2019s findings. Instead, the Board\u2019s representatives proposed to the CEC two alternative methods of allocating to certificated personnel, as a one-year salary adjustment for 1970-1971, a sum greater than $135,000 but not inclusive of all additional funds anticipated by the fact-finding committee. Because of the refusal of the Board to meet and confer on the basis of the committee\u2019s report, and lacking any other alternative, the Association accepted one of the two alternatives proposed by the Board. The Board thereafter adjusted teachers\u2019 salaries for 1970-1971 accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">During the period from July 1971 to June 1972, the CEC requested the Board to meet and confer on budget and spending priorities in relation to teachers\u2019 salary increases, on the use and availability for such increases of specified revenues and monies which the Board had discretion to appropriate for that purpose, and on the inhibiting effect upon such increases of expenditures for other purposes from the District\u2019s undistributed reserve. The CEC also requested the Board to meet and confer on those items prior to appropriating, for other uses, funds which the Board had discretion to expend for teachers\u2019 salary increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The Board refused those requests. The Board contended that the \u201cmeet and confer\u201d requirements of the Winton Act did not extend to the items specified by the CEC, and that, although the Board would honor its statutory obligation to meet and confer on teachers\u2019 salaries per se, it would only \u201cdiscuss\u201d on a voluntary basis (rather than under statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>compulsion) the items concerning revenue availability, budget and spending priorities, and use of the undistributed reserve. Accordingly, on numerous occasions during the last half of 1971 and first half of 1972, the CEC and the Board\u2019s representatives met and conferred on teachers\u2019 salary increases, but only \u201cdiscussed\u201d the other related fiscal items. During this period, the Board adopted the budget for 1971-1972 and authorized expenditures for other purposes of funds which it had discretion to appropriate for teachers\u2019 salary increases; and the Board did so even though no emergency existed and the CEC had requested the Board to defer action until the priority of those expenditures in relation to such increases had been explored at \u201cmeet and confer\u201d sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In the spring of 1972, the Board refused to meet and confer upon the basis of the report of a fact-finding committee established after a persistent disagreement had been declared by the CEC with respect to teachers\u2019 salary increases for the 1971-1972 school year. Instead, the Board granted the certificated employees another salary adjustment by using for that purpose a smaller portion of the undistributed reserve than the CEC had proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">2. <em>Judgment and Contentions in Yuba City Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Paragraph No. 2 of the declaratory portion of the judgment held as follows: \u201cThe Winton Act, in Education Code \u00a7 13087.1, establishes a procedure for findings and recommendations by a committee established to consider the resolution of any persistent disagreement between a public school employer and the employee representative. Section 13087.1 contemplates that the findings and recommendations shall be the basis for the narrowing or resolution of the matters in dispute. The Winton Act accordingly requires that the parties meet and confer upon request with respect to the findings and recommendations of a committee formed pursuant to \u00a7 13087.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Inasmuch as section 13087.1 provides that the findings and recommendations of a committee established under it \u201cshall not be binding on the parties,\u201d the second sentence of paragraph No. 2 erroneously adjudged that the committee\u2019s findings and recommendations \u201cshall be\u201d the basis for the narrowing or resolution of the matters in dispute. Section 13087.1 contemplates that those findings and recommendations <em>may be </em>the basis for the narrowing or resolution of such matters. Contrary to the Board\u2019s contention, however, the trial court did not err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>holding that the Winton Act requires the parties to meet and confer upon request \u201cwith respect to\u201d the committee\u2019s findings and recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Section 13087.1 states that the procedure which it prescribes is one \u201cfor the resolution of persistent disagreements . . . .\u201d Although the parties are not bound by the findings and recommendations of the committee, the committee\u2019s efforts would seldom be of aid in resolving persistent disagreements if the parties were under no statutory compulsion to meet and confer upon request with respect to such findings and recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Moreover, subdivision (e) of section 13081 defines \u201cpersistent disagreement\u201d as \u201ca disagreement between the parties to meeting and conferring required by this article that has not been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties <em>through such meeting and conferring </em>within a reasonable period of time after the initial presentation of proposals .. ..\u201d (Italics added.) It is clearly to be inferred, therefore, that matters which are subject to the \u201cpersistent disagreement\u201d procedure of section 13087.1 are the same matters as to which section 13085 requires a public school employer to meet and confer upon request; hence findings and recommendations concerning such matters are likewise within the mandatory language of section 13085.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The judgment also held that \u201c[t]he subject matter of the use and availability of specified school revenues and monies within the discretion of a public school employer to appropriate for an increase in teacher salaries,\u201d and \u201c[t]he subject matter of the budget and spending priorities of a public school employer in relation to their substantial impact upon an increase in teacher salaries,\u201d are \u201cmatters relating to employment conditions\u201d within the meaning of sections 13084 and 13085 and thus matters upon which section 13085 requires a public school employer to meet and confer upon request. The judgment permanently enjoined the Board from refusing to meet and confer upon the aforementioned fiscal matters \u201cunder reasonable and orderly procedures established pursuant to. the Winton Act,\u201d provided that the revenues in question were substantial and not required to be otherwise expended by the existence of an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The Board asserts that the judgment erroneously brought the above stated fiscal matters within the scope of section 13085. The Board\u2019s argument fails. In our discussion of the San Juan case, we have explained that the Legislature intended certificated employees to have a broad scope of representation under sections 13080, 13084, and 13085. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The fiscal matters mentioned in the judgment not only all bear directly on teachers\u2019 salary increases (i.e., \u201cwages\u201d (\u00a7 13084)) but also, to some extent, bespeak \u201cthe formulation of educational policy\u201d (\u00a7 13080); hence th,ey are manifestly embraced by the inclusion in sections 13084 and 13085 of \u201call matters relating to employment conditions and employer-employee relations . . . .\u201d The Board\u2019s disagreement with the plain meaning of those sections is a point of view which only the Legislature can vindicate by statutory repeal or amendment. This court has no such power.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Concerning such fiscal matters, of course, we interpret only the scope of the statutory obligation to \u201cmeet and confer\u201d (\u00a7 13085). As hereinbefore emphasized in the context of the San Juan case <em>(ante, </em>fn. 10 and pp. 242, 248, and 252), section 13088 expressly reserves to the Board the power of final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The injunctive portion of the judgment also enjoined the Board from \u201c[e]xp ending monies, not otherwise obligated or restricted and within its discretion to appropriate for teacher salaries and not required to be expended by the existence of an emergency, during such times as reasonable and orderly procedures, established pursuant to the Winton Act, are being pursued pursuant to a request to meet and confer upon the subject of the appropriation of such monies, if substantial, for an increase in teacher salaries.\u201d In apparent reference to this portion of the judgment, the Board contends that \u201c[t]he Winton Act does not require that meeting and conferring be completed before a public school employer may act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The Board\u2019s latter contention is overly broad. As indicated in that portion of this opinion devoted to the San Juan case, it cannot be said that the Winton Act requires, <em>without exception, </em>that meeting and conferring be completed before a public school employer may act. Those exceptions were preserved by the injunction in the instant (Yuba City) case, which restrained the Board from expending the subject monies only if there was no emergency need for them, and only if \u201creasonable and orderly\u201d proc\u00e9dures were being pursued to implement a \u201cmeet and confer\u201d request concerning their appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The Board next contends that the trial court erred when, in paragraph No. 1 of the declaratory judgment, it held that \u201c[t]akeit-or-leave-it offers by a public school employer with respect to teacher salaries, a subject matter within the required scope of representation of the Winton Act, violates [sz'c] the Winton Act by failing the requirement of Education Code \u00a7 13081 [subd. (d)] that there be a conscientious effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>to reach agreement under orderly procedures.\u201d We uphold the Board\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The judgment in this respect was based upon the court\u2019s finding (expressed as a conclusion of law) that the Board had made one or more \u201c[t]ake-it-or-leave-it\u201d offers with respect to teachers\u2019 salaries. The finding had substantial support in the undisputed evidence that on December 15, 1970, as its only counterproposal up to that time, the Board had made what the Board then called a \u201cfirst, last and final offer.\u201d The finding was also supported by evidence that, with regard to the 1970-1971 salary adjustment, the Board had proposed two alternative methods of adjusting salaries while, at the same time, the Board was refusing the CEC\u2019s request to meet and confer concerning the report of the fact-finding committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The holding in paragraph No. 1, however, was too broad. <em>In and of itself </em>the mere fact that offers made by a public school employer as to \u201cmeet and confer\u201d items are \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d offers is insufficient to show a lack of conscientious effort by the employer to reach agreement under orderly procedures. The Winton Act does not require the employer to initially overstate its demands and understate its concessions and make a series of proposals before arriving at an ultimate good faith position on an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">As said concerning an analogous proposition under the Labor Management Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 et seq.), \u201cThe statutory duty to bargain collectively as set forth in Section 8(d) of the Act [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158, subd. (d)] imposes upon the parties the obligation \u2018to meet * * * and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment\u2019 with a view to the final negotiation and execution of an agreement. The statute states specifically that this obligation \u2018does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession.\u2019 [Cf., \u00a7 13088.] Thus the adamant insistence on a bargaining position is not necessarily a refusal to bargain in good faith. [Citation.] \u2018If the insistence is genuinely and sincerely held, if it is not mere window dressing, it may be maintained forever though it produce a stalemate. Deep conviction, firmly held and from which no withdrawal will be made, may be more than the traditional opening gambit of a labor controversy. It may be both the right of the citizen and essential to our economic legal system * * * of free collective bargaining.\u2019 [Citation.] The determination as to whether negotiations which have ended in stalemate were held in the spirit demanded by the statute is a question of fact which can only be answered by a consideration of all the \u2018subtle and elusive factors\u2019 that, viewed as a whole, create a true picture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>of whether or not a negotiator has entered into discussion with a fair mind and a sincere purpose to find a basis of agreement. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Almeida Bus Lines, Inc. </em>(1st Cir. 1964) 333 F.2d 729, 731; see <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co. </em>(1961) 198 Cal.App.2d 564, 578 [18 Cal.Rptr. 17].)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Lastly, the Board attacks the <em>court\u2019s </em>finding that the Board\u2019s policy was to refuse to meet and confer concerning the \u201csubstantial\u201d impact of the District\u2019s budget priorities upon teachers\u2019 salaries, and the Board also challenges the finding that this policy was manifested in June 1972 by its conduct in response to a \u201cmeet and confer\u201d request of the CEC. The Board\u2019s claim is that the evidence was insufficient to show that its refusal to meet and confer related to budget priorities having an impact upon teachers\u2019 salaries which was \u201csubstantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The claim is unavailing. The evidence was undisputed that, while refusing the CEC\u2019s ongoing requests to meet and confer on the effect of budget priorities upon teachers\u2019 salary increases, the Board used $74,000 from the District\u2019s undistributed reserve in August 1971 for purposes other than such increases. That sum is not insubstantial. The finding as to the Board\u2019s general policy in this regard being thus supported, there was a factual basis for the injunction and declaratory judgment in terms of that general policy. Thus any error in the specific finding as to the Board\u2019s conduct in June 1972 was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The judgments in 3 Civil No. 14010 and 3 Civil No. 13924 are modified in accordance with this opinion; and, as thus modified, the judgments are affirmed.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtD\">I concur in part, dissent in part. The Winton Act contains a number of large verbal abstractions which give the appearance but not the reality of concrete solutions. For example, after expressing a broad purpose \u201cto afford [teacher organizations] a voice in the formulation of educational policy\u201d (\u00a7 13080), the act demands that school trustees meet and confer with these organizations \u201cwith regard to procedures relating to the definition of educational objectives, the determination of the content of courses and curricula, the selection of textbooks, and other aspects of the instructional program ....\u201d (\u00a7 13085.) Relatively narrow employee participation in <em>procedures </em>is hardly coextensive with broad participation in <em>policy. </em>Similar examples of linguistic looseness abound.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Statutory generalizations of this sort have the earmarks of verbal compromises between contending special interests. They allow a legislative escape from controversy and send the contending interests out into the administrative arena and from thence into already overburdened courts. Conventional tenets of statutory interpretation fall flat in the face of such draftsmanship. Hence, conflicting interpretations must be tentative and respectful.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The Winton Act seems to demarcate a number of separate functional areas, granting employee organizations a participatory interest in some, excluding them from others. The majority opinion, in my view, fails to observe these demarcations and indulges in a blending which extends employee participation into decisional concerns not intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">An amicus brief filed by the California School Boards Association urges that the scope of representation granted employee organizations by Education Code sections 13083 and 13084 is not relevant in ascertaining the extent of the \u201cmeet and confer\u201d provisions of section 13085. The majority opinion correctly rejects that contention. There is no sense in a labor relations statute which mandates a sphere of representation, then excludes the employee organization from any right to negotiate within part of that sphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In the case of San Juan Unified School District, I agree: (1) that the district\u2019s rules and regulations couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t enlarge the statutory area of labor-management negotiations; (2) that the \u201cmaster agreement\u201d demanded by the San Juan Teachers Association was an unjustified attempt to impose an illegal collective bargaining contract on the school board; (3) that the school trustees had no optional authority to enter into collective bargaining contracts; (4) that the character of the school counselling program affected employment conditions of teachers, hence lay within the mandatory negotiation provision of section 13085; (5) that the school trustees could not refuse to \u201cmeet and confer\u201d in an effort to define the scope of negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s approval of the declaratory judgment\u2019s statement that \u201call matters relating to the implementation\u201d of the school counselling program were subject to compulsory negotiation. At this point the trial court simply repeated the fuzzy language of the statute. At this point the majority err by delineating too wide a scope for compulsory negotiations. For example, formulation of qualifications of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>school counselors is a lawful subject of mandatory, teacher-management consultations; selection among individual counselling applicants is not. Thus the phrase \u201call matters\u201d in the judgment is too broad to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">At one point the trial court granted a preliminary injunction which directed the school board to employ counselors with educational qualifications prescribed by the injunction. The injunction is outside the scope of this appeal. Nevertheless, I do not wish to imply approval by silence. Nothing in the law authorizes a superior court judge to fix the educational qualifications of applicants for school district employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">As to the Yuba City Unified School District case, I agree generally with the majority opinion up to\u2014but not including\u2014its acceptance of the proposition that a school board must meet and confer with teacher organizations regarding budgetary allocations for educational purposes outside the area of teachers\u2019 salaries and fringe benefits. At this point, the trial court\u2019s judgment and the majority opinion rest upon this shaky thesis\u2014that a decision to buy musical instruments or a school bus diminishes the money available to pay teachers, hence the school board is required to negotiate with the teachers\u2019 organization over the wisdom and necessity of purchasing musical instruments or a school bus. That thesis rests upon, first, an over-broad view of the employment conditions which section 13085 exposes to mandatory negotiation and, second, a refusal to recognize the 1970 amendment to section 13085.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">When the Winton Act was adopted in 1965, section 13085 gave teacher organizations a right to negotiate with the school board in two areas. These were described in the following terms: (a) \u201call matters relating to employment conditions and employer-employee relations\u201d and (b) \u201call matters relating to . . . the instructional program . . . .\u201d In 1970 section 13085 was amended in several respects. (Stats. 1970, chs. 1412, 1413.) The 1970 amendment did not change the first of the above clauses, but the second was amended to substitute the word \u201cprocedures\u201d for the phrase \u201call matters.\u201d Thus, as amended in 1970, the second of the above two clauses was amended to require negotiations covering \u201cprocedures relating to . . . the instructional program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">A school board makes up an annual budget of proposed expenditures and estimated revenues itemized \u201cby functions and object.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 20602, 20603.) The budget may raise money for an \u201cundistributed reserve\u201d covering unforeseen expenditures. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 20605.) School <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>districts are limited by tax rate ceilings. (Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 20751, 20800.) Given a limited revenue, all expenditure decisions impinge upon one another. Every penny of anticipated revenue devoted to \u201cfunctions and objects\u201d other than employee compensation diminishes the revenue available for employee compensation. I find nothing in the Winton Act denoting a legislative design to inject employee organizations into the entire gamut of school board budgetary deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In relating the phrase \u201call matters relating to employment conditions\u201d to budgetary determinations, it is difficult to articulate a formula for inclusion and exclusion. Generally, of course, this part of the statute embraces appropriations for salaries and fringe benefits. Dealing with a somewhat analogous statute, one court has restricted the scope of compulsory negotiations to those matters having \u201ca significant or material relationship\u201d to wages, hours and other conditions of employment. <em>(Westinghouse Electric Corporation </em>v. <em>N.L.R.B., </em>387 F.2d 542, 548; see also <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>v. <em>Labor Board, </em>379 U.S. 203, 223-224 [13 L.Ed.2d 233, 245-246, 85 S.Ct. 398, 6 A.L.R.3d 1130], separate opinion of Stewart, J.) In any event, when the relationship consists of nothing more than the negative effect created by distribution of revenue to other objectives, the decisions are outside the ambit of \u201cmatters relating to employment conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The briefs fail to give precise outline to the clause of section 13085 requiring negotiations \u201cwith regard to procedures relating to . . . the instructional program.\u201d The failure is understandable, for the clause is murky and mystifying. Only one aspect of the matter has clarity\u2014in deleting \u201call matters\u201d at that point of the statute and substituting ^procedures\u201d as the area for compulsory negotiation, the 1970 Legislature distinctly expressed a desire to narrow that area. When the school board decides to spend money for musical instruments or a bus, the decision involves neither \u201cemployment conditions\u201d nor \u201cprocedures relating to ... the instructional program.\u201d I dissent from the majority view that section 13085 requires compulsory negotiations with teacher organizations in the general area of budget management.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The petitions of all the parties for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied March 12. 1975. Richardson, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
