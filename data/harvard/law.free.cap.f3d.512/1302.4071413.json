After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-16\">Grife owns a unit at the Admiral\u2019s Port Condominiums in North Miami Beach, Florida. Grife has a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy for his condominium unit (his \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d) with Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-17\">In October 2005, the Admiral\u2019s Port Condominiums sustained damages to its common property during Hurricane Wilma. The Admiral\u2019s Port Condominium Association (\u201cCondominium Association\u201d) has a separate master policy that insures the common property, but carries a substantial deductible. Under the Condominium Association\u2019s master policy, $719,080 of the Hurricane Wilma damage to the common property fell within the deductible. The Condominium Association levied special assessments against the individual unit owners to cover the damages not paid because of the substantial deductible. Grife\u2019s personal assessment was $1,226.56.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-18\">After the assessment, Grife filed a claim for the Condominium Association\u2019s $1,226.56 assessment under his personal owner\u2019s policy. Pursuant to his owner\u2019s policy, Allstate agreed to \u201cpay [Grife\u2019s] share of any special assessments charged against the condominium owners by the association\u201d as a result of loss to the condominium\u2019s collectively owned property. This provision, entitled \u201cLoss Assessments,\u201d also contains the following exclusion: \u201cAny reduction or elimination of payments for losses because of any deductible applying to the insurance coverage of the association of building owners collectively is not covered under this protection.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>district court referred to this exclusion in Grife\u2019s owner\u2019s policy as the \u201cMaster Deductible\u201d clause. Allstate denied Grife\u2019s claim, contending that an assessment resulting from the deductible in the Condominium Association\u2019s policy was excluded from loss assessment coverage by the \u201cMaster Deductible\u201d clause in Grife\u2019s personal owner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">Grife filed this action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, alleging that Allstate breached his personal owner\u2019s policy and seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court granted Allstate\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). <em>Grife v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>493 F.Supp.2d 1249 (S.D.Fla.2007). The district court concluded that the plain language of the \u201cMaster Deductible\u201d clause in Grife\u2019s personal owner\u2019s policy excluded from coverage any loss assessment due to the master policy\u2019s deductible. <em>Id. </em>at 1253-54. Alternatively, the district court agreed with Allstate\u2019s argument that another clause in the loss assessment provision, the excess coverage clause, also barred coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 1254-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">After review and for the reasons stated by the district court in Section I of its well-reasoned published decision, <em>id. </em>at 1253-54, we conclude that the plain language of the \u201cMaster Deductible\u201d clause in Grife\u2019s owner\u2019s policy excludes coverage for any assessment due to losses that fell within the Condominium Association\u2019s master policy deductible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we agree with the district court that this \u201cconclusion that Plaintiffs claim is excluded due to the Master Deductible provision alone, renders a decision on the remaining Policy language at issue unnecessary,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1254, we decline to address the district court\u2019s discussion of the effect of the excess coverage clause, which is dicta, in Section II of its published decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's grant of judgment on the pleadings. <em>Hardy v.
