Writ in the Second District Court of Bristol dated May 3,1905;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-11\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was submitted to Holmes, J. upon an agreed statement of facts in substance as. follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-12\">This was an action on a poor debtor\u2019s recognizance entered into in the Second District Court of Bristol on the thirty-first day of March, 1905, by Max L. Lizotte as principal and the defendant as surety. The declaration was in the form prescribed by statute, and the answer admitted the giving of the recognizance but denied every other material allegation in the declaration, and further alleged that the defendant on the eighteenth day of April, 1905, surrendered his principal in open court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-13\">All the proceedings in the district court before April 18, 1905, were in regular form, and a copy of the record of the proceedings in that court on that day and subsequent thereto and a memorandum of the recognizance declared on were annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACI\">The record showed that on March 31, 1905, Max L. Lizotte <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and Ovide Ouellette, the defendant, both of Fall River, appeared before that court, and severally acknowledged themselves to be indebted to the plaintiff, Lizotte as principal in the sum of $300, and the defendant as surety in the same sum, a copy of the recognizance being set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">The record further showed the following proceedings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">On April 18, 1905, the debtor being surrendered by Ovide Ouellette surety, and the debtor offering J. C. Emery Panneton as surety in place of Ouellette, the debtor gave recognizance with Panneton as surety, conditioned to deliver himself up for examination within thirty days of March 31, 1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-7\">On June 9,1905, the judgment creditor suggested a diminution of the record relating to the surrender of the debtor, \u201c in that it does not show whether an officer qualified to serve legal process was present in court when such surrender was made or attempted, and whether the principal therein was committed to any such officer in attendance,\u201d and prayed the court to amend the record in these particulars, so that these facts should appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-8\">The judge of the district court thereupon amended the record to read as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-9\">\u201c April 18,1905. Then appeared before the court the debtor Lizotte, Ovide Ouellette his surety in his recognizance of March 31, 1905, and J. C. Emery Panneton. Said Ouellette stated that he wished to surrender said Lizotte and said Lizotte stated that he wished to submit to be surrendered and to be surrendered and to recognize anew with said J. C. Emery Panneton as surety ; said Panneton stated that he wished to become surety in place of said Ouellette on said Lizotte\u2019s new recognizance. Whereupon having examined said Panneton and found him sufficient as a surety the court said that it would allow said Lizotte to recognize anew with said Panneton as surety. The court then purported to discharge said Ovide Ouellette as surety upon his recognizance of March 31, 1905, and to allow said Lizotte to recognize anew with said Panneton as surety; a memorandum of the second recognizance with Panneton as surety is among the papers in this case and is made a part of this record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-10\">\u201c There was no officer qualified to serve legal process in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>case present.

There are two grounds of defence, first, that there was a surrender of the principal by the defendant, and second, that there has been no breach of the recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-16\">1. As to the surrender. It is provided in R L. c. 168, \u00a7 65, that a surety on a poor debtor\u2019s recognizance may at any time surrender his principal and exonerate himself from further lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>bility in the manner provided for the surrender of bail, \u201c and all the proceedings on such surrender shall be the same as provided in the case of bail.\u201d The proceedings on the surrender by bail in the inferior courts, so far as material to this case, are set forth in R. L. c. 169, \u00a7 19. This section provides that when bail surrender their principal in court, either during the pendency of the original action or of <em>scire facias, </em>they shall secure the attendance of an officer qualified to serve legal process in the case, to whom the principal may be committed. The reason for this is obvious. It is an important provision for the benefit and security of the creditor. The agreed facts show that no such officer was present at the time of the attempted surrender in this case, and it is not shown that the creditor has waived his rights. See <em>Pacific Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Canterbury, </em>104 Mass. 438. It follows that the attempted surrender was inoperative, and that the liability of the defendant as surety still continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">2. As to the breach. Even if it be said that the principal debtor did \u201c within thirty days from the date of his arrest deliver himself up for examination before some court of record,\u201d it is certain that he never gave any notice thereof to the judgment creditor. It is no excuse that the court refused to issue the notice. For aught that appears the court refused to issue the notice for the reason that it could not be served in time. But, however that may be, the debtor takes upon himself the risk of proper notice being given to the creditor. See <em>Thacher </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>14 Gray, 324; <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>117 Mass. 1, and cases cited; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>177 Mass. 206. No notice having been given, the discharge of the debtor was beyond the power of the court. See <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Kershaw, </em>180 Mass. 99, 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
