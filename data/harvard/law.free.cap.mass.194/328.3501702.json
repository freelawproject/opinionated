Wallace, as her next friend, to recover damages for the loss of the lower part of one of her legs which was injured by a car of the defendant. The plaintiff appeared by Henry C. Long, Esquire, an attorney at law, whose appearance is recorded upon the docket record above given. The defendant .did not regard itself as liable in the action and never had made any attempt to settle the case or made any offer of settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-15\">On December 21, 1903, the father went to the office of the defendant and requested the attorney of the defendant to settle the case with him, saying that he wanted to buy his girl a cork leg, which would amount to $175, for a Christmas present, and wanted the defendant to settle for that sum. The attorney for the defendant told him that the plaintiff had counsel and he, the defendant\u2019s attorney, would not talk with him, the father. The father said he was going to discharge the counsel. The attorney again told him to go and see his counsel, but on the father\u2019s insisting upon talking about the case the attorney for the defendant called up on the telephone the counsel for the plaintiff and told him that the father was there and wanted to settle the case and that he, the defendant\u2019s attorney, had refused to settle the case with him and had told him to go to his counsel, and that the father had said he was going to discharge the counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>arid that the father had said lie would not have Long for counsel anyway. The judge found that this was tantamount to a discharge of the attorney Long.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-3\">The attorney for the defendant said to the'plaintiff\u2019s attorney that the plaintiff had no case, but that the injury was so great that the defendant would be willing to pay enough to purchase the child a cork leg. Mr. Long said, \u201c Well, go ahead and settle with him but save me out my bill of $150.\u201d The attorney for the defendant said he would not pay so much, that that was more than the case was worth and that it was a case where the road was not at fault. The attorney for the defendant told Mr. Long he was going to pay the plaintiff $175 in settlement of the action, and would pay the plaintiff\u2019s attorney his bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-4\">The attorney for the defendant paid the father $175 in settlement of the action and told him that he would pay the attorney\u2019s fees so that the sum would be clear for the plaintiff, and he paid the plaintiff\u2019s attorney $50 in settlement of his bill. Two releases were executed, one by the father as father and next friend of the child, and one by the father personally. The $175, except $2 of it, was paid by the father to the mother, the next friend in this petition. The appointment of -the father as next friend never was revoked. The appearance of the counsel for the plaintiff never was withdrawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">It was at the time of this settlement that the agreement printed above was signed by the father and by the witness to his signature. The agreement was filed by the defendant in the case, No. 6078, without any signature in behalf of the defendant. Thereupon, without any special order of the court, the clerk made the entry of judgment to be found in the above copy of the docket record under the date of 1903, December 31. See R. L. c. 177, \u00a7 1; Rule 23 of the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">The petitioner asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">2. Under the evidence and record in this case the plaintiff is entitled to have the entry dated December 31, 1903, stricken from the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">3. Inasmuch as the entry was unauthorized by special or general order of the court or by rule, no judgment has been given in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-9\">4. Inasmuch as the agreement was not signed by the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ant the case was not ripe for judgment within the meaning of the rule and therefore the entry was unauthorized and should he stricken off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-3\">5. The agreement having been signed by the next friend only and not by the counsel of record in the case, it was made without sufficient authority to render the case ripe for judgment and therefore the entry should be stricken off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-4\">6. As a result of the evidence it appears that the agreement was not such a one as in equity and good conscience ought to bind the plaintiff. The court, therefore, will not sustain it and the entry based upon it should be stricken off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">7. A minor party to a suit in court is represented in court by his attorney of record, and no judgment by consent should be entered against such a party without the consent of his attorney of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-6\">8. The written agreement not being signed by the defendant or its attorney remains an agreement made by the next friend <em>in pais </em>and is therefore not binding upon the plaintiff under the decision of <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>Gfifford, </em>155 Mass. 108.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-7\">9. Upon all the evidence in this case the petitioner is entitled to have the record amended according to the prayer in the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-8\">10. Upon the evidence in this case the court legally in the exercise of its discretion may amend the record according to the prayer of the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings. He gave as the ground for refusing to make the rulings numbered 2 and 3, that they were not in accordance with the facts, and as the ground for refusing to make the ruling numbered 10, that it was not applicable to the facts found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-10\">The judge found that the allegation that the father at the time he signed the agreement and received the money was intoxicated and mentally incapable was untrue, found that the settlement was such a one as the court would have approved had the matter been brought to the court\u2019s attention at the time of the filing of the agreement, and ruled that the court had the power to grant the relief prayed for (against the defendant\u2019s contention and objection), but also ruled that there had been a valid settlement of the case, and for that reason dismissed the petition. The petitioner alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>A. L. Richards, </em>(T. <em>Eaton </em>with him,) for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-3\"><em>J. T. Hughes, </em>for the respondent, was not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b352-4\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amx\">At the hearing the judge found that the allegation that the father, who was the next friend, was intoxicated and mentally incapable at the time he signed the agreement, was untrue. No fraud or collusion was alleged. The powers and duties of a next friend in a case like this were considered in <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>155 Mass. 108. In that case the following language is used by Barker, J.: \u201c We see no reason why the next friend should not have authority to institute or to entertain negotiations for a settlement of the controversy. His position with reference to it is like that of a general guardian, or the guardian <em>ad litem </em>of an infant defendant. It is to be expected that he will act fairly and intelligently for the real interest of the plaintiff; but it cannot be said that every suit brought in the name of the infant is upon a good cause of action, or that, if well brought, the just amount of the recovery cannot be arrived at without a trial. . . . The next friend is intrusted with the rights of the infant so far as they are involved in the cause, and acts under responsibility both to the court and the plaintiff. It may well be considered to be within his qfficial duty to negotiate, if possible, a fair adjustment, without subjecting the plaintiff to the expense and risk of a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u201c When, however, he assumes' finally to conclude a settlement out of court, and to discharge the cause of action by\" an agreement <em>in pais, </em>under which he accepts less than the plaintiff\u2019s entire demand, he does more than is clearly within his authority to prosecute the action, and more than we think ought to be allowed with due regard to the protection of the infant. Unless such a settlement is affirmed, either in terms if brought to the attention of the court, or by an entry of judgment in regular course, it may fairly be held invalid. If it is not of such a nature as to commend itself to counsel, to whom, as well as to the next friend, the infant has a right to look for protection, it ought not to stand unless sanctioned by the court. It is \u2022 no injustice to a defendant to hold that the infant is not concluded until the cause is disposed of by judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In the case before us the judge found that certain acts of the next friend were tantamount to his discharge of the counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>whose name was upon the record as counsel for the plaintiff. Whether that be so or not, it does not appear that the counsel objected to the settlement, but on the contrary he seems to have been content with it. The agreement of settlement was signed by the next friend, and then was filed in court by the counsel for the defendant, who neglected to sign it. Thereupon, without any special order of the court, the clerk entered up judgment on December 31, 1903, the next day for entering up judgment under the statute (R. L. c. 177, \u00a7 1) in cases ripe for judgment being the first Monday in January,1904. See Rule 23 of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">It is urged by the plaintiff that, the agreement not being signed by the counsel for the defendant, the judgment was for that reason invalid. But we do not think that position tenable. By filing the agreement the defendant indicated its assent and desire to have it ratified by the judgment of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The judge before whom this petition was tried has found that the settlement was such a one as the court would have approved had the matter been brought to the court\u2019s attention at the time of filing the agreement. Here then is a reasonable settlement fairly made, and both the next friend and the defendant desire to reduce the same to judgment; and a paper containing an agreement for judgment is filed in court. Under these circumstances we think that after the agreement for judgment was filed the case was ripe for judgment under R. L. c. 177, \u00a7 1, and that therefore in law it went to judgment at any rate on January 4, 1904, under that statute. And that is so even if the clerk failed to note the fact on the docket. <em>Pierce </em>v. Lamper, 141 Mass. 20. It is immaterial that the clerk made an unauthorized entry of judgment at an earlier date. Under these circumstances the settlement was in law valid, the ruling of the judge to that effect was correct, and the petition was rightly dismissed for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We see no error in the manner in which the judge dealt with the petitioner\u2019s requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled ; decree dismissing petition affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
