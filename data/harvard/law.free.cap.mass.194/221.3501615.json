At the time of the accident, the plaintiff, who was fifty-two years of age, had been working at the shoe business for twenty years, and for about two or three years had worked on a machine similar to the one on which he was working when injured. He was shaving a heel by pressing it against the revolving knife on the machine when a hard piece of \u201c veneering \u201d threw off the heel from the knives on the machine and caused the plaintiff to cut his thumb. The plaintiff\u2019s description of the accident is quoted in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>J.

The only description given in the bill of exceptions is included in the following testimony of the plaintiff : \u201c There were two knives for shaving the main part of said heel and two more knives' known as rand cutters which are on a spring for cutting a part of said heel near the upper of the shoe, and that the shoe came to him with the sole and heel on it just as the sole was sewed and the heel nailed on the machine; that the sole and shank were also on the shoe when he got it, and for the purpose of raising the shank it was necessary for the defendant to put in a small piece of leather between the shank of the shoe and the upper, on both sides of the shoe, and this small piece was fastened to the shoe and extended the full length of the shank and it came back to the front edge of the heel, and the shoes with the upper sole shank and heel were furnished to him by the defendant.\u201d Three or four days before the accident the plaintiff complained to the foreman of the room in which he worked that the veneering put in between the sole and the upper was not made of proper stock; that it was larger and longer than usual and extended back \u201c about an inch over the front of the heel and interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s shaving the heel.\u201d The foreman explained that the reason for this veneering having been used was that the defendant being out of regular stock had borrowed this from a neighbor, and stated that as soon as he had run off the shoes on which the borrowed stock had been used \u201c the shoes would come all right.\u201d The plaintiff further testified that in three or four hours he ran off the borrowed stock \u201c and then the shoes came all right.\u201d He also testified that <em>\u201c </em>about two or three days from the time he complained he struck a shoe which seemed harder, and there was a piece of large, hard veneering in the shank of the shoe that extended back beyond the front of the heel, and as soon as it came in contact with the knives the large, hard piece of veneering threw off the heel from the moulding knives on said machine, and caused the plaintiff to cut his thumb; that the leather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>on the shoe he got hurt on was harder; that usually, the day before, the leather is put in water and tempered more or less; that some, of course, absorb more water, some less, and some the water won\u2019t affect at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The plaintiff was an experienced workman and had been working on a machine similar to the one in question for two or three years; and he testified that he did not need \u201c any instructions.\u201d It was admitted that the light in the room in question was good.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">On this evidence the presiding judge directed a verdict for the defendant, and the case is here on an exception to that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">All that the plaintiff complains of is that the veneering in the shoe in question was harder than usual. The plaintiff himself testified that the veneering was more or less hard as it absorbed more or less water when \u201c tempered \u201d \u201c the day before,\u201d and that some veneering \u201c the water won\u2019t affect at all.\u201d The risk coming from the veneering\u2019s being more or less hard was an obvious one, incident to the employment which the plaintiff undertook. The defendant\u2019s duty to the plaintiff was not increased by the conversation had a few days before between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s foreman if (which is by no means clear) the veneering in question was not what the foreman assured the plaintiff he might expect in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
