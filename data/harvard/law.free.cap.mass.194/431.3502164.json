The distance that the pole slipped was only <em>\u201c </em>a couple of feet at the bottom.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was an experienced carpenter and an active, intelligent and careful workman. <em>Held, </em>that, even if the plaintiff\u2019s intestate did not assume the risk of such an accident, there was no evidence that the accident was due to any negligence on the part of the superintendent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b451-11\">The exclusion of a competent question gives no ground for exception if the fact sought to be established by the answer to the question sufficiently appears and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>this court holds that the evidence warranted a finding for the excepting party-on the issue to which the fact pertained.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b452-3\">In an action against a building contractor for causing the death of the plaintiffs intestate while in the defendant\u2019s employ by his being pushed from the third floor of a building in process of construction by the slipping of the foot of a gin pole or derrick which he was adjusting under the direction of a superintendent, if there is nothing to show that the superintendent did not have all the ropes necessary to move the gin pole, general questions by the plaintiff relating to the supply of ropes for hoisting purposes properly may be excluded.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b452-4\">A violation of R.

It had as foreman a man named McNeil. McNeil directed one Scott, who was a carpenter, to move a gin pole or derrick from a building which they had finished to the third floor of another building. The gin pole was a stick of timber twenty-two to twenty-five feet long, four by six inches, and was to be used as a derrick for the purpose of hoisting up the floor beams. It had two guys on the back and one or two on the front to hold it in place, and a fall to be used for hoisting, and weighed all together between three and four hundred pounds. There were six or seven men, of whom the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was one, in the gang for moving the pole. 'After giving the direction McNeil went away and Scott proceeded to move the pole, and had got it on to the third floor and substantially into position, and, with the assistance of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, was in the act of moving the foot a little, when the foot slipped and pushed the plaintiff\u2019s intestate over and he fell one or two stories, receiving injuries which resulted in his death. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the judge directed a verdict for the defendant and the case is here on the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">We think that the jury would have been warranted in finding that Scott had charge of moving and putting up the pole, not as a workman, but as a superintendent or foreman in the absence of McNeil, with the authority or consent of the defendant.

But we do not see how it can be said that the accident was due to any negligence on his part. It is immaterial whether he was accustomed to move gin poles or not. The pole had been moved to the third floor without accident and was substantially, as we understand the evidence, in the position in which it was required to be. What happened was this : The foot of the pole rested on some planks which had been placed across the floor beams a short time before, \u201c probably,\u201d as the testimony tended to show, \u201c by Farrell himself and the others,\u201d and the top rested against a roof timber. The fall had been taken off and fastened to a roof timber to hoist the pole up with and- had to be fastened on to the top of the pole again. It was necessary to slide out the foot of the pole a little to do this. Scott and Farrell were trying to do that, and Scott directed Farrell \u201c to steady it, steady the bottom of it so it wouldn\u2019t slide,\u201d and when Farrell started to \u201c move the bottom out \u201d as thus directed the pole \u201c simply slipped and pushed him out, pushed him over.\u201d The distance that the pole slipped was short, \u201c only ... a couple of feet at the bottom.\u201d On this statement we do not see how, as already observed, Scott could be said to be at fault for what occurred, or how expert testimony would have helped to throw any light on the question whether he was negligent in undertaking to move the foot of the gin pole as he did. Moreover the intestate was forty-two years old and had always worked at his trade as a carpenter and was, as the testimony tended to show, \u201can active, intelligent man and a careful workman.\u201d The situation was as obvious and the danger, if any, of attempting to slide the foot of the gin pole along was as apparent to him, to say the least, as to Scott, and it may well be doubted whether he did not impliedly consent to the assumption of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">No harm was done by the exclusion of the questions to the witness McNeil though they might properly have been admitted.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It sufficiently appeared at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>evidence what Scott\u2019s duties were in connection with the moving of the gin pole, and from whom the men in the gang took and were to take their orders, and, as already observed, the evidence warranted a finding that Scott was acting as foreman with the defendant\u2019s consent in the absence of McNeil.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b454-9\"><em>A. </em>Lincoln, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b454-10\"><em>W.

L. c. 104, \u00a7 44,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> constituted a violation of law and contributed to render the conditions under which the plaintiff\u2019s intestate worked upon the building more hazardous, it was not a cause contributing to the accident but a condition of it and therefore did not render the defendant liable. <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Boston Protective </em>Department, 146 Mass. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The result is that the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-6\"> McNeil was called by the plaintiff, and the questions excluded were <em>\u201c </em>What were Mr. Scott\u2019s duties in connection with this work which you told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>him to do ? \u201d and From whom would the men in this gang, who were working on this work of getting up the pole, in the usual course of such work take their orders ? \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-12\"> It appeared that the building was a steel frame building, three stories high, that the roof had been at least partially constructed, the roof timbers being laid, and that the carpenters on the day of the accident were engaged in putting in the floor timbers, none of the floors having been laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">The plaintiff contended that the fact that the defendant acted in violation of law in failing to place and maintain a close plank flooring on the first and second floors before adding the third story to the building as required by R. L. c. 104, \u00a7 44, was evidence of negligence which contributed to the injuries sustained by Farrell and should have been submitted to the jury, that the object of the statute is to prevent a workman from falling through floors, and, that it was for the jury to say how much the injuries and subsequent death of Farrell were caused or affected by his falling through the second floor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
