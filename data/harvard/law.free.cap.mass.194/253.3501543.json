Both were payable to A. Blum Jr.\u2019s Sons, and both were indorsed \u201cMontrose K. Newman for A.

Whipple &amp; Co.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">The answer contained a general denial, and alleged ratification of the indorsements of Newman by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was submitted to <em>Fox, </em>J., without a jury, upon an agreed statement of facts. The plaintiff relied solely upon its counts in tort for the conversion of the checks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-8\">The agreed facts were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-9\">The plaintiff was a corporation doing business in the city of New York as a wholesale dealer in wines and liquors, and the defendants were the proprietors and managers of a hotel in Boston known as the Parker House. The plaintiff employed as a travelling salesman one Montrose K. Newman. While in Boston, between January 25, 1901, and May 4, 1901, Newman transmitted several orders from Boston to New York, among which were some bogus orders. He also collected during this period cash and checks from the customers from whom he had received the orders, and never transmitted either the cash or the checks to the plaintiff. Knowledge of these transactions first came to the plaintiff in May, 1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>In April, 1901, the Locke-Ober Company, doing business in Boston, was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $82.92, and Newman called upon this debtor and received, in satisfaction of the claim, a check for that amount payable to the order of the plaintiff. Newman requested the defendants to cash this check and indorsed it, \u201c Montrose K. Newman for A. Blum Jr.\u2019s Sons,\u201d and thereupon the defendants paid to Newman the face amount of the check, after deducting such sum as was due to the defendants from Newman for board and lodging. The defendants deposited the check to their own credit in the Metropolitan National Bank, and the check was paid by the bank upon which it was drawn. Newman had no authority to indorse the plaintiff\u2019s name to any checks or other instruments. Some time in the latter part of May, 1901, the plaintiff first was advised of the fact of the delivery of this check to Newman and of the manner in which it was cashed by the defendants. The plaintiff immediately consulted the district attorney for the county of Suffolk. It was agreed, if competent, that an indictment was returned by the grand jury for that county, at its next sitting, against Newman, on a charge arising out of this and like transactions, and that Newman was never apprehended and never has been located since that time, except that there was a rumor that he was in the Philippine Islands. No notice of the want of authority on the part of Newman to indorse this check was given by the plaintiff to the defendants until on or about October 15, 1903, at which time the check was placed in the hands of counsel for collection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">In April, 1901, one M. C. Page of Boston was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $50, and Newman obtained in payment of the claim a check for that amount payable to the order of the plaintiff. Newman indorsed this check in the same form as above stated, and received the money thereon from the defendants, and the defendants deposited the check to their credit in the Metropolitan National Bank, and it was paid by the bank upon which it was drawn. Newman had no authority to indorse the plaintiff\u2019s name to any checks or other instruments. Some time in the latter part of June, 1901, the plaintiff first was advised of the fact of the delivery of this check to Newman and of the manner in which it was cashed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>defendants. The plaintiff immediately consulted the district attorney for the county of Suffolk. It is agreed, if competent, that an indictment was returned by the grand jury for that county at its next sitting, against Newman, on a charge arising out of this and like transactions as stated above. No notice of the want of authority on the part of said Newman to indorse this check was given by the plaintiff to the defendants until on or about October 15, 1903, at which time the check was placed in the hands of counsel for collection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">The plaintiff never has received payment of these checks from any one. No demand ever has been made upon or action brought against either bank by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">The defendants asked the judge to rule as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">1. That upon the agreed statement of facts the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">2. That it is admitted by the agreed statement of facts that Newman was the plaintiff\u2019s agent, and was rightfully in possession of the checks in question, and that the defendants cashed these checks upon the indorsement of Newman as the plaintiff\u2019s agent on or about April 26 and 29,1901; that the plaintiff discovered that the checks had been indorsed by its agent in May and June, 1901, and that the plaintiff did not notify the defendants with reference to the indorsements until October 15, 1903. In view of these facts it is clear that the plaintiff was guilty of loches and cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-9\">3. That. the plaintiff\u2019s silence for more than two years and three months warrants the court in finding that the plaintiff ratified the acts of its agent, and therefore the plaintiff cannot recover in any form of action against these defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-10\">The judge refused to make any of the rulings requested, and found for the plaintiff in the full amount of the checks with interest. The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-11\"><em>J. </em>Gordon, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-12\"><em>A. K. </em>Cohen, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b276-13\">Sheldon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMT\">As Newman was employed by the plaintiff corporation merely as a travelling salesman, with no authority to indorse the plaintiff\u2019s name upon any checks or other instruments, and as he never was held out by the plaintiff as having any such authority, there is no doubt of the plaintiff\u2019s right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>recovery in this action unless it has lost this right by its long silence after its discovery of Newman\u2019s wrongful acts. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Chemical National Bank, </em>86 N. Y. 404. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Second National Bank, </em>6 Vroom, 400. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>United States Savings Institution, </em>46 Mo. 186. He was only a special agent of the plaintiff, with limited authority; and the defendants before taking the checks upon his indorsement were bound to inquire and ascertain the nature and extent of his authority. <em>Lovett, Hart &amp; Phipps Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>189 Mass. 535, 536, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">But the defendants contend that the plaintiff, having allowed more than two years to elapse after learning of Newman\u2019s wrongful acts and before it gave any notice to the defendants or made any claim upon them, was guilty of loches and now must be taken to have ratified the acts of its agent Newman. They quote the language of Colt, J. in <em>Harrod </em>v. <em>McDaniels, </em>126 Mass. 413, 415: \u201cIt is a rule in the law of agency, that when the unauthorized act of the agent is done in the execution of a power conferred, in a mode not sanctioned by its terms, and in excess or misuse of the authority given, ratification by the principal is more readily implied from slight acts of confirmation. The duty to disaffirm at once, on knowledge of the act, is said to be more imperative in such cases, because the confidence of the principal in the fitness and fidelity of the person he has selected as an agent is shown by the relations already established between them.\u201d But in that case there was evidence of ratification by the affirmative acts of the defendant. Nor were Newman\u2019s acts, as in some other cases cited by the defendants, done in the execution of a power conferred by the plaintiff, though in a mode not sanctioned by its terms, or merely in excess of the strict limitations put upon his authority. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Rockwell, </em>104 Mass. 167. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>172 Mass. 559, 567. Nor did the plaintiff receive any benefit from Newman\u2019s acts, as in <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>1 Gray, 139, nor was there any legal duty incumbent upon the plaintiff to give prompt notice of the facts and of its claims to the <em>defendants; </em>its delay could be nothing more than one of the circumstances to be weighed against it. <em>Grreenfield Bank </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>2 Allen, 269. <em>Canal Bank </em>v. <em>Bank of Albany, </em>1 Hill, 287. It could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>been ruled as matter of law that the plaintiff had ratified Newman\u2019s acts in indorsing the checks to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\">Nor was the plaintiff guilty of such negligence or loches as to take away its right of recovery. This question was considered under somewhat similar circumstances in the recent case of <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Metropolitan National Bank, </em>191 Mass. 159, 164, 165. Here, as in that case, it did not appear that any loss was caused to the defendants or that their position was in any way changed by the failure of the plaintiff to notify them earlier than it did. <em>Hamlin </em>v. Sears, 82 N. Y. 327. Indeed, it affirmatively appears that the plaintiff, as soon as it learned of these transactions, instituted criminal proceedings against Newman, but that he has never since been located, except that it was rumored that he was in the Philippine Islands ; and these facts are competent to show that the defendants have not been injured by the plaintiff\u2019s failure to give them any earlier notice. And see the cases cited in <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Metropolitan National Bank, </em>191 Mass. 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The rule adopted in that case as between a bank and one of its depositors applies <em>a fortiori </em>in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">It follows that the instructions requested by the defendants were rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
