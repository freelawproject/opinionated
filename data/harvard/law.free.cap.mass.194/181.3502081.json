Negligence.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b201-8\">By an express provision of R. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 267, a railroad corporation is not liable for causing the death of a person while walking or being upon its road contrary to law or to the reasonable rules and regulations of the corporation. Even without such an express provision, there could be no liability to such a trespasser unless there was wilful or reckless misconduct on the part of the railroad corporation or its servants.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-9\">Tort under R. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 267,268, for causing the death of Alice Durbin, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, while she was travelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>along Oak Street in Needham where the tracks of the defendant cross Oak Street at grade. Writ dated May 10,1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">At the trial before <em>Wait, </em>J. it appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate when struck by the train and killed was not upon Oak Street but was walking down the defendant\u2019s track. The judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-5\"><em>F. F. Sullivan, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-6\"><em>J. L. Hall, </em>for the defendant, was not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b202-7\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af0\">Upon the undisputed evidence the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had turned from the side of the highway where it crossed the railroad track, and having passed within the defendant\u2019s location was walking in the middle of the roadbed, when she was struck and instantly killed by a passing train. At common law, not having survived the injury, no action could be maintained, and the plaintiff relies on the provisions of R. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 267, 268. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Thomson-Houston Electric Co. </em>188 Mass. 371, 376. But as the decedent\u2019s life was not lost by a collision with the defendant\u2019s engine or cars at a grade crossing the remedy given by \u00a7 268 is inapplicable, and it is expressly provided by \u00a7 267, that if at the time of death the person killed is walking on its road contrary to law the corporation shall not be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Even without such a statutory provision, the decedent being a trespasser, the plaintiff could not recover unless wilful or reckless misconduct on the part of the defendant\u2019s engineer was shown, and of this there is no evidence. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>125 Mass. 75. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Boston Albany Railroad, </em>142 Mass. 296. <em>McCreary </em>v. <em>Boston Maine Railroad, </em>153 Mass. 300, 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">It consequently becomes unnecessary to consider the other questions argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
