Cushman <em>v. </em>Jennie E. Cushman, dated February 8,1904, alleging desertion on or about January 3,1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-11\">In the Superior Court the cases were heard by Aiken, C. J. He found that Lewis N. Cushman committed adultery at Hubbardston on June 15, 1904, with the person named in his wife\u2019s libel, and by reason of that misconduct ordered that his libel be dismissed. Upon the wife\u2019s libel, after stating the facts, the Chief Justice concluded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-12\">\u201c While I do not find her conduct amounted to desertion, I do find that there was on her part such unmindfulness of marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>obligations as to preclude the granting of her libel and I order the same dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">To this order the libellant alleged exceptions, raising only the question whether on the facts found the libel as matter of law could be dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-6\"><em>S. J. Elder, (F. E. Bradbury </em>with him,) for the libellant Jennie E. Cushman.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-7\"><em>E. R. </em>Anderson, for the libellee Lewis N. Cushman, submitted his case to the court without argument and without a brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b59-8\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aea\">To a libel of the wife for divorce on the ground of adultery the husband filed an answer denying the adultery and setting up by way of recrimination previous desertion on the part of the wife. At the trial the judge found that the husband was guilty of the adultery. But as to the charge of desertion he did not find that the wife\u2019s conduct amounted to desertion, although he did find \u201c that there, was on her part such unmindfulness of marital obligations as to preclude the granting of her libel,\u201d and ordered it to be dismissed. In other words, the wife\u2019s charge of adultery was sustained but the husband\u2019s charge of desertion was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">However it may be elsewhere, the rule in this Commonwealth is that while the offence set up in recrimination need not be of the same nature as the one relied upon in the libel, yet it must be such as in law would be of itself sufficient ground for divorce. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>4 Allen, 39. <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>97 Mass. 531. <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>160 Mass. 464. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>172 Mass. 82, and cases there cited. If upon the evidence the judge had found desertion, the dismissal of the libel would have been correct ; but he did not find it, and there is nothing in the facts found by him as to the conduct of the wife which estopped her from a divorce on the ground of the husband\u2019s adultery. This case does not belong to the class of which <em>Lyster </em>v. <em>Lyster, </em>111 Mass. 327, is a type, where the libellee attempts to justify the charge alleged in the libel (in that case it was desertion) by showing misconduct on the part of the libellant which, although not sufficient in law to constitute a ground of divorce, may yet be sufficient in law to justify the act relied upon in the libel. <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Watts, ubi supra. </em>In the case before us a separate and distinct offence on the part of the libellee, having no relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the offence charged, is set up as a bar to the libel. In such a case, as has been before stated, the offence set up must be sufficient of itself to constitute a ground of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\n<em>\u00a1Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
