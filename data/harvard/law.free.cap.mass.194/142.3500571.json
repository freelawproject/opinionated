Annexed to the answer was a copy of another instrument in writing which the defendant alleged to be a part of the contract between the parties. A master found that the two instruments were delivered at the same time and together constituted the contract of option between the parties. The bill originally contained the following averment: \u201c The plaintiff is ready and willing and hereby offers to pay to the defendant said sum of S600 and to comply with any and all other terms of said agreement on its part to be performed.\u201d The plaintiff was allowed to amend by adding to this averment the words \u201cand any and all terms of the paper, a copy whereof is annexed to the defendant\u2019s answer, to such extent and in such manner as the court may require.\u201d The defendant objected that the contract, which was made up of the two papers, was not set forth in the bill fully and formally. <em>Held, </em>that, while it would have been more regular, in making the amendment, to include the contents of the additional paper with the formal statement of the other part of the contract, the reference to the paper annexed to the defendant\u2019s answer and the offer to perform the contract according to its terms should be treated as an embodiment of the contents of the paper in the contract set forth in the bill, and that the bill as amended contained a sufficient statement to protect the rights of the parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-3\">In a suit in equity by a street railway company to compel the specific performance of a contract to convey to the plaintiff a strip of land on the proposed location of its railway, where under the contract proved it was the duty of the defendant to prepare and deliver a deed and the plaintiff was to pay a sum of money and to do certain things upon the land which could not be done until it acquired title to it, and where there was no requirement in the contract that the performance of the plaintiff\u2019s agreements should be made conditions subsequent in the deed, the court in ordering a conveyance of the land were of opinion that the rights of the defendant could be secured properly by inserting in the deed agreements which would be binding on the grantee and its successors and assigns, instead of by inserting conditions, the breach of which at any time would work a forfeiture.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-4\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on September 14, 1904, to compel the specific performance of a contract to convey to the plaintiff a narrow strip of land in the town of Natick with an easement in adjoining land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">The plaintiff was allowed to amend its bill by adding the words quoted below.

Rose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-15\">The case was referred to S. K. Hamilton, Esquire, as master. His report contained the following findings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-16\">\u201c I find that the two papers, one dated April 26, 1904, and the other dated April 30,1904, were delivered at the same time and together constitute the option which the defendant gave the plaintiff, and which entitled the plaintiff to a proper warranty deed of the property described therein upon the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the conditions therein named, or in some form by which the rights of the defendant should be protected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-3\">\u201c I find that this option was accepted on the 25th day of July, A. D. 1904, and became operative as a contract at that time. The option further provided that a conveyance of said premises should be made within thirty days after such acceptance by warranty deed, with full covenants and dower release, if necessary, conveying a clear title free from all incumbrances whenever and wherever said corporation should tender the consideration named in said option after seven days\u2019 notice by it of the time and place for tender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-4\">\u201cI find that the plaintiff did not tender said consideration nor give the defendant any notice of the time and place for tender within the thirty days named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">\u201c I find that on the 29th day of August, A. D., 1904, the plaintiff tendered the defendant the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00), together with a deed for his signature. This the defendant declined to sign, it not being in accordance with the option. Thereafter, on August 29, 1904, the plaintiff notified the defendant that it would be ready to receive the conveyance of the land described in said option and to tender the consideration therefor at the registry of deeds in Cambridge, on Tuesday, September 6, 1904, at ten o\u2019clock A. M. The parties met in accordance with said appointment and the plaintiff again tendered to defendant the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and a deed similar to the one tendered August 29th. This tender was declined in writing at the time of the tender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">\u201c I find that it was the duty of the plaintiff to give the defendant seven days\u2019 notice of the time and place within the said thirty days when and where it would tender the defendant the consideration set forth in said option, and that it was the duty of the defendant to prepare and execute a deed in accordance with said option ready for delivery upon the proper tender. Neither did what was incumbent upon him. The defendant contends and asks me to find that time was of the essence of the contract. I do not consider it necessary in making my findings to determine that question, but I do find that both parties have so conducted themselves that they have waived the performance of the contract within the thirty days named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201c I find that the consideration named in the option was such that it could not be performed in full until the plaintiff had obtained at least a conditional title to the premises described in the option. I find that on the 6th day of September, A. D. 1904, at the registry of deeds in Cambridge, upon service of a notice therefor, the parties met and then and there the plaintiff tendered to the defendant such portion of the consideration as it was possible for it t,o tender at that time, to wit, five hundred dollars ($500.00), and that the defendant did not tender a deed such as was set out in the option, or one which would under the circumstances protect his interests. I find that the said five hundred (500) dollars was enclosed in an envelope and remained in the hands of the plaintiff corporation ready for payment until the beginning of this suit, when the same was deposited in the International Trust Company to the credit of the plaintiff corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-3\">\u201c I find that the plaintiff is entitled to have a conveyance of the premises described in the option in such form as the court may determine will protect the defendant\u2019s interests and secure the performance of the remainder of the consideration set forth in said option upon the payment to the defendant of five hundred (500) dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-4\">In the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>Lawton, </em>J. upon the master\u2019s report and the defendant\u2019s exceptions thereto. The judge made a final decree overruling the exceptions to the master\u2019s report and ordering a specific performance of the contract in the manner and upon the conditions set forth in the decree. The defendant appealed. The plaintiff also appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-5\"><em>W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A87\">The master has found that the two papers, one dated April 26, 1904, and signed by the defendant, and the other dated April 30, 1904, and signed by the plaintiff\u2019s agent, \u201c were delivered at the same time and together constitute the option which the defendant gave the plaintiff, and which entitled the plaintiff to a proper warranty deed of the property described therein upon the performance of the conditions therein named, or in some form by which the rights of the defendant should be protected.\u201d The option was accepted in writing on July 25, 1904, and became operative as a contract at that time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>There is no ground for the contention that it was void for want of mutuality, for it became enforceable by either party upon its acceptance within the time specified. <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>Hodgdon, </em>147 Mass. 304. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Boland, </em>166 Mass. 481. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>161 Mass. 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">In that part of the writing which fixed the time within which the option might be accepted, time was of the essence of the contract. In that part which stated a time after the acceptance within which the deed should be delivered, the contract is within the ordinary rule that time is'not of the essence of the contract, unless it is made material by express stipulation, or unless there are circumstances indicating that it was deemed important by the parties and was intended to be made the subject of a stipulation to be performed literally, or unless there is such a change of conditions after the time fixed for performance, that the enforcement of the contract would be inequitable. <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>97 Mass. 92, and cases cited. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>144 Mass. 100. <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Libby, </em>134 U. S. 68, 77. The defence founded on the failure of the plaintiff to tender performance and demand a deed until five days after the expiration of the thirty days from the acceptance of the option is not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The next objection of the defendant rests upon the contention that the plaintiff\u2019s offer of performance was not sufficient. By the terms of the contract, it was the duty of the defendant to prepare and deliver a deed. There is no dispute that the plaintiff repeatedly tendered the money, which was the substantial part of the consideration for the conveyance, and that the defendant never prepared or tendered a deed. The plaintiff tendered a deed, to be signed by the defendant, which did not contain a statement of all the things to be done by the plaintiff as a part of the consideration. As to most of these things, it is to be noticed that they could not be performed until after the land had been conveyed. The writing signed by the plaintiff\u2019s agent, which states these things, ends with the sentence, \u201c The above named specifications are hereby agreed to, on the condition that said Rose delivers to the Boston and Worcester Street Railway Company a proper warranty deed of land as described.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s formal notice, after the defendant\u2019s neglect to prepare a deed and the refusal to sign the deed prepared by the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>was that \u201c said company will be ready to receive the conveyance of the land described in said option and to tender the consideration therefor,\u201d at the time and place fixed. After this notice the defendant, at this time and place, neglected to prepare the deed and refused to carry out his contract, on grounds other than the failure of the plaintiff to include, in the deed prepared by it, all the agreements made by the plaintiff in the acceptance of the option. There is nothing to indicate that the plaintiff ever refused to perform these agreements when it should receive its title, without which they could not be performed. We are of opinion that, in view of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the master was right in his finding that there was a sufficient offer on the part of the plaintiff to enable it to maintain the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\">It is contended that the bill, as amended by including a statement of the plaintiff\u2019s readiness and willingness and offer to comply with all the terms of the paper prepared by the defendant\u2019s wife, and signed by its agent, as well as the terms of the other paper which formally constituted the option, is insufficient. The objection is that the contract, which was made up of two papers, was not given fully and formally in the stating part of the bill. The paper expressly referred to in the stating part of the bill was the principal part of the contract. The second paper, prepared by the defendant\u2019s wife, was informal, and it contained the most important of the things to be done by the plaintiff, stated in the other writing in different language, and it included certain others. While it would have been more regular, in making the amendment, to include the contents of the additional paper with the formal statement of the other part of the contract, we think the reference to the paper, a copy of which is annexed to the defendant\u2019s answer, and the offer to perform the contract according to its terms, should be treated as an embodiment of it in the contract on which the bill was brought, and as a sufficient statement to protect the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">According to the terms prescribed by the judge when the amendment was allowed, the plaintiff is to take no costs up to the date of the amendment, and it is to pay the defendant\u2019s costs to that date. The record does not enable us to determine whether there is any error in the decree as to the allowance of costs. The exceptions to the master\u2019s report were rightly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Inasmuch as the option states that the \u201c conveyance shall be made by a warranty deed with full covenants and dower release, if necessary, conveying a clear title free from all encumbrances,\u201d and inasmuch as there is no suggestion that the construction of the cement tank and the maintenance of it and of the pipes forever, and the construction and maintenance of the Page woven wire fence are to be secured by making them conditions subsequent in the deed, we are of opinion that the fights of the defendant in this particular can be properly secured by inserting agreements in the deed, to be binding on the grantee and its successors and assigns, instead of by conditions, the breach of which at any time would work a forfeiture. The decree should be modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\n<em>Decree for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
