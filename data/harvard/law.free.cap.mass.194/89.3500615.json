Writ dated January 26, 1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">In the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>Fox, </em>J., without a jury, upon an auditor\u2019s report and additional testimony. The controversy in the case was under the defendant\u2019s plea of payment. There was due to the plaintiff on the date of the writ for malt sold and delivered $30,190.85, unless certain notes of J. K. Souther and Sons given by the defendant were to be allowed as payment <em>pro tanto. </em>If these notes were allowed as payment <em>pro tanto, </em>there was due to the plaintiff the sum of $17,710.65, with interest thereon from November 27, 1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">The judge made the following findings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">\u201c The finding of the auditor to the effect that there was an oral agreement between J. K. Souther and Charles M. Warner that notes should be taken in payment was controlled by the testimony before me, and I find that there was no such agreement affecting the questions here in issue. I find, however, that there was a written agreement that the notes of Souther and Sons should be accepted in payment <em>pro tanto </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s open account with the defendant, and that this written agreement is established by the letter of June 27,1899, and the subsequent correspondence above set forth, read in the light of the situation of the parties as shown by tbe auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">\u201c It appears that Souther and Sons had carried on a brewery business for many years and, in 1898 incorporated the Souther Brewing Company, which took over their business. Warner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>one of the plaintiff\u2019s principal men and the head of the house which had been absorbed by the plaintiff corporation, had dealt with and given credit to Souther and Sons for years, and there is nothing essentially improbable .in the fact that the plaintiff regarded the credit of Souther and Sons as good as that of the corporation which they had organized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-3\">\u201cI am of the opinion that the letter of June 27th is to be deemed a request, not for leave to give additional security but for leave to give substituted security; that the word <em>6settle\u2019 </em>as used in this and later letters means 6 pay,\u2019 and that the concurrence of the plaintiff in this construction is shown by the fact that in one instance it returned the invoice duly receipted as paid and in another instance promised so to receipt them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-4\">\u201c Respecting the plaintiff\u2019s contention that it has a right to rescind the agreement on the ground of fraud I find as follows : In the letter of June 27bh there are some misstatements made by Souther with the knowledge of the facts. First, the new brewery did not cost more than $150,000; second, one bill for about $11,000 for construction had not been paid. When this letter was written Souther and Sons had given their note for this bill, but the corporation subsequently had to pay it. Third, the Souther Brewing Company was not taking all its malt from the plaintiff. Malt, although not to a very large amount, had been bought of other concerns.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">\u2022 \u201c These representations might be deemed material if there were any evidence that the plaintiff paid any attention to them. The plaintiff furnished no direct evidence that it relied on these statements. It contended throughout that the notes were not accepted in payment, and in support of this contention introduced evidence that the question of accepting these notes was not made even a matter of discussion among its officers and agents. I cannot infer from the facts before me that the plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations in accepting the notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">' \u201c It is further contended by the plaintiff that Souther committed a fraud in offering his own notes for the liability of the corporation, because of his insolvency at that time, even though he made no representations as to solvency. The auditor finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>in substance that Souther was in fact insolvent, although he believed that be was solvent, and no evidence was offered before me which controls the auditor\u2019s finding on this point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-4\">\u201cAll the facts material to the determination of the question whether the law of Massachusetts or the law of New York applies are stated by the auditor. Upon these facts I am of the opinion that the Massachusetts law applies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\"><em>\u201c </em>I find that the various agents of the corporation by whom the plaintiff\u2019s letters were signed and its invoices receipted were duly authorized.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">The letter of June 27,1899, referred to above and the reply to it were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-7\">\u201c C.

It has been settled law in this jurisdiction for more than a century, that where a debtor delivers to his creditor either his own or the negotiable promissory note of a third party for the whole, or a part of the indebtedness, a presumption arises that it was given and received in satisfaction of the debt, although this presumption may be controlled by evidence that by acceptance the creditor did not intend to extinguish the original claim. <em>Thacher </em>v. <em>Dinsmore, </em>5 Mass. 299, 302. <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>7 Mass. 286. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>9 Met. 322. <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>130 Mass. 485. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>131 Mass. 467. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>132 Mass. 536. <em>Ely </em>v. <em>James, </em>123 Mass. 36, 44. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>157 Mass. 584, 587. <em>Brewer Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Albany Railroad, </em>179 Mass. 228, 234. <em>Jeffrey </em>v. <em>Rosenfeld, </em>179 Mass. 506, 509. <em>Paddock &amp; Fowler Co. </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>186 Mass. 152, 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">But as this rule of evidence was not the law of the plaintiff\u2019s place of business where the notes were accepted, it is not applicable unless the contract was to be performed here. <em>Carnegie </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>2 Met. 381, 397. <em>Tarbox </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>165 Mass. 408, 411, and cases cited. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Pond, </em>13 Pet. 65. The auditor, upon whose findings the ruling as to the place of performance rests, not only reports that the malt was to be delivered at Boston <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> where the title passed and consequently the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>defendant\u2019s promise to pay arose, but the notes were made, and were payable here, though sent by mail to the plaintiff. When considered separately the place of the making and performance of the contract of sale were the same, while the notes became completed contracts only upon their acceptance in another State. But this fact is not decisive. The debt due for the malt was payable in this Commonwealth where the performance of this contract began, and the notes given which it is contended were to be applied in payment also were made payable here, and not elsewhere. <em>Liverpool &amp; Great Western Steam Co. </em>v. <em>Phenix Ins. Co. </em>129 U. S. 397. When accepted, the acceptance having been according to their tenor, it was ruled correctly that the contract was to be performed at the place selected by the parties. <em>Carnegie </em>v. Morrison, <em>ubi supra. Penobscot &amp; Kennebec Railroad </em>v. Bartlett, 12 Gray, 244, 248. <em>Shoe &amp; Leather National Bank </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>142 Mass. 563, 567. <em>Tarbox </em>v. <em>Childs, ubi supra. Andrews </em>v. <em>Pond, ubi supra.

C. 202. See <em>Nashua Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Sayles, </em>184 Mass. 520, 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">But while under the rulings this presumption must be included as forming a portion of the evidence upon which the finding of payment rests, the plaintiff contends that the entire testimony is insufficient to sustain the finding that there was a written agreement to receive the notes in payment, or that by their acceptance it intended to extinguish a part of the original debt. The inception of this agreement is contained in two letters, which are to be construed with later letters to ascertain whether any or all of the notes were given and accepted in partial liquidation, or as security. Before the organization of the corporation the plaintiff had dealt with the partnership to whose business the defendant had succeeded, and from the auditor\u2019s report of their commercial relations, and the letters which passed between them, it is evident that the plaintiff was desirous of retaining the corporation as a customer, and when the arrangement was proposed regarded the financial condition of either as unexceptionable. In less than a year after the contract for malt was entered into the indebtedness on account amounted to a large sum which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>had become overdue. The plaintiff insisted upon payment, and on June 27,1899, while acknowledging and regretting the delay, the defendant offered by letter the notes of the partnership \u201c to settle everything due to the present moment, if acceptable.\u201d To this letter on June 28, 1899, the plaintiff replied \u201c that we would be pleased to receive notes from you, with interest, for the overdue amounts . . . and if you wish would be pleased to accept your notes for everything shipped you so far, having same run on stipulated time of contract.\u201d The subsequent correspondence discloses a similar course of dealing as to accruing indebtedness, and when interpreted with reference to the precedent conditions, and of the further finding that at least in one instance the plaintiff returned an invoice receipted as paid, and\" promised that other invoices should be similarly receipted, these letters with those which followed properly were held to contain an unequivocal proposition to give, and agreement to accept, the notes of the firm in settlement of the open account then payable, and of any account that might become due for future deliveries. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>12 Gray, 251, 255. <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Hartigan, </em>139 Mass. 554. <em>Hebb </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>185 Mass. 335. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>162 Mass. 47. <em>Lynn Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>180 Mass. 527. <em>Callender, McAuslan &amp; Troup Co. </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>187 Mass. 104. <em>Buffington </em>v. <em>McNally, </em>192 Mass. 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\">If, however, the plaintiff was induced to accept the notes in partial payment by misrepresentations of the defendant acting through its treasurer, upon discovery of the fraud it had the right to rescind, and on rescission its original debt would have been fully restored. While there were material misstatements in the defendant\u2019s letter relating to the cost of the brewery, and payment for its construction, to avoid the contract of payment the plaintiff must prove not only an intent to defraud, but that it actually had been misled by the deceit. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Denison, </em>12 Met. 549. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>162 Mass. 260. <em>Hillyer </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>154 Mass. 502. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Tarplin, </em>183 Mass. 52, 56. Both questions were issues of fact, and the adverse findings that there was no purpose to mislead, as the defendant\u2019s*treasurer, who also was a member of the firm, believed at the time that the firm was solvent, and that the misrepresentations did not influence the plaintiff\u2019s conduct, are supported by the evidence. <em>Holbrook </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>v. <em>Burt, </em>22 Pick. 546. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Aspinwall, </em>114 Mass. 187. <em>Gilfillan </em>v. <em>Mawhinney, </em>149 Mass. 264, 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\">The remaining requests for rulings must be considered in connection with these special findings, which although adverse to the plaintiff are not shown to have been erroneous, and when thus considered those refused were irrelevant, and the rulings given were correct in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff on the finding.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\"> The contract signed by the parties required the delivery of the malt at the Boylston Street railroad station in Boston, freight to be paid by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
