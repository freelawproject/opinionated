On an exception to this ruling it was <em>held, </em>that, as the witness was not qualified to express an opinion upon the sanity of the alleged testator, the only question was whether an affirmative answer to the question was admissible to contradict the previous statements of the witness and thus weaken his credibility, and that the witness\u2019s alleged statement to the orderly properly might be interpreted as a statement concerning the mental .capacity of the alleged testator, which the jury erroneously might regard as affirmative evidence on that issue, and so properly could be excluded by the judge as not strictly in contradiction of the statements of the witness as. to simple physical acts of the alleged testator; <em>also, </em>that the judge properly might have excluded the evidence on the ground that the alleged statement was so vague and indefinite as not to have any tendency to contradict the witness.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-13\">Appeal from a. decree of the Probate Court for the county of Plymouth admitting to probate an instrument purporting to be the will of John Griffin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-14\">At the trial of the appeal before <em>Lathrop, </em>J. the following issues were submitted to the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>First.

Tileston, one of these three, was called in support of the will. He testified among other things that when the will was presented to Griffin, the testator, he was told, \u201c This is your will giving all your property to Gusty [the petitioner],\u201d and was asked if he wanted to sign it; that Griffin nodded his head and reached for the pen. He further testified that he saw Griffin take a teacup in his hand and drink from it on or about the day the will was executed, and that on various occasions he had asked Griffin how he was and Griffin had answered \u201c Pretty well.\u201d On cross-examination the witness was asked if he had not said to one Sullivan, the orderly at the hospital, on the same day the will was executed, \u201c That it was a shame to make that man make a will. They might as well have a dead man.\u201d The question was objected to by the appellee as calling for the opinion of the witness on the testator\u2019s mental capacity; but the appellant stated that the question was asked with the intention of contradicting the witness, if he should answer in the negative, by calling Sullivan. The justice excluded the question, the appellant excepted, and the only matter for us to determine is whether there was error in law in excluding this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Since Tileston was not qualified to express an opinion upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the sanity of the testator, the only ground upon which the question was admissible, if at all, was that an answer in the affirmative would tend to contradict his previous statements and thus weaken his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Tileston had not expressed any opinion as to the sanity of the testator. He had simply testified to certain very simple physical acts of the testator. The statement which it is said he made to Sullivan, when fairly considered, is rather a statement respecting the mental capacity of the testator than his physical condition, and there was danger that it would be regarded by the jury as affirmative evidence of the testator\u2019s mental capacity. Under these circumstances the justice was justified in holding somewhat strictly to the rule as to contradictory evidence; and he may have concluded that the alleged statement was so vague and indefinite as not to have any tendency to contradict the witness. In coming to such a conclusion we do not see that he committed any error. The case differs from cases like <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>7 Met. 262, and <em>Brown </em>v. Brown, 108 Mass. 386, and should stand with <em>Hubbell </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>2 Allen, 196, and similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
