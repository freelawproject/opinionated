Writ dated November 15, 1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-9\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Bishop, </em>J. The plaintiff was about sixty years of age. She testified that on May 23,1901, she was a passenger upon an outbound open car of the defendant and was going to the Pope\u2019s Jubilee in the Cathedral on Washington Street; that the car stopped at Union Park Street, the stopping place for the Cathedral, and the plaintiff got off; that she got off on the right hand side and went right around the rear end of the car. She described the accident as follows: \u201c I come round the rear end of the car and stepped into the space between, looked up and saw this car. I came round the rear end of the car and stepped into the space and saw the car a little distance and I thought I had plenty of time to step over. People commenced to screech and scream and I got kind of confused and the next thing I knew the car was right up on me and pitched me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-10\">On cross-examination the plaintiff said that she used to go to the Cathedral frequently and used to go the same way by car; that she was familiar with the way there and the way the cars ran, and that she always used to get off at about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>same place, Union Park Street, and then walked across to the Cathedral.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-4\">Other evidence is described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the judge ruled that the evidence would not warrant a verdict for the, plaintiff, and ordered a verdict for the defendant, which was returned by the jury. At the request of the parties he reported the case for determination by this court. If the ruling and direction were right the verdict was to stand ; otherwise it was to be set aside and a new trial was to be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-6\"><em>H.

She attempted to cross the track in front of a car which was a car length or a little more away and which was coming as she testified \u201c rather fast,\u201d and was struck and knocked down before she got across. She testified, amongst other things, as we understand her testimony, that she thought that she had plenty of tim\u00e9 to get across, and she relied on the motorman slowing or slackening up and she chanced it. She was familiar with the way cars ran in that locality and there was no exigency which compelled her to cross the track as she attempted to do. She \u201c chanced it \u201d as she testified^ and as is evident was the case and as many people do under similar circumstances, and though it may be hard for her, she must take the consequences. <em>Stachpole </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>193 Mass. 562. <em>Mathes </em>v. <em>Lowell, Lawrence, &amp; Haverhill Street Railway, </em>177 Mass. 416. It is unnecessary to consider whether there was evidence of negligence on the part of the motorman.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
