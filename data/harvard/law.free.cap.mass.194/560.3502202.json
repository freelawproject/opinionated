This patent was issued on June 29,1897, and comprised the same claims discussed in the opinion of Messrs. Fish, Richardson and Storrow hereafter referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-10\">On March 5, 1896, the defendant paid $1,000 into the treasury of the National Cloth Cutter Company, in pursuance of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-11\">On March 14, 1896, the defendant was elected president of the National Cloth Cutter Company, W. L. Coolidge, W. H. Coolidge, O. H. Durrell and the defendant were chosen directors, and W. L. Coolidge was chosen treasurer. Each of these had subscribed for one share of stock on February 14, when the company was organized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-12\">Certificate No. 9, made out in the name of Adams D. Claflin for nine hundred and ninety-nine shares, was signed by the defendant Claflin as president and by W. L. Coolidge as treasurer, under date of March 14, 1896, but never was torn from the stock book stub, nor was it ever delivered to the defendant, nor did he ever sign any receipt for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-13\">On August 1, 1896, an application was made for a patent on improvements in the machine by the plaintiffs Morse and Calvin E. Randall. They assigned their rights under this application to the National Cloth Cutter Company on August 21, 1896, and a patent was issued on this application on June 15, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The opinion of Messrs. Fish, Richardson and Sborrow, called for by the contract, was rendered on or about February 2,1897. The opinion consisted of a letter signed \u201c Frederick P. Fish,\u201d addressed to W. H. Coolidge and dated B'ebruary 2, 1897. The substance of this letter is described in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-5\">Directly after receiving the opinion of Mr. Fish, W. H. Coolidge handed it to the defendant, who kept it two or three days and went over it carefully by himself, and also spent one evening upon it with W. H. Coolidge. The defendant contended that the opinion was not such an opinion as would compel him to go ahead and make further payment under the contract, and that at that time he decided he would not go ahead, and that this decision was communicated to W. L. Coolidge by W. H. Coolidge, and shortly afterwards by the defendant to W. L. Coolidge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-6\">About February 17, 1897, the defendant and W. L. Coolidge talked over the defendant\u2019s relation to the company, in view of the fact that an annual meeting was soon to take place, and it was understood between them that the defendant should drop out as an officer of the company. At the request of W. L. Coolidge the defendant indorsed on the back certificate No. 9, for nine hundred and ninety-nine shares, under date of February 19, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-7\">On February 24, 1897, W. L. Coolidge wrote to C. A. Hight, the clerk of the corporation in Portland, a letter in which he said: \u201c Enclosed find my proxy and I expect to send you more to-morrow or next day. Mr. Claflin has given up all but one of his shares so he will not send proxies. The 999 shares which Mr. Claflin had have not been issued to any other person as yet.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-8\">At the annual meeting held on February 27, 1897, Messrs.

Coolidge was elected president and treasurer of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-9\">About a week after this annual meeting, on March 4,1897, W. L. Coolidge and the plaintiffs signed a paper as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-10\">\u201c Natick, March 4, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-11\">\u201c We, the undersigned, owners of 250 shares each of the National Cloth Cutter Company, which shares have stood on the books of said Company in the name of Adams D.

About a year after his death, which occurred on March 4, 1904, the original stock book of the company was found in the office of W. H. Coolidge, and the foregoing paper was found in it pinned to certificate No. 9, for nine hundred and ninety-nine shares in the name of the defendant. The certificate never had been detached from the stock book and was not receipted for, but bore upon the back an assignment running to the treasurer of the National Cloth Cutter Company signed by the defendant under date of February 19, 1897, and witnessed by W. L. Coolidge. This stock book was put in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-7\">The defendant testified in his own behalf. On his direct examination he was asked the following question: \u201c You say you had this conversation with Mr. W. H. Coolidge and went over this contract carefully: will you state what you said to Mr. Coolidge in regard to it ? \u201d This question was objected to by the plaintiffs, and was allowed by the justice subject to the plaintiffs\u2019 exception. The defendant answered as follows: <em>\u201c </em>I stated to Mr. W. H. Coolidge that in view of the uncertainty or indecisiveness of the opinion, and the many questions and possibilities raised by the opinion, I didn\u2019t consider that it met the requirements of the contract, or met my requirements in satisfying me as to the status of the patents and I therefore should not be able to go on, didn\u2019t feel able to go on, under the contract, and that I should expect to forfeit my SI,000 already paid in as called for by the contract and cease my connection with the matter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-8\">The witness went on to testify in substance as follows: \u201c After my conversation with Mr. W. H. Coolidge, I met Mr. W. L. Coolidge in the Boston office of Strout and Coolidge and confirmed to him what I had stated to Mr. W. H. Coolidge. W. L. Coolidge made no comment on my statement other than shaking his head up and down. I understood him to acquiesce in my decision. I saw Mr. W. L. Coolidge after that almost every day for a long time; from that time on Mr. W. L. Coolidge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>made no demands on me in connection with this contract or its performance; he never alluded to the matter thereafter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-5\">W. H. Coolidge, who was called as a witness by the defendant, having testified that after the opinion of Fish, Richardson and Storrow was given he had a conversation with the defendant in regard to it, was asked on his direct examination the question \u201c What did he say ? \u201d This question was objected to by the plaintiffs and was admitted by the presiding justice. \u201c A. I can\u2019t remember the language; I know the substance of it. \u2014 Q. State, as near as you can, the substance. A. The substance was that this wasn\u2019t the kind of a report he was going in <em>on; </em>that this wasn\u2019t the kind he expected to go in on; that there were questions in regard to whether it would infringe some old patent; there were questions in regard to how much value it was, whether it was useful, and how easily it might be got around; and that on the whole he didn\u2019t think he ought to go in.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-6\">The witness testified that after having this conversation with the defendant he told his father all about it; told him that the defendant and he had had a talk, and what the defendant said and what the witness said.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-7\">The defendant was recalled, and stated in regard to signing his name on the back of certificate No. 9 on February 19, 1897, that he remembered that after talking with W. H. Coolidge and subsequently with W. L. Coolidge, W. L. Coolidge and the witness talked over the witness\u2019 relation as an officer of the company, in view of the fact that an annual meeting was pretty soon to take place, and it was understood between them that of course the witness should drop out as a director and officer of the company at that annual meeting, as the witness\u2019 connection with the company was to be entirely severed owing to his not taking the option under the contract. As nearly as the witness could fix that conversation it must have been somewhere in the latter part of February. It was as a result of that conversation that the witness signed the transfer on the certificate, and he did not send a proxy to the meeting, as he was not supposed to have any further connection with the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">The defendant then offered the following letter, signed by O. H. Durrell previously mentioned, who died three or four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>years before the trial, which was admitted subject to the plaintiffs\u2019 objection and exception:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-5\">\u201c Boston, March 6,1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-6\">\u201c W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"An5\">This is an action upon a contract in writing, whereby the defendant agreed with the plaintiffs and one William L. Coolidge, who were the owners of an invention and of the capital stock of a corporation formed for the purpose of utilizing the invention, to pay $11,500 and receive one fourth of the capital stock of the corporation in case Fish, Richardson and Storrow should give an opinion that the invention was patentable. Under the contract the defendant also had an option to pay the money and take the stock if Fish, Richardson and Storrow should give an opinion that the invention was not patentable, and in reference to that the language of the contract is as follows: \u201c Said Claflin shall determine whether he will or will not purchase said stock as soon as the opinion of Fish, Richardson and Storrow is received, provided the opinion is unfavorable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The first question which arises is whether they gave an opinion that the invention was patentable. As to this the presiding justice instructed the jury as follows: \u201c It is not a question whether the invention is patentable or not, but whether Messrs. Fish, Richardson and Storrow will say that it is in terms; and what they say, in substance, about it, as I construe it, is that this is a new invention, but that whether it is patentable or not depends upon certain practical things, the value of certain practical things, which they know nothing about; and if they are sufficiently valuable then it is patentable, and if not, then it is not. So they do not give, it seems to me, an opinion that the invention is patentable.\u201d There is little to be added to this brief characterization of the opinion given by Fish, Richardson and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Storrow.' An examination of it will show that, while the writer of it found in the invention much to commend, he carefully refrained from giving an opinion upon certain questions which he stated, and which should be answered affirmatively in order to render the invention patentable. He made the patentability of the invention depend on whether \u201c such a \u2018 scissors \u2019 cut ... is a substantial advance in the art.\u201d He then said, \u201c It is a practical question to be determined by mechanical experts as to whether or not there is in this class of machines such a decided advantage in a \u2018scissors \u2019 cut. I myself express no opinion on that point, for it is outside of my province.\u201d He stated as bis conclusion \u201c that if, as a matter of fact, the peculiar arrangement and combination of the cutting blades of the Morse machine is very important in cloth cutters, the first nine claims are of corresponding importance and would protect the manufacturer of the Morse machine against the competition of other machines having this peculiar cutting organization. If a reciprocating cutter having a long plunging stroke and toward the end of its stroke cooperating with a stationary blade to make a \u2018 scissors \u2019 cut is not important, then the claims are not important.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We are of opinion that this instruction of the justice was correct, and we thus dispose of the plaintiffs\u2019 three requests for rulings, and of their exceptions to the rulings given on this part of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The next question is whether there was error in the instructions in regard to the defendant\u2019s determining whether he would or would not purchase stock. The jury were instructed that there was nothing in the contract that required him to give notice to anybody whether he made that determination or not, and that \u201c it is not necessary that he should give an explicit notice, either in writing or orally, either to all of the signers or to any of them. It is necessary that, in addition to making the decision in his own mind, he should do something so that that might become properly known, and so that thereafter he could not dispute but that he had made that decision.\u201d He further told the jury that, if, deeming the opinion unfavorable, he decided in his own mind that he would not go on, and \u201c if, having come to that determination in his own mind, he did communicate that to Mr. W. H. Coolidge, and it came to the knowledge of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>W. L. Coolidge, who was treasurer at that time of the corporation, and thereupon, having that knowledge, Mr. W. L. Coolidge, the treasurer, had him sign the assignment on the back of the certificate in the book, and that was considered between them as an act which he had done in relinquishing his right to the stock, that would be such an overt act as would be a sufficient communication of his determination.\u201d This had reference to an assignment of one fourth of the capital- stock of the corporation, for which there was an unissued certificate in the stock book standing in his name, and which he indorsed over for use by the corporation soon after the receipt of the opinion from Fish, Richardson and Storrow. This is to be taken in connection with the undisputed evidence that, long before that time, a corporation had been formed by the plaintiffs and their associate W. L. Coolidge, with whom the defendant contracted; that this corporation represented all the interest of the plaintiffs in the invention; that W. H. Coolidge, a son of W. L. Coolidge, who had acquired a half interest in his father\u2019s stock, was one of the directors, who acted for himself and others in the business, and to whom the opinion of Fish, Richardson and Storrow was given, and with much other evidence from which it ought to be inferred that all the plaintiffs very early had knowledge of the defendant\u2019s determination not to purchase the stock. We are of opinion that the justice was right in ruling that no formal notice to the plaintiffs was necessary, and that it was enough if the defendant promptly came to the determination, and did some overt act which would bind him so that it might become properly known. There was uncontradicted evidence that the plaintiffs went on without him, for nearly eight years, and that, although seeing him frequently, no one of them ever questioned his determination or suggested that he was liable under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The conversation with W. H. Coolidge was competent. He was acting in the interest of himself and the plaintiffs in procuring the opinion, and he was one of the directors of the corporation. He narrated the conversation to his father, W. L Coolidge, another of the directors and the treasurer of the corporation, and one of the joint signers with the plaintiffs of the contract on which this action is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>The letter from Durrell to W. H. Coolidge was competent. It was the declaration of a deceased person, and it tended to contradict material testimony of R. H. Randall, one of the plaintiffs. That it contained irrelevant matter does not render the whole letter inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
