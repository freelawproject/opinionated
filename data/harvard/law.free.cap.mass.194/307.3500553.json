Writ dated December 9, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-10\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Lawton, </em>J. The plaintiff at the time of the accident was about nineteen years of age and previous to his employment by the defendant had worked for the General Electric Company. When the plaintiff first entered the employ of the defendant he was put to work on a cornering machine, and worked on this machine about a month, then he worked in the shipping room for a month or two, and then was put on a team delivering boxes. Occasionally he was taken off the team and put to work on the circular saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>and piling lumber. He was put to work on the heading machine for the first time about a week or two before the accident, but did not work steadily on it for more than a day or two at a time. On the morning he was injured he had been driving a team up to nine or ten o\u2019clock, when the superintendent put him to work on the heading machine. He worked till twelve o\u2019clock, went to dinner, returned at one o\u2019clock, and had been working on the heading machine about fifteen minutes when he was injured. The machine consisted of a movable table, a revolving circular saw and a stationary table. About two inches back of the saw was a device known as a spreader, which consisted of a piece of tin or zinc a little thinner than the saw projecting about three or four inches above the table and about five or six inches long. The spreader was about three thirty-seconds of an inch wide and the saw a little wider. The spreader was in the same plane as that in which the saw revolved, and its purpose was to fill the slit cut by the saw and prevent the slit from closing, which would cause the wood to bind on the saw. The wood to be sawed was placed on the movable table running on two iron brackets with rollers and was pushed by the operator against the saw, which revolved toward the operator. At the time of the accident the plaintiff was cutting a board on the machine, and the spreader did not enter the cut in the board\", but struck the board a little to one side of the cut, which caused the board as it was being forced against the saw to stop with a violent jerk, and the plaintiff\u2019s hand was thrown forward upon the saw and was injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">The plaintiff among other things testified that \u201c The spreader didn\u2019t take the cut because it was loose; the screws on the spreader were loose. I didn\u2019t examine the screws.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">Another workman in the factory, who operated a similar machine, testified that \u201c The spreader was a little bit off; the screws were loose \u2014 the wood was sort of chewed away, the screws a little loose causing the spreader to go one way or the other.\u201d He also testified \u201cI ran the machine before the accident and had observed it acting this way before. I couldn\u2019t say how long before.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-7\">The defendant\u2019s superintendent, called by the plaintiff as a witness, testified that seven or eight clays before the accident he knew that the machine was out of order. He also testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>he instructed the plaintiff about this machine, told him the working principles and showed him how it should be worked, but did not tell him what to do in case the board struck the spreader; that it never was reported to him that that happened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-6\"><em>R. L. Sisk, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-7\"><em>R. </em>Spring, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b329-8\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYR\">Upon the evidence the jury might have found that the plaintiff was inexperienced with reference to this machine and should have been instructed as to the effect of a loose or defective spreader; and that at the time of the accident he was in the exercise of such care as could reasonably have been expected of him; that the accident was due to the looseness of the screws by which the spreader was bound to the stationary table, and that this defect had existed so long that if reasonable care had been exercised by the defendant, or those for whose care it was responsible, this defect would have been remedied. In other words, the jury might have found that the plaintiff was careful and that the accident was due to the failure on the part of the defendant to use due care for the safe condition of the machines. The jury might further have found that the danger of the loose spreader was not known to or appreciated by the plaintiff. Upon such findings a case would have been made out by the plaintiff. We think that the plaintiff was entitled to have his case submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
