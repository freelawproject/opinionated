J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARg\">This is an action upon a judgment, recovered more than twenty years before the date of the writ, and the only question is whether the action is barred by the statute . of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The provision of the statute touching this question is found in R L. c. 202, \u00a7 19, and is as follows: \u201cA judgment or decree of a court of record of the United States or of this or any other State of the United States shall be presumed to be paid and satisfied at the expiration of twenty years after it was rendered.\u201d This is applicable only to those judgments which have been rendered more than twenty years. It is found in the chapter which contains the general statute of limitations, and it is a special limitation of judgments in regard to which there is no proof that they remain unpaid. It implies that, when there is such proof, the judgment may be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">This statute was before the court in <em>Denny v. Eddy, </em>22 Pick. 533. The court said in the opinion: \u201cThe only statute bar to an action on a judgment of a court of record is that contained in the Rev. Sts. c. 120, \u00a7 24, providing that every judgment \u2018 shall be presumed to be satisfied and paid at the expiration of twenty years after the judgment was rendered.\u2019 \u201d The case was considered in reference to a general plea of the statute of limitations, and this section is distinctly held \u201cto be the only statute bar\u201d to such an action. The general provisions of the statute were substantially the same then as now. Rev. Sts. c. 120, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7. R. L. c. 202, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. In <em>Walker </em>v. Robinson, 136 Mass. 280, 282, this statute was again before us, and it was assumed both by counsel and the court that, on proof of non-payment, lapse of time was no bar to an action on such a judgment. In <em>Day </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>173 Mass. 433, there was the same assumption. We have been referred to no decision that modifies the doctrine of <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Fddy, ubi </em>supra, although there are two or three dicta, relied on by the defendant, which appear to have been uttered without a particular consideration of the question, and without thought of their application to this special provision of the statute. <em>Von Hemert </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>11 Met. 210, 216. <em>Bannegan </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>13 Met. 251, 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The defendant relies upon the fourth clause of the R. L. c. 202, \u00a7 1, which includes within the limitation of twenty years \u201c actions upon contracts which are not limited by the provisions of the following section or by any other provision of law.\u201d This provision was before the court when <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Eddy </em>was decided. The answer to the contention is that this judgment is limited by another \u201c provision of law,\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Section 19 is a special limitation of all such judgments, unless there is affirmative proof that they have not been paid. Section 18 also declares that, \u201cIf a special provision is otherwise made relative to the limitation of any action, the provisions of this chapter which are inconsistent therewith shall not apply.\u201d Giving \u00a7 19 its true meaning, \u00a7 1, if construed as the defendant construes it, would be inconsistent with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Moreover, the whole force of the defendant\u2019s argument rests upon his contention that an action upon a judgment is an action upon contract, within the meaning of the fourth clause. This clause relates only to actions of contract founded \u201cupon contracts,\u201d while \u00a7 2 includes \u201cactions of contract founded upon contracts or liabilities, express or implied,\u201d except, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">There are many cases that treat a liability upon a judgment as contractual in its nature, and some that call a judgment a contract; but there are others in which the word \u201c contract \u201d has been held not to include a judgment'. The meaning of the word often depends upon the connection in which it is used. See <em>Bidleson </em>v. Whytel, 3 Burr. 1545, 1548; <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Mayor of New Orleans, </em>109 U. S. 285; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>113 U. S. 452; <em>Morley </em>v. <em>Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway, </em>146 U. S. 162, 169; <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>15 Maine, 167, 168; <em>Wolffe </em>v. <em>Eberlein, </em>74 Ala. 99; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>33 Ala. 706, 710; <em>Rae </em>v. <em>Hulbert, </em>17 Ill. 572, 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Actions upon the judgments referred to in \u00a7 19 are specially excepted from the provisions of R. L. c. 202, \u00a7 2, and we are of opinion that such judgments are not included in the fourth clause of \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
