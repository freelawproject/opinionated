The lease contained a covenant by the city binding it to pay rent at the rate stipulated in the lease for such further time as it should hold the premises or any part thereof after the term of the lease or any extension of that term had expired. An extension of the term of the lease expired on December 1, 1901. In November, 1898, the city removed the float for repairs, and it never was brought back, but all the other structures erected by the city remained, as did also a notice purporting to be signed by the superintendent of streets reading \u201c City of Boston Public Landing. Boats not allowed to tie up here.\u201d No notice of abandonment of the leased premises was given by the city. On August 6,1903, the mayor sent a letter to the wharf company notifying it that at the end of the quarter which should begin next after that date the city would quit and deliver up the premises theretofore used by it for a float and landing place. Later the wharf company brought an action of contract on the covenants of the lease for the rent from March 1,1903, to December 1, 1903. The plaintiff offered in evidence the letter of the mayor mentioned above which was excluded by the judge. The plaintiff also, for the purpose of showing that payments of rent were made by the defendant after the expiration of the extension of the lease up to April, 1903, offered in evidence entries in a book kept by the plaintiff\u2019s deceased wharfinger containing declarations to that effect. This evidence was excluded by the judge on the ground that no authority from the city to make the alleged payments had been shown. The judge also excluded evidence offered by the plaintiff to show that between December 1,1901, and December 1, 1903, it made no charge for landing on the platform constructed by the defendant under the lease, although it made a charge after the last named date and made charges for a similar use of other parts of the wharf. The judge ordered a verdict for the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that the removal of the float for repairs by the defendant in November, 1898, did not constitute an abandonment of the premises'; that the letter of the mayor should have been admitted in evidence as tending to show that the defendant was holding over when the letter was written; that in connection with other evidence it was competent for the plaintiff to show that it had recognized the alleged occupation of the defendant by refraining from making any charge for landing upon the platform ; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the entries in the books of the deceased wharfinger should have been admitted in evidence, as in the absence of evidence to the contrary it would be presumed that the payments stated in the entries were made with authority; and that the liability of the defendant depended on whether it had occupied any part of the leased premises during the period sued for, which was a question of fact for the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b481-4\">The.acts of a public official are presumed to have been done rightly until the contrary is shown.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b481-5\">On the issue whether a city has surrendered certain leased premises on the termination of a lease or has continued to occupy them so as to be liable on a covenant to pay rent during such occupation, the liability of the city is to be determined as that of any citizen would be.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">Two actions OF CONTRACT against the city of Boston for rent alleged to be due under a covenant in a lease from the plaintiff to the defendant dated November 30, 1891, the first action for $250 as rent for the quarter from March 1 to June 1, 1903, and the second action for $500 as rent for the two quarters from June 1 to December 1, 1903.

that, when he first came to the wharf, there was a float about thirty by forty feet in size and so constructed that it would rise and fall with the tide, maintained for a landing, with a flight of steps leading to the platform on the wharf; that at the time of the big storm about Thanksgiving, 1898, which wrecked the Portland, the float was damaged and was towed off and never was brought back; that from that time \"the only way any person could land there from small boats or crafts was by bringing a ladder with them or climbing up a slimy pile if it was low water, but at high water they could jump on to the wharf; that the tide rose and fell at that point from eight to ten feet; that the piles of the wharf were from about ten inches to a foot in diameter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-7\">He further testified that between December 1,1901, and December 1, 1903, he had seen boats land there with junk, had seen parties land there from launches, and that boats made the same use of the landing that they did when there was a float there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-8\">The counsel for the plaintiff then asked the witness whether or not any charge was made for landing on the platform between December 1, 1901, and December 1, 1903, and also whether any charge was made after December 1,1903. These questions were asked for the purpose of bringing out evidence to show that the plaintiff acknowledged the city\u2019s right in the premises and did not charge for landing on the part of the wharf described in the lease to the defendant until after December 1, 1903, but did charge after that, and that charges always were made for similar use of other parts of the wharf. The judge excluded the evidence and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-9\">The plaintiff then called as a witness one Ballard, who testified that he had been in the employ of the plaintiff since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>middle of April, 1902, first as bookkeeper and then as assistant wharfinger in charge of the premises, after the death of the previous wharfinger, one White, who died on April 3, 1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-4\">The counsel for the plaintiff then offered in evidence the ledger and cash book of the plaintiff kept by the witness and by White in the usual course of business. These boobs were not objected to as such, and counsel then offered to show from them payments of $250 each for rent, made by the defendant to White, the wharfinger, on March 12, 1902, August 12, 1902, October 16, 1902, January 13, 1903, April 11,1903, and April 13,1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\">These payments were offered as evidence of a holding over by the defendant under the covenants of the lease, and it was ruled by the judge that no authority to make the payments having been shown they were not admissible.

Nor was there any dispute that for any occupation of the whole or a part of the leased premises after the term of the lease, as extended, had expired, the defendant would be liable to pay rent at the rate stipulated in the lease. The question at issue was whether there had been such occupation. The defendant contends that it had abandoned the premises in November, 1898, by removing the landing float, and in no way had occupied them since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The property leased to the defendant was the right to use a certain part of the plaintiff\u2019s dock and flats \u201c for a public float and landing place for boats,\u201d and the \u201c right to drive, cap and maintain four oak piles, one at each corner of said float, to keep the same in position; also the right to build a platform \u201d from one side of the pier \u201c and a run or other suitable approach \u201d from the platform to the float, \u201c and to drive such piles as may be necessary in building \u201d the platform and approach. The defendant did all these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The mere removal of the float by the defendant in November, 1898, for repairs, all its other erections having been left there, did not constitute an abandonment, even though it never was brought back. Nor was anything further done upon the expiration of the extended term, December 1, 1901. The other erections made by the defendant were not removed, and apparently were still in position until the end of the period sued for. There also was evidence that the defendant had put a notice upon the premises, purporting to be signed by the superintendent of streets, reading, \u201c City of Boston Public Landing. Boats not allowed to tie up here \u201d; and that this remained in position until after the expiration of the period sued for. No notice of any kind was given by the defendant of its abandonment of the leased premises. It is true that no notice was required to terminate the tenancy at the expiration of the lease; but in view of the other facts of the case this failure to give notice might have some significance. Under these circumstances we are of opinion that the plaintiff should have been allowed, if it could do so, to show the declarations of White, its deceased wharfinger, contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>entries in the books kept by him, that payments of rent for these premises had been made by the defendant after the expiration of the lease up to April, 1903. The books which were offered to show these declarations were not objected to as such ; and they appear to have been excluded simply because no authority from the city to make the alleged payments had been shown. But the offer was to show that the payments were made by the city ; the contents of the books are not before us; and we cannot suppose that the payments purporting to be made were made through merely inferior officers of the defendant city. If made by the mayor and treasurer, or either of them, the presumption <em>omnia rite esse acta, </em>would apply. <em>Washington National Bank </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>190 Mass. 497. The mayor is the chief executive officer of the city. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>98 Mass. 39. The treasurer is the person charged with its financial affairs -and the responsibility for its moneys. Apparently the whole matter of this lease and its extensions had been attended to from the beginning by the mayor ; and evidence of his actions in the matter was <em>prima facie </em>competent. <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Mayor of New York, </em>93 N. Y. 250. Such evidence was received and acted upon against the same objection in <em>St. Louis Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>St. Louis, </em>11 Mo. App. 55, 74, 75, upon the presumption of right acting which attends the conduct of every person in an official station until the contrary is shown. <em>Read </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>2 Cush. 115. <em>Bank of the United States </em>v. <em>Dandridge, </em>12 Wheat. 64, 69, 70. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>24 Fed. Rep. 348. <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>68 N. Y. 528, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">It must be remembered that this is a question of merely private right, in which no governmental function is to be dealt with, and the liability of the defendant is to be determined, as that of any citizen would be, by the contract which it has made. <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Mass. 387. <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>Sexton, </em>115 Ill. 230. It is not denied that if such payments were made after the term of the extended lease had expired this would furnish some evidence of a holding over by the defendant; and there was no assertion of any act of abandonment or surrender during the period sued for after the time covered by the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">For the same reasons, the letter written by the mayor, dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>August 6, 1908, should have been admitted. It was of course open to explanation; but it tended to show that the city was holding over when the letter was written. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Blackstone, </em>102 Mass. 343, 348. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Board of </em>Education, 93 N. Y. 1. 1 Dillon, Mun. Corp. (4th ed.) \u00a7 305, note. In connection with the other evidence, it was competent for the plaintiff to show that it had recognized the alleged occupation of the city by refraining from making any charge for landing upon the platform constructed by the city under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">It is not necessary to consider the requests for rulings in detail. The liability of the defendant depended upon whether it actually had occupied any part of the leased premises during the period sued for; and this presents a question of fact to be determined by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
