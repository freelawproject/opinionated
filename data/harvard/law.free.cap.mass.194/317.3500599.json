L. c. 167, \u00a7 116, to dissolve an attachment, is valid and binding even if the attachment was not effective.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-11\">Tort for unlawfully entering the plaintiff\u2019s lunch room in a store numbered 374 on Hanover Street in Boston, seizing and taking possession of that place of business of the plaintiff and preventing the plaintiff from conducting business there for about eighteen hours, with a second count for the conversion of certain goods of the plaintiff. Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated J une 8, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-12\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Wait, </em>J. It appeared that the defendant was a constable in the city of Boston, and that on May 22,1903, he attached one of the stores of the plaintiff on Hanover Street in Boston, in which she was conducting a lunch room, \u201c run night and day,\u201d on a writ issuing from the Municipal Court of the City of Boston in favor of one Cornelius Mahoney, and put a keeper in possession thereof for about eighteen hours, when the plaintiff gave a bond to dissolve the attachment, and the defendant and the keeper withdrew.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-13\">It further appeared that the defendant while in possession took cash from customers who had purchased food, and also at the time of the attachment removed part of the money from the cash register, ordered the husband of the plaintiff and her em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ployees out of the store in the evening, and put a lock and staple on the door leaving the keeper therein during the night.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-3\">The plaintiff contended that the writ under which the attachment was made was returned to court on June 4,1903, although returnable on May 30, 1903. The defendant testified that he returned the writ to the court on May 29, 1903; the writ, however, never was entered in the court, but was placed among the non-entries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-4\">The plaintiff asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">1. The writ in Mahoney <em>v. </em>Walsh not having been entered in court, the writ is no justification for any acts done in consequence of that writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">2. That as the writ in Mahoney <em>v. </em>Walsh was not returned to court on the return day mentioned therein, or on the Monday following, nothing done under it justifies the acts of the defendant in the premises of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-7\">3. The defendant, although having in his possession a writ, which might justify his acts in attaching the goods and chattels of the plaintiff, by putting on a lock and driving a staple in the door, and denying the plaintiff possession, exceeded his authority, therefore the writ is no justification.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-8\">4. The acts of the defendant in interfering, ejecting and preventing the customers of the plaintiff from entering the premises made the defendant a trespasser therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-9\">The judge ordered a verdict for the defendant, stating that he did so in order that the questions of law involved might be presented to this court. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-10\"><em>E. B. Callender &amp; E. M. Shanley, </em>for the plaintiff, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-11\"><em>J. L. </em>Sheehan, <em>(J. S. Cannon </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b338-12\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOQN\">The defendant, a constable in the city of Boston, received a writ sued out by one Mahoney against Susan E. Walsh, the plaintiff in this action. The writ instructed him to attach the goods and estate of the said Walsh, to the amount of $110. Armed with this document he proceeded to a lunch room owned and kept by her but under the immediate management of her husband, and, as stated in his return, attached \u201c certain goods and chattels . . . placed a keeper over said property and took from cash register $12.93.\u201d Neither in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>return nor in the evidence at this trial is there any mor\u00e9 specific description of the goods and chattels which were attached. If the officer had stopped there perhaps he would have been justified by his writ taken in connection with the provisions of R. L. c. 167, \u00a7 43. But he did not stop there. There was evidence that the store was \u201c run night and day.\u201d It appeared that the defendant \u201c ordered the husband of the plaintiff and her employee out of the store in the evening, and put a lock and staple on the door leaving the keeper therein during the night.\u201d From some time in the early evening of the day of the attachment until ten or eleven o\u2019clock the next forenoon, he kept the store locked up and prevented all access to it. There was evidence also that before the closing of the store he forcibly prevented customers from coming in. Against the exclusion of the customers, the closing of the store and the exclusion of the husband and servants of the plaintiff, the plaintiff, through her husband, protested, but finally yielded.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">It is plain that in these various acts of exclusion and in the locking up of the store the defendant went beyond the authority of his writ and of the statute above named; and no citation of authorities is needed in support of the proposition that such a public officer exceeding his authority becomes a trespasser <em>ab initia.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The third and fourth requests should have been given. The trespass was not waived by the subsequent giving of a bond to dissolve the attachment. The bond is not before us, but we assume it to be the statute bond to pay the judgment, and that it is good whether or not there has been any substantial attachment. The defendant in the writ may have preferred in that way to avoid all further trouble about the possession of her store, but it cannot be held to estop her from a claim for damages as to the past trespasses. There being evidence of a trespass the plaintiff had a right to go to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Since the exceptions must be sustained upon this ground it is unnecessary now to consider the exception concerning the filing of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> For the other branch of the rule in the <em>Six Carpenters' Case, </em>that one who has entered a close under a license from the owner does not become a trespasser <em>ah initia </em>by committing unlawful acts after his entry, see <em>Beers </em>v. McGinnis. 191 Mass. 279; <em>Feeley </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>191 Mass. 313.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
