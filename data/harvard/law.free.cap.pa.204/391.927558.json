One of the parties could not, therefore, make such changes in the stairway as to interfere with the light from the windows opening into the area, or cut new holes in his neighbor\u2019s wall to support new landings, or open a door on the ground floor to an elevator, so as to subject the common area to the new and additional use of persons going to new upper stories erected by himself on his own building.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b421-12\">Argued Oct. 27, 1902.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARFD\">Appeal, No. 7, Oct.

At the same time the defendant\u2019s predecessors in title were the owners of a lot fronting about twenty-three feet on Fifth avenue, adjoining the lot of plaintiff on the west.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-4\">The plaintiff built its banking house on its lot, and the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title built on his lot a business house, these two buildings being each of a height of four stories, and provided with an iron front alike on the two buildings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">In the construction of these buildings a space four and one half feet in front on Fifth avenue, and fifteen feet in depth, was left out of the walls of each building, one on the westerly side of the bank\u2019s lot, and the other on the easterly side of the lot, now belonging to the defendant. In this space, a staircase was built to the top of the building. A doorway, six feet wide, opened into this space from Fifth avenue, and the stairs started up from the side next to the bank building at a distance of about six feet from the doorway, and the flight of stairs went up from side to side of the space with continuous landings at the level of the stories.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\">The front of this space was covered by the common iron front of the building, and contained windows which were but slightly'interfered with by the stairs. There were openings from the third and fourth stories into the bank\u2019s building, and on each of the stories above the ground into the building now of the defendant. The stairs have been used continuously by both parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\">No contract of the parties, written or oral, in regard to this staircase,' was given in evidence, but it is alleged in the bill, and admitted by defendant, that the plaintiff paid one half the cost of the construction of the stairs in 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">In the summer of 1900, the defendant\u2019s building was seriously injured by fire and the rear part of it destroyed, but no part of the staircase, or the walls, or doors adjoining it, was affected. Sometime after the fire the defendant drew up plans for the alteration of his building, including the putting in of an elevator and a change in the number of stories, by making three stories out of a third and fourth and adding what would be a sixth story, and by changing the front, and submitted these plans, or some of them, to the plaintiff, and requested the plaintiff to agree to them. The bank, after considering the matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>declined to agree to the changes. Negotiations were then had between the counsel of the respective parties, and while these were pending, the defendant proceeded with his plan, tore down the staircase, rebuilt it in part, and put a wall ten feet high on top of the walls enclosing the nine by fifteen foot space heretofore described, and extended the staircase up into it, to connect with his new sixth story. This work was done without the knowledge of the plaintiff, it being all inside the building, and done with the rest of the work of rebuilding the burnt portions of defendant\u2019s house, the upper stories of the bank building either being unoccupied, or the tenants not objecting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-3\">The plaintiff bank filed the bill herein and applied for a pre* liminary injunction, which was granted, restraining the defendant from further interfering with the stairs, except to protect them with banisters, and from taking down and changing the front and from further proceeding with the work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-4\">The changes actually made by the defendant, up to the time of filing the bill, were: He raised the first platform two or three feet above its former level, for the purpose of giving headroom to reach his elevator from the front door, and to do so was obliged to bring the foot of the stairs two feet nearer to the door than it was before. In raising this platform he made new cuts into the wall of the bank building in which to place the supports, and similar changes were made in the various platforms of the stories above the first, the same being broken into two parts so as to reach the changed position of the doors in his building, and the headway over the stairs in one or two places was reduced to as low as seven feet. The stairs, as so altered by him, wore much less conformable to the windows in the front than they were before, and the light to the staircase is materially interfered with. This the defendant claims will be practically remedied if he is allowed to change the front according to his design. The platforms of the stairs still conform to the stories of the plaintiff\u2019s building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\">He put a thirteen-inch brick wall on the top of the walls enclosing the sides and back of the space on his own building and on that of the bank, and extended the staircase up into this space to connect with his sixth story.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">The defendant has also put an elevator into the building wholly upon his own ground, immediately in the rear of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>four and one half feet of his own ground, which is enclosed for the purpose of a staircase, and has cut a door through the rear wall of the nine by fifteen foot space to give access to his elevator from that space, under the platform raised for that purpose. All the other doors of the elevator are into defendant\u2019s building on the west side of the elevator shaft, and not into the stairway. Persons using the elevator instead of the stairs to reach the upper stories of defendant\u2019s building, enter through the door, the middle of which is on the outer line of the two properties, and proceed thence to the left to the elevator, the stairway starting up on the right. There is no place in which the plaintiff could put an elevator opening to his building in the space used for the stairway, except by removing the stairway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-4\">The further changes which defendant proposes to make are to take out the whole front \u25a0 of the nine feet on Fifth avenue, and replace it with a brick wall, in conformity with the new front which he proposes to put on his own building, putting in new windows to correspond in height and appearance with the windows in his altered front; and which will then not conform with the windows iu the bank building. Of this the plaintiff complains that it will cause the whole of the nine-foot space to appear to be a part of defendant\u2019s building, and that the change is unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court, awarding an injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-6\"><em>J.

Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">It is not material for the purposes of this case whether the appellant\u2019s right in plaintiff\u2019s building be called an irrevocable license or an easement, for it must rest on the principles and be decided on the footing of an easement by prescription. That' the joint erection and occupation of the stairway and the area in which it is located were by agreement is known here just as it is implied in a prescription, but in the absence of any evidence either written or oral as to the terms of the agreement, the court can only determine what it was by what was done without dispute by the parties on the land at the time and subsequently. That is the test of the nature and extent of an easement by prescription and it must be the test here. The inference from the evidence is not that each party gave the other an unlimited right to use the common area for such purposes and in such manner as he might desire or even for general use for a stairway, but that the right was definitely confined to the common area as it was established by the parties at the time and as it continued to be jointly used.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The alterations in the stairway and building made by defendant are admitted. Some of them, such as the building of the wall an additional story in height on plaintiff\u2019s side of the area, and the alteration of the front wall over the area, were corrected before the decree and are now out of the case. But there still remain the removal of the stairway farther front at the ground floor, the reduction of the headway at points in the stairs and landings, the consequent interference with the light from the front windows, the cutting of new holes in plaintiff\u2019s wall to support the new landings, and the opening of a door to the elevator on the ground floor of the area, which though in defendant\u2019s own building subjects the common area to the new and additional use of persons going to the new upper stories erected by defendant. All these, and perhaps some others less mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>fest, are new or more extensive burdens on tbe area and stairway than have been used heretofore.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\">That the changes inflict little or no damage on plaintiff is not material. Even a conceded benefit by an improvement cannot be imposed without consent, for plaintiff\u2019s right is to have the status quo maintained, independently of any actual present injury by the change. The legal injury which plaintiff is entitled to prevent is the permanent change in the conditions agreed upon as shown by the past user.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Decree affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
