T., 1902, by M. H. Stevenson, from order of C. P. Washington Co., Nov. T., 1897, No. 57, striking off judgment in ease of Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York for use of Robert Scott and J. B. Tenan v. George M. Tenan, Executor of Stephen Smith, Deceased, with notice to M. H.

If this is apparent from the inspection of the record, we have no doubt as to the power of the court to summarily strike the same from the record as something that ought not to be there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-8\">The only question, then, for us to determine, is whether or not the record shows that the judgment and the decree of this court, approving the sheriff\u2019s special return, are void or not. There can be no dispute as to what the record shows; it shows a default judgment entered against an executor for want of an affidavit of defense, and the only question then to determine is a legal one, and that is, is such a judgment void ; has it any legal effect? What is our authority for saying it is void ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\">In the appeal reported in 188 Pa. 239, the Supreme Court say of this judgment: \u201c It follows that the judgment so entered in the present case is a void judgment and must be set aside.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-10\">In Tenan v. Cain, 188 Pa. 242, the Supreme Court say of this judgment: \u201cWe have just reversed that judgment as unauthorized and void. It was incapable of supporting an execution,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-11\">In Stevenson\u2019s Appeal, 194 Pa. 259, the Supreme Court say of this judgment and the proceedings had thereon: \u201c The judgment, deed and receipt to the sheriff were all legal nullities and possessed no efficacy whatever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-12\">With these declarations of the Supreme Court we think there can bo no question as to the legal effect of the judgment in question. If, then, the judgment, the deed and the receipt to the sheriff were all \u201c legal nullities and possessed no efficacy whatever,\u201d why should they remain on the record ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-13\">The answer of M. H. Stevenson to the motion to strike off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the judgment filed, avers that <em>\u201c </em>the sole purpose of the present motion is to prevent him from using the records as evidence before the auditor appointed to pass upon exceptions and make distribution in the matter of the account of Wm. M. Jackson, administrator of Stephen Smith, deceased, and he suggests that the granting of said motion would therefore be unfair and inequitable.\u201d Would it. not be nearer the mark to say that it would be unfair and inequitable not to grant the motion ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">If this court finds on its records a judgment and proceedings thereon \u201c that are legal nullities and possessed of no efficacy whatever \u201d in the opinion of 'the Supreme Court, and that the record of the judgment and of the proceedings thereon is about to be used as evidence in another court, where there might be some question whether or not it could be attacked collaterally, why should not this be a reason to move this court to purge its records ? Why should this court withhold its hand in this matter to allow M. H. Stevenson to offer in evidence in the orphans\u2019 court a record which has already been adjudged by the Supreme Court not oniy a nullity, but not competent evidence to establish the claim which he seeks to establish in the orphans\u2019 court? We therefore hold that the judgment entered to No. <em>57, </em>November term, 1897, and all the proceedings under it, are a nullity, and that the motion to strike off should prevail, and that the respondent in his answer has not shown any just ground for our delaying the entry of the decree asked for until he can use the record as it now stands as evidence in the orphans\u2019 court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">Of course if we were to assume that James B. Tenan had been actually paid his mortgage debt and that the estate of Stephen Smith owed him nothing, and that he by the sheriff\u2019s sale was trying to collect a debt not honestly due him, there might be some force in the suggestion that it would be inequitable for this court to grant the motion to strike off the approval of the sheriff\u2019s special return. But we can make no such assumption ; on the contrary, the fact that the estate of Stephen Smith owes James B. Tenan this mortgage debt has been adjudicated, and there is no claim that he was paid the money covered by the receipt which he gave the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">But more than this; this very money for distribution in the orphans\u2019 court referred to in the respondent\u2019s answer, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ordered paid to the executor of the will of Stephen Smith that he might pay it to James B. Tenan in discharge of his debt. It may be, as stated in the answer, that the respondent has been put to expense by reason of this sheriff\u2019s sale in preparing his paper-books for the Supreme Court in the cases that reached there by a blunder or inadvertence of this court in entering this judgment, but if, in place of giving notice to bidders at the sheriff\u2019s sale that the purchaser would take no title, he had come into this court and called our attention to the blunder we had made in entering the default judgment, we would certainly have quashed the writ of lev. fa. and then struck the judgment from the record, and there would have been no expense for him to have paid. Decrees for default judgments are always prepared by counsel and are handed up and signed on motion day without much examination, and as our court rules provide for their being opened or stricken off on cause shown, the election is with the party dissatisfied with the judgment to pursue either courseand we have no criticism to make of the course the respondent chose to take, we only say that he cannot charge the expenses incurred to \u201c the unconscionable conduct of James B. Tenan.\u201d He should either charge them to the inadvertence of the court in signing the decree for the default judgment, or to his not calling the attention of this court to the slip it had made before the sheriff\u2019s sale was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">And now, June 26, 1902, the motion of James B. Tenan, herein filed, an answer thereto of M. H. Stevenson came on to be heard and was argued, whereupon, upon due consideration, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the judgment of this court entered at No. 57, November term, 1897, and that the decree of this court of date November 12, 1897, approving the sheriff\u2019s special return on levari facias, issued to No. 92, November term, 1897, on said judgment, which decree is in these words, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">And now, November 12,1897, the within return presented and read in open court and there being no objections, the same is approved and the sheriff is directed to present for acknowledgment, the deed to James B. Tenan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">Be and the same are hereby stricken from the records of this court as \u201clegal nullities and possessed of no efficiency whatever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-5\"><em>M.

The learned judge granted the motion and struck from the records the judgment and decree as being \u201c legal nullities and possessed of no efficiency whatever.\u201d On three separate appeals to this court, in litigation involving the -validity of the judgment, we have declared it void and of no efficacy whatever. We have also held that the deed and the receipt of the sheriff by the lien creditor were likewise of no force or validity. \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s sale under the judgment,\u201d says Chief Justice Green in Smith\u2019s Estate, 194 Pa. 259, \u201c was a void sale and the deed to the purchaser was a void deed. It not only conferred no\u2019 title, it was a legal nullity. In other words, the judgment and all the subsequent proceedings were the same as if they had never taken place-; they had no existence in any manner which the law could or would recognize.\u201d Such was the opinion of this court, after deliberate consideration, upon the validity of the judgment and subsequent proceedings on the scire facias <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>issued on the mortgage. Eegarding this opinion as authoritative, the learned trial judge struck from the record the proceedings to foreclose the mortgage. His opinion thoroughly justifies his action. There can be no sufficient reason assigned why a judgment or proceeding, adjudged by this court to be void and of no legal effect, should be permitted to remain on the record of the court of first instance. Until it is stricken from the record and its invalidity thus declared, it can and may be enforced by the same or another tribunal. Thus the records of the court may be used as evidence to enforce a claim which this court declares to have no legal existence, or to defeat a claim which is justly and equitable due.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Here the correction of the record was resisted by the appellant in order that he might use it to prevent the allowance of the appellee\u2019s claim by an auditor appointed to distribute a fund in another court. So long as the record of the common pleas showed a satisfaction of the claim, the orphans\u2019 court could not allow it to participate in the distribution of a fund arising from the sale of the debtor\u2019s real estate. The judgment and proceeding thereon, declared by this court to be void and of no legal efficacy whatever, would therefore prevent the appellee from enforcing the payment of his claim out of the fund for distribution. The necessity for correcting the record is therefore apparent and the learned court below was entirely right in granting the motion for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
