We granted review. We reverse and remand for further proceedings in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\n<em>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The questions presented in this case are (1) whether the Court of Appeals correctly determined that the trial court properly exercised its discretion under Civil Rule (CR) 37 and King County Local Rule (KCLR) 4 in dismissing Petitioner Kathy Rivers\u2019 complaint because of her failure to comply with a discovery order and case event schedule deadlines; and (2) whether the trial court\u2019s granting of a dispositive motion for dismissal without oral argument constituted an \u201cirregularity\u201d justifying relief from the order to dismiss under CR 60(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">\n<em>STATEMENT OF FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Petitioner Kathy Rivers is a journeyman bricklayer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In October 1995, after completing an apprenticeship and working several years in Cincinnati, Ohio, she moved to Seattle, Washington and applied to members of the Washington State Conference of Mason Contractors for bricklay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ing work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Washington State Conference of Mason Contractors is an association of employers of bricklayers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Respondent Fairweather Masonry Company is a member of the Association.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> From 1995 to 1998 Petitioner was hired by and worked for various employers who are members of the Association. They include Keystone Masonry, Inc., Fairweather Masonry Company, Barkshire Panel Systems, Inc., East Hill Masonry, Inc., and J&amp;S Masonry, Inc. Petitioner claims that during that period the named defendants, including Respondent Fairweather Masonry Company, discriminated against her in hiring practices and treatment because of her gender.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 31, 1998 Petitioner Rivers initiated a lawsuit against association members, including Respondent Fairweather Masonry Company, in the King County Superior Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Presiding Judge Bobbe J. Bridge entered an order setting case scheduling.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\">On February 9, 1999 Respondent Fairweather Masonry Company served its first discovery request, interrogatories and request for production of documents upon Petitioner.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The interrogatories asked for calculation of specific damages, the identity of expert witnesses expected to be called at trial and the substance of facts and opinions to which each expert was expected to testify.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s responses were due on March 11, 1999, 30 days after the date of service.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The conduct related in this case is principally that of counsel for the parties, but Petitioner and Respondent are nevertheless referred to throughout this opinion without necessary distinction between them and their counsel. Absent fraud, the actions of an attorney authorized to appear for a client are binding on the client at law and in equity.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The \u201csins of the lawyer\u201d are visited upon the client.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Counsel for Respondent in a letter to Petitioner\u2019s counsel on March 8, 1999 reminded her of the deadlines and the requirement for scheduling a KCLR 37(e) conference in the event the discovery responses were not served by March 11, 1999.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In response, counsel for Petitioner requested two additional weeks to serve the discovery answers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Respondent agreed and gave Petitioner until March 25, 1999 to serve the discovery responses on the condition that Petitioner agree to extend the deadline for disclosing possible primary witnesses from March 15, 1999 to April 5, 1999.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On March 11,1999 Judge Donald D. Haley signed the order extending the deadline for disclosure of the primary witness list.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Adqv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>On March 25,1999, the extended date on which discovery responses were due, the parties engaged in a KCLR 37 conference<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> at which time Petitioner requested even more additional time to serve discovery responses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Respondent Fairweather Masonry rejected the request and on March 31, 1999 filed a motion to compel Petitioner to answer the interrogatories and requests for production of documents.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\">In response to Respondent\u2019s motion to compel compliance, Petitioner\u2019s counsel on April 5, 1999 submitted to the court a signed declaration explaining why she was unable to provide discovery responses.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> She stated that her \u201cbad cold,\u201d coupled with her client\u2019s unavailability, prevented her from completing the interrogatories.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Counsel indicated she was completing the interrogatories that day, but would need at least three additional days to obtain her client\u2019s approval and signature.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> She asked the court \u201cto allow until April 12, 1999 to provide signed answers to Respondent\u2019s counsel, Mr. Campos, and to extend the witness disclosure date [from April 5, 1999] to April 19, 1999____\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Respondent then submitted to the court a <em>proposed </em>order granting its motion to compel Petitioner to answer discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ery requests.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The proposed order referred to the first extended date of April 12,1999 as the deadline agreed to by counsel for Petitioner for answering Respondent\u2019s first set of interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">On April 16, 1999 Judge Haley signed Respondent Fairweather\u2019s order approving its motion to compel discovery, and made findings that:<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">(1) Plaintiff [Petitioner Rivers] failed to answer Defendant\u2019s [Respondent Fairweather Masonry Company\u2019s] First Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents \u25a0within 30 days of service as required by Civil Rule 33[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">(2) Plaintiff did not object to Defendant\u2019s First Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents, and any objections are therefore waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">(3) Plaintiff failed without excuse to answer Defendant\u2019s First Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents by March 25,1999, the deadline established by agreement with Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">(4) Plaintiff has demonstrated an inability to respect the deadlines established by the Civil Rules and the Case Schedule, as well as a willingness to ignore deadlines established by agreement with defense counsel, and the Court, therefore, deems it necessary to take action to encourage future compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The court ordered Petitioner to fully answer Respondent\u2019s interrogatories and requests for production of documents by April 12, 1999, and warned that any failure to comply with another discovery deadline or case event deadline in the future would result in dismissal of her case with prejudice.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>On April 13,1999 Petitioner sent to Respondent\u2019s counsel by telefacsimile a confirmation of joinder form.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Replying by letter by telefacsimile on April 14, 1999, Respondent\u2019s counsel advised he would not sign the form because Petitioner had not complied with discovery requests and deadlines for disclosing possible witnesses<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and that he would not sign the confirmation of joinder form until a date certain had been established for the status conference with approval by the court.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\">On April 20,1999 Petitioner received by regular mail the court\u2019s April 16, 1999 order to compel discovery requiring compliance by April 12, 1999, which antedated both the date of the order and the date it was received by Petitioner, although this was the extended deadline date previously requested by Petitioner.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Petitioner served answers to Respondent\u2019s interrogatories on April 21, 1999, one day after she received the court\u2019s order in the mail.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The following day, on April 22, 1999, Petitioner served Respondent with amended answers and submitted a proposed joint status report.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> On April 26, 1999 Respondent wrote to Petitioner stating that section IV of the proposed joint status report, which stated that Petitioner had fully complied with discovery, was not correct and that Petitioner still had not fully answered interrogatories and requests for documents.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Respondent also noted that objections made by Petitioner were contrary to the court\u2019s ruling that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Petitioner had waived all objections by not objecting to Respondent\u2019s first discovery requests.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">On April 27, 1999 Respondent moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s complaint with prejudice because Petitioner had not complied with the court\u2019s order compelling discovery and had not complied with the case event schedule deadlines.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Petitioner opposed the motion by memorandum dated May 4,1999. On May 6,1999 the trial court, Judge Haley, agreed with Respondent and by letter ruling granted Respondent\u2019s motion, making the following findings:<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">1. Plaintiff violated this Court\u2019s April 16, 1999, order by-failing to fully answer Defendant\u2019s first interrogatories and requests for production of documents no later than April 12, 1999; Plaintiff did not provide complete answers; Plaintiff asserted objections when the Court had already ruled all objections were waived; and Plaintiff has, to date, still not fully answered Defendant\u2019s interrogatories;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">2. Plaintiff has failed to meet Civil Case Scheduling deadlines by failing to disclose possible primary witnesses, which were due April 5, 1999; by failing to timely file a Confirmation of Joinder which was due September 8, 1998; and by failing to file a Joint Status Report by April 19, 1999, deadline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">3. The court has considered lesser sanctions of terms and exclusion of testimony, but has determined that dismissal of Plaintiff\u2019s complaint with prejudice is the only appropriate remedy given the terms of the Court\u2019s April 16, 1999, order, and Plaintiff\u2019s repeated and continuing violation of that order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration and an alternative motion to vacate the dismissal order.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> On December 2, 1999 Judge Haley issued a letter ruling denying the motions.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>On December 30, 1999 Petitioner appealed the May 6, 1999 order and the December 2, 1999 letter ruling to the Court of Appeals, Division One, which, in an unpublished opinion, affirmed the trial court.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered dismissal because Petitioner failed to provide adequate answers to Respondent\u2019s discovery requests, Petitioner\u2019s actions substantially prejudiced Respondent in its ability to prepare for trial, and lesser sanctions would not cure such prejudice or advance the purposes of discovery.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The court also concluded that the trial court correctly denied Petitioner\u2019s motion for CR 60 relief, holding that KCLR does not implicitly require oral argument before the court may rule on a dispositive motion.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\">Petitioner filed this petition for review on March 7, 2001 which we granted on September 7, 2001.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The abuse of discretion standard governs review of sanctions for noncompliance with discovery orders.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> \u201c[A] trial court has broad discretion as to the choice of sanctions for violation of a discovery order.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018 [D] iscretionary determination should not be disturbed on appeal except on a clear showing of abuse of discretion, that is, discretion manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>grounds, or for untenable reasons.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> \u201c[The trial court\u2019s] reasons should, typically, be clearly stated on the record so that meaningful review can be had on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> A motion for reconsideration and motion to vacate a dismissal are to be decided by the trial court in exercise of its discretion and its decision will be overturned only if the court abused its discretion.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">\n<em>Dismissal with Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">A significant issue before this court is whether the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing Petitioner\u2019s complaint as a sanction for violation of discovery orders. In this case, the order setting civil case schedule provided that the trial court \u201cmay\u201d impose sanctions set forth in KCLR 4(g) and CR 37 for failure to comply with the order.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> KCLR 4(g) reads:<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">(1) Failure to comply with the Case Schedule may be grounds for imposition of sanctions, including <em>dismissal, </em>or terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">(2) The Court, on its own initiative or on motion of a party, may order an attorney or party to show cause why sanctions or terms should not be imposed for failure to comply with the Case Schedule established by these rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">(3) If the Court finds that an attorney or party has failed to comply with the Case Schedule and has no reasonable excuse, the Court. . . may impose such other sanctions as justice requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>CR 37(b)(2) sets out sanctions a court may impose for failure to comply with a court order, providing in pertinent part the following:<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-3\">(2) <em>Sanctions by Court in Which Action Is Pending. </em>If a party . . . fails to obey an order . . . made under section (a) [Order to Compel] of this rule . . . the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\">(C) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or <em>dismissing </em>the action or proceedings or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient partyf.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The law is well settled in this state concerning dismissal of a complaint as a sanction for discovery abuse. \u201cUnder CR 41(b), a trial court has the authority to dismiss an action for noncompliance with a court order or court rules.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t is the general policy of Washington courts not to resort to dismissal lightly.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> When a trial court imposes dismissal or default in a proceeding as a sanction for violation of a discovery order, it must be apparent from the record that (1) the party\u2019s refusal to obey the discovery order was willful or deliberate, (2) the party\u2019s actions substantially prejudiced the opponent\u2019s ability to prepare for trial, and (3) the trial court explicitly considered whether a lesser sanction would probably have sufficed.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> A party\u2019s disregard of a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>order without reasonable excuse or justification is deemed willful.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\">\n<em>Sequence of Dates and Events</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The following chart lists in sequence pertinent dates and events in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\"><em>March 31, 1998 </em>Summons and complaint issued and filed by Petitioner Kathy Rivers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGE\">Order setting case scheduling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGT\"><em>February 9, 1999 </em>Respondent Fairweather Masonry Company served first interrogatories and request for production of documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKr\"><em>March 8, 1999 </em>Respondent reminded Petitioner of deadlines and asked to schedule a KCLR 37 conference if discovery responses not served by March 11, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO7y\"><em>March 9, 1999 </em>Petitioner by letter asked Respondent to agree to extension of two weeks for service of her discovery responses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkS\"><em>March 10, 1999 </em>Respondent agreed to grant Petitioner extension until March 25, 1999 for service of discovery answers on condition that the primary witness list be served by April 5, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6i\"><em>March 11, 1999 </em>Original deadline for discovery responses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A72\">Judge Donald D.

Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Petitioner principally argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it dismissed her complaint because of her failure to comply with the April 16, 1999 order to compel which required compliance by April 12, 1999.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> She contends she could not have willfully violated the express terms of the order to compel production of discovery by April 12, 1999 and to file a joint status report by April 19, 1999 because those deadlines had already passed when she received the order to compel compliance on April 20,1999.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> She maintains that consequently such failure to provide notice and an opportunity to respond violates fundamental fairness and due process.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">In response, Respondent asserts that Petitioner\u2019s argument ignores the fact that the court\u2019s order of dismissal took into consideration her counsel\u2019s affidavit which asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the court to extend the answer deadline to April 12,1999.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Respondent contends that failure of counsel for Petitioner to comply with her own requested deadline of April 12,1999 constituted a willful refusal to obey the April 16, 1999 discovery order.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\">Respondent further argues that Petitioner willfully disobeyed the court\u2019s order to compel compliance by her failure to adequately respond even after she received the order on April 20, 1999.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> It notes that Petitioner\u2019s responses on April 21, 1999 and April 22, 1999 still did not provide adequate responses to interrogatories concerning damages, expert witnesses, and lay witnesses.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Respondent also notes that, instead of answering interrogatories, Petitioner merely stated objections.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The Court of Appeals agreed with Respondent and concluded that Petitioner\u2019s \u201cwillful disregard of the order to compel is evidenced less by her failure to respond by April 12 than by her failure to respond fully and without objection.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s order to compel compliance required Petitioner to <em>fully answer </em>Respondent\u2019s first interrogatories and request for documents without objections.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Despite that order, she continued to object to interrogatories instead of providing complete answers.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Many of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>answers were evasive and incomplete.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> She did not provide full answers to standard interrogatories concerning expert witnesses.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> For example, interrogatory number 3 asked Petitioner to identify all expert witnesses expected to testify and the substance of their opinions. Petitioner answered in general terms, stating that she expected to call vocational and employment experts regarding women in the trades, and reserved the right to call unnamed health professionals, including a psychiatrist.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> None of the experts, except one she specifically identified by name, had formed an opinion about the case.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">The Court of Appeals correctly pointed out that with respect to the joint status report, Petitioner\u2019s duty to file the report arose not from the April 16,1999 order to compel, but from an independent obligation under the March 31, 1998 scheduling order.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Petitioner had notice since March 31, 1998 of her obligation to file a joint status report by the April 19, 1999 deadline. This contradicts Petitioner\u2019s contention that it was impossible for her to comply with the April 19, 1999 deadline because she did not receive the order to compel compliance until April 20, 1999.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Petitioner attributes her failure to file a joint status report to Respondent\u2019s refusal to sign her proposed report.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> She claims this demonstrated impediment by Respondent and not efforts by her to avoid discovery obligations.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> However, under KCLR 4.2(a)(3), as the Court of Appeals pointed out, when Respondent did not cooperate in completing the report form (by not signing it), Petitioner nevertheless should have filed the form noting the parties\u2019 disagreement over discovery responses.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Instead Petitioner disregarded KCLR 4.2(a)(3) and did not file any status report.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\">Petitioner does not assign error to the trial court\u2019s finding that she failed to disclose possible primary witnesses by April 5, 1999 and failed to file a confirmation of joinder by September 8, 1998. Because these findings are unchallenged, they are considered verities on appeal.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Under KCLR 4(g) a court \u201cmay impose such sanctions as it deems appropriate for violation of its scheduling orders to effectively manage its caseload, minimize backlog, and conserve scarce judicial resources.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Petitioner also claims the trial court abused its discretion by not considering her explanation for delay in submitting answers to discovery.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> But the trial court explicitly stated it considered Petitioner\u2019s memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss in which counsel stated her reasons for delay.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Even if her excuses were reasonable, Petitioner still did not explain why her responses to Respondent\u2019s interroga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>tories were incomplete.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> In a similar case, the plaintiffs in <em>Anderson v. Mohundro </em>inexplicably failed to furnish complete and meaningful answers to interrogatories despite a court order. In affirming dismissal by the trial court, the Court of Appeals held that failure to comply with the order to compel without reasonable excuse \u201c \u2018impels a conclusion that the refusal was willful.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The ruling by the Court of Appeals in this case, as in <em>Anderson, </em>is consistent with CR 37(a)(3), which allows the court to treat an evasive or incomplete answer as a \u201c \u2018failure to answer.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Petitioner Rivers does not explain why she did not provide complete responses. Instead she asks the court to focus only on her reasons for delay in providing timely responses to discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Contrary to Petitioner\u2019s assertion, there is substantial evidence in the record to justify the trial court\u2019s finding of \u201crepeated and continuing\u201d violation of the May 16, 1999 order to compel and violation of the case event schedule.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\n<em>Prejudice to Ability of Opponent to Prepare for Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Petitioner contends the findings in the record do not support prejudice to Respondent. Respondent and the Court of Appeals disagree. <em>Burnet v. Spokane Ambulance </em>states that reasons for a court to choose sanctions for violation of a discovery order \u201cshould, typically, be clearly stated on the record so that meaningful review can be had on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The court then stated that when a trial court \u201c \u2018chooses one of the harsher remedies ... it must be <em>apparent from the record </em>that the trial court <em>explicitly </em>considered whether a lesser sanction would probably have sufficed,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>and whether it found that the disobedient party\u2019s refusal to obey a discovery order was willful or deliberate and substantially prejudiced the opponent\u2019s ability to prepare for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Petitioner claims the record does not indicate that the trial court <em>explicitly </em>considered prejudice to the defense. She, however, presents no adequate argument to support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\">The order to dismiss stated the court considered Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss, Petitioner\u2019s memorandum in response, and recited specific findings that Petitioner failed to meet the civil case schedule and to comply with the order to compel compliance.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> The record does not indicate that the court actually used the words \u201cFairweather Masonry Company was prejudiced,\u201d even though the court referred to numerous missed discovery and case schedule deadlines and violation of a court order which warned Petitioner of dismissal if she did not comply with those deadlines. Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss noted that Petitioner\u2019s inadequate answers and unexcused delays had left Respondent ill prepared for a trial which was scheduled within about three months.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded it is apparent from the record that Petitioner\u2019s failure to disclose basic facts substantially prejudiced Respondent\u2019s ability to prepare for trial.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> However, that conclusion was not affirmatively stated on the record by the trial court, as required by our decision in <em>Burnet.</em><footnotemark><em>88</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\n<em>Consideration of Less Harsh Sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Petitioner argues the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered dismissal without considering on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>record a less severe sanction that could have cured or compensated for the effects of her discovery failings.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> She bases her argument on <em>Burnet v. Spokane Ambulance, </em>in which a trial court excluded the plaintiff\u2019s negligent credentialing claim after finding the pleadings and the responses to discovery gave insufficient notice of the claim.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court\u2019s ruling that the claim was not properly pleaded. It nevertheless affirmed the trial court, restating the primary issue as a problem of compliance with a scheduling order.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> On review, this court reversed, finding an abuse of discretion by the trial court in imposing severe sanctions without considering on the record less severe alternative sanctions.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The court in <em>Burnet </em>held that sanctions imposed by a trial court is a matter of judicial discretion to be exercised in light of the particular circumstances,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> but that the sanction imposed should be proportional to the nature of the discovery violation and the surrounding circumstances.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> That decision establishes a gauge for determining disproportionate sanctions. The court stated that even if the trial court had considered other options, the sanctions were still too severe considering the length of time (18 months) before trial was scheduled to begin,<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> the severe injury to plaintiff, and the absence of a finding that the plaintiffs willfully disregarded a trial court order.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In this case, the order of dismissal signed by the trial court stated the court had considered lesser sanctions of terms and exclusion of testimony, but concluded dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>was the only appropriate remedy considering its order to compel compliance and Petitioner\u2019s repeated and continuing violation of that order.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concurred, finding the trial court\u2019s conclusion reasonable.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\">The trial court in this case found that Petitioner willfully disregarded trial court orders. The Court of Appeals agreed. The trial court on the record did consider lesser sanctions, but only by stating in the order, \u201cThe court has considered lesser sanctions of terms and exclusion of testimony, but has determined that dismissal of [Petitioner\u2019s] complaint with prejudice is the only appropriate remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The record in this case indicates that Petitioner manifested a somewhat casual disregard for the rules of discovery and her obligation to comply with the orders of the court under those rules.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Whether she should be subject to the drastic sanction of dismissal cannot be determined under the limited language used by the trial court in its order of dismissal. Before resorting to the sanction of dismissal, the trial court must clearly indicate on the record that it has considered less harsh sanctions under CR 37. Its failure to do so constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">\n<em>CR 60 Motion for Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Under CR 60(b)(1), a court may relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for irregularity in obtaining the judgment or order.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Petitioner asserts that there was an irregularity when the trial court ordered dismissal on a dispositive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>motion without oral argument because the inverse of KCLR 7(b)(2), which provides that nondispositive motions may be decided without oral argument, implicitly required oral argument before ruling on the dispositive motion in this case.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Petitioner does not adequately support her contention by argument or citation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\">In contrast, Respondent correctly notes that oral argument is not prescribed for motions under CR 37 for sanctions for discovery abuse or under KCLR 4 for violation of a court\u2019s scheduling order.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> It also points out that \u201coral argument [on a motion] is not a due process right.\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> \u201cDue process does not require any particular form or procedure . . . .\u201d \u201c[It] requires only \u2018that a party receive proper notice of proceedings and an opportunity to present [its] position before a competent tribunal.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">In this case Petitioner was accorded due process. Prior to rendering judgment on Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court considered Petitioner\u2019s memorandum in opposition.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the trial court did not violate Petitioner\u2019s due process right in exercising its discretion to decide the motion to dismiss without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">\n<em>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">A significant issue before this court is whether the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing Petitioner\u2019s complaint as a sanction for violation of discovery orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The law is well settled in this state concerning dismissal of a complaint as a sanction for discovery abuse. When a trial court imposes dismissal or default in a proceeding as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>sanction for violation of a discovery order, it must be apparent from the record that (1) the party\u2019s refusal to obey the discovery order was willful or deliberate, (2) the party\u2019s actions substantially prejudiced the opponent\u2019s ability to prepare for trial, and (3) the trial court explicitly considered whether a less severe sanction would probably have sufficed. A party\u2019s disregard of a court order without reasonable excuse or justification is deemed willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\">The Court of Appeals concluded that Petitioner\u2019s \u201cwillful disregard of the order to compel is evidenced less by her failure to respond by April 12 than by her failure to respond fully and without objection.\u201d The trial court\u2019s order to compel required Petitioner to <em>fully answer </em>Respondent\u2019s first interrogatories and request for documents without objections. Despite that order, she continued to object to interrogatories instead of providing complete answers. Many of her answers were evasive and incomplete. She did not provide full answers to standard interrogatories concerning expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The record does not indicate that the court actually used the words \u201cFairweather Masonry Company was prejudiced,\u201d even though the court referred to numerous missed discovery and case schedule deadlines and violation of a court order which warned Petitioner of dismissal if she did not comply with those deadlines. Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss noted that Petitioner\u2019s inadequate answers and unexcused delays had left Respondent ill prepared for a trial which was scheduled within about three months. The Court of Appeals concluded it was apparent from the record that Petitioner\u2019s failure to disclose basic facts substantially prejudiced Respondent\u2019s ability to prepare for trial. However, that conclusion was not affirmatively stated on the record by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Petitioner argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered dismissal without considering on the record a less severe sanction that could have cured or compensated for the effects of her discovery failings. Although the trial court in this case stated that it considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>lesser sanctions of terms and exclusion of testimony before concluding that dismissal was the only appropriate remedy, it did not make a sufficient record before reaching that conclusion as required by our decision in <em>Burnet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Imposition of sanctions by a trial court is a matter of judicial discretion to be exercised in light of the particular circumstances, but the sanction imposed should be balanced against the nature of the discovery violation and the surrounding circumstances. The circumstances in this case might well justify the sanction of dismissal imposed against Petitioner. Petitioner was granted several deadline extensions for discovery but failed to comply with those extended deadlines. Petitioner failed to comply with trial court discovery orders. Under CR 37, the trial court might impose the sanction of dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s complaint, but the court must explain on the record that it has considered less harsh alternative sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Oral argument is not prescribed for motions under CR 37 for sanctions for discovery abuse or under KCLR 4 for violation of a court\u2019s scheduling order. Oral argument on a motion is not a due process right. Due process does not require any particular form or procedure. It requires only that a party receive proper notice of proceedings and an opportunity to present its position before a competent tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In this case Petitioner was accorded due process. Prior to rendering judgment on her motion to dismiss, the trial court considered Petitioner\u2019s memorandum in opposition. The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the trial court did not violate Petitioner\u2019s due process right in exercising its discretion to decide the motion to dismiss without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">We reverse the Court of Appeals, Division One, which affirmed the order of the King County Superior Court dismissing with prejudice Petitioner Kathy Rivers\u2019 gender discrimination complaint against Respondent Fairweather Masonry Company because she did not comply with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>order of the trial court directing her compliance with a discovery order and case event schedule deadlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\">We remand to the trial court for a new determination whether the complaint should be dismissed, with specific findings on the record (1) whether Petitioner\u2019s failure to obey discovery orders and case event schedule deadlines was willful or deliberate; (2) whether Petitioner\u2019s actions substantially prejudiced Respondent\u2019s ability to prepare for trial; and (3) whether the court considered less severe sanctions than dismissal before resorting to the drastic remedy of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Alexander, C.J., and Johnson, Madsen, Ireland, Bridge, and Owens, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-10\"> Clerk\u2019s Papers at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b734-4\"> <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b734-5\"> <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\"> Default judgments were entered against all defendants except Fairweather Masonry Company which remains as the sole respondent before this court. <em>See </em>Clerk\u2019s Papers at 132.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\"> Clerk\u2019s Papers at 4-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">\n<em> Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b734-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 379.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b734-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at 19-67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b734-11\">\n<em> Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b734-12\"> CR 33(a) reads in pertinent part, \u201cThe party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers, and objections if any, within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>30 days after the service of the interrogatories ....

Further, I concur that the sanction of dismissal should be vacated. I write separately to express my belief that dismissal would be unjust. While the trial court has considerable discretion, under the facts of this case a less harsh sanction is clearly required.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Kathy Rivers served her complaint upon the Defendant, Washington State Conference of Mason Contractors, on March 31, 1998. The Defendant waited more than nine months to begin discovery, serving its first interrogatories on February 9, 1999, approximately six months before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Unfortunately, counsel was ill and her client was unavailable. Two days before answers were due, Rivers\u2019s attorney sought and received a two week extension. On March 25, 1999, the agreed extended deadline, Rivers\u2019s attorney asked for another extension, which was refused by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Defense counsel moved for an order to compel Rivers to answer. Without oral argument, on April 16,1999, the trial judge signed an order prepared by defense counsel. It stated, \u201c[t]o encourage plaintiff\u2019s future compliance with the rules of civil procedure and Case Schedule, the Court will. . . dismiss plaintiff\u2019s case with prejudice if plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>misses another discovery deadline.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 159. Such an order is inconsistent with our jurisprudence. Dismissal of a complaint or answer is an extreme sanction not available merely to encourage compliance with a case schedule. Such a sanction is reserved for discovery violations which are willful or deliberate, when the violation substantially prejudices the opponent, and a lesser sanction would not suffice. <em>See Burnet v. Spokane Ambulance, </em>131 Wn.2d 484, 497, 933 P.2d 1036 (1997); <em>Snedigar v. Hodderson, </em>53 Wn. App. 476, 487, 768 P.2d 1 (1989), <em>aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>114 Wn.2d 153, 786 P.2d 781 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">In addition, the April 16, 1999 order directed Rivers to comply by April 12,1999, a date which had passed four days before the order was entered and eight days before the order was received by Rivers\u2019s counsel. Rivers\u2019s counsel attempted compliance the next day, April 21, 1999, and although it appears the answers were incomplete, counsel later submitted supplemental responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Any trial court\u2019s order directing compliance, which requires time travel in order to comply with it, under threat of dismissal, is presumptively beyond the reasonable counsel\u2019s ability to obey and deserves scrutiny. A client should not be penalized under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Merely 20 days later, following another 6 day motion without oral argument, the trial court dismissed Plaintiff\u2019s complaint with prejudice for violation of the April 16, 1999 order. Again, such an order is inconsistent with our jurisprudence. In addition to the factors enunciated by the majority, we should also consider when <em>dismissal </em>is an appropriate factor. The Court of Appeals rightly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">[When] a court has found that a party has acted in willful and deliberate disregard of reasonable and necessary court orders and the efficient administration of justice and has prejudiced the other side by doing so, dismissal has been upheld as justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-8\"><em>Woodhead v. Disc. Waterbeds, Inc., </em>78 Wn. App. 125, 130, 896 P.2d 66 (1995). By no account can the April 16, 1999 order be found reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Further, while the trial court stated that it had considered lesser sanctions and found them inadequate, our record is bare of reasoning that would allow us to review the trial court\u2019s reasoning. Because the case was summarily dismissed, we do not know if the trial court considered the reasons for the delay. We do not know if the trial court considered the logistical difficulties inherent in complying with an order requiring actions in the past. We have no reason to believe the failure to comply was willful. Nor do we know if the Defendant was actually prejudiced. And we do not know why lesser sanctions were deemed inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">What we do know is that 102 days before trial and without having counsel appear personally before him, the trial judge dismissed Plaintiff\u2019s complaint. We also know that this sanction was extreme, especially without specific findings justifying it. Accordingly, I concur in this Court\u2019s opinion, I concur in this Court\u2019s order that there must be a new determination of appropriate sanction, and I concur with this Court that the reasoning must be on the record. I urge a lesser sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Sanders, J., concurs with Chambers, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
