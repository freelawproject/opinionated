We hold under the facts of this case that the title insurer should not avoid liability through the doctrine of equitable subrogation because the title insurer had actual knowledge of a prior judgment lien and failed to disclose such a lien to its insured before issuance of the title policy. The Court of Appeals\u2019 decision is reversed, and the trial court\u2019s judgment is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">The pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute. On December 5, 1995, Kenneth and Yun Ok Chang bought a home in Yakima for their daughter and son-in-law, Sharon and Stanley Lee. Of the $165,000 purchase price, $130,000 was financed by a promissory note from Sterling Trust Company (Sterling) in the Changs\u2019 name at an interest rate of 10.5 percent per annum, maturing in six years. The promissory note was secured by a deed of trust dated December 5, 1995, and was recorded on December 11, 1995 in Yakima County Auditor\u2019s file number 3118149. Yakima Title &amp; Escrow (Yakima Title) recorded the statutory warranty deed in favor of the Changs and the deed of trust was executed at the direction of Sterling Escrow Company. The Lees moved into the home and made payments owed by the Changs on the Sterling loan as each became due.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Meanwhile, on April 28, 1997, Hu Hyun Kim obtained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>default judgment against the Lees in King County Superior Court for failure to comply with discovery orders. Judgment was entered for a total of $83,565.37. The judgment was recorded in Yakima County on May 16, 1997, under auditor\u2019s file number 7010775.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">On December 22, 1997, two years after purchasing the home, the Changs quitclaimed an undivided one-half interest in the property to the Lees. The Changs and the Lees filed an excise tax affidavit claiming the one-half interest as a gift to claim the gift exemption. The home was still subject to the loan from Sterling\u2019s deed of trust. Subsequently, the Lees sought their own financing in order to take advantage of lower interest rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In March 1998, the Lees procured financing through Pioneer National Bank (Pioneer Bank) to pay off the underlying deed of trust granted by the Changs to Sterling. As part of the deal, the Changs agreed to quitclaim their remaining undivided one-half interest to the Lees in consideration of love and affection. The quitclaim deed was signed on April 10, 1998 and recorded on April 28, 1998. Yakima Title\u2019s employee, Rae Dawn Hawley, signed a real estate tax affidavit in which the Changs and Lees were not subject to pay excise tax by claiming that \u201cgrantor gifts property which has no underlying debt.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">On April 20, 1998, the Lees executed their own promissory note and deed of trust to Pioneer Bank with an interest rate of 6.75 percent per annum, maturing in 30 years. All of the Lees\u2019 loan proceeds were used to pay off Sterling\u2019s deed of trust, plus settlement charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">On April 28,1998, a year after Kim had recorded the King County judgment in Yakima County, Pioneer Bank recorded its deed of trust and the second quitclaim deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Yakima Title issued a commitment for title insurance insuring Pioneer Bank\u2019s first lien position effective March 16,1998, and updated it on April 22,1998. In conducting its title search, Yakima Title failed to discover Kim\u2019s judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>lien. Thus, the commitment for title insurance did not mention Kim\u2019s judgment against the Lees.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">On June 17, 1998, an assignment of Pioneer Bank\u2019s deed of trust to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. was recorded by Yakima Title.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Once Kim learned of the new loan by Pioneer Bank, Kim\u2019s counsel informed Yakima Title of Kim\u2019s judgment, its date and recording number, and that Kim\u2019s judgment was now the first lien on the Yakima property, on July 13, 1998. Yakima Title\u2019s agent responded that he had not found an abstract with the Yakima Superior Court Clerk\u2019s Office and believed that Kim could not have held a perfected judgment lien. Later the same day, Kim\u2019s counsel confirmed the telephone conversation with Yakima Title and sent copies to Pioneer Bank and Kim.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">On July 16, 1998, an assignment of deed of trust was amended to show PHH Mortgage Services Corporation (PHH) as an assignee; it was re-recorded by Yakima Title.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">On July 17, 1998, Yakima Title issued an ATLA (American Land Title Association) title policy with PHH as the insured, showing the Lees as owners of the property and Pioneer\u2019s deed of trust in first position, with no mention of Kim\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">On December 10, 1998, Kim\u2019s counsel notified PHH\u2019s counsel of Kim\u2019s judgment lien, of which they had been unaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">On June 21, 1999, Kim\u2019s counsel notified Yakima Title that Kim would begin execution on the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> PHH had previously notified Yakima Title, on May 10,1999, that Kim would execute on his judgment lien as soon as possible. Yakima Title, as the agent for the policy issuer, accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>this notice as a tender of defense of PHH\u2019s lien position.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">On September 9, 1999, a writ of execution was issued by King County Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"At\">\n<em>King County Superior Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">At Kim\u2019s request, King County Superior Court issued a writ of execution on the Lees\u2019 real property in Yakima. Yakima Title moved to intervene and to quash the execution sale. Kim opposed these motions and filed a motion for CR 11 sanctions against Yakima Title. On October 21,1999, the trial court granted Yakima Title\u2019s motion to intervene, denied Kim\u2019s motion for CR 11 sanctions, and denied Yakima Title\u2019s motion to quash. Yakima Title appealed the denial of the motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\n<em>Court of Appeals, Division One</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 decision reversed the King County Superior Court\u2019s order denying Yakima Title\u2019s motion to establish as a first lien on defendant Lee\u2019s real property, prior to the previously filed judgment against Lee and in favor of Kim, a deed of trust given by Lee to Yakima Title\u2019s assignee PHH.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Kim now seeks this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">Determination of a proper standard of review of whether equitable subrogation should be applied to give a mortgage lender first lien position over a prior perfected judgment creditor rests upon whether the question presented for review is one of fact, one of law, or a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Rasmussen v. Employment Sec. Dep\u2019t, </em>98 Wn.2d 846, 850, 658 P.2d 1240 (1983). Since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>pertinent facts of this case are not in dispute, the lien priority of PHH over a prior perfected lien creditor is a question of law, which is subject to de novo review. <em>Millay v. Cam, </em>135 Wn.2d 193, 198, 955 P.2d 791 (1998) (citing <em>Medcalf v. Dep\u2019t of Licensing, </em>133 Wn.2d 290, 297, 944 P.2d 1014 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Recording Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Under Washington\u2019s recording act, RCW 65.08.070, a subsequent mortgagee takes subject to any prior encumbrances of which the mortgagee has either actual or constructive knowledge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">The purpose of the recording statute is to make the deed first recorded superior to any outstanding unrecorded conveyance of the same property unless the mortgagee or purchaser had actual knowledge of the transfer not filed of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\"><em>Tacoma Hotel, Inc. v. Morrison &amp; Co., </em>193 Wash. 134, 140, 74 P.2d 1003 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Judgment attaches automatically as a lien upon the real estate of the judgment debtor. RCW 4.56.190. A superior court judgment becomes a perfected lien against the judgment debtor\u2019s real property from the time the judgment creditor records the judgment with the recording officer of the county where the property is located. RCW 6.13.090. <em>See In re Deal, </em>85 Wn. App. 580, 583, 933 P.2d 1084 (1997). Moreover, under the amendments to the law enacted by the 1999 Legislature, a judgment creditor is entitled to execute on the judgment debtor\u2019s equity in real estate, net of the homestead amount, less all liens and encumbrances senior to the creditor\u2019s judgment. RCW 6.13.010(3); Laws of 1999, ch. 403, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">In the instant case, when Kim\u2019s judgment was filed in Yakima County on May 16, 1997, it became a lien on the Lees\u2019 one-half interest in the Yakima property on December 22, 1997, the date the Lees acquired their one-half interest from the Changs. The Kim judgment lien attached to the entire Yakima property when the Changs conveyed their remaining one-half interest to the Lees by quitclaim deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>on April 10, 1998. Kim\u2019s judgment was perfected for almost a year before the Lees placed the Pioneer Bank deed of trust on the Yakima property. Once the Sterling deed of trust was paid, there were no liens on the Yakima property senior to Kim\u2019s judgment when the King County Superior Court issued its writ of execution in September 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Refinance</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Generally, when the doctrine of equitable subrogation applies, its effect is to restore the first lien position of the mortgage refinance lender. Grant S. Nelson &amp; Dale A. Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law \u00a7 10.6 (3d ed. 1993). In order for the doctrine of equitable subrogation to apply, the loan must be considered a refinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201crefinance\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">To finance again or anew; to pay off existing debts with funds secured from new debt; to extend the maturity date and/or increase the amount of an existing debt; to arrange for a new payment schedule. The discharge of an obligation with funds acquired through the creation of a new debt, often at a different interest rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1281 (6th ed. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>defines \u201crefinance\u201d as \u201cto renew or reorganize the financing of : provide capital for afresh : provide for (an outstanding indebtedness) by making another loan or a larger loan on fresh terms.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1908 (3d ed. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">In the present case, the Lees paid off the Changs\u2019 existing debt with funds secured from new debt incurred by the Lees. Although the borrowers are different parties, since they are family and the transfer of title from the Changs to the Lees was a gift, that fact should not preclude treatment of the new deed of trust as a refinance. The terms of the loan significantly changed, even though it was for the same collateral and the amount of the indebtedness did not change significantly. For instance, the interest rate was reduced from 10.5 percent to 6.75 percent and the maturity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>date was extended from 6 years to 30 years. These loan terms from Pioneer Bank were substantively different from the Changs\u2019 loan. The lower interest rate is of no prejudice to the judgment lienholder. However, the increase in term from 6 to 30 years is prejudicial should the judgment lien be subrogated to the new deed of trust.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Doctrine of Equitable Subrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u201cSubrogation is a consequence which equity attaches to certain conditions. It is not an absolute right, but one which depends upon the equities and attending facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Coy v. Raabe, </em>69 Wn.2d 346, 351, 418 P.2d 728 (1966). As the Court of Appeals noted, Washington has not yet adopted the doctrine of equitable subrogation; this is a matter of first impression in Washington. <em>Kim v. Lee, </em>102 Wn. App. 586, 592, 9 P.3d 245 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Subrogation is fundamentally an equitable concept designed \u201cto impose ultimate responsibility for a wrong or loss on the party who, in equity and good conscience, ought to bear it.\u201d <em>Mahler v. Szucs, </em>135 Wn.2d 398, 411, 957 P.2d 632 (1998) (subrogation in auto insurance context allows insurer to recover payments made to insured from third party tortfeasor). The doctrine of subrogation is not a fixed and inflexible rule of law or of equity. <em>Han v. United States, </em>944 F.2d 526, 529 (9th Cir. 1991). Generally, in federal courts, equity has acted only when legal remedies were inadequate. <em>Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, </em>359 U.S. 500, 508, 79 S. Ct. 948, 3 L. Ed. 2d 988 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u201cSubrogation is always liberally allowed in the interests of justice and equity.\u201d <em>J.D. O\u2019Malley &amp; Co. v. Lewis, </em>176 Wash. 194, 201, 28 P.2d 283 (1934) (agent paying on behalf of bonding company entitled to subrogation from third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>party obligated to reimburse the principal). However, in the real estate context, equitable subrogation has been traditionally invoked only to prevent unjust enrichment; equitable remedies are not granted where it would produce injustice. Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Mortgages \u00a7 7.6 cmt. fat 522 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">We adopt the principle of subrogation in the mortgage loan context as set forth in the <em>Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages </em>\u00a7 7.3, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">(a) If a senior mortgage is released of record and, as part of the same transaction, is replaced with a new mortgage, the latter mortgage retains the same priority as its predecessor, except</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">(1) to the extent that any change in the terms of the mortgage or the obligation it secures is materially prejudicial to the holder of a junior interest in the real estate, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">(2) to the extent that one who is protected by the recording act acquires an interest in the real estate at a time that the senior mortgage is not of record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">(b) If a senior mortgage or the obligation it secures is modified by the parties, the mortgage as modified retains priority as against junior interests in the real estate, except to the extent that the modification is materially prejudicial to the holders of such interests and is not within the scope of a reservation of right to modify as provided in subsection (c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Under the principles of replacement and modifications of mortgages in section 7.3, \u201c[t]he result is analogous to subrogation, and under this Restatement the requirements are essentially similar to those for subrogation.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Mortgages \u00a7 7.6 cmt. e at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Under the <em>Restatement, </em>a modification of a mortgage will ordinarily cause it to lose priority to junior interests to the extent that the modification is materially prejudicial to those interests. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7.3. Not all modifications will materially prejudice junior interests. For example, mortgagees commonly consent to an extension of the mortgage maturity date or to a rescheduling or \u201cstretching out\u201d of installment payments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7.3 cmt. c. Absent an increase in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>principal amount or the interest rate of the mortgage, such modifications normally do not jeopardize the mortgagee\u2019s priority as against intervening interests. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In the present case, the modifications made to the loan from the Changs to the Lees were not merely an extension of the maturity date or stretching out installment payments of the existing mortgage; rather, it was a new mortgage and the change was from a 6-year maturity date to a 30-year maturity date. These modifications were materially prejudicial to Kim.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Existing mortgages replaced by new mortgages do not always fall within the rules of replacement and modification of senior mortgages. However, in this case, because the intent of the Kims and the Lees was for the Lees to obtain the home, the rules of replacement and modification should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Actual notice of an intervening judgment lien often bars subrogation. <em>See generally Dodge City of Spartanburg, Inc. v. Jones, </em>317 S.C. 491, 454 S.E.2d 918, 920-21 (1995). When Kim\u2019s counsel contacted Yakima Title on July 17, 1998, it received actual notice of Kim\u2019s judgment lien before the title policy was issued. In spite of this knowledge, Yakima Title chose not to disclose Kim\u2019s judgment lien to the insured. Yakima Title concedes it missed the recorded judgment. Yakima Title recorded an assignment of the Pioneer Bank deed of trust to PHH and issued its title insurance policy to PHH.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The <em>Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages </em>has adopted the view that, \u201csubrogation <em>can </em>be granted even if the payor had actual knowledge of the intervening interest; the payor\u2019s notice, actual or constructive, is not necessarily relevant.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Mortgages \u00a7 7.6 cmt. e at 520 (1997) (emphasis added). However, allowing subrogation in the face of actual knowledge would discount the purpose of the recording statute, RCW 65.08.070. The purpose of the recording statute is to make the deed first recorded superior to any outstanding unrecorded conveyance of the same property unless the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>gagee or purchaser had actual knowledge of the transfer not filed of record. <em>Tacoma Hotel, </em>193 Wash, at 140. Further, allowing subrogation in this case would ignore the interests of equity and justice established by Washington jurisprudence. <em>Mahler, </em>135 Wn.2d at 412. Equitable remedies should not be granted where it would result in injustice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">In the <em>Coy </em>case, the title company failed to ascertain the existence of a lease and option to purchase regarding property purchased at a tax sale. This Court held that the purchasers, their lender, and their insuring title company were all placed on constructive notice of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the property. <em>Coy, </em>69 Wn.2d at 349.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The purchaser and title insurer nonetheless claimed to be subrogated to the federal government\u2019s tax claims, which they had paid. This Court determined that the purchasers could claim a subrogation interest, but the title company could not, since the purchasers were \u201cbona fide purchasers to the extent that they were entitled to rely upon others who were paid to give an expert opinion and insure title,\u201d while the title company was \u201cengaged in giving those expert opinions for a consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350. This Court ultimately held that it was \u201cnot the province of the court to relieve a title insurance company of its contractual obligation\u201d to insure title. <em>Id. </em>at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The role of the title insurer is to insure title; \u201c[e]ither they insure or they don\u2019t.\u201d <em>Coy, </em>69 Wn.2d at 351. Generally, the role of the title insurer is relied upon by the lender, judgment creditor, and other lienors. Just as a lender relies on the title insurer to commit that title is vested in its borrower, subject only to known exclusions, judgment creditors and other lienors rely on title insurers to prevent a debtor from conveying real property without first satisfying a perfected lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In the instant case, legal remedies and equity suggest that the loss should fall on the title company rather than the innocent judgment creditor. As in <em>Coy, </em>this case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>precipitated by the title company\u2019s negligence and failure to acknowledge the lien. Yakima Title not only failed to discover Kim\u2019s judgment lien when it conducted its title search for the Lees\u2019 loan from Pioneer, as in the <em>Coy </em>case, but also failed to acknowledge the lien when it had actual knowledge of it from Kim\u2019s counsel. With the information at hand, Yakima Title still issued the title policy insuring PHH\u2019s first lien position. Applying equitable subrogation to extend in favor of Yakima Title would result in alleviating Yakima Title of its own negligence and complete disregard of the actual notice at the expense of an innocent judgment creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Under Washington\u2019s recording act, from the time the judgment creditor records the judgment with the recording officer of the county where the property is located, the judgment attaches automatically. RCW 4.56.190 and 6.13.090. Since Kim\u2019s judgment was perfected and attached almost a year before the Lees placed the Pioneer Bank deed of trust, the senior judgment lien under the statute was Kim\u2019s judgment lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">This financing arrangement falls under the definition of a refinance. Although the doctrine of equitable subrogation may be applied, this case is controlled by <em>Coy, </em>69 Wn.2d 346, which allows equitable subrogation to a bona fide purchaser (or refinance lender) to the extent they were entitled to rely on others to guarantee title. However, equitable subrogation should not apply in favor of a title company which guaranteed title while on constructive or actual notice of a prior judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Under a contractual obligation, Yakima Title was negligent in giving its expert opinion and insuring title. The doctrine of subrogation does not apply to relieve a title insurance company of its contractual obligation because a title insurance company not only receives consideration for rendering an expert opinion, but also for acting as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>insurer of its accuracy. <em>Coy, </em>69 Wn.2d at 351. Yakima Title failed to discover a recorded and perfected judgment lien and upon receiving actual notice, failed to disclose or remedy the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The title insurer should not be able to invoke the doctrine of equitable subrogation to be relieved from a contractual obligation when the title insurer had constructive and actual notice of a prior judgment and when the new obligation prejudices lienholders who would be junior by subrogation. The case is reversed, and the trial court\u2019s judgment is reinstated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Smith, Johnson, Bridge, and Owens, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\"> When Em\u2019s judgment lien was recorded in Yakima County on May 16, 1997, Washington case law held that any deed of trust encumbering property after entry of default judgment, but before executing, was to be counted as part of the \u201cliens and encumbrances\u201d under RCW 6.13.010(3) before arriving at a net property value upon which a judgment creditor could execute. <em>Robin L.

The doctrine of equitable subrogation does not apply to the Chang/Sterling Escrow Company and Lee/ Pioneer National Bank transaction. The transaction involved different mortgagors and different mortgagees; it cannot be described as a simple refinance and does not satisfy the requirements of <em>Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages </em>\u00a7 7.3 (1997).

Its analysis begins on an incoherent note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">This is a discretionary review of a Court of Appeals\u2019 decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>which extended to Yakima Title &amp; Escrow Company the first lienholder position of its insured, ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Majority at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">No, Yakima Title is an insurance company which intervened in this action to defend the asserted legal right of its insured, PHH, to first lien priority over judgment creditor Hu Hyun Kim. Yakima Title does not now, nor has it ever, held a lien on the property, first or otherwise. Rather under the terms and conditions of its policy Yakima Title owed PHH a defense, and this action evidences the fact that it is providing one. If Yakima Title prevails, judgment creditor Kim would be equitably subrogated to PHH\u2019s first lien position. If, on the other hand, the equitable subrogation claim fails, PHH may have a valid claim against its insurer, Yakima Title, because it insured against all claims on the title not excepted\u2014and Kim\u2019s judgment was not. But that is their problem, not ours. Our problem is to decide whether Kim\u2019s judgment (subsequent to the original deed of trust but prior to its replacement) should take precedence over PHH\u2019s subsequently recorded deed of trust. Since the original deed of trust was recorded before the judgment lien, it is argued the replacement deed of trust should relate back to the date the original deed of trust was recorded for the purpose of establishing its priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In any case, however, the fact that PHH had title insurance is no more relevant to this case than the availability of automobile insurance in the typical personal injury case. And whether Yakima Title negligently failed to except a previously filed judgment from coverage is also quite beside the point; it is the consequence of that prior filing which is here at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The general rule is aptly expressed in Washington\u2019s recording act, RCW 65.08.070, that first in time is first in right. 18 William B. Stoebuck, Washington Practice: Real Estate: Transactions \u00a7 17.21, at 311 (1995). That is to say that the first instrument recorded (or judgment filed) takes precedence over subsequent filings and recordings. The issue here, however, is whether there should be an excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>tion to that rule and, if so, the contours of that exception. I have no quarrel with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the doctrine of equitable subrogation provides a legitimate basis for such an exception and that the nature of that exception is described in <em>Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages </em>\u00a7 7.3, at 472 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">(a) If a senior mortgage is released of record and, as part of the same transaction, is replaced with a new mortgage, the latter mortgage retains the same priority as its predecessor, except</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">(1) to the extent that any change in the terms of the mortgage or the obligation it secures is materially prejudicial to the holder of a junior interest in the real estate, ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The majority, however, finds the exception inapplicable because (1) <em>Yakima Title </em>had \u201cactual notice of Kim\u2019s judgment lien before the <em>title policy </em>was issued,\u201d majority at 90 (emphasis added), and (2) Kim would be prejudiced if the doctrine were applied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I find the first point not only misleading but irrelevant; whereas the second point is simply wrong.

Second, there is no claim here that lienholder PHH or Pioneer had actual notice prior to making its loan. Majority at 84. And third, not that it matters, Yakima Title did not have actual notice until <em>after </em>it had issued its March 16, 1998 commitment to insure Pioneer Bank\u2019s first lien position in any event. Majority at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-18\">1. Equitable subrogation not defeated by actual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Under the <em>Restatement (Third) </em>rule, actual knowledge of a prior lien is irrelevant to application of equitable subrogation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even those jurisdictions which accept the proposition that actual notice to the potential lienholder undermines equitable subrogation reject the claim that <em>constructive </em>notice should suffice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Grant S. Nelson &amp; Dale A. Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law \u00a7 10.6 (3d ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We have also previously held constructive knowledge of a properly recorded lease and option to buy is legally insufficient to deny equitable subrogation. <em>See Coy v. Raabe, </em>69 Wn.2d 346, 349, 351, 418 P.2d 728 (1966). Of course if constructive knowledge <em>were </em>sufficient to defeat application of the doctrine of equitable subrogation in this jurisdiction, there would be no such doctrine since absent a prior filing or recording there would be no priority to contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">2. No actual notice to lienholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Even in jurisdictions where actual knowledge may defeat equitable subrogation, only knowledge by the <em>lienor </em>may have this effect. Neither Pioneer Bank nor PHH received actual notice of the Kim judgment prior to making the loan. PHH did not receive actual notice of the judgment lien until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>December 1998, seven months after the refinance was complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">3. No actual notice to title company until after transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">It is the date of the commitment to insure which is relevant (if at all), not the date the policy actually issued. By the terms and conditions of the commitment issued on March 16, the title company undertook to insure title to its insured, save and except identified exceptions as well as encumbrances \u201cif any, created, first appearing in the public records or attaching subsequent to the effective date hereof [March 16, 1998].\u201d CP at 41. At that point Yakima Title became obligated to issue a title insurance policy to its insured, Pioneer Bank (and later its assignee PHH), without excepting the Kim judgment lien because that lien had been filed prior to the date of the commitment and was not expressly excepted. Had Yakima Title attempted to add an exception to the policy not expressed in the commitment it would have breached the commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">According to the facts as the majority describes them (majority at 83), the commitment for title insurance was issued on March 16,1998, Pioneer Bank recorded its deed of trust and second quit claim deed on April 28, but Kim\u2019s attorney first informed the title company of its judgment on July 13, 1998. Even the assignment of Pioneer Bank\u2019s deed of trust to PHH occurred prior to that, on June 17, 1998 (although it was not re-recorded until July 16).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore Yakima Title, much less the real parties in interest, Pioneer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>and PHH, had no actual notice of the Kim judgment prior to the refinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">No Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">A legitimate concern under the <em>Restatement (Third) </em>formulation of the rule is whether the prior lienholder would be prejudiced by subrogation to the replacement mortgage or deed of trust. Arguably if the refinance significantly increased the principal balance of the loan, there might be prejudice. By the same token if the terms and conditions of the loan repayment were less favorable to the obligor, that might be prejudicial as well. Here, however, the majority notes that the amount of the indebtedness did not change significantly, whereas the interest rate was reduced from 10.5 percent to 6.75 percent, and the maturity date was extended from 6 years to 30 years, eliminating a balloon payment. Moreover the size of the property subject to the judgment lien doubled.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Under section 7.3 equitable subrogation will not be granted if a change in the terms of the refinance mortgage or the underlying debt is \u201cmaterially prejudicial\u201d to the holder of a junior interest. Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Mortgages \u00a7 7.3(a)(1) (1997). A change is generally deemed materially prejudicial only if (1) it is in the form of an increase in principal amount;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (2) it is in the form of an increase in interest rate;* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or (3) the refinance mortgagee fails to record its mortgage and the intervening lienor takes detrimental action as a result.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> None of these situations is at hand in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Although this refinance did lead to a small increase in the principal amount, from $130,000 to $132,700, the majority correctly concedes this change is not materially prejudicial. <em>See </em>majority at 87-88. Furthermore, the refinancing led to a substantial beneficial reduction in interest rate from 10.5 percent to 6.75 percent. Lastly, Pioneer Bank\u2019s deed of trust was promptly recorded, and there has been no suggestion Kim has taken any detrimental action in response to any failure on Pioneer Bank\u2019s part in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">However, the majority apparently finds the extension of time for payment (majority at 88) was prejudicial to the rights of the judgment creditor. But quite to the contrary, an extension of time to repay a loan is generally presumed <em>beneficial </em>to junior lienors, not prejudicial. <em>See, e.g., Crutchfield v. Johnson &amp; Latimer, </em>243 Ala. 73, 8 So. 2d 412, 414 (1942); <em>Lennar N.E. Partners v. Buice, </em>49 Cal. App. 4th 1576, 57 Cal. Rptr. 2d 435, 439 (1996) (citing <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. BVS Dev., Inc., </em>42 F.3d 1206, 1215 (9th Cir. 1994)); <em>Eurovest Ltd. v. 13290 Biscayne Island Terrace Corp., </em>559 So. 2d 1198, 1198 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1990); <em>Larson Cement Stone Co. v. Redlim Realty Co., </em>179 Neb. 134, 137 N.W.2d 241, 245 (1965). <em>But see Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Smith, </em>277 S.C. 162, 284 S.E.2d 770, 772 (1981) (holding extension of senior mortgage resulted in loss of priority because intervening mortgagee had agreed to be subordinated on the assumption the senior mortgage would be fully satisfied on the initial due date).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Instead of a note amortized over 15 years with the full balance due on a balloon payment in 6, the terms of repayment were liberalized to allow amortized payments over 30 years with no balloon. This is anything but prejudicial to junior liens. The elimination of a balloon payment representing 70 percent of the purchase price was beneficial to Bum\u2019s junior judgment lien.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Perhaps the majority forgets that this is an action to quash a sheriff\u2019s sale initiated by the judgment creditor against the subject property. Had the sheriff\u2019s sale gone to fruition, and had there been no refinance, the judgment creditor would simply step into the shoes of the judgment debtor and take title subject to all prior liens, including the one with high interest and a balloon payment in six years.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is hardly a doubtful proposition that the successful bidder would prefer a lower interest rate and 30 years to pay to higher interest and a 6 year balloon.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover as a result of the refinance the judgment lien would now attach to all the property not just half, as was the case prior to the refinance. If this is prejudice, what is benefit?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Taken on its face the majority opinion cannot support its own conclusion. It confuses the status of title insurer with the property owner insured, relies on \u201cactual notice\u201d which came after the transaction, and misconstrues benefit as prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Madsen, J., concurs with Sanders, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Reconsideration denied April 12, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b151-11\"> Justice Chambers\u2019 concurring opinion says the doctrine of equitable subrogation is inapplicable because \u201c[t]he transaction involved different mortgagors and different mortgagees.\u201d (Chambers, J., concurring at 93).

Some courts have granted subrogation in spite of actual knowledge in part because, regardless of the subrogee\u2019s knowledge, intervening lienors would not be in a worse position. <em>See, e.g., Wilkins v. Gibson, </em>113 Ga. 31, 38 S.E. 374, 382 (1901); <em>Klotz v. Klotz, </em>440 N.W.2d 406, 409-10 (Iowa Ct. App. 1989); <em>Providence Inst. for Sav. v. Sims, </em>441 S.W.2d 516, 520 (Tex. 1969).
