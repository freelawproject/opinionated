Although the Court of Appeals acknowledged that differing standards of review applied to the Department\u2019s rule-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>making in 1993 and its denial of rulemaking in 1997, it did not review the two challenges separately. We agree with the Department that the plaintiffs failed to show that the 1993 rule was arbitrary and capricious. However, we have determined that the Department\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 1997 request was arbitrary in light of the Department\u2019s post-1993 investigation, and we therefore conclude that the Department\u2019s failure to act was contrary to the requirements of the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act of 1973 (WISHA), chapter 49.17 RCW.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The Court of Appeals decision is therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part. We remand this matter to the Department with our order to initiate rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit are agricultural pesticide handlers, farm workers directly engaged in mixing, loading, and applying pesticides. Because exposure to pesticides containing organophosphate and carbamate compounds is known to inhibit levels of cholinesterase, a blood enzyme essential to the proper functioning of the nervous system,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the pesticide handlers asked the Department in 1986 and again in 1991 to adopt a mandatory blood testing program to monitor their cholinesterase levels. The Department initiated rulemaking and, in March 1993, adopted WAC 296-307-14520 (originally codified as WAC 296-306--40011 (1993)),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which recommends but does not require a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>blood testing program for monitoring cholinesterase levels. Stephen M. Cant, the Department\u2019s \u201cindustrial hygiene program manager,\u201d \u201cmade the initial decision not to require mandatory cholinesterase monitoring, and the Assistant Director for WISHA and the Director for the Department accepted that recommendation.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 508, 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The pesticide handlers informed the Department that they intended to seek judicial review. In response, the Department set up a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) \u201cto assist the Department... in determining an appropriate response\u201d and \u201cto identify the essential components of a successful monitoring program in Washington State.\u201d CP at 273. The TAG, comprised of three health care professionals from the University of Washington, along with two representatives from the Department, completed a 20-page report in August 1995. <em>See </em>CP at 271-91. Although the heading to section II of the TAG report termed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>cholinesterase monitoring \u201cthe most well developed and feasible method among available worker monitoring approaches for cholinesterase-inhibitor exposure,\u201d the TAG \u201crecommend [ed] the following\u201d in its September 1995 cover letter to the report: \u201cCholinesterase monitoring on a voluntary basis for those working in occupations involved with handling cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides within the specific trigger levels described in this document.\u201d CP at 274, 202. The TAG explained that, \u201c[g]iven the current limitations of various resources vital for the implementation of some of the recommendations described in this document, we are not advising mandatory cholinesterase monitoring programs.\u201d CP at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">In letters dated June 19 and July 18, 1997, the pesticide handlers\u2019 counsel asked the Department to \u201cstate its intent to adopt a mandatory medical monitoring rule for pesticide handlers.\u201d CP at 492. Michael Silverstein, the Department\u2019s Assistant Director for industrial safety and health, responded by letter of August 29, 1997. Silverstein explained that \u201c[t]he primary rationale for not making ChE [(cholinesterase)] monitoring mandatory at this time grows out of the technical limitations involved with ChE testing,\u201d CP at 215, but he also discussed the constraints placed on the Department by competing priorities and limited resources. While Silverstein concluded that the Department had correctly decided in 1993 to recommend nonmandatory cholinesterase monitoring and had properly adhered to the voluntary recommendations in light of the 1995 TAG report, he nevertheless recognized \u201cthat additional review of technical issues related to cholinesterase monitoring was warranted both in light of the Technical Advisory Group advice to this effect, and also in light of the Governor\u2019s Executive Order on Regulatory Improvement (EO 97-02).\u201d CP at 493. Consequently, the Department included \u201cthe voluntary monitoring recommendations in the Rule Review Plan . . . submitted to the Governor in August 1997.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The pesticide handlers filed the present declaratory judgment action in October 1997 in Thurston County Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Court. CP at 5-15. They stated causes of action for the Department\u2019s alleged violation of WISHA, RCW 49.17-.050(4) and 49.17.240(2); the Washington Administrative Procedure Act (APA), RCW 34.05.570(4)(b) and 34.05-.570(2)(c); the Washington Law Against Discrimination, RCW 49.60.030; article I, section 12 of the Washington State Constitution; and Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. In January 1998, the case was certified as a class action on behalf of <em>\u201call </em>persons who are or will be employed as pesticide handlers in the agriculture industry in Washington State.\u201d CP at 21. At a bench trial in June 1998, the trial court issued an oral ruling based on the oral argument of counsel, the testimony from witnesses, and \u201cthe rule-making file required by RCW 34.05.370, as well as all pleadings, briefs and evidence which were called to the Court\u2019s attention.\u201d CP at 2221. The trial court ruled against the pesticide handlers on all causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">This court denied the pesticide handlers\u2019 request for discretionary review and transferred the matter to the Court of Appeals. Division Two reversed, and we granted the Department\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">When the Department decided not to include mandatory cholinesterase monitoring in the agricultural pesticide regulations promulgated in 1993, and then rejected in 1997 the pesticide handlers\u2019 renewed request for rulemaking on such a program, did the Department violate its statutory duty under WISHA or otherwise act arbitrarily or capriciously?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\"><em>Standard of Review. </em>The pesticide handlers have challenged the validity of the 1993 rule,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Department\u2019s subsequent failure to initiate rule making in 1997. The two challenges are based on distinct provisions in the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The APA provides that \u201c[t]he <em>validity of any rule </em>may be determined upon petition for a declaratory judgment addressed to the superior court of Thurston county, when it appears that the rule, or its threatened application, interferes with or impairs or immediately threatens to interfere with or impair the legal rights or privileges of the petitioner.\u201d RCW 34.05.570(2)(b) (emphasis added). The APA places \u201c[t]he burden of demonstrating the invalidity of agency action... on the party asserting invalidity\u201d and further provides that \u201c[t]he validity of agency action shall be determined in accordance with the standards of review provided in this section, as applied to the agency action at the time it was taken.\u201d RCW 34.05.570(l)(a), (b). The following standard of review is applicable to the pesticide handlers\u2019 challenge to the Department\u2019s 1993 rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">(c) In a proceeding involving <em>review of a rule, </em>the court shall declare the rule invalid only if it finds that: The rule <em>violates constitutional provisions; </em>the rule <em>exceeds the statutory authority of the agency; </em>the rule <em>was adopted without compliance with statutory rule-making procedures; </em>or the rule <em>is arbitrary and capricious.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">RCW 34.05.570(2)(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Whereas the pesticide handlers\u2019 challenge of the 1993 rule falls under RCW 34.05.570(2), their challenge to the Department\u2019s 1997 denial of their rulemaking request comes under RCW 34.05.570(4), the subsection governing actions other than rules or orders: \u201cA person whose rights are violated by <em>an agency\u2019s failure to perform a duty that is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>required by law to be performed </em>may file a petition for review pursuant to RCW 34.05.514, seeking an order pursuant to this subsection requiring performance.\u201d RCW 34.05.570(4)(b) (emphasis added). As with the challenge to the 1993 rule, the pesticide handlers bear the burden of demonstrating their entitlement to relief, and judicial review must be based on the standard prescribed in the APA. Here, the standard applicable to the Department\u2019s alleged \u201cfailure to perform\u201d in 1997 is very similar to the standard of review governing the challenge to the 1993 rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">(c) Relief for persons aggrieved by the performance of an agency action, including the exercise of discretion, or an action under (b) of this subsection [subsection (4)] can be granted only if the court determines that the action is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">(i) <em>Unconstitutional;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">(ii) <em>Outside the statutory authority of the agency or the authority conferred by a provision of law;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">(iii) <em>Arbitrary or capricious; or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">(iv) <em>Taken by persons who were not properly constituted as agency officials lawfully entitled to take such action.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">RCW 34.05.570(4)(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Thus, in broadest terms, the APA\u2019s standards of judicial review require that we make two inquiries: first, whether the pesticide handlers met their burden of demonstrating that the 1993 rule was unconstitutional, exceeded the Department\u2019s statutory authority, was adopted without compliance with rulemaking procedures, or was arbitrary and capricious; and, second, whether the pesticide handlers met their burden of demonstrating that the Department\u2019s 1997 decision to forgo rulemaking was unconstitutional, outside the Department\u2019s statutory authority, arbitrary or capricious, or made by unauthorized persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Not all of the statutory standards apply to our review of the 1993 rule and the 1997 denial of rulemaking. Although the pesticide handlers claimed that the Department\u2019s 1993 rule violated state and federal constitutional provisions, exceeded the Department\u2019s statutory authority, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>arbitrary and capricious, the Court of Appeals declined to address the pesticide handlers\u2019 inadequately developed constitutional argument and focused exclusively on whether the 1993 rule was \u201cinvalid for failure to comply with WISHA requirements.\u201d <em>Rios v. Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>103 Wn. App. 126, 136, 5 P.3d 19 (2000). We conclude that we may declare the omission in the 1993 rule invalid only upon the pesticide handlers\u2019 demonstration that the omission of a mandatory requirement violated the Department\u2019s duty under WISHA or was otherwise arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Regarding the Department\u2019s 1997 refusal to initiate the requested rulemaking, the pesticide handlers\u2019 complaint made no specific reference to the grounds for review set forth in RCW 34.05.570(4)(c)(i)-(iv). Focusing solely on option (ii), the Court of Appeals analyzed only whether the Department had failed to perform a duty required under WISHA. As with our review of the 1993 rule, we conclude that the pesticide handlers will be entitled to relief only if they demonstrate that the Department\u2019s failure to initiate rulemaking in 1997 violated a duty under WISHA or was otherwise arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\"><em>The Department\u2019s Duty under WISHA. </em>Given the applicable standards of review, our threshold task in reviewing both the 1993 rule and the 1997 refusal to initiate rulemaking is to define the nature of the Department\u2019s statutory duty under WISHA. Exercising its police power and respecting \u201cthe mandates of Article II, section 35 of the state Constitution,\u201d the Washington legislature enacted WISHA in 1973 \u201cto create, maintain, continue, and enhance the industrial safety and health program of the state.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute provides that the \u201cprogram shall <em>equal or exceed </em>the standards prescribed by the Occupational Safety and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Health Act of 1970,\u201d (OSHA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651. RCW 49-.17.010 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Pivotal in this case is the WISHA provision regarding safety and health standards for exposure to toxic agents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">[T]he director shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">(4) Provide for the promulgation of health and safety standards and the control of conditions in all work places concerning gases, vapors, dust, or other airborne particles, toxic materials, or harmful physical agents which shall set a standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life; any such standards shall require where appropriate the use of protective devices or equipment and for monitoring or measuring any such gases, vapors, dust, or other airborne particles, toxic materials, or harmful physical agents [.][<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The statute is not well drafted. In skeletal form, it states that \u201cthe director shall. . . [pjrovide for the promulgation of. . . standards and the control of conditions . . . which shall set a standard which most adequately assures . . . that no employee will suffer material impairment of health.\u201d It is anybody\u2019s guess what the relative pronoun \u201cwhich\u201d refers to in the clause \u201cwhich shall set a standard\u201d\u2014\u201cpromulgation,\u201d \u201cstandards,\u201d or \u201ccontrol of conditions.\u201d In contrast to the WISHA provision, the first sentence in the seminal OSHA provision virtually sings with clarity: \u201cThe Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, . . . that no employee will suffer material impairment of health!.]* 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">As a preliminary step in our analysis of RCW 49.17.050(4), we must correct a distinction between the state and federal provisions that the pesticide handlers urged and that the Court of Appeals adopted. The pesticide handlers maintained that OSHA says \u201cmay\u201d where WISHA says \u201cshall\u201d and that, consequently, the state provision curtails the director\u2019s discretion. But this position is based on a misleading distinction. The federal statute actually uses the permissive \u201cmay\u201d in an introductory statement lacking in WISHA. Because OSHA gives the secretary a series of optional means for developing safety and health standards, Congress necessarily used \u201cmay\u201d to introduce the eight subsections delineating those options: \u201cThe Secretary <em>may </em>by rule promulgate, modify, or revoke any occupational safety or health standard in the following manner.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b) (emphasis added). From those eight subsections (the first of which, for example, permits the secretary to appoint an advisory committee), Washington adopted only subsections (5) and (7), which pertain to the requirements of the standards that <em>are </em>promulgated. <em>See </em>RCW 49.17.050(4), .240(2). We simply do not find the permissive \u201cmay\u201d in the overarching OSHA framework pertinent to our analysis of RCW 49.17.050(4), which we have previously described as \u201cmirroring\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(5). <em>Aviation W. Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>138 Wn.2d 413, 431, 980 P.2d 701 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In fact, other than the greater coherence in the federal provision, we can see no significant difference between RCW 49.17.050(4), which states that \u201cthe director <em>shall. . . \\p\\rovide for the promulgation </em>o/health and safety standards . . . which shall set a standard,\u201d and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(5), which states that \u201c[t]he Secretary, <em>in promulgating </em>standards . . ., <em>shall </em>set the standard.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While it may not be entirely clear what our legislature intended when it said \u201cshall provide for the promul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>gation of\u201d rather than \u201cshall promulgate,\u201d the chosen language makes the director\u2019s duty not a duty to promulgate, but a duty to make promulgation possible, a duty to create an opportunity for such rulemaking. In sum, we decline to conclude that the director\u2019s rulemaking discretion under WISHA is more circumscribed than that of the Secretary under OSHA. And, in any case, the issue presented is not whether the Department breached the statutory command that the director \u201cprovide for the promulgation of\u201d rules, but whether the Department, having committed its energies to regulating the exposure of agricultural workers to pesticides, met the statutory requirements for such regulation. What this case thus demands is our close consideration of the specific requirements set forth in RCW 49.17.050(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We must determine whether the pesticide handlers have shown that the Department, in failing to require mandatory cholinesterase monitoring, failed to \u201cset a standard [that] most adequately assure [d], to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee [would] suffer material impairment of health.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The essence of the pesticide handlers\u2019 challenges to the 1993 rule and the 1997 denial of rulemaking is that the Department linderregulated the significant risk of pesticide exposure\u2014 more specifically, that the Department did not set the standard that regulated the risk \u201cto the extent feasible.\u201d The definition of \u201cfeasible\u201d in an underregulation challenge is an issue of first impression in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>In our relatively recent decision in <em>Aviation West, </em>we confronted an owerregulation challenge under RCW 49.17.050(4). In that case, cigarette manufacturers and other affected companies contended that the Department\u2019s regulation of smoking in private workplaces had gone beyond the Department\u2019s statutory authority. Our primary focus in that overregulation case was RCW 49.17.020(7), the general definition of \u201csafety and health standard\u201d: \u201cThe term \u2018safety and health standard\u2019 means a standard which requires the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes <em>reasonably necessary or appropriate </em>to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">To better understand not only the distinction between our review of overregulation and underregulation challenges but also the interplay between the general definition of a safety and health standard and the more specific requirements of a toxic exposure standard, we may find guidance in federal cases interpreting the mirror image OSHA provisions, although plainly we are not bound by such cases. <em>Adkins v. Aluminum Co. of Am., </em>110 Wn.2d 128, 147, 750 P.2d 1257 <em>(1988); Aviation W. Corp., </em>138 Wn.2d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Federal cases have focused on the phrase \u201cto the extent feasible\u201d in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(5), the OSHA precursor to RCW 49.17.050(4). In construing \u201cfeasible,\u201d the United States Supreme Court took as its starting point the dictionary definition \u201c \u2018capable of being done, executed, or effected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Textile Mfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan, </em>452 U.S. 490, 508-09, 101 S. Ct. 2478, 69 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1981) [hereinafter <em>ATMI\\ </em>(quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 831 (1976)); <em>see also Aviation W. Corp., </em>138 Wn.2d at 433 n.ll (quoting <em>Indus. Union Dep\u2019t v. Am. Petroleum Inst., </em>448 U.S. 607, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>719, 100 S. Ct. 2844, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1010 (1980) (Marshall, J., dissenting)). Although the <em>ATMI </em>court refused to make the feasibility assessment of \u00a7 655(b)(5) dependent upon a compulsory cost-benefit analysis, the court acknowledged that the legislative history of OSHA indicated that a \u201cfeasible\u201d standard must nevertheless be one \u201ccapable of economic and technological accomplishment\u201d: \u201cCongress was concerned that the Act might be thought to require achievement of absolute safety, an impossible standard, and therefore insisted that health and safety goals be <em>capable of economic and technological accomplishment.\u201d ATMI, </em>452 U.S. at 514 (emphasis added); <em>see also AFL-CIO v. OSHA, </em>965 F.2d 962, 980 (11th Cir. 1992) (stating that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has defined \u2018feasibility\u2019 as \u2018 \u201ccapable of being done, executed, or effected,\u201d \u2019. . . both technologically and economically\u201d). While the <em>ATMI </em>court cautioned that the general definition of a safety and health standard in \u00a7 652(8), which suggests a cost-benefit analysis, should not nullify the feasibility requirement, the court recognized that the \u201creasonably necessary or appropriate\u201d language in the general definition nevertheless \u201cmight. . . impose additional restraints\u201d on the feasibility analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">[I]f the use of one respirator would achieve the same reduction in health risk as the use of five, the use of five respirators was \u201ctechnologically and economically feasible,\u201d and OSHA thus insisted on the use of five, then the \u201creasonably necessary or appropriate\u201d limitation might come into play as an additional restriction on OSHA to choose the one-respirator standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\"><em>ATMI, 452 U.S. </em>at 514 n.32. The <em>ATMI </em>court also recognized that \u201cany standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would <em>a fortiori </em>not be \u2018reasonably necessary or appropriate\u2019under the <em>Act.\u201d Id. </em>at 513 n.31 (citing <em>Indus. Union Dep\u2019t v. Hodgson, </em>499 F.2d 467, 478 (1974) (\u201cCongress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their employers out of business .. . .\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> In sum, in light of the guidance provided in <em>ATMI, </em>we conclude that the phrase \u201cto the extent feasible\u201d in RCW 49.17.050(4) means \u201cto the extent the standard is capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>being economically and technologically accomplished.\u201d Two points regarding economic feasibility warrant emphasis. First, in determining economic feasibility under WISHA, the director must consider the degree to which a standard will affect the regulated industry\u2019s \u201c \u2018competitive stability.\u2019 \u201d <em>ATMI, </em>452 U.S. at 530 n.55 (quoting <em>United Steelworkers of Am. v.

This analysis of economic feasibility under RCW 49.17.050(4) must not be confused with the Department\u2019s exercise of discretion in prioritizing among the many areas that could potentially benefit from rulemaking.

Applying the respirator hypothetical from <em>ATMI, </em>we conclude that the director has a duty under RCW 49.17.050(4) to continue adding \u201crespirators\u201d so long as the additions are feasible, but only up to the point where additional ones are no longer necessary to protect against the worker\u2019s \u201cmaterial impairment of health.\u201d <em>See ATMI, 452 </em>U.S. at 513 n.32; <em>Bldg. &amp; Constr.

In effect, to outstrip what is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d is to go beyond \u201cthe extent feasible.\u201d Clearly, whether the Department has fulfilled its mandatory duty under WISHA will depend upon whether the Department has properly exercised its discretion in making the feasibility analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Returning to the discussion of our previous decision in <em>Aviation West, </em>we note that our analysis in that overregulation challenge naturally focused on whether the regulation had been \u201creasonably necessary or appropriate,\u201d for there, the appellants had maintained that the Department engaged in overkill, promulgating, in effect, a \u201cfive-respirator\u201d standard, one that exaggerated the statutorily defined risk to worker health. In contrast to the overregulation challenge, the pesticide handlers do not say that what <em>was </em>done was not \u201creasonably necessary or appropriate\u201d; rather, they focus on RCW 49.17.050(4) and contend that the Department underestimated\u2014again, in our hypothetical terms\u2014the number of \u201crespirators\u201d necessary to protect against the \u201cmaterial impairment of health.\u201d In the pesticide handlers\u2019 view, even with the enactment of the other agricultural pesticide regulations, a risk of \u201cmaterial impairment of health\u201d remained. They contend that the addition of a monitoring program was feasible\u2014that is, capable of economic and technological accomplishment\u2014and that the addition was necessary to achieve the statutorily mandated level of worker protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>Review of the Department\u2019s 1993 Rule. </em>We must decide whether the Department violated its statutory duty under WISHA or otherwise acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it decided not to include mandatory cholinesterase monitoring in the agricultural pesticide regulations promulgated in 1993.

Corp., </em>138 Wn.2d at 427 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In 1993, Stephen M. Cant, the Department\u2019s industrial hygiene program manager, determined that a mandatory monitoring program \u201cwas not justified\u201d in light of the Department\u2019s adoption of \u201cextensive other mandatory requirements to protect pesticide workers.\u201d CP at 516. Those requirements included \u201cpersonal protective clothing, respiratory protection, gloves, training, posting, first aid, emergency facilities, washing facilities, eye-wash requirements, and other provisions designed to protect workers.\u201d CP at 515. It was Cant\u2019s belief that, if the 1993 standards were \u201ccorrectly followed, pesticide workers [would] be protected\u201d and the necessity for cholinesterase monitoring would be \u201cobviate[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Cant also considered \u201ctechnical and practical problems associated with the test\u201d that \u201chad not been resolved\u201d and could be only with \u201can additional expenditure of resources.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In sum, Cant concluded that the 1993 package of regulations protected agricultural pesticide workers \u201cto the extent [economically and technologically] feasible\u201d and that \u201cto layer a burdensome blood test on top of the comprehensive worker protection requirements in place\u201d would have produced a standard that was not cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>effective and thus not \u201creasonably necessary or appropriate.\u201d RCW 49.17.050(4); CP at 518; RCW 49.17.020(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The primary evidence on which Cant relied was from the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA). The EPA, rather than OSHA, has responsibility for setting the standards for pesticide protection. In fact, the Department\u2019s 1993 package of pesticide regulations was \u201cadapted from the final draft of EPA\u2019s then proposed pesticide work protection standards.\u201d CP at 513. While initially endorsing cholinesterase monitoring, the EPA ultimately concluded that too many implementation difficulties remained to permit inclusion of the requirement in its final rule. Cant considered the EPA\u2019s decision not to require cholinesterase monitoring and \u201cread their comments on this issue in the Federal Register before deciding this issue.\u201d CP at 516. Cant likewise noted his reliance on \u201cdata from the Pesticide Incident Review and Tracking Panel created by the Legislature to compile data on pesticide exposures.\u201d CP at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The pesticide handlers assert that the Department neglected the evidence derived from California\u2019s mandatory monitoring program. The only such program in the country, California\u2019s program was adopted in 1974 through its Department of Agriculture. A 1989 study of the California program, based on a 1985 worker survey, showed that \u201c23 percent of the 542 handlers in the study had cholinesterase levels indicating overexposure.\u201d CP at 2125; <em>see also </em>CP at 277 (citing Richard G. Ames et al., <em>Cholinesterase Depression Among Pesticide Applicators: Results from the 1985 California Medical Monitoring Program, </em>15 Am. J. Indus. Med. 143-50 (1989)). Cant acknowledged his familiarity with the California program prior to his 1993 decision, but he maintained that the existence of the California program did not ipso facto make such a program necessary in Washington: \u201c[T]here is no justification in Washington State to support the notion that, because California did something, that somehow, whatever the \u2018something\u2019 was should be adopted here.\u201d CP at 514. In his view, because states are different, there will be \u201cvariation in approaches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>to problem solving.\u201d CP at 514. Indeed, no other state labor department has a mandatory program, nor does an OSHA standard even exist, given the EPA\u2019s jurisdiction over such pesticide regulations. Moreover, while the results in the 1989 study were significant, what the pesticide handlers did not show was that a comparable exposure rate would occur in Washington after its implementation of the 1993 protective regulations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As we demonstrated in <em>Aviation West, </em>neither the existence of contradictory evidence nor the possibility of deriving conflicting conclusions from the evidence renders an agency decision arbitrary and capricious. <em>Aviation W. Corp., </em>138 Wn.2d at 429 (citing <em>ATMI, </em>452 U.S. at 523 (quoting <em>Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966))). In <em>Aviation West, </em>we concluded that the Department\u2019s fundamental reliance on the EPA report on environmental tobacco smoke met the \u201cbest available evidence\u201d requirement of RCW 49.17.050(4). <em>Aviation W. Corp., </em>138 Wn.2d at 427-29. Just as we could not declare the Department\u2019s action unreasoning in <em>Aviation West, </em>we cannot in the present case conclude that the Department\u2019s 1993 rulemaking decision was not \u201crational at the <em>time </em>it was made.\u201d <em>Aviation W. Corp., </em>138 Wn.2d at 427. The Department based its determination that a mandatory cholinesterase program was unnecessary on the EPA\u2019s decision not to include such a program among its federal pesticide protections. In sum, the pesticide handlers have not met their burden of showing that the absence of a mandatory program in the 1993 pesticide regulations ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>dered the 1993 rule \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d under RCW 34.05.570(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><em>Review of the Department\u2019s 1997Decision Not to Act. </em>We review the Department\u2019s 1997 denial of the pesticide handlers\u2019 request under the standards set forth in RCW 34.05.570(4)(c). The pesticide handlers have the burden of showing that Silverstein\u2019s August 1997 decision was \u201c[arbitrary or capricious\u201d in light of the record at that time.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The critical post-1993 evidence in the record is the August 1995 TAG report. The basic tenets of the report are that cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides can materially harm workers, that medical monitoring by means of a simple blood test is \u201cthe most well developed and feasible method\u201d for monitoring such exposure, and that the California program and the Washington nonmandatory guidelines provide a substantial model for a mandatory Washington rule. CP at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The TAG report relies on significant post-1993 research. The report cites two 1995 articles supporting its straightforward observation that \u201c[t]he surveillance system in California has succeeded in reducing the number of work-related pesticide illnesses.\u201d CP at 272, 287; <em>see also </em>CP at 2088-89. According to the report, the TAG contacted the medical coordinator of the California program, a medical supervisor involved in the program, and \u201cother organizations and individuals representing workers in California.\u201d CP at 281-82. The report addressed \u201c[t]he difficulties\u201d prompting the EPA to reverse its original decision to initiate a mandatory nationwide requirement, CP at 275, and the TAG also reviewed information from the World Health Organization and the National Institute on Safety and Health, as well as the annual reports from Washington\u2019s Pesticide Incident Reporting and Tracking panel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>(PIRT). <em>See </em>CP at 2091. The 1991-97 PIRT data showed that, of 279 reported pesticide incidents for which cholinesterase testing had been done, 43 workers (15 percent) had depressed cholinesterase levels. CP at 498. Also available to the TAG was a 1995 Washington study showing that 10 percent of workers who were tested had cholinesterase levels low enough to meet the California trigger levels. CP at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The tenor of the TAG report is proactive. The TAG outlined the essential requirements of a mandatory monitoring program, the \u201cresources required, and technical issues that must be addressed to ensure that these primary goals are accomplished and maintained.\u201d CP at 280-81; <em>see also </em>CP at 283-84. The TAG identified the ways in which the California model would have to be modified to meet the TAG\u2019s goals. Consistent with the report\u2019s description of its recommended monitoring program as \u201cthe most well developed and feasible method,\u201d the report does not conclude that the suggested modifications are not technologically or economically capable of accomplishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The Department can do little to parry the thrust of the TAG report. In explaining his 1997 decision not to go forward with the requested rulemaking, Michael Silverstein, the Department\u2019s Assistant Director for the WISHA Services Division, did not claim that a mandatory rule was not technologically or economically feasible. Rather, he admitted that \u201cit might be possible to demonstrate feasibility for a cholinesterase monitoring program,\u201d but simply cautioned that it \u201c[would] be a challenging and complex undertaking.\u201d CP at 502. Silverstein focused primarily on the Department\u2019s limited resources, noting in particular the budget and staff constraints in the rule-making section of his division, and he stressed the importance of setting priorities for the allocation of scarce resources. In his view, \u201cany substantial new rulemaking project would require new budget or the displacement of other agency activities,\u201d and he speculated that, because \u201cregulation in the agricultural sector has been controversial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>and contentious,\u201d the Department \u201cwould need to prepare for this by securing additional technical and legal resources to develop and evaluate a voluminous record, and to prepare for likely litigation.\u201d CP at 494, 502. Surmising that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that the Department would \u201chave any capacity to do rulemaking for medical surveillance in the foreseeable future,\u201d Silverstein went on to observe that, should the Department \u201cnevertheless . . . choose a specific chemical exposure or group of workers for medical surveillance rulemaking, [the Department] would consider cholinesterase monitoring for farm workers as one of many possibilities.\u201d CP at 497. He emphasized that cholinesterase had no special claim by noting that \u201c[t]here are literally hundreds of such chemicals to which millions of workers are exposed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Ordinarily, an agency is accorded wide discretion in deciding to forgo rulemaking in an area, and fiscal constraints may reasonably determine whether an agency takes action (and, if so, how). But an agency\u2019s allusion to fiscal considerations and prioritizing cannot be regarded as an unbeatable trump in the agency\u2019s hand; on review, a plaintiff has the opportunity to show that the agency\u2019s failure to act was \u201c[arbitrary or capricious.\u201d RCW 34.05-.570(4)(c)(iii); <em>see Hillis, </em>131 Wn.2d at 390-91. This case presents an extraordinary circumstance: even though we recognize the Department\u2019s wide discretion in choosing and scheduling its rulemaking efforts, we conclude that the Department\u2019s denial of the pesticide handlers\u2019 1997 request was arbitrary. At the time of their request in 1997, the pesticide handlers were not asking the Department to embark on a new enterprise\u2014they had not simply pulled from a hat the name of one dangerous workplace chemical among the hundreds. In fact, the Department had already made cholinesterase monitoring enough of a priority to draft the nonmandatory guidelines and to convene a team of experts \u201cto identify the essential components of a successful monitoring program.\u201d CP at 273. And that report announced in its introductory summary that \u201c[t]he TAG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>recommends cholinesterase monitoring for all occupations handling Class I or II organophosphate or carbamate pesticides.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because the Department had already invested its resources in studying cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides and because the report of its own team of technical experts had, in light of the most current research, deemed a monitoring program both necessary and doable, the Department\u2019s 1997 denial of the pesticide handlers\u2019 request was \u201cunreasoning and taken without regard to the attending facts or circumstances.\u201d <em>Hillis, </em>131 Wn.2d at 383. Consequently, in failing to act on the request for rulemaking, the Department violated RCW 49.17.050(4), the requirement that the Department \u201cset a standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Under RCW 34.05.574, a court reviewing agency action has an array of options: \u201cthe court may (a) affirm the agency action or (b) order an agency to take action required by law, order an agency to exercise discretion required by law, set aside agency action, enjoin or stay the agency action, remand the matter for further proceedings, or enter a declaratory judgment order.\u201d While we affirm the validity of the Department\u2019s 1993 rule, we conclude that the pesticide handlers met their burden of showing that the Department\u2019s 1997 denial of the pesticide handlers\u2019 request for rulemaking was unreasonable.

In that regard, I agree with the majority that by virtue of its failure to promulgate mandatory rules for cholinesterase monitoring after it deemed cholinesterase monitoring both necessary and feasible, L&amp;I violated the provisions of RCW 49.17.050(4) that require L&amp;I to \u201cset a standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">I write separately simply to indicate my disagreement with Justice Sanders\u2019s view that the situation before us is \u201con all fours with the one we faced in <em>Hillis v. Department of Ecology, </em>131 Wn.2d 373, 932 P.2d 139 (1997).\u201d Dissent at 527. In <em>Hillis, </em>the plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the Department of Ecology (DOE) to compel the processing of his application for groundwater rights. The record there showed that DOE was engaged in the ongoing task of processing those applications and did not dispute that it had a statutory duty to do so. Rather, it claimed that it had discretion to establish its own schedule for carrying out its duties. We agreed with DOE, notwithstanding a dissent authored by me, and concluded that DOE had considerable discretion over the manner in which it carried out its statutory duties. In reaching that conclusion the majority held that it was not arbitrary or capricious for DOE to consider fiscal constraints in ordering priorities for processing applications for groundwater rights. Thus, our concern in <em>Hillis </em>focused on the amount of procedural discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>that DOE had over the manner in which it carried out its statutorily prescribed duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The fact that an agency has discretion over the manner in which it carries out its statutorily prescribed duties does not mean that the agency has the discretion to refuse to carry out those duties. L&amp;I interprets ROW 49.17.050 in a way that supports its conclusion that it had discretion to decide whether or not to initiate rule making on mandatory cholinesterase monitoring for agricultural pesticide handlers. Such an interpretation of that statute is, in my view, contrary to the law because an agency does not have discretion to determine the scope or extent of its own authority. <em>In re Elec. Lightwave, Inc., </em>123 Wn.2d 530, 540, 869 P.2d 1045 (1994). While, as I noted above, an agency has wide discretion as to the manner it carries out its duties, its discretion is limited to the terms of the statutory scheme that provides the agency its authority. Because the challenge in <em>Hillis </em>concerned the amount of procedural discretion an agency has when carrying out its statutorily prescribed duties, and did not concern discretion to determine the scope of the agency\u2019s authority, <em>Hillis </em>does not command us to reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Accordingly, I concur with the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b566-6\">Madsen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5n\">(dissenting) \u2014 The majority claims that this case presents an extraordinary circumstance justifying the conclusion that the Director of the Department of Labor and Industries acted arbitrarily in denying the pesticide handlers\u2019 1997 request for a mandatory rule requiring blood testing of pesticide handlers\u2019 cholinesterase levels. If this case represents such extraordinary circumstance, then this court, itself, has set an extraordinary precedent that will result in courts directing that untold numbers of mandatory rules be promulgated by the Director, notwithstanding the Department\u2019s limited resources and funding, and notwithstanding the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">I respectfully dissent because the majority opinion fails to accord due deference to the Director\u2019s decision, particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>where the decision not to adopt a mandatory rule rests to a large extent on availability of agency resources and funding, and the agency\u2019s decisions on priorities. It fails to heed the principle that substantial judicial deference is to be accorded agency views based heavily on factual matters which are complex, technical, and close to the heart of the agency\u2019s experience. It gives undue weight to an advisory report, while at the same time fails to give appropriate weight to aspects of that report that support the Director\u2019s decision. The majority\u2019s analysis provides a huge disincentive to agency\u2019s consideration of issues for possible rule making. If consideration of rule making will ultimately require rule making, an agency will think very carefully before investigating possible subjects of rule making. In the end, the majority has substituted its factual determinations and judgment for that of the agency. This the court should not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Failure to Petition for Rule Making</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Before turning to the heart of this case, i.e., whether the Director acted arbitrarily in declining to promulgate a mandatory rule, one significant procedural issue bears comment\u2014the failure of the pesticide handlers to petition for rule making in 1997, as required by RCW 34.05.330(1), and as they were encouraged to do by the Department. Unfortunately, this issue is not addressed by the majority, and the Court of Appeals, which did address it, decided it wrongly. The majority\u2019s acceptance of the proposition that review is appropriate under RCW 34.05.570(4)(c) despite the pesticide handlers\u2019 failure to petition is bound to reverberate in future administrative law appeals, given the Court of Appeals published decision. Moreover, the failure to comply with the petition requirement should preclude review in this case of the 1997 refusal to adopt a mandatory rule, ending this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>RCW 34.05.330(1) provides that \u201c[a]ny person may[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] petition an agency requesting the adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule.\u201d Within 60 days, the agency must either (1) deny the petition in writing, stating the reasons for the denial and specifically addressing the concerns raised in the petition, and, if appropriate, stating alternative means by which the agency will address those concerns, or (2) initiate rule making. <em>Id. </em>Analogous federal cases are persuasive that the failure to petition for rule making precludes judicial review of the refusal to engage in rule making. The federal counterpart states that \u201c[e]ach agency shall give an interested person the right to petition for the issuance . .. of a rule.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(e) (1996). Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(e), the agency must provide <em>\u201ca </em>brief statement of the grounds for denial.\u201d <em>Am. Horse Prot. Ass\u2019n v. Lyng, </em>812 F.2d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Where a petition for rule making is properly filed, and the agency refuses to engage in rule making, review is then appropriate under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, which describes the scope of review. <em>See Am. Horse Prot., </em>812 F.2d at 4; <em>Kappelmann v. Delta Air Lines, </em>539 F.2d 165, 172 &amp; n.22 (D.C. Cir. 1976). However, where a petition is not filed, judicial review is generally precluded. <em>See S. Hills Health Sys. v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 1084, 1095 (3d Cir. 1988); <em>Kappelmann, </em>539 F.2d at 171-73; <em>N.Y. State Elec. &amp; Gas Corp. v. Saranac Power Partners, L.P., </em>117 F. Supp. 2d 211, 236 &amp; n.50 (N.D.N.Y. 2000); <em>Midwater Trawlers Coop. v. Mosbacher, </em>727 F. Supp. 12, 15 (D.D.C. 1989); <em>Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Harris, </em>484 F. Supp. 58, 60 (D.D.C. 1979).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The doctrines of exhaustion and primary jurisdiction have been applied as the bases for courts to decline to review cases where plaintiffs have failed to petition for rule making under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(e). <em>See Brown v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>46 F.3d 102, 113-15 (1st Cir. 1995); <em>Skubel v. Sullivan, </em>925 F. Supp. 930, 936 (D. Conn. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">I would hold that a petition under RCW 34.05.330(1) is a necessary predicate to seeking judicial review of an agency\u2019s refusal to engage in rule making. Among other things, compliance with the statute increases the likelihood that a more developed administrative record will likely exist, provides that the agency will state reasons for denying rule making, thus clarifying its particular policy reasons for denial, and will assure that the agency will state how it intends, where appropriate, to meet the petitioner\u2019s concerns, thus providing additional information as to the agency\u2019s refusal to engage in rule making. Thus, compliance with RCW 34.05.330 will in general greatly facilitate judicial review, <em>see Brown, </em>46 F.3d at 114, and in particular will also help assure that a court does not unduly interfere in an agency\u2019s decision making. And, more fundamentally, it will give the agency the opportunity to address the petition for rule making in a structured fashion in the first place. The requirement of filing a petition for rule making is not onerous, and the benefits to be derived far outweigh any burden. Further, because the agency must respond within 60 days to a petition, the requirement does not unduly delay review of a denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The Court of Appeals reasoned, however, that under RCW 34.05.534(1), the pesticide handlers were not required to petition for adoption of a rule. RCW 34.05.534(1) states that \u201c[a] petitioner for judicial review of a rule need not have participated in the rule-making proceeding upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>which that rule is based, have petitioned for its amendment or repeal, have petitioned the joint administrative rules review committee for its review, or have appealed a petition for amendment or repeal to the governor.\u201d The Court of Appeals held that this provision applies in this case, and thus the pesticide handlers\u2019 failure to petition for rule making in 1997 did not preclude review of their request. However, by its plain terms, RCW 34.05.534(1) applies where the challenge is to a <em>rule, </em>or the amendment or repeal of a <em>rule. </em>It does not apply where the challenge is to the <em>failure to engage in rule making. </em>This conclusion is reinforced by the specific language used in RCW 34.05.330(1), which allows any person to petition for \u201cadoption, amendment, or repeal\u201d of any rule. RCW 34.05.534(1), in contrast, refers only to existing rules, and their amendment and repeal. The omission of any language relating to adoption of a rule indicates legislative intent that exhaustion is not excused where adoption of a rule is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Here, the pesticide handlers have not exhausted their administrative remedies as required because they did not petition for rule making, <em>see Citizens for Mount Vernon v. City of Mount Vernon, </em>133 Wn.2d 861, 866, 947 P.2d 1208 (1997), nor do they contend that they are excused from exhausting their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Finally, on this procedural issue, I disagree with the Court of Appeals conclusion that RCW 34.05.570(4)(b) \u201ctrumps\u201d the petition requirement of RCW 34.05.330(1). RCW 34.05.570 addresses the burden of proof and the standards of judicial review. Along with review of rules and agency orders in adjudicative proceedings, the statute provides for the method for seeking review of \u201cother agency action,\u201d RCW 34.05.570(4), and states that \u201c[a]ll agency action not reviewable under subsection (2) or (3) of this section shall be reviewed under this subsection,\u201d RCW 34.05.570(4)(a). Thus, where an agency has failed to perform a duty required by law, subsection (4)(b) directs that a petition for review may be filed in accordance with the procedures in RCW 34.05.514, states how and when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>agency is to respond, and states that the court may hear evidence, pursuant to RCW 34.05.562, on material issues of fact. RCW 34.05.570(4)(b) does not, by its terms, preclude or excuse the filing of a petition for rule making where a challenge is the failure to promulgate a rule. Moreover, as explained, bypassing the petition process can severely handicap judicial review because the opportunity for a more complete record and a clear explanation of the reasons for denying rule making would also be bypassed. Finally, as also noted, the petition requirement is a predicate to review of denial of rule making in the federal system, but, if the petition is denied, then review proceeds according to the federal counterpart to RCW 34.05.570, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">This court should hold that judicial review of the failure to promulgate a mandatory blood-testing rule in 1997 is precluded because the pesticide handlers did not petition for the adoption of a rule at that time as required under RCW 34.05.330(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Whether the Director Must Promulgate a Mandatory Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">With regard to the 1997 decision by the Director not to adopt a rule, the majority concludes that this case involves an extraordinary circumstance justifying this court in requiring the Director to promulgate a mandatory blood-testing rule. In my view, this holding represents a serious encroachment by the judiciary into the responsibilities of the executive branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">When reviewable, an agency decision not to adopt a rule is reviewable under RCW 34.05.570(4), as the majority says. <em>See Hillis v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, </em>131 Wn.2d 373, 393-94, 932 P.2d 139 (1997). The standard of review is whether the decision not to promulgate was arbitrary or capricious. \u201cAgency action is arbitrary and capricious if it is willful and unreasoning and taken without regard to the attending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>facts or circumstances.\u201d <em>Hillis, </em>131 Wn.2d at 383. \u201cWhere there is room for two opinions, an action taken after due consideration is not arbitrary and capricious even though a reviewing court may believe it to be erroneous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Federal courts have appropriately explained that the degree of deference to the agency under the arbitrary and capricious standard, where agency inaction is the refusal to adopt a rule, depends in part upon the reason that the agency declines to adopt the rule. For example, where the reason lies in the agency\u2019s construction of statute, i.e., a question of law, there is less reason for deference than in the case where the agency\u2019s decision not to regulate is based upon factors not inherently susceptible to judicial review, such as internal management considerations relating to budget or personnel, the agency\u2019s assessment of its own competence, or the weighing of competing policies in an extensive statutory scheme. <em>Pub. Citizen v. Heckler, </em>653 F. Supp. 1229, 1239 (D.D.C. 1986). The court in <em>Maier v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, </em>114 F.3d 1032, 1040 (10th Cir. 1997) noted that within the range of deference embodied in the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of review, an agency\u2019s refusal to initiate rule making is at the high end, adding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">[c]ourts are ill-equipped and poorly situated to address important reasons for agency inaction, such as the decision that a \u201cproblem is not sufficiently important to justify the allocation of significant scarce resources given the nature of the many other problems the agency is attempting to address.\u201d 1 Kenneth C. Davis &amp; Richard J. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 6.9, at 280 (3d ed. 1994).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Thus, federal courts have concluded that a refusal to adopt a rule should be overturned \u201conly in the rarest and most compelling of circumstances . . . primarily involv[ing] . . . plain errors of law, suggesting that the agency has been blind to the source of its delegated power.\u201d Am. <em>Horse Prot., </em>812 F.2d at 5 (citations and quotation marks omitted). This court should take the same approach. Unfortunately, the majority has not accorded the agency\u2019s decision the deference that is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Setting aside concerns about exhaustion requirements and separation of powers concerns, the majority\u2019s analysis under the arbitrary and capricious standard is highly questionable. The majority\u2019s analysis turns largely on its view of whether a health and safety standard on mandatory blood monitoring for pesticide handlers\u2019 cholinesterase levels is \u201cfeasible.\u201d Although not acknowledged by the majority, there is a significant question about whether the \u201cto the extent feasible\u201d language of RCW 49.17.050(4) even applies as the yardstick by which to measure the Director\u2019s decision not to adopt a mandatory blood-testing rule. RCW 49.17-.050(4) contains essentially two directives, first, that the Director shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">Provide for the promulgation of health and safety standards and the control of conditions in all work places concerning gases, vapors, dust, or other airborne particles, toxic materials, or harmful physical agents which shall set a standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The second directive is that any \u201csuch standards shall require <em>where appropriate </em>. . . monitoring or measuring any such gases, vapors, dust, or other airborne particles, toxic materials, or harmful physical agents.\u201d RCW 49.17.050(4) (emphasis added). A related statute also uses the term \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d when referring specifically to medical monitoring. RCW 49.17.240(2) states that <em>\u201c[w]here appropriate, </em>such [safety and health standards] ... shall provide for monitoring or measuring employee exposure at such locations and intervals, and in such manner as may be reasonably necessary for the protection of employees,\u201d and \u201c[i]n addition, <em>where appropriate, </em>any such rule shall prescribe the type and frequency of medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available, by the employer or at his cost, to employees exposed to such hazards in order to most effectively determine whether the health of such employees is adversely affected by such exposure.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Thus, there is compelling reason to conclude that the proper measure of medical monitoring required is whether it is \u201cappropriate,\u201d not whether it is \u201cfeasible.\u201d This does not mean that Washington workers would receive less protection than required by law. Anytime a protective standard is adopted by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), ROW 49.17.010 requires that this state program \u201cshall equal or exceed the standards.\u201d Thus, where OSHA adopts a standard that includes mandatory medical monitoring, this state must do the same. In the absence of an OSHA rule, it appears that such monitoring is required only \u201cwhere appropriate,\u201d\u2014a standard obviously relegated to agency discretion by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Even accepting the \u201cfeasibility\u201d standard applied by the majority does not, however, lead to the majority\u2019s result. Despite nearly identical language in the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(5), (7), federal courts have not concluded that every feasible safety or health standard must be adopted. Instead, the courts have recognized that the agency must have discretion to decide the means for carrying out the statutory mandate, discretion to determine priorities for rule making, and discretion as to the speed with which the agency considers a problem. <em>See Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Dep\u2019t v. Brock, </em>838 F.2d 1258, 1271 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (the feasibility principle may not be applied in a way which would deprive OSHA of the almost unlimited discretion to devise means to achieve the goal mandated by Congress; nor is there any requirement that every possible tightening of a regulation must be made); <em>Am. Iron &amp; Steel Inst. v. OSHA, </em>182 F.3d 1261, 1269 (11th Cir. 1999) (OSHA\u2019s choice to limit rule making by excluding certain policy pertaining to atmospheric contamination from consideration, regardless of feasibility, found to be a valid exercise of the agency\u2019s authority to set priorities); <em>AFL-CIO v. OSHA, </em>965 F.2d 962, 985 (11th Cir. 1992) (OSHA\u2019s decision to defer issuing standards on permissible exposure limits to air contami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>nants within discretion of agency to set priorities for the use of the agency\u2019s resources, and to promulgate standards sequentially). Moreover, as the United States Supreme Court has observed, the allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation is a discretionary administrative decision, given that such an appropriation is designed to allow the agency to adapt to changing circumstances and meet statutory duties in the way it sees as most effective or desirable. <em>Lincoln v. Vigil, </em>508 U.S. 182, 192, 113 S. Ct. 2024, 124 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1993). This court has also recognized that problems of priority setting and resource allocation may result in agency inaction, and that accordingly in such cases a court should proceed with great caution, as these are valid reasons for concluding that the agency has not acted arbitrarily or capriciously, even in the face of a statutory duty. <em>Hillis, </em>131 Wn.2d at 393-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Under the arbitrary and capricious standard, the Director\u2019s action\u2014the decision not to promulgate a mandatory rule\u2014was not arbitrary and capricious. First, as Dr. Michael Silverstein, the Assistant Director for the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act (WISHA) Services Division, testified, and as the majority acknowledges, the Department is restricted by limited resources, in terms of both budget and staff. Silverstein explained that any new rule-making project would either require additional funding, or the displacement of other agency activities. He also pointed out that \u201c[t]here are literally hundreds of such chemicals to which millions of workers are exposed.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 497. He explained that pesticide rule making would be procedurally complex, and would require extensive use of limited professional staff and a fixed budget. He said other agency work would not be done, and, significantly, other workers would not be protected. Silverstein noted the limited options available, should the Department focus on pesticide protection. The Department could, for example, forgo rule making to protect workers from musculoskeletal disorders, which are the cause of more than half of the workplace injuries in the state, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>forgo further rule making concerning hundreds of chemicals causing workplace asthma, or reduce workplace inspections and consultations.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Dr. Silverstein also noted that nearly all of the work of the rule-making section of his division involves nondiscretionary tasks: (1) the statutory requirement to promulgate and enforce rules at least as effective as those of OSHA; (2) rule making specifically required by the Legislature; (3) and rule-making activities under the Governor\u2019s Executive Order on Regulatory Improvement. The Assistant Director did not foreclose future rule making on cholinesterase monitoring, however. He specifically noted the possibility of future consideration of a mandatory rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In short, these reasons offered by the department for not promulgating a mandatory rule are precisely those that this court, and the federal courts, have recognized as valid justifications for not taking action, i.e., limited resources and priority setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In addition, where there are \u201chundreds of such chemicals,\u201d I cannot fathom how the majority can conclude that the decision not to require mandatory testing with respect to one is arbitrary and capricious. It is also important to remember that OSHA has not promulgated any cholinesterase monitoring rules, nor has any labor department in any state\u2014California\u2019s monitoring is required by the state\u2019s agriculture rules. More importantly, it also must be remembered that there are many rules that actually have been promulgated in this state that are designed to protect the pesticide workers from pesticide contamination in the first place. If the rules adopted in Washington are followed, as is required by law, exposure to pesticides will be reduced or eliminated. The Director has not failed to promulgate rules to protect pesticide handlers, and this court should defer to his decision as to the means of regulation. Given the protections afforded, the failure to additionally monitor blood for pesticide exposure, under all the facts and circumstances in this case, can hardly be said to be arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The majority says, however, that the agency had already made cholinesterase monitoring a priority, had invested its resources in studying cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides, and its own team of technical experts had deemed a monitoring program both necessary and doable. Given this \u201cextraordinary circumstance,\u201d the majority says, the agency\u2019s refusal to adopt a mandatory rule was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The danger in this holding is that anytime an agency embarks on an investigation whether to engage in rule making, on its own initiative or by petition, and obtains any information which will guide its determination whether to engage in rule making, it could then be required to engage in rule making because it has already made studying the issue a priority and has invested its resources. Also, to say this case involves an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d is to say that a great number of routine agency studies will constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting this court\u2019s intervention in the administrative process.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Here, the agency considered rule making when the pesticide handlers originally petitioned for rule making. After considerable effort, and adoption of numerous rules for protecting pesticide handlers, the Department declined to adopt a mandatory blood monitoring rule. The Department did not completely drop the matter, however, but arranged for a team of experts to identify what would be required for a successful monitoring program. In 1995, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) issued a report that recommended a <em>nonmandatory program, </em>particularly because there were limitations of various resources vital to implementation of recommendations made in the report. (Not only was the recommendation for a reorcmandatory rule, there is nothing that indicates that the TAG report constituted an <em>agency </em>determination about rule making.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Moreover, despite the majority\u2019s implication that the agency has all but adopted a rule, the reality is far from it. As Dr. Silverstein explained, rule making requires a formal analysis of alternatives to rule making and consideration of consequences of not adopting a rule; a cost-benefit analysis, which would be technically difficult where a cholinesterase blood-testing rule is concerned; and a determination that the rule adopted is the least burdensome. He explained that the Department has had <em>no experience </em>in adopting rules for medical monitoring because all previous medical monitoring requirements that have been adopted are identical to OSHA rules based upon OSHA regulatory analyses. He explained there are no two sets of medical monitoring rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>that are the same, and no template to follow. (As mentioned, the federal agency does not monitor cholinesterase levels in pesticide handlers\u2019 blood, and no state in the nation had adopted such a requirement, with the exception of California, and that adoption was not by a labor agency.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Thus, as Dr. Silverstein noted, the Department would have to address various options including eligibility of workers, frequency of tests, qualifications of testers, record-keeping requirements, laboratory quality control, medical removal testing, medical confidentiality, and resolution of disputes among providers. These options would have to be considered even in light of existence of this state\u2019s recommended program under WAC 296-307-14520 and California\u2019s existing program, because, as the TAG report indicated, these programs are lacking in several respects. The report noted needs for standardization of laboratory testing methods, accreditation of participating medical supervisors, expansion of workers covered, development of guidelines for follow-up monitoring, and modification of baseline measurement criteria. Dr. Silverstein explained that the agency\u2019s experience has been that safety and health regulation in the agricultural sector has been controversial and contentious, and anticipated this would be true for a medical monitoring rule. Thus, to adequately prepare, additional technical and legal resources would be required to develop and evaluate what would be a voluminous record.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Dr. Silverstein noted that it is not unusual for an OSHA rule of this complexity to require <em>10 to 15 </em>years from start to finish, and thus the Department does not undertake lightly to engage in rule making for which there is no OSHA standard. Finally, Dr. Silverstein identified a number of technical problems associated with cholinesterase testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In light of the heavy demands upon the Department\u2019s limited resources, the wide range of other areas of worker protection that call for attention, the fact that there are numerous rules that have actually been promulgated to protect pesticide workers from exposure in the first place, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the absence of any comparable rule in the federal system or 48 of the other states, and the complexity of the rule making required, including factual complexity, it cannot be said that the Director\u2019s decision was arbitrary or capricious. Allocation of resources and the setting of priorities are decisions which must lie within the agency\u2019s discretion, and decisions respecting use of those resources and the setting of priorities are decisions to which this court should apply a particularly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard where the failure to adopt a rule is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Finally, the role of adequate funding cannot be overlooked. As this court said in <em>Hillis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">The judiciary is the branch of government that is empowered to interpret statutes, not enact them. While there are special situations when the courts can and should order the expenditure of funds, specific appropriation to fund a statutory right, not involving constitutional rights or judicial functions, is normally beyond our powers to order. If every time we decided that the Legislature had not appropriated enough funds to an agency for a given purpose we could rule that the agency was \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d for failing to act and order the agency to act, then the funding of all agency action would be effectively shifted from the Legislature to the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\"><em>Hillis, </em>131 Wn.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">I would hold that the Director\u2019s 1997 decision not to adopt a mandatory cholinesterase testing rule was not arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">1993 Recommendation for Testing</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">Finally, the majority holds that the Director did not act arbitrarily in refusing to enact a mandatory rule in 1993. Although I agree with the result, I do not agree that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>issue involves a deficiency in the rules that were enacted and thus do not agree with the majority\u2019s analysis. Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, there was no rule making in 1993 that is reviewable under RCW 34.05.570(2)(b). The nonmandatory recommendations for blood testing, <em>see </em>WAC 296-307-14520, did not comprise a rule, as the majority implicitly acknowledges. <em>See </em>RCW 34.05.010(16).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The majority says, though, that the failure to adopt a mandatory rule in 1993 was a deficiency in the rules that were enacted, and thus subject to review under RCW 34.05-.570(2)(b). Majority at 490 n.3. This analysis means that an agency\u2019s decision to delay or deny rule making with regard to virtually any subject the agency considers in connection with the rules it actually adopts will be reviewable as rule making. This broad expansion of appellate review is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The case the majority cites, <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>801 F.2d 417, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1986), does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion. In that case, the Federal Trade Commission promulgated a \u201cUsed Car Rule\u201d requiring dealers to post several consumer warnings, the terms of any warranty, and a list of known specific mechanical defects on a standard window sticker. Before the rule was final, <em>see id. </em>at 423, it was revised to delete the known-defects provision. When the rule was challenged on appeal because it did not include this provision, the Commission argued that the gravamen of the appeal was the failure to engage in rule making. The court disagreed, and said that the case involved an issue of the rationality of the rule that was adopted, given the alternatives that were suggested and rejected. <em>Id. </em>at 422.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Here, in contrast, the Director promulgated a series of rules to protect agricultural workers from pesticides, including, as the majority notes, at 502 (quoting CP at 515), \u201c \u2018personal protective clothing, respiratory protection, gloves, training, posting, first aid, emergency facilities, washing facilities, eye-wash requirements, and other provisions designed to protect workers.\u2019 \u201d These rules concern preventive practices, warnings, and emergency practices when contamination occurs, but do not concern medical blood monitoring to determine pesticide exposure. While in <em>Consumers Union </em>the rule challenged, including the omitted provision, directly related to consumer information to be provided in a window sticker on used cars, here none of the rules actually promulgated by the Director in this case can be said to have omitted a naturally related provision concerning medical blood monitoring. Unlike the case in <em>Consumers Union, </em>the gravamen of the pesticide handlers\u2019 challenge with regard to 1993 is the failure to promulgate a mandatory rule for blood testing, i.e., the failure to engage in rule making.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The majority\u2019s equation of the <em>failure to adopt a rule </em>to <em>a rule </em>significantly alters appellate review and fails to accord the considerable deference that applies to an agency\u2019s decision not to adopt a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Lastly, the pesticide handlers argued to the Court of Appeals that their petition for rule making in 1991 satisfies the requirement under RCW 34.05.330(1) for a petition to adopt a rule. That petition led to a number of rules, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>noted, but did not result in a rule regarding testing blood for cholinesterase levels. The 1993 action on that petition did not result in a rule, but rather resulted in the refusal to adopt a rule. The 1991 petition does not satisfy RCW 34-.05.330(1) with regard to the 1997 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">I would reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b568-4\"> The word \u201cmay\u201d means petitioning is permissive in that a person is not required to petition for rule making. However, it does not mean that if rule making is sought, a petition is optional. RCW 34.05.330(1) is the only avenue in the state Administrative Procedure Act for \u201cany person\u201d to initiate rule making. Thus, insofar as the Court of Appeals suggested that the use of \u201cmay in RCW 34.05.330(1) means that a petition need not be filed before seeking judicial review of the failure to engage in rule making, it misreads the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b568-5\"> Other jurisdictions also refuse to consider the failure to engage in rule making under state provisions which permit \u201c \u2018any person\u2019 to submit a petition \u2018requesting the adoption ... of a rule\u2019 \u201d (quoting N.C. Admin. Code tit. 4 r. 3B.0101) where no such petition was filed, on the basis that \u201c \u2018when the legislature has established an effective administrative remedy, it is exclusive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beneficial N.C., Inc. v.

In <em>Public Citizen v. Heckler, </em>653 F. Supp. 1229 (D.D.C. 1986), the Secretary of Health and Human Services declined to promulgate a rule banning the interstate sales of raw milk. She based the decision on the fact that a greater amount of raw milk was marketed and consumed within the producing state, and most illness accordingly occurred there. She concluded the issue was best resolved at the state level. The court found this denial arbitrary and capricious and ordered rule making. The record showed a serious risk of illness resulting from interstate shipments of raw milk, and this risk was not reduced because the amount of milk sold interstate was less than that consumed within the producing state. <em>Id. </em>at 1239. The court also noted that there were formal rule-making proceedings in 1973 followed by 12 years of agency information gathering, a public hearing in 1984, and the compilation of a full administrative record. It was undisputed that all types of raw milk are unsafe and pose a significant health risk. <em>Id. </em>at 1240, 1241. As to the agency\u2019s explanation, the court noted that the evidence in the record showed that the states had been unsuccessful in individual attempts to regulate the sale of raw milk, that the states did not have authority to prohibit sales of raw milk beyond their borders, and that only the federal government, under its commerce clause power, could institute a nationwide ban. <em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In <em>American Horse Protection Ass\u2019n v. Lyng, </em>812 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1987), the challenge was to existing regulations relating to \u201csoring\u201d show horses, i.e., deliberately using weighted devices to injure the horses so that their gait would improve. The Secretary of Agriculture declined to revise the regulations after he reviewed studies and other materials relating to devises used to \u201csore\u201d the horses. <em>Id. </em>at 5. The agency also submitted an affidavit showing fewer findings of violations. <em>Id. </em>The court found the agency\u2019s conclusory reasons for refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>initiate rule making were not the result of reasoned decision making. The court noted that the agency had noted earlier that the existing regulations, which prohibited use of devices of certain weights, but not devices of lesser weight, were inconsistent with the law\u2014Congress had banned soring-\u2014and inconsistent with research. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Also, counsel for the agency appeared to resist the proposition that Congress\u2019 act was intended to prohibit devices reasonably likely to cause soring. <em>Id. </em>The court found nothing ambiguous in the federal act banning soring, concluding that it was designed to end the practice. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Further, Congress had amended the act to stop the practice it thought would end with the original act. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">These two cases show extraordinary circumstances warranting a court\u2019s intervention in the decision not to engage in rule making. The present case is not of the same kind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b580-12\"> Finally, <em>even if </em>rule making is appropriately ordered by this court, the majority has far exceeded its judicial role when it not only directs rule making but directs the precise nature of the rule that must be adopted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\"> Nor do the recommendations comprise a \u201csafety and health standard\u201d under the WISHA, since a standard must <em>require </em>the \u201cadoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.\u201d RCW 49.17.020(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> None of the cases cited by the court for this proposition, <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. v.
