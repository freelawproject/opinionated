Here DSHS acts as a representative payee under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(j) for foster children and then applies the Social Security benefits to reimburse the state budget for payments made to foster parents for the basic needs of those children. We are also asked if DSHS\u2019s actions deprived the foster children of their property absent due process and abridged their right to equal protection of the laws. Lastly the plaintiff class asserts entitlement to an award of reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We hold DSHS as a representative payee violates \u00a7 407(a) of the Act when it applies Social Security benefits to the current maintenance needs of foster children for whom it acts as representative payee. Given this disposition we find it unnecessary to consider the due process and equal protection claims. We remand for further proceedings, including further consideration of the reasonable attorney fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">1. Does DSHS violate \u00a7 407(a) of the Social Security Act when, as a representative payee under \u00a7 405(j) of the Act, it uses Social Security benefits to pay current maintenance costs of children in foster care?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">2. Is the class entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">Foster care in Washington is provided by an amalgam of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>federal, state, and private funds, although the program is largely state-funded. In fiscal year 2000, for example, the total foster care budget was $37.4 million in state funds, plus approximately $12.9 million in federal funds. To be eligible for federal funding under the Social Security Act, a state must provide foster care services under a plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 670.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> RCW 74.13.031<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorizes DSHS to provide foster care services to children in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Foster care is generally provided in Washington to children who have been abused or neglected or have become the responsibility of the state through our juvenile justice laws, Title 13 RCW.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On behalf of these children, the state pays a schedule of monthly allotments to foster parents who in turn pay for the basic necessities such as food, shelter, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>clothing for the children in their charge. As of September 1999, there were 10,578 foster children under DSHS\u2019s supervision. An additional 2,352 children were in the custody of tribal authorities or child care agencies for whom DSHS paid support. Five hundred sixty-seven additional children received support through DSHS\u2019s Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Although DSHS provides foster care for children who need it, it is Washington public policy to attempt to recover the costs of foster care from the parents of children in foster care who are primarily liable for the costs of that care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">It is declared to be the public policy of this state that this chapter be construed and administered to the end that children shall be maintained from the resources of responsible parents, thereby relieving, at least in part, the burden presently borne by the general citizenry through welfare programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">RCW 74.20A.010 (support of dependent children act). <em>See also In re Welfare of Feldman, </em>94 Wn.2d 244, 250, 615 P.2d 1290 (1980) (\u201cIt is true that parents bear the primary responsibility for the support of their children.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In the context of foster care, DSHS implemented the Legislature\u2019s cost recovery policy by regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">Parents of children in foster care paid by the department satisfy their legal obligation to support their children when there is a superior court order for support by paying the amounts specified in the order or in the absence of a superior court order, by paying the amount determined under RCW 74.20A.055 and regulations promulgated in chapter 388-11 WAC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Former WAC 388-70-075(1) (1976), <em>repealed by </em>St. Reg. 01-08-047 (Apr. 30, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">If parents of a foster child are unavailable or unwilling to reimburse DSHS for the costs of foster care, DSHS may reimburse itself using \u201cmoneys and other funds\u201d that come into its possession while the child is in its custody. RCW 74.13.060 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The secretary [of the Department] or his designees or delegatees shall be the custodian without compensation of such moneys and other funds of any person which may come into the possession of the secretary during the period such person is placed with the department of social and health services pursuant to chapter 74.13 RCW. As such custodian, the secretary shall have authority to disburse moneys from the person\u2019s funds for the following purposes only and subject to the following limitations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\">(1) The secretary may disburse any of the funds belonging to such person for such personal needs of such person as the secretary may deem proper and necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">(2) The secretary may apply such funds against the amount of public assistance otherwise payable to such person. This includes applying, as reimbursement, any benefits, payments, funds, or accrual paid to or on behalf of said person from any source against the amount of public assistance expended on behalf of said person during the period for which the benefits, payments, funds or accruals were paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">DSHS implemented RCW 74.13.060 with the following regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">(1) If a child in foster care is entitled to financial benefits the income received shall be used on behalf of the child to help pay for the cost of the foster care received, except for resources held in trust for an American Indian child according to provisions in WAC 388-28-650.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">(a) Income includes SSI [Supplemental Security Income], RSDI [retirement survivors disability insurance], veteran\u2019s benefits, railroad retirement benefits, inheritances, or any other payments for which the child is eligible, unless specifically exempted by the terms and conditions of the receipt of the income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">(b) Receipt of other income as described above shall not relieve the child\u2019s responsible parent(s) of the liability for payment of child support in accordance with WAC 388-70-075 through 388-70-084.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">(2) Any person, agency, or court which receives any payments on behalf of a child in foster care shall remit such payments to the office of support enforcement, in accordance with WAC 388-70-082.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>(3) Resources in the control of a child in foster care shall be treated in accordance with WAC 388-28-400 through 388-28-455.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Former WAC 388-70-069 (1983), <em>repealed by </em>St. Reg. 01-08-047 (Apr. 30, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Where a child is eligible for Social Security benefits,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> federal law provides a process by which a \u201crepresentative payee\u201d may be appointed to administer the funds on behalf of the child. Section 405(j)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Act authorizes the Social Security Administration (Administration or SSA) to appoint such a \u201crepresentative payee\u201d for the child beneficiary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">If the [Administration] determines that the interest of any individual under this subchapter would be served thereby, certification of payment of such individual\u2019s benefit under this subchapter may be made, regardless of the legal competency or incompetency of the individual, either for direct payment to the individual, or for his or her use and benefit, to another individual, or an organization, with respect to whom [certain] requirements . . . have been met (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the individual\u2019s \u201crepresentative payee\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(j)(l)(A); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.2001(b), 416.601(b). Generally, a representative payee is appointed whenever a beneficiary is under 18 years of age. The Administration has an order of preference for representative payees for such children, generally favoring the appointment of parents or relatives of the child; it will appoint an authorized agency only if no parent or guardian is available. The appointment of a state agency like DSHS is the last on that priority list.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(j)(3)(B), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>405(j)(2)(C)(iii)(III); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a)(2)(B); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.2021, 416.621.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The Code of Federal Regulations explains the function of representative payees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">A representative payee may be either a person or an organization selected by us [the Social Security Administration] to receive benefits on behalf of a beneficiary. A representative payee will be selected if we believe that the interest of a beneficiary will be served by representative payment rather than direct payment of benefits. Generally, we appoint a representative payee if we have determined that the beneficiary is not able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments in his or her interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2001(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The appointment of a representative payee such as DSHS may be challenged. The Administration must notify the beneficiary or legal guardian of the appointment of a representative payee and must advise that the beneficiary has the right to a hearing before the Commissioner and judicial review to challenge any appointment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(j)(2)(E)(i), (ii); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a)(2)(B)(xi), (xii).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Representative payees, including state agencies, must use Social Security benefits for the beneficiary, and in the beneficiary\u2019s best interest, under guidelines set forth in the Administration\u2019s regulations. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.2035(a), 416.635(a). The regulations specifically authorize representative payees to use benefits to defray the cost of the beneficiary\u2019s \u201ccurrent maintenance,\u201d including food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal items. The regulations state, in relevant part: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.2040(a)(1), 416.640(a). The regulations also specify that the cost of institutionalized care is an authorized expense. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.2040(b), 416.640(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>We will consider that payments we certify to a representative payee have been used for the use and benefit of the beneficiary if they are used for the beneficiary\u2019s current maintenance. Current maintenance includes cost incurred in obtaining food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>When monthly SSA and/or SSI benefits exceed the amount needed for current maintenance, the representative payee is required to conserve and invest the remaining benefits in trust for the benefit of the beneficiary. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.2045(a), (c), 416.645(a), (c). Large amounts of retroactive benefits must be placed in a separate, dedicated account and may be used only for certain, enumerated expenditures. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.640(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">If a representative payee misuses benefits, the representative payee may be removed by the Administration. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(j)(l)(A); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a)(2)(A)(iii). Moreover, a representative payee\u2019s misuse of the beneficiary\u2019s funds is a felony. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(5). Given the criminal penalty for misuse of funds, some courts have inferred a fiduciary relationship between beneficiary and representative payee, although the statute and implementing regulations do not say as much. <em>See, e.g., Garvey v. Worcester Hous. Auth., </em>629 F.2d 691 (1st Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 925 (1981); <em>Bradley v. Austin, </em>841 F.2d 1288 (6th Cir. 1988); <em>C.G.A. v. State, </em>824 P.2d 1364 (Alaska 1992); <em>In re Estate of Merritt, </em>272 iLL. App. 3d 1017, 651 N.E.2d 680 (1995); <em>Rice v. Perales, </em>156 Misc. 2d 631, 594 N.Y.S.2d 962 (Sup. Ct.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>193 A.D.2d 1135, 599 N.Y.S.2d 211 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In September 1999, of the thousands of foster children in the custody of DSHS pursuant to Title 13 and chapter 74.13 RCW, 1,480 foster care children were receiving Social Security benefits. Nine hundred twenty-three children were receiving SSI benefits, 469 were receiving SSA benefits, and 88 children were receiving both. DSHS acted as a representative payee for 1,411 children in foster care and in DDD.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Two units within DSHS perform the actual function of representative payee for the Social Security benefits of class members. The Children\u2019s Administration (Children\u2019s) provides services to all foster children regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the children also receive Social Security benefits. These services include monitoring the child\u2019s needs, determining special needs, and developing an individual service plan for each child. The Trust Fund Unit accounts for Social Security benefits received by DSHS as representative payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">When a child is placed in foster care, Children\u2019s identifies those children who may be eligible for Social Security benefits and makes an application on their behalf. If Children\u2019s believes a denial of benefits is erroneous, Children\u2019s will appeal for the child. In each case, DSHS also applies to the Administration to become the representative payee for the child (except for developmentally disabled children).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">When DSHS receives Social Security benefits as representative payee for a foster child the funds are deposited in a Foster Care Trust Fund Account at the Office of the State Treasurer. Although the funds are in a single account, the Trust Fund Unit maintains an individual \u201csubsidiary account\u201d for each child for whom benefits are received.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Children\u2019s is responsible for providing the current maintenance needed by a child in foster care. However, Children\u2019s does not normally purchase a child\u2019s food, shelter, clothing, and other items directly. Rather, such items are purchased and provided by the child\u2019s foster parent. Children\u2019s pays the foster parent a fixed amount based on a schedule. Where a special item or expenditure is needed, the Trust Fund Unit will issue a check to either the foster parent or directly to a store or service provider. Such expenditures are authorized by DSHS in its discretion as the representative payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The Trust Fund Unit typically uses a child\u2019s Social Security benefits to pay for a child\u2019s basic foster care expenses. Every month, Children\u2019s generates a report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>showing the amount of money paid by Children\u2019s to a care provider for each child in foster care. The Trust Fund Unit uses this report to determine how much of a child\u2019s SSI and SSA funds it will direct the state treasurer to pay to Children\u2019s. In general, if the amount in the trust fund account is adequ\u00e1te to reimburse the entire cost of foster care, as claimed by Children\u2019s, the entire claimed amount is paid. If the funds in the trust fund account are not adequate to reimburse the entire cost of foster care, the Trust Fund Unit uses up to the amount available in the trust fund account. The amount to be paid for foster care is transferred from the Foster Care Trust Fund Account to Children\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">As representative payee, DSHS has the discretion to expend a child\u2019s SSA or SSI funds on items other than current basic foster care expenses. Children\u2019s staff may request that a child\u2019s benefits be used for extra items or special needs, such as computers, educational expenses, summer camps, counseling, toys, clothing, athletic equipment and orthodontics. When in doubt, the Trust Fund Unit consults with the Administration to determine whether a particular expenditure is authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Children in foster care for whom a person or entity other than DSHS serves as representative payee still receive state-supported foster care. Foster children who do not receive any Social Security benefits are eligible for state funding for extra items and special needs if funds are available in the state foster care budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">DSHS is also authorized to conserve and invest Social Security benefits for foster children. Funds not used for basic foster care or special needs are deposited into a single interest-bearing account. The interest earned on this account is credited to the child\u2019s individual subsidiary account. These funds are ultimately forwarded to a successor representative payee or paid directly to the child upon emancipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">There is a $2,000 resource limit on any child receiving SSI benefits (although funds deposited to the dedicated account are not subject to this limit). DSHS monitors each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>child\u2019s subsidiary account to ensure the balance remains below the limit. When a balance is approaching the resource limit, the Trust Fund Unit notifies Children\u2019s of the need to spend down the account balance. Children\u2019s determines what special needs might be met using the excess funds and requests disbursements from the Trust Fund Unit. DSHS uses reimbursements to Children\u2019s for current expenses as a means of not exceeding the $2,000 limit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK\"> Federal law forbids creditor access to Social Security benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">The right of any person to any future payment under this subchapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Commonly referred to as an antialienation provision, this statute evinces Congress\u2019s intent to remove Social Security benefits from the reach of creditors employing legal process. <em>Dionne v. Bouley, </em>757 F.2d 1344, 1355 (1st Cir. 1985). The statute also prohibits the voluntary transfer or assignment of Social Security benefits by the beneficiary. <em>Gardner v. Ewing, </em>88 F. Supp. 315 (S.D. Ohio), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>185 F.2d 781 (6th Cir. 1950), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>341 U.S. 321, 71 S. Ct. 684, 95 L. Ed. 968 (1951); <em>accord Hurd v. Ill. Bell Tel. Co., </em>136 F. Supp. 125 (N.D. 111. 1955), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>234 F.2d 942 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 918 (1956). As the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Bennett v. Arkansas, </em>485 U.S. 395, 397, 108 S. Ct. 1204, 99 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1988), any state law contrary to \u00a7 407(a) runs afoul of the Supremacy Clause. <em>Accord Crawford v. Gould, </em>56 F.3d 1162, 1165 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The present case arose from DSHS\u2019s treatment of class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>representative Danny Keffeler. Apparently, an overzealous Department employee sought to have Danny\u2019s grandmother and guardian removed as representative payee. DSHS now asserts this was the only time it has ever tried to remove a private representative payee. After four years of litigation involving just Danny, his guardian filed a class action lawsuit in the Okanogan County Superior Court on Danny\u2019s behalf and on behalf of others \u201csimilarly situated.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 1-15. According to the amended complaint, DSHS has now abandoned its efforts to become the representative payee for Danny.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The trial court certified the class, and later amended the certification to include children receiving both SSA and SSI benefits. The class now consists of \u201cAll foster children within the State of Washington, past, present, and future in foster care that receive [either SSA or SSI benefits] for whom the State of Washington acts or has sought to act as \u2018representative payee.\u2019 \u201d CP at 574.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The gravamen of the class action is that DSHS\u2019s actions violate the antialienation provision of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) where DSHS, as representative payee, uses a foster child\u2019s Social Security benefits to reimburse the state for the costs of foster care. The class also presents several constitutional causes of action. First, the class alleges DSHS has acted irrationally, invidiously, and arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Second, the class alleges DSHS\u2019s actions violate the due process clauses of the Washington Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment. Third, the class alleges the state discriminates against the class members \u201cby subjecting them to a lower standard of living than children who are not so situated.\u201d Finally, the class alleges the state \u201cmaliciously, recklessly and wantonly is invading federally protected funds for its own improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>advantage, to the detriment of Plaintiff and all other foster children\u2019s financial and emotional well-being.\u201d CP at 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">In its prayer for relief, the class seeks (i) a permanent injunction enjoining DSHS from using Social Security payments to offset the cost of foster care; (ii) reimbursement to class members of all Social Security payments used by DSHS for reimbursement; and (iii) an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">DSHS moved to dismiss the action, arguing the Administration was an indispensable party that cannot be sued in state court. In response, the class argued it was not claiming the Administration has done anything wrongful, only that DSHS is unlawfully taking Social Security benefits from the class members in violation of federal law. The trial court denied the motion, without analysis, in certifying the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">On cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court filed a memorandum opinion and entered judgment in favor of the class. The trial court held DSHS\u2019s use of Social Security benefits to reimburse the cost of foster care violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a), and DSHS violates procedural due process by failing to provide notice, beyond that required by federal law and regulation, of the \u201cintended result\u201d of the appointment of DSHS as representative payee. The trial court did not address the class\u2019 remaining constitutional arguments, nor did it specifically conclude DSHS was liable for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The trial court\u2019s judgment provided the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">1. An injunction preventing DSHS from taking action to replace any private representative payee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">2. An injunction preventing DSHS from requiring any private representative payee to repay DSHS for the cost of maintaining a child in foster care from Social Security benefit payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-10\">3. An injunction requiring DSHS to provide written notice containing certain information to a child\u2019s parent(s) or legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>guardian whenever DSHS applies to become a representative payee for the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\">4. An injunction preventing DSHS from using Social Security payments to reimburse the costs of foster care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">5. An order requiring DSHS to produce an accounting of Social Security fund disbursements for all children that had been in the custody of DSHS for the purpose of receiving foster care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">6. An order of restitution of Social Security funds used to reimburse DSHS for foster care expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">7. An award of attorney\u2019s fees, with the amount to be determined in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">DSHS appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to Division Three of the Court of Appeals, although no error was assigned to items 1 or 2 referenced above. Because of the importance of the issues in this case, the Court of Appeals certified the case to us and we granted the certification. After the first oral argument of the case, we remanded the matter to the trial court pursuant to RAP 9.11. The parties have supplemented the record and the trial court has made findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">A. DSHS\u2019s actions as representative payee violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Simply put, if DSHS is appointed representative payee for a foster child it will confiscate the child\u2019s SSI money to benefit the state. However, if <em>anyone else </em>is appointed, the state will bear the cost of foster care, and the child\u2019s SSI will be available to benefit the child in addition to the state-funded foster care program. The issue is whether this confiscation violates federal law. For the reasons which follow we believe it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">DSHS admits it would probably not even apply to be a representative payee if it could not rely on the child\u2019s SSI benefits to reimburse the cost of care. By the same token, DSHS admittedly cannot actively seek reimbursement from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>benefits paid to <em>private </em>representative payees because Congress specifically protects Social Security benefits from transfer, assignment, execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, DSHS receives reimbursement for foster care only if it serves as a representative payee, and it only serves as representative payee so it can confiscate the child\u2019s money.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">This scheme stands in stark contrast to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2021 which expressly provides, \u201cOur primary concern is to select the payee who will best serve the <em>beneficiary\u2019s </em>interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Obviously the child is better off with any payee other than the state because DSHS must provide foster care under state law <em>regardless </em>of whether it receives a reimbursement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> DSHS\u2019s self-prioritization is extremely disquieting in the face of a regulatory mandate that we consider these disenfranchised children before enriching government coffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\n<em>DSHS as a creditor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Whether DSHS acts as a <em>creditor </em>when it reimburses itself for foster care costs out of the foster children\u2019s Social Security Administration (SSA) entitlements is the crucial question. If DSHS\u2019s reimbursement scheme is that of a creditor, the antiattachment provisions of \u00a7 407(a) apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>and DSHS\u2019s cost recovery policy runs afoul of a federal statute which preempts state law under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The facial logic of DSHS\u2019s reimbursement scheme demonstrates a creditor relationship, a relationship involving creditor-type acts, vis-a-vis foster children and their SSA benefits. Further, while no federal case addresses the peculiar set of facts involved here, the course of federal precedent in similar situations arising under \u00a7 407(a) undercuts the claim that DSHS complies with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In <em>Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Board, </em>409 U.S. 413, 93 S. Ct. 590, 34 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1973), the United States Supreme Court described the broad protection \u00a7 407 affords Social Security benefits. <em>Philpott </em>declared that \u00a7 407 barred New Jersey\u2019s attempt to reach federal Social Security disability benefits in order to reimburse the state for public assistance expenditures made on behalf of the petitioners. State welfare recipients were made to execute an agreement, as a condition precedent to receiving welfare benefits, to reimburse the county welfare board with any funds that came into their possession. When Philpott refused to turn his SSA disability benefits over to the welfare board the latter sued to enforce the agreement. The Supreme Court held \u00a7 407 on its face prohibited New Jersey from reaching the petitioner\u2019s federal disability payments, explaining, \u201cWe see no reason why a State, performing its statutory duty to take care of the needy, should be in a preferred position as compared with any other creditor.\u201d <em>Philpott, </em>409 U.S. at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Responding to the argument New Jersey may not be a creditor with respect to the SSA benefits, the Court continued: \u201c\u00a7 407 does not refer to any \u2018claim of creditors\u2019; it imposes a broad bar against the use of any legal process to reach all social security benefits. That is broad enough to include all claimants, including a State.\u201d 409 U.S. at 417. This language evinces a federal policy with respect to SSA benefits\u2014the \u201cbroad bar\u201d\u2014which controls this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>The Supreme Court again took up \u00a7 407(a) in <em>Bennett v. Arkansas, </em>485 U.S. 395, 108 S. Ct. 1204, 99 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1988), where Arkansas attempted to attach certain federal benefits paid to individuals incarcerated in Arkansas prisons to reimburse the state for maintaining a prison system. Arkansas argued an \u201cimplied exception\u201d to the broad bar of \u00a7 407(a) (as here) where the state is providing public money for the care and maintenance of the SSA beneficiary. The Court found no such \u201ccare and maintenance\u201d exception for states \u201cgiven the express language of \u00a7 407(a) and the clear intent of Congress that Social Security benefits not be attachable.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>485 U.S. at 397-98. DSHS in the instant case attempts to evade \u00a7 407(a) by arguing that it simply provides the \u201ccare and maintenance\u201d intended by the SSA. We find that argument as unavailing, notwithstanding some factual dissimilarities, as did the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Closer to home, the Ninth Circuit ruled in <em>Brinkman v. Rahm, </em>878 F.2d 263 (9th Cir. 1989) DSHS may not deduct SSA benefits as reimbursement for the costs of care and maintenance, paid out of public funds, for involuntarily committed mental health patients in state hospitals. The court noted, \u201cThe state collects this debt from the appellees by withdrawing [Old Age Survivor\u2019s and Disability Insurance] funds from appellees\u2019 accounts at the state hospital accounting offices,\u201d finding \u00a7 407 preempts this procedure. <em>Brinkman, </em>878 F.2d at 264. There is not a significant enough difference between DSHS\u2019s methods in <em>Brinkman </em>and its methods of reaching the foster children\u2019s SSA benefits in this case<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to justify a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The Ninth Circuit again addressed the issue in <em>Crawford v. Gould, </em>56 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir. 1995) where, under California law, patients committed to state psychiatric hospitals were held responsible for the costs of their own incarceration. California accordingly required all funds and income, including SSA benefits, to which the patient was entitled to be placed in a hospital trust account from which the state could deduct as reimbursement the costs of care and maintenance expended on the patient. The state deducted the money whether or not the patient authorized the deduction. Holding \u00a7 407 preempted this procedure, the Ninth Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">Our conclusion, that \u201cother legal process\u201d includes the procedure that California uses to deduct Social Security benefits, is consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 407. The nonassignment provision was not designed to preclude use of only the judicial process to obtain Social Security benefits. Rather, \u00a7 407(a) is designed \u201cto protect social security beneficiaries and their dependents from the claims of creditors.\u201d The cramped reading of \u00a7 407 California urges would enable the state to obtain Social Security benefits through procedures that afford less protection than judicial process affords.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\"><em>Crawford, </em>56 F.3d at 1166 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">These cases evince an expansive interpretation of the protections of \u00a7 407. The thrust of the case law is that Social Security benefits are, for all intents and purposes, beyond the reach of the state, however clever or subtle its attempt to seize them. <em>Philpott </em>and the cases in its line, including <em>Crawford, </em>are on point and persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The state claims <em>King v. Schafer, </em>940 F.2d 1182 (8th Cir. 1991) justifies DSHS\u2019s position, particularly because DSHS acts as a representative payee under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(j) for the foster children in this case. In <em>King </em>the State of Missouri, as representative payee, received SSA benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>due involuntarily committed mental patients and reimbursed itself for the care and maintenance costs expended out of public funds for the patients. The patients argued the state\u2019s application to become the patient\u2019s representative payee to accept the patients\u2019 SSA benefits violated the \u201cother legal process\u201d provision of \u00a7 407(a). However the <em>King </em>court disagreed, noting the illogic of presuming \u00a7 407(a) would outlaw a procedure (applying to become representative payee) expressly authorized by \u00a7 405(j). \u201cWe cannot agree with the plaintiffs,\u201d wrote the <em>King </em>court, \u201cthat the Department\u2019s participation in the administrative proceeding to become a representative payee is the kind of coercive legal process envisioned by \u00a7 407(a).\u201d <em>King, </em>940 F.2d at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">In light of <em>King, </em>and the fact that DSHS enjoys the status of representative payee (for most) of the foster children under \u00a7 405(j) and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2001(a), the significance of the state\u2019s representative payee status requires further discussion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The <em>King </em>plaintiffs challenged the state\u2019s procedure for applying to become representative payee, arguing that <em>procedure </em>(incident to which the state seized the mental health patient\u2019s SSA benefits) violated \u00a7 407(a) as \u201cother legal process.\u201d However here it is not DSHS\u2019s procedure to apply to become the foster children\u2019s representative payee that is under attack; rather it is DSHS\u2019s practice of reimbursing itself from the foster children\u2019s SSA benefits once it <em>becomes </em>representative payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The difference is subtle, but the distinction is crucial. There is nothing ipso facto wrong with DSHS applying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>become the representative payee for certain foster children, as \u00a7 405(j) and the SSA\u2019s accompanying regulations explicitly contemplate. We may even agree the representative payee application is not \u201cother legal process.\u201d But it is equally clear the reimbursement process <em>is </em>\u201cother legal process,\u201d given the definition of that phrase furnished by <em>Philpott, Brinkman, Bennett, </em>and <em>Crawford. </em>Accordingly, <em>King </em>must be distinguished, as Judge Burchard below correctly concluded, \u201c[T]here is no legal basis for giving foster children less protection for their social security benefits than adult welfare recipients, state prisoners or involuntarily committed mental patients receive.\u201d CP at 627 (Trial Court\u2019s Mem. Op. (Sept. 29, 1998) at 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The state also claims <em>C.G.A. v. State, </em>824 P.2d 1364 (Alaska 1992) supports its position. But <em>C.G.A. </em>said only the state may apply to become a representative payee. <em>C.G.A., </em>824 P.2d at 1366. The court <em>did not hold </em>the state could reimburse itself but deferred that determination to the Social Security agency under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1370. Like <em>King, C.G.A. </em>stands for no more than the uncontested proposition DSHS may apply to become a representative payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">DSHS reimbursement is barred by \u00a7 407(a) because despite DSHS\u2019s status as representative payee it performs the role of creditor when it takes the foster child\u2019s SSA entitlement to reimburse itself for moneys spent on the child. A representative payee may not be a \u201ccreditor of such individual who provides such individual with goods and services for consideration.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(j)(2)(C)(i)(III).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">However to claim DSHS does not provide goods and services for consideration is only to say that DSHS is not the kind of creditor which \u00a7 405(j) excludes from representative payee status. It is not to say the definition of a creditor \u201cwho provides such individual with goods and services for consideration,\u201d <em>id., </em>is an exhaustive definition of other creditors who do not, nor is it to say DSHS cannot become a creditor or act like a creditor despite the fact it is a representative payee. If DSHS is allowed under \u00a7 405(j) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>become a representative payee for the foster children, that fact does not establish the legality of taking the child\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Furthermore, the bare logic of reimbursement also implies a creditor-debtor relationship. Common sense and dictionary definition of \u201creimburse\u201d is \u201c[t]o pay back, to make restoration, to repay that expended; to indemnify, or make whole.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1287 (6th ed. 1990). In common parlance one need not make a payback unless something \u201cloaned\u201d was \u201cowed\u201d by the recipient back to the payee. In fact the public policy of our state to recover the costs expended from public funds on foster children implies exactly this sort of debtor-creditor relationship.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As DSHS presently conceptualizes the matter, RCW 74.13.060 (and its implementing regulation, former WAC 388-70-069 (1983))<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>requires it to reimburse itself for the public assistance it has meted out to foster children from money, including SSA entitlements, that come into the children\u2019s possession. If the Legislature and DSHS did not hold the costs of foster care were somehow \u201cowed\u201d back to the taxpayers, it would not claim the right of DSHS to \u201creimburse\u201d itself on the taxpayer\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">DSHS\u2019s representative payee status further undercuts the legality of its reimbursement process because a representative payee is charged under SSA regulation, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2035, with the responsibility to \u201c[u]se the payments he or she receives only for the use and benefit of the <em>beneficiary </em>in a manner and for the purposes he or she determines, under the guidelines in this subpart, to be in the best interests of the <em>beneficiary\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 404.2035(a) (emphasis added). We seriously doubt using the SSA benefits to reimburse the state for its public assistance expenditure is in all cases, or even some, \u201cin the best interests of the beneficiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Using this money for the care and maintenance of the beneficiary, as required under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2035(a), would indeed be in the best interest of the beneficiary, but that is significantly different from using the money to reimburse the state for payments it made for the care and maintenance of the foster child\u2014especially when that payment to the state cannot be legally compelled and, moreover, could be used or conserved for other special needs of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">As the state concedes, DSHS takes on a fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary role when it acts as representative payee. Br. of Appellants at 3. DSHS\u2019s reimbursement procedure hence constitutes a conflict of interest precisely because DSHS uses the SSA benefits it receives as representative payee in a manner inconsistent with the best interests of the foster children entitled to the money. However worthy cost recovery might be, DSHS cannot violate federal law at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the expense of foster children to accomplish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Accordingly we hold each instance of reimbursement makes DSHS a creditor, or, if not a creditor, then at least committed to a creditor-type action that is preempted by the \u201cbroad bar\u201d of \u00a7 407(a). DSHS\u2019s application under \u00a7 405(j) to become a foster child\u2019s representative payee is at best immaterial to the analysis pertaining to its use of SSA benefits as reimbursement, or is at worst incompatible with that use of the benefits, as discussed above. Given our view that the state\u2019s actions violate the Supremacy Clause we find it unnecessary to consider other alleged constitutional infirmities such as deprivation of property without due process or denial of the equal protection of the law. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">B. The trial court award of attorney fees is not sufficiently specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The summary judgment which we review provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">It is hereby ordered that plaintiff should be awarded attorney fees, the amount of which, and the theory under which awarded, shall abide future ruling of this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Pl.\u2019s Order Granting Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Summ.

The quoted language does not clarify the scope or basis of the attorney fee award and therefore must be revisited on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\"> Under the American Rule for attorney fees, compensation may be awarded only if authorized by contract, statute, or a recognized ground in equity. <em>Bowles v. Dep\u2019t of Ret. Sys., </em>121 Wn.2d 52, 70, 847 P.2d 440 (1993) (citing <em>Painting &amp; Decorating Contractors of Am.., Inc. v. Ellensburg Sch.

A well-established equitable ground for awarding attorney fees is the common fund doctrine. <em>See Covell v. City of Seattle, </em>127 Wn.2d 874, 891, 905 P.2d 324 (1995); <em>Bowles, </em>121 Wn.2d at 70; <em>Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>90 Wn.2d at 542-45. It applies when a litigant preserves or creates a common fund for the benefit of an ascertainable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>category of persons. <em>Miotke v. City of Spokane, </em>101 Wn.2d 307, 339, 678 P.2d 803 (1984) (quoting <em>Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 v. Kottsick, </em>86 Wn.2d 388, 390-91, 545 P.2d 1 (1976)). The doctrine serves important public functions, and, in light of the purpose of the American Rule for attorney fees, should be applied only when such functions are met. <em>Accord Covell, </em>127 Wn.2d at 892 (awarding attorney fees based on the common fund doctrine because the policy reasons \u201cclearly are supported\u201d). If properly applied, it provides greater access to those who otherwise may be unable to afford the services of an attorney. <em>Bowles, </em>121 Wn.2d at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Although the common fund doctrine provides an avenue whereby attorneys may be reimbursed from the fund created, other equitable and/or statutory grounds may allow an affirmative recovery against the nonprevailing party. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, for example, may provide an arguable basis for such an award; however, neither the trial court nor the parties have adequately articulated the equitable or statutory basis to impose liability against the state for reasonable attorney fees and expenses of litigation in the context of this case. This issue therefore must be considered further on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">We therefore hold DSHS violated \u00a7 407(a) of the Act when acting as the representative payee under \u00a7 405(j) of the Act by reimbursing itself for foster care payments, contrary to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s result, remanding for further appropriate proceedings consistent with this opinion.

If SSA chooses to make DCFS [Division of Children and Family Services] the Representative Payee, the actual checks are sent to the Department\u2019s Office of Financial Recovery and the money is then <em>transferred to a suspense account </em>in the Department\u2019s Office of Accounting Services. <em>This money is used to reimburse the Department </em>for monthly foster care expenses, including food, clothing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>shelter and other personal or medical expenses as governed by the Code of Federal Regulations.

This fact is of some interest in light of <em>King, </em>because the <em>King </em>court found that with respect to those mental health patients for whom the state was <em>not </em>the representative payee, the state\u2019s attempts to reach the SSA benefits <em>did </em>constitute \u201cother legal process\u201d and was preempted by \u00a7 407(a). <em>King v.

However, the majority goes too far in concluding that <em>any </em>use of social security funds by DSHS violates the antiattachment rule. Under a fair reading of the controlling federal statute and regulatory authority, DSHS is entitled to use the funds to pay for <em>current </em>maintenance costs, provided that any special needs of the children are satisfied first.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The federal law governing the appointment of representative payees and the use to which funds received on behalf of beneficiaries can be put is 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(j). RCW 74.13.060 allows DSHS to become the custodian (i.e., representative payee) \u201cwithout compensation\u201d of social security funds<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> payable to foster children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">The secretary or his designees or delegatees shall be the custodian without compensation of such moneys and other funds of any person which may come into the possession of the secretary during the period such person is placed with the department of social and health services pursuant to chapter 74.13 RCW.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Tracking federal law, state law provides that once DSHS becomes the custodian (\u201crepresentative payee\u201d) of the funds, DSHS is permitted to spend these funds <em>only </em>for the child\u2019s \u201cpersonal needs\u201d or to reimburse the state for \u201cthe amount of public assistance otherwise payable to\u201d the child during the period for which the benefits were paid. RCW 74.13.060(1), (2). Former WAC 388-70-069 (1983), <em>repealed by </em>St. Reg. 01-08-047 (Apr. 30, 2001), specifically allowed the social security funds to be used on behalf of the child to help defray the state\u2019s cost for foster care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">(1) If a child in foster care is entitled to financial benefits the income received shall be used on behalf of the child to help pay for the cost of the foster care received, except for resources held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>in trust for an American Indian child according to provisions in WAC 388-28-650.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">(a) Income includes SSI, RSDI [retirement survivors disability insurance], veteran\u2019s benefits, railroad retirement benefits, inheritances, or any other payments for which the child is eligible, unless specifically exempted by the terms and conditions of the receipt of the income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The majority concludes that \u201cIf DSHS\u2019s reimbursement scheme is that of a creditor, the antiattachment provisions of \u00a7 407(a) [of the Social Security Act] apply and DSHS\u2019s cost recovery policy runs afoul of a federal statute which preempts state law.\u201d Majority at 17-18. This statement is misleading in its scope. The Social Security Act, chapter 7, 42 U.S.C., does not rule out appointment of a creditor as representative payee in all situations. One of the exceptions to the antiattachment provisions of the act allows the appointment of \u201can individual who is determined by the Commissioner... to be acceptable to serve.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(j)(2)(C)(iii)(V). Thus, even if DSHS is characterized as a creditor, the commissioner of social security may find, and here <em>has </em>found, DSHS acceptable to serve as a representative payee for these children in foster care.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The determination of the Social Security Act should control. The real issue, in my view, is the conflict of interest that arises when DSHS serves both as a representative payee and as a creditor for the <em>same </em>funds (which funds belong to the eligible child, the beneficiary) and the permissible uses of such funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Federal regulations not only govern the selection of a representative payee, but also define the lawful uses to which a representative payee may put the social security funds entrusted to its care. Specifically, a representative payee has a responsibility to \u201c[u]se the payments he or she receives only for the use and benefit of the beneficiary in a manner and for the purposes he or she determines, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the guidelines in this subpart, to be in the best interests of the beneficiary.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.635(a). <em>Current maintenance, </em>including the cost of food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items, is deemed to be for the use and benefit of the beneficiary. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.640(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">An example in the regulations clarifies the definition of \u201cuse and benefit\u201d in the context of payments to an institution for current maintenance of the beneficiary and indicates a clear intent that special needs of the beneficiary should take precedence over general maintenance or reimbursement for care.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The example states that the representative payee should deduct the cost of special needs items from the amount paid to the institution, and also makes clear that any remaining money may be used for current maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The majority relies on four federal cases to assert that DSHS may not use social security funds for current maintenance: <em>Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Board, </em>409 U.S. 413, 93 S. Ct. 590, 34 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1973) (holding that New Jersey may not attach social security benefits to reimburse itself for welfare benefits); <em>Bennett v. Arkansas, </em>485 U.S. 395, 108 S. Ct. 1204, 99 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1988) (holding that Arkansas may not attach federal benefits for care and maintenance of prisoners); <em>Brinkman v. Rahm, 878 </em>F.2d 263 (9th Cir. 1989) (forbidding Washington State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>from attaching federal benefits for the care of involuntarily committed mental health patients); and <em>Crawford v. Gould, </em>56 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that California may not deduct the costs of caring for psychiatric inpatients from a trust account to which social security payments were deposited).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">These cases are readily distinguished from the DSHS practice at issue here. Critically, none of the cited federal cases involve the expenditure of social security benefits by a state that was designated as a representative payee. In fact, the class certified in <em>Brinkman </em>specifically excluded patients for whom the state served as representative payee. <em>Brinkman, </em>878 F.2d at 264. As explained above, under federal regulations a representative payee has considerable authority to spend the funds entrusted to its control, provided the expenditures are for the best interests of the beneficiary. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.635(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Thus, the issue as I see it is not whether DSHS may spend the funds for current maintenance, provided it gives priority to special needs of the foster children, but whether it may use those funds to reimburse itself for <em>past </em>maintenance or for its own administrative services, such as mileage reimbursements for social workers. The fact that DSHS in the context of reimbursing itself for <em>past </em>care of the beneficiary puts its need for reimbursement ahead of the needs of the foster children further demonstrates the fundamental conflict between its roles as representative payee and creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The federal mandate to give priority to the special needs of the beneficiary directly conflicts with the express policy of DSHS to conserve the expenditure of public assistance funds on foster care and thereby lighten the burden on the taxpayer. <em>See </em>chapter 74.20 RCW (Support of Dependent Children):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">It is the responsibility of the state of Washington through the state department of social and health services to conserve the expenditure of public assistance funds, whenever possible, in order that such funds shall not be expended if there are private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>funds available or which can be made available by judicial process or otherwise to partially or completely meet the financial needs of the children of this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">RCW 74.20.010. The state aggressively pursues this recovery policy, not only seeking money for current maintenance but also sweeping lump sum payments into the treasury to prevent a child\u2019s account from exceeding the $2,000 resource limit imposed by the Social Security Administration (SSA).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In order to provide states with an incentive to provide financial assistance to needy individuals awaiting disposition of their Supplemental Security Income (SSI) applications, Congress provided that back payments made at the time the secretary makes the <em>first </em>payment would be exempt from the general antiattachment rule. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(g)(2). However, a recent case held that a retroactive payment after a period of denial is not the same as an initial payment and therefore does not fall under the exemption to the antiattachment rule that is found in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(g)(2). <em>Catarine v. Wing, </em>274 A.D.2d 310, 710 N.Y.S.2d 569 (2000). <em>Accord Conaway v. Soc. Servs. Admin., </em>298 Md. 639, 471 A.2d 1058 (1984) (holding that the use of conserved social security benefits to reimburse the cost of past foster care is prohibited). Thus, the lump sums that DSHS \u201csweeps\u201d into the treasury to reimburse the state for past foster care expenses cannot fall under the initial payment exception. There is no other exception which would validate DSHS\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">This sweeping of lump sums is not only unauthorized under any exception to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a), but also often constitutes double reimbursement. The sums \u201cswept\u201d to the treasury frequently reimburse the state for amounts already paid by the federal government under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or paid by parental support. DSHS apparently keeps no accurate record to allow tracing of the \u201cswept\u201d sums.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Under \u00a7 407(a), rights to future payments are not transferable or assignable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The right of any person to any future payment under this subchapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a). DSHS receives the payments not on its own behalf, but on behalf of the beneficiaries, and is not permitted to assign pending (i.e., future) payments to the reimbursement of its expenditures on behalf of the foster children. Where an agency puts reimbursement to itself ahead of the best interests of the child, ignoring the policy expressed in the federal regulations to prioritize the child\u2019s special needs, it effectively transfers the payments to its own use. This transfer from the state in its role as representative payee to the state in its role as guardian of the public purse is contrary to \u00a7 407(a). Where the agency pursues that policy to the extent of double reimbursement, the conflict of interest is egregious.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">To the extent that RCW 74.20A.010 encourages the state to \u201csweep\u201d a child\u2019s benefits into the treasury to repay past-due foster care, I agree with the majority that the statute is incompatible with \u00a7 405(j), which forbids any \u201csubstantial conflict of interest\u201d between the payee and the beneficiary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(j)(2)(C)(iv)(II). <em>See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(j)(l)(A) (mandating removal of a representative payee if the commissioner or a court of competent jurisdiction later determines that it has misused any individual\u2019s benefit.) It is also incompatible with \u00a7 407(a), which prevents transfer of the benefits. Under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, federal law takes precedence. Thus, any use of social security funds for purposes other than current care and maintenance is unlawful, as is giving priority to maintenance over the children\u2019s special needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">I agree with the majority that in relying on RCW 74.20A.010, DSHS has given preference to the interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the taxpayer over the special needs of foster children and has acted as creditor by reimbursing itself for past payment of foster care, directly contrary to \u00a7\u00a7 405(j) and 407(a) of the Social Security Act. But for reasons already set forth in this opinion, I would remand this matter to the trial court with directions to modify the injunction to prevent DSHS from using social security payments to reimburse the costs of <em>past due </em>foster care <em>or other expenses not directly related to current maintenance, and to require DSHS give special needs a higher priority than current maintenance. </em>On remand, the trial court should order DSHS to produce an accounting of social security fund disbursements for all children that had been in the custody of DSHS for the purpose of receiving foster care, establish restitution of social security funds used to reimburse DSHS for <em>past due </em>foster care expenses, <em>other expenses not directly related to current maintenance, and unmet special needs, </em>and determine appropriate attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">I thus respectfully concur in part and dissent in part from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Ireland, J., and Guy, J. Pro Tern., concur with Bridge, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Reconsideration denied December 14, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\"> Social Security (SSA) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\"> If the commissioner may find an individual acceptable to serve, he may presumably find an entity acceptable to serve. This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the commissioner routinely appoints entities such as DSHS to serve as representative payees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\"><em>Example: </em>An institutionalized beneficiary is entitled to a monthly Social Security benefit of $320. The institution charges $700 a month for room and board.

He also takes the beneficiary to see a movie which costs $3. When they return to the institution, the payee gives his brother $3 to be used at the canteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Although the payee normally withholds only $25 a month from Social Security benefit for the beneficiary\u2019s personal needs, this month the payee deducted the above expenditures and paid the institution $10 less than he usually pays.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">The above expenditures represent what we would consider to be proper expenditures for current maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2040(2)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
