The United States Court of Federal Claims dismissed the shareholders\u2019 complaint because they had not shown that they had a contract with the government. <em>Cain v. United States, </em>53 Fed.Cl. 658 (2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b899-19\">A. The background and consequences of the savings and loan industry\u2019s financial crisis in the 1980\u2019s has been frequently described and need not be repeated here. See <em>United States v. Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996); <em>Landmark Land Co. v. FDIC, </em>256 F.3d 1365 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>Glass v. United States, </em>258 F.3d 1349 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>The crisis arose because the interest rates the thrifts had to pay on deposits were higher than the interest rates they received on their long-term real estate mortgages in which their capital was invested. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board (\u201cBank Board\"), the agency that regulated the thrifts, tried to alleviate the situation by encouraging economically healthy thrifts and individuals to acquire or invest in the financially troubled institutions. To induce such acquisitions or investments, the Bank Board permitted the troubled thrifts to follow accounting practices under which their capital for regulatory purposes included losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">In 1989, Congress reacted to this situation by enacting the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (\u201cFinancial Reform Act\u201d), Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183. That Act, among other things, prohibited thrifts from employing those accounting practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The result was that numerous thrifts no longer complied with the regulatory capital requirements and were placed in receivership. Many of them and their stockholders filed suits against the United States to recover their losses. The cases included claims for breach of contract and Fifth Amendment takings.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In <em>Winstar, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of this court, 64 F.3d 1531 (1995), that \u201cthe United States is liable to respondents [three thrifts] for breach of contract.\u201d 518 U.S. at 910, 116 S.Ct. 2432. The contracts there permitted the three failed thrifts to meet regulatory capital requirements by using a \u201c \u2018fictional asset\u2019 called \u2018supervisory goodwill\u2019 that represented the excess of the thrift\u2019s liabilities over its assets,\u201d and to amortize that \u201casset\u201d over a substantial period. <em>FDIC v. United States, </em>342 F.3d 1313, 1315 (Fed. Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Landmark, </em>256 F.3d at 1370). Most of the Winstar-related cases we have decided also have involved such supervisory goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">B. The present case involves a different but comparable accounting system. Security Federal Savings Bank (\u201cSecurity Federal\u201d), a mutual thrift owned by its depositors, in 1982 sold most of its low-interest loans at a loss of $4.25 million. <em>Cain, </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 660. The Bank Board permitted the thrift to treat the loss as part of its regulatory capital requirements and to amortize part of the loss over the original loan period. <em>Id. </em>Despite this action, Security Federal\u2019s financial condition continued to deteriorate. <em>Id. </em>The shareholders\u2019 complaint stated: \u201c[i]n late 1986 and early 1987, as solution to Security Federal\u2019s capital deficiency problems, the [Bank Board] suggested that plaintiffs convert the thrift from a \u2018mutual\u2019 association to a \u2018stock\u2019 association.\u201d Cain Pis.\u2019 2nd Am. Compl. 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Security Federal\u2019s board of directors adopted such a conversion plan, under which the directors would provide additional capital by purchasing the newly-issued stock. The board of directors authorized Security Federal\u2019s president, Laurance Hardee, \u201cto negotiate and \u2018take any and all such action as [he] may deem necessary or desirable in order to implement the Plan of Conversion and the transactions contemplated thereby ..., to prepare and file an Application for Approval of Conversion (Form AC) with the [Bank Board] ..., and to take any and all such other action as is or may be necessary or required in connection with such filing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cain, </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 660 (alterations in original). \u201c[0]n behalf of Security Federal,\u201d Hardee informed the Bank Board that \u201cit was preparing a proposal to convert from a mutual association to a stock institution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Security Federal\u2019s law firm, Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, prepared and filed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>the Bank Board a conversion application. <em>Id. </em>The application was filed for \u201cSECURITY FEDERAL SAVINGS &amp; LOAN ASSOCIATION OF PANAMA CITY\u201d and was signed \u201cBY: Laurance A. Hardee, Director, President and Principal Financial Officer (Duly Authorized Representative).\u201d On the following page, after the word \u201cAttest:\u201d were the signatures of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Controller, a Director who also was the Secretary-Treasurer, and four other Directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">The Bank Board initially rejected the application because the converted thrift proposed to use the historical accounting method instead of the \u201cpush-down\u201d accounting method that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles required. <em>Id. </em>at 661. <em>see 12 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 563b.27(p)(1987). This was significant because under \u201cpush-down\u201d accounting, the converted thrift could not treat its loan-sale losses as part of its regulatory capital and amortize them, which it could continue to do under historical basis accounting. <em>Cain, </em>53 Fed. Cl. at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Extensive discussions and negotiations ensued between the law firm, which acted on behalf of the thrift, Hardee, and the regulators. It was made clear that the directors would not invest in the stock of the converted thrift unless it could continue to treat the loan losses as part of its regulatory capital. Cain Pis.\u2019 2nd Am. Compl. 1124. The matter was settled by the thrift agreeing to use \u201cpush-down\u201d accounting and the Bank Board permitting the thrift to continue using the loan losses as part of its regulatory capital. <em>Cain, </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 661-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">By letter dated December 23, 1987, the Bank Board approved the conversion. The letter, addressed to the four directors who had acquired the largest number of shares and to Security Federal\u2019s board of directors, approved the application. <em>Id. </em>at 661. The Bank Board also did not disapprove Notices of Change of Control of the thrift that the four principal stockholders had submitted, provided that seven specified conditions were \u201ccomplied with.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662. One of those conditions was that the four stockholders enter into an agreement with the new thrift that would limit the amount of dividends it could pay. <em>Id. </em>All the stockholders signed such an agreement with Security Federal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The approval letter further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-9\">\n<em>DEFERRED LOAN LOSSES</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-10\">The New Association is hereby allowed to carry forward the \u201cdeferred loan losses,\u201d as defined in Part 563c.l4, reported as of the date of consummation of the conversion as a special component of its regulatory capital, provided that the \u201cdeferred loan losses\u201d be amortized in accordance with currently prevailing regulations ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-11\"><em>Id. </em>Finally, the letter concluded with a \u201cTAX CERTIFICATION.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">The letter was signed by a representative of the Bank Board\u2019s Office of General Counsel and a representative of the Office of Regulatory Policy, Oversight and Supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">Security Federal converted from a mutual to a stock thrift. <em>Id. </em>The appellants purchased its stock for $3.425 million. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">Several months later, the Financial Reform Act was enacted. The Act \u201crestricted the ability of thrifts to count intangible assets, including [deferred loan losses] and goodwill, towards their regulatory capital requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(t)). It also mandated regulations requiring thrifts to use Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1463(b)(2) (2000). It abolished the Bank Board \u201cand created the Office of Thrift Supervision (\u2018OTS\u2019), which was responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>for the regulation and supervision of all federally insured thrifts.\u201d <em>Cain, </em>53 Fed. Cl. at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">\u201cOTS issued regulations that prohibited the use of DLLs [deferred loan losses] as assets for the purpose of computing regulatory capital requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOTS informed Security Federal that it was not in compliance with minimal capital standards and required it to submit a capital plan demonstrating how it intended to remain in compliance with such standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecurity Federal\u2019s capital plan was denied because Security Federal intended to continue including its DLLs in calculating its minimum capital requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Security Federal\u2019s response was to file suit against OTS in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida. That court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining OTS \u201cfrom enforcing against the plaintiffs any regulatory capital requirements inconsistent with the 1987 conversion agreement for Security Federal Savings Bank of Florida.\u201d <em>Sec. Fed. Sav. Bank of Fla. v. Dir., Office of Thrift Supervision, </em>747 F.Supp. 656, 660 (N.D.Fla. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">The injunction did not save Security Federal, whose \u201cfinancial condition continued to deteriorate, and it failed to meet all of its regulatory capital requirements.\u201d <em>Cain, </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 663. In January 1992, Security Federal was placed in receivership. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">C. Seven Security Federal shareholders (\u201cthe Shareholders\u201d), the appellants in the present case, filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the United States seeking damages for breach of contract. In their second amended complaint, the Shareholders alleged that \u201c[t]his action stems from a contract between plaintiffs and the defendant entered into as a part of the conversion of Security Federal Savings Bank of Florida (\u2018Security Federal\u2019) from a mutual association to a stock company,\u201d Cain Pis.\u2019 2nd Am. Compl. 112; that \u201c[t]he documents and transactions described above ... collectively evidence and establish the contract under which the United States promised these individual plaintiffs that it would recognize deferred loan losses as capital of Security Federal for the full amortization period provided in the regulations then applicable (\u2018the Agreement\u2019),\u201d <em>Id. </em>H 30; and that the government had breached that contract when it precluded Security Federal from including deferred loan losses in its regulatory capital, <em>Id. </em>111140-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Following the filing of numerous motions, including motions to dismiss and for summary judgment by the Shareholders, the court dismissed the Shareholders\u2019 claims because the Shareholders had no privity of contract with the government. The court ruled that the Shareholders \u201cdo not have standing to pursue direct breach of contract claims against the government relating to the 1987 conversion of Security Federal.\u201d <em>Cain, </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 666. The court stated that the Shareholders could not \u201cdemonstrate how they were injured independently of their status as shareholders,\u201d and that \u201cany injury suffered by the [Shareholders] cannot be distinguished in any meaningful way from the injury suffered by Security Federal when its ability to count DLLs towards regulatory capital, as allowed by the [Bank Board\u2019s] approval letter, was taken away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">The court concluded that the evidence upon which the Shareholders relied to show that they had entered into a contract with the government, discussed in Part II below, \u201cdoes not indicate that the [Bank Board] treated the acquirers as contracting parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665. Finally, the court stated that \u201cthe pertinent facts in this case are indistinguishable from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>[sic] of <em>First Hartford Corp. Pension Plan &amp; Trust v. United States, </em>42 Fed. Cl. 599 (1998), <em>ajfd, </em>194 F.3d 1279 (Fed.Cir.1999),\u201d in which this court held that a shareholder of a failed thrift could not maintain a damage suit against the United States based on a similar alleged breach of contract claim because it was not in privity with the government since \u201cthe Agreement at issue was entered into by the bank and not the shareholder.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">The court also rejected the Shareholders\u2019 claim that they could maintain their suit as third party beneficiaries of a contract between Security Federal and the government. <em>Cain, </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 666. The Shareholders\u2019 appeal does not challenge that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">In addition to the Shareholders\u2019 suit, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), as the receiver of Security Federal, filed its own complaint in intervention on behalf of the thrift to recover damages for breach of contract. The court dismissed that complaint because it did not present any case or controversy between the FDIC and the government, since the FDIC would have to return to the government any recovery it might obtain on behalf of the thrift. <em>Id. </em>The FDIC appealed from that ruling but subsequently dismissed its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">The contract that the Shareholders contend they entered into with the government allegedly was formed by (1) the Shareholders offering to invest more than $3,000,000 in the converted thrift, and (2) the Bank Board permitting the converted thrift to continue to include in its regulatory capital its deferred loan losses. The Shareholders\u2019 theory is that the Bank Board accepted their offer and thereby created a contract by approving the conversion in its letter of December 23, 1987. The Shareholders emphasize that that letter was addressed not only to Security Federal\u2019s board of directors but also to the four largest shareholders, including Har-dee, the thrift\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">This court recently noted: \u201cFor a contract to be formed once an offer is made, there must be an acceptance, i.e., a \u2018manifestation of assent to the terms thereof made by the offeree in a manner invited or required by the offer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>344 F.3d 1343, 1355 (Fed. Cir.2003). The record may be searched in vain for any showing of \u201cthe necessary \u2018manifest assent,\u2019 [by the Bank Board] under our precedent, to form a contract [with the Shareholders] for the extended amortization of goodwill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">The December 23, 1987 letter shows no intent by the Bank Board to enter into any contract with the Shareholders. The first two paragraphs stated that \u201c[w]e have completed our review of the application filed ...\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-11\">to convert from a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association to a federally chartered stock savings and loan association pursuant to Section 5(i), (p) of the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cHOLA\u201d), 12 U.S.C. Section 1464(i)(2) (1982), and Subpart C of Part 563b of the Rules and Regulations for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, 12 C.F.R. Sections 563b.20-563b.32, in a voluntary supervisory conversion in which the Association will issue approximately 350,000 shares of conversion common stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-12\">We have also completed our review of the Notices of Change of Control of the Association filed by Messrs. Hardee, Harrison, Haney and Dantzler (collectively, the \u201cAcquirors\u201d) for authority to acquire control of the Association pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Section 1730(q) and 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>C.F.R. Part 574, upon consummation of its conversion to stock form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-5\">The third paragraph stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-6\">On the basis of the information contained in all of the afore-mentioned applications, the Office of General Counsel (\u201cOGC\u201d), and the Office of Regulatory Policy, Oversight and Supervision (\u201cOR-POS\u201d) have determined, after having made all required findings and determinations, to approve all of the aforesaid applications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-7\">The letter continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">The Association is hereby authorized to convert from the mutual to the stock form of organization and to adopt the proposed form of stock charter and bylaws submitted with the application, and the Acquirors\u2019 Change-In-Control Notices regarding the acquisition of control of the Association as a result of that conversion are hereby not disapproved; provided that the following conditions are complied with to the satisfaction of the Supervisory Agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">The letter then listed seven conditions, including that the conversion be completed within ninety days, that \u201ccounsel for the Association ... submit an opinion to the Supervisory Agent, indicating that the proposed merger did not result in any significant tax liability to the Association or the New Association,\u201d and that within thirty days \u201cthe Acquirors and the New Association sign an agreement ... that ... dividends paid by New Association shall be limited to 50 percent of net income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">The letter then set forth the <em>\u201cDEFERRED LOAN LOSSES\u201d </em>provision quoted in Part I B above, stating that \u201c[t]he New Association is hereby allowed to carry forward the \u2018deferred loan losses\u2019, as defined in Part 563c,14,\u201d on the terms specified. Finally, as noted, the letter contained a \u201cTAX CERTIFICATION.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">The December 23 letter does not contain or provide any contractual commitment by the Bank Board to the Shareholders. Instead, on its face it constitutes and reflects no more than the Bank Board\u2019s regulatory approval of the proposed conversion of Security Federal into a stock company. The provisions of the letter described above are typical regulatory actions \u2014 approval of the conversion of the thrift and the imposition of terms and conditions for such action, approval of the acquisition of control of the thrift by the principal Shareholders, authorization for the new association to include the deferred loan losses in its regulatory capital, and granting of a tax certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">\u201cAn agency\u2019s performance of its regulatory or sovereign functions does not create contractual obligations. Something more is necessary.\u201d <em>D &amp; N Bank v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 1374, 1378-79 (Fed.Cir. 2003) (citation omitted), <em>reh\u2019g denied, reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>331 F.3d 1374 (Fed.Cir. 2003). Here there is nothing more than the Bank Board\u2019s performance of its regulatory function.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">The Bank Board\u2019s addressing of the notice of approval to the thrift\u2019s four largest shareholders can not be viewed as manifesting intent to enter into a contract with them. The obvious reason for the Board doing so was because the Board\u2019s approval letter also authorized them to acquire control of the new association. Since those four had filed the applications to acquire control, the Bank Board naturally sent them its letter approving such acquisition. Indeed, if the Bank Board intended to enter into a contract with the Shareholders, why would it have sent the letter only to four of the seven of them?</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">The Shareholders also rely on an affidavit by Hardee, executed in 1997, 10 years after the events in question, that \u201c[i]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>1987, acting as President of Security Federal and in an individual capacity on behalf of [himself] and the other plaintiffs in this lawsuit,\u201d he negotiated with the Bank Board \u201cconcerning the terms and conditions under which Security Federal would convert from a \u2018mutual\u2019 association to a \u2018stock\u2019 association owned by its shareholders, and under which the officers and directors of Security Federal, including all the plaintiffs in this action, would invest their own funds to purchase all the stock in the new corporation.\u201d The affidavit stated that in a letter he sent to the Bank Board via Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius in July 1987, he \u201cexplained] that preserving-deferred loan losses as a component of Security Federal\u2019s regulatory capital was <em>absolutely essential </em>to [their] willingness to invest in Security Federal.\u201d (emphasis in original). The letter, however, did not contain this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">The Shareholders also point to their own affidavits (also executed in 1997) that state they \u201cdesignated\u201d Hardee \u201cto act on [their] behalf in negotiating the terms of the conversion and the acquisition of the stock in the new institution with the [Bank Board] and other government entities.\u201d Although these affidavits may show that a condition of the Shareholders\u2019 investment in the converted thrift was that it be permitted to use its deferred loan losses as part of its regulatory capital, they do not show that in authorizing that practice the Bank Board entered into a contract with the Shareholders. Indeed, the Shareholders\u2019 interest was fully protected as long as the Bank Board authorized the thrift to do so \u2014 which was precisely what it did and all that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The conclusion that there was no contract between the Bank Board and the Shareholders is further supported by the application for conversion. The application was filed for Security Federal \u201cBy\u201d Hardee, as its \u201cDirector, President and Principal Financial Officer.\u201d Although on the following page, six of the directors (including the Chairman of the Board) and the Controller \u201cAttested]\u201d to the document by signing their names, that action merely reflected their attestation that they had authorized the filing of the application. It did not make them parties to the application, much less than to a contract between themselves and the Bank Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">At oral argument the Shareholders cited seven documents in the record that, they contended, supported their claim that they had negotiated and entered into a contract with the Bank Board permitting the converted thrift to continue using deferred loan losses as part of regulatory capital. Three of those documents were letters between the Bank Board and Security Federal\u2019s counsel, Morgan, Lewis <em>&amp; </em>Bockius. Another was the dividend restriction agreement between Security Federal and the four principal shareholders, which the Board\u2019s approval of the conversion agreement required them to enter into. Two other documents were internal memoranda between members of the Bank Board staff. The final document was the Bank Board\u2019s December 28, 1987 letter approving the conversion, which we already have discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Neither individually nor collectively do those documents support the Shareholders\u2019 contention that they entered into a contract with the Bank Board or undermine the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 contrary conclusion. Indeed, even \u201ca cloud of evidence that could be consistent with a contract does not satisfy the plaintiffs burden of proving mutual intent.\u201d <em>First Commerce Corp. v. United States, </em>335 F.3d 1373, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The Shareholders also argue that the Court of Federal Claims improperly dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>missed their complaint without a trial because their \u201ccomplaint unquestionably alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a contract between [themselves] and the government.\u201d Cain Br. at 12. As we have shown, however, the record does not contain evidence that would establish a contract between the Shareholders and the Bank Board. The Shareholders point to no additional evidence they would have introduced at a trial that would show such a contract, and they make no claim that the procedure the Court of Federal Claims followed in deciding this case precluded them from introducing any additional evidence that would have produced a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Of course, whether the government entered into a contract with a thrift\u2019s shareholders necessarily turns on the facts of the particular case. Our decision in this case, however, is consistent with our prior cases in which we held that there was no contract between a thrift\u2019s shareholders and the government. <em>See, e.g., Castle v. United States, </em>301 F.3d 1328, 1339-41 (Fed.Cir.2002), <em>reh\u2019g denied, reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>64 Fed.Appx. 227, 2003 WL 21212568 (Fed.Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 2572, 156 L.Ed.2d 602 (2003); <em>First Hartford, </em>194 F.3d 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">The Court of Federal Claims correctly dismissed the Shareholders\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">The judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b906-12\">PAULINE NEWMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai5B\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">Respectfully, I dissent. This case is not distinguishable from the definitive decision of <em>United States v. Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996), wherein the government agreed to a specified accounting method, including accounting for supervisory goodwill as regulatory capital with long-term amortization, in order to induce a cash investment that was adequate to meet the then-existing regulatory requirements. The documented mutual promises and forbearances that here occurred track those of <em>Winstar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">The private investors who are the plaintiffs here, like the private investor in <em>Winstar, </em>agreed to contribute and did contribute capital to a failing thrift, upon written commitments from the Bank Board including federal approval of the terms of the investment and conditions of the transaction. The written commitments from the Bank Board to the plaintiff herein included authorization to continue accounting for \u201cdeferred loan losses\u201d as regulatory capital with long-term amortization. As in <em>Winstar, </em>the documents establishing the agreement between the investors and the government comprise several exchanges of correspondence and governmental approval documents, together forming an integrated contract. That contract was breached when, after enactment of FIR-REA, the government withdrew its authorization for the accounting practices to which it had agreed, forcing the bank into receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-16\">Implementing their agreement with the government, the investors in both <em>Winstar </em>and the case at bar became the owners of the thrift. The many and varied arrangements whereby the government in the 1980s obtained hard money from investors in exchange for favorable accounting procedures and forbearances, did not depend on whether the investors were individuals or a corporation; it was irrelevant whether the investor was another bank that acquired the shares of the troubled thrift, or individuals who acquired the shares of the troubled thrift. What counted was wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>er there was an agreement by the government in consideration of the capital contributed by the investor, and whether that agreement was breached. That is the principle established in <em>Winstar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">As in <em>Winstar, </em>these investors contracted with the government, coming to terms before they made their capital contributions. It is surely incorrect to dismiss this case at the threshold, under Rule 12(b)(1) and by summary judgment, without providing an opportunity for the investors to establish the existence of a contract, in view of the extensive documentary evidence supporting mutual intent, reliance, and performance. The record contains, for example, the \u201clawyer\u2019s letter\u201d setting forth the details of the arrangement; at least two letters from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the investors confirming the arrangement; the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta Memorandum stating that certain conditions would be unacceptable to the \u201cfour individuals\u201d who would acquire control; the Federal Home Loan Bank Board letter to the individual investors summarizing and recommending approval of the arrangement; the Plan of Conversion stating the requirement that the investors would provide capital; and the Dividend Agreement that was a condition of Bank Board approval. The decision of the Court of Federal Claims that these documents did not and could not comprise an integrated contract to which these plaintiffs are party, is not in accordance with the rules of contract or with precedent. From my colleagues\u2019 affir-mance of that decision I must, respectfully, dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
