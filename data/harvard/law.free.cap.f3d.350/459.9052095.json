Defendant Chris Shirley is a corrections officer employed by MTC at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the jail. Rosborough sued MTC and Shirley under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment when Shirley maliciously slammed a door on Rosborough\u2019s fingers, severing two fingertips. Rosborough also alleges that Shirley displayed deliberate indifference to Rosborough\u2019s resulting serious medical condition. In addition, Ros-borough alleges that MTC is liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for its improper training and supervision of Shirley. Rosborough supplemented his federal action with state-law negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Rosborough\u2019s action on the ground that Shirley was an employee of MTC rather than an employee of the State of Texas and, therefore, was not acting under color of state law for purposes of suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The court dismissed the supplemental state-law claims but did not address MTC\u2019s potential liability for failing to train Shirley. Rosborough appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>McGrow v. Texas Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>47 F.3d 158, 160 (5th Cir.1995) (per curiam). We accept the plaintiffs factual allegations as true and uphold the district court\u2019s dismissal \u201conly if it appears that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proven consistent with the allegations.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Puckett, </em>157 F.Bd 1022, 1025 (5th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u201cTo state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988). At issue here is the \u201cunder color of state law\u201d requirement. The district court assumed that this requirement prevented a person in private employ from being sued under \u00a7 1983. The Supreme Court, however, has held that \u201c[t]o act \u2018under color\u2019 of law does not require that the accused be an officer of the state.\u201d <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 152, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Under the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cpublic function\u201d test, a private entity acts under color of state law \u201cwhen that entity performs a function which is traditionally the exclusive province of the state.\u201d <em>Wong v. Stripling, </em>881 F.2d 200, 202 (5th Cir.1989). The Supreme Court has explained that \u201cwhen private individuals or groups are endowed by the State with powers or functions governmental in nature, they become agencies or instrumentalities of the State and subject to its constitutional limitations.\u201d <em>Evans v. Newton, </em>382 U.S. 296, 299, 86 S.Ct. 486, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966). Thus, the Supreme Court has found private actors to be susceptible to suit under \u00a7 1983. <em>E.g., West, </em>487 U.S. at 54-57, 108 S.Ct. 2250 (holding that private doctor under contract with a state prison to provide medical care to prisoners acted under color of state law when he treated inmate). Relevant to this case, the Supreme Court has suggested\u2014 though it has not actually held \u2014 that state prisoners might bring suit under \u00a7 1983 against privately owned correctional facilities. <em>See Correctional Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 72 n. 5, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001) (\u201c[S]tate prisoners ... already enjoy a right of action against private correctional providers under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d) (emphasis omitted); <em>Richardson v. McKnight, </em>521 U.S. 399, 413, 117 S.Ct. 2100, 138 L.Ed.2d 540 (1997) (\u201c[We] have not addressed whether [prison guards] are liable under \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>even though they are employed by a private firm.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In <em>Skelton v. Pri-Cor, Inc., </em>the Sixth Circuit, relying on these Supreme Court precedents, held that a private company administering a state corrections facility could be sued under \u00a7 1983. 963 F.2d 100, 102 (6th Cir.1991). The Sixth Circuit found determinative the fact that the corporation was \u201cperforming a public function traditionally reserved to the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Evans, </em>382 U.S. at 299, 86 S.Ct. 486). The court reasoned that \u201cthe power exercised by [the private prison-management company] is \u2018possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>West, </em>487 U.S. at 49, 108 S.Ct. 2250). Moreover it found that \u201c \u2018[t]here is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of [the corporation] so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974)). Thus, according to the Sixth Circuit, the private corporation \u201cacted under color of law7 for purposes of \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">District courts within this circuit have similarly held that private prison-management companies and their employees are subject to \u00a7 1983 liability because they are performing a government function traditionally reserved to the state. <em>See, e.g., Palm v. Mart, </em>174 F.Supp.2d 484, 487-88 (N.D.Tex.2001); , <em>Kesler v. King, </em>29 F.Supp.2d 356, 370-71 (S.D.Tex.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">We agree with the Sixth Circuit and with those district courts that have found that private prison-management corporations and their employees may be sued under \u00a7 1983 by a prisoner who has suffered a constitutional injury. Clearly, confinement of wrongdoers \u2014 though sometimes delegated to private entities \u2014 is a fundamentally governmental function. These corporations and their employees are therefore subject to limitations imposed by the Eighth Amendment. Accordingly, we find that the district court erred in dismissing Rosborough\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
