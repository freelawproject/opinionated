Asserting the generally held presumption of validity that attaches to the quantum of a municipality\u2019s assessment of property, with the concomitant burden on the taxpayer to prove that the property\u2019s value is otherwise, <em>Pantasote Co. v. City of Passaic, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>408, 412-13, 495 A.2d 1308 (1985), defendant City of Atlantic City maintains the applicable method to determine the Borgata\u2019s tax liability is the cost approach rather than the income approach utilized by the Tax Court judge. Also, for the first time on appeal, defendant argues the methodology employed by the Tax Court judge was specific to casinos and cannot be used for any other type of property; therefore, the method of assessment violated the uniformity provision of the tax clause of the State Constitution. <em>See N.J. Const. </em>art. VIII, \u00a7 1,\u00b61.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">We reject defendant\u2019s arguments as unavailing and unsupported. We affirm for the reasons set forth in Judge Patrick DeAlmeida\u2019s comprehensive and thoughtful written opinion, issued following the twenty-one day trial. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(A). We add only these brief comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Judgments of the Tax Court are binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence. <em>City of Atl. City v. Boardwalk Regency Corp., </em>19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>164, 192 (App.Div.2000); <em>Global Terminal &amp; Container Servs. v. City of Jersey City, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax </em>698, 702-03 (App.Div.1996); <em>see also Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974) (setting forth standard for appellate review of non-jury trials). This presumption \u201cis especially so with respect to the findings of the Tax Court because of the special expertise afforded to such courts.\u201d <em>Boardwalk Regency Corp., supra, </em>19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 192 (citation and internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>omitted). <em>See also Global Terminal &amp; Container Servs., supra, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 703; <em>Kearny Leasing Corp. v. Town of Kearny, </em>7 <em>N.J.Tax </em>665, 667 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>340, 508 A.2d 215 (1985). \u201cMoreover, \u2018[s]ince the judges assigned to the New Jersey Tax Court have special expertise, [this court] will not disturb their finding[s] unless they are plainly arbitrary or there is a lack of substantial evidence to support them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pine St. Mgmt. Corp. v. City of E. Orange, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax </em>681, 686 (App.Div.1995) (first and second alterations in original) (quoting <em>G &amp; S Co. v. Borough of Eatontown, </em>6 <em>N.J.Tax </em>218, 220 (App.Div.1982)), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>172, 675 A.2d 1121 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\u201cThere are three traditional appraisal methods utilized to predict what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller on a given date, applicable to different types of properties: the comparable sales method, capitalization of income and cost.\u201d <em>Brown v. Borough of Glen Rock, </em>19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>366, 376 (App.Div.) (citing Appraisal Institute, <em>The Appraisal of Real Estate </em>81 (11th ed. 1996)), <em>certif. denied, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>291, 773 A.2d 1155 (2001). \u201cThere is no single determinative approach to the valuation of real property.\u201d <em>125 Monitor St., LLC v. City of Jersey City, </em>21 <em>N.J.Tax </em>232, 237-38 (Tax 2004) (citing <em>Samuel Hird &amp; Sons, Inc. v. City of Garfield, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65, 72, 208 A.2d 153 (App.Div.1965); <em>ITT Cont'l Baking Co. v. Twp. of E. Brunswick, </em>1 <em>N.J.Tax </em>244 (Tax 1980)), <em>aff'd, </em>23 <em>N.J.Tax </em>9 (App.Div.2005). The choice of the approach to determine value is case specific, as it depends \u201cupon the facts of each ease and the reaction of the experts to those facts.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Judge DeAlmeida detailed his factual findings, including very specific credibility determinations assessing the evidence and opinions offered by each testifying appraisal expert. He concluded plaintiffs proofs were more credible and overcame the presumption attached to the municipality\u2019s assessment. <em>See Pantasote, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 412, 417, 495 A.2d 1308 (noting the Tax Court may depart from the presumption when an assessment is \u201ctotally unrelated to true value,\u201d which is defined as \u201cthe value the property would bring at a fair, bona fide, and uncoereed private sale\u201d). This conclusion was fully supported by the evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>record, including the character of plaintiffs business enterprise being assessed, that is, a casino hotel, which is a distinctively different business from a resort hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Also considered by the judge were the national economic difficulties affecting business values during the tax years under review and the overall casino market in Atlantic City as affected by neighboring states interposing significant competition upon the State\u2019s casino industry. Each of these factors found to have impact were not considered by or accounted for in defendant\u2019s tax assessment. Where sufficient evidence exists to rebut the presumption of validity, the Tax Court has \u201cnot only the right[ ] but the duty to apply its own judgment ... to arrive at a true value____\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Twp. of Edison, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>290, 311, 604 A.2d 580 (1992) (first alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Further, contrary to defendant\u2019s suggestion, the income approach is neither novel in rendering assessments nor unique to Atlantic City casinos. <em>Parkway Vill. Apts. Co. v. Twp. of Cranford, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>266, 270, 528 A.2d 922 (1987) (stating the income approach is the preferred method to estimate the value of income-producing properties); <em>City of Atl. City v. Ace Gaming, LLC, </em>23 <em>N.J.Tax </em>70, 95, 97, 103 (Tax 2006) (noting parties stipulated the income approach be used to assess the Sands Casino). Admittedly, the computation made by Judge DeAlmeida carefully weighed factors specific to the casino industry; however, such consideration does not equate to preferential treatment, which is prohibited by the Constitution\u2019s uniformity clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Switz v. Kingsley, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>566, 584, 182 A.2d 841 (1962) (discussing the parameters of art. VIII, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Following our review in light of the record evidence and the applicable law, we reject defendant\u2019s asserted constitutional chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>lenge. Moreover, we discern no basis to disturb the valuation methodology used by Judge DeAlmeida.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-11\"> N.J. <em>Const, </em>art. VIII, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1 provides, in pertinent part: \"Property shall be assessed for taxation under general laws and by uniform rules.
