In its two judgments, the court reduced the City\u2019s assessment from $1.3 million for each year to $690,000 for 2006 and $590,000 for 2007. We affirm those determinations substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Mary Siobhan Brennan\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion reported at 27 <em>N.J.Tax </em>196 (Tax 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The Center is an affordable housing cooperative apartment corporation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> formed almost fifty years ago pursuant to federal housing laws and regulations. It operates under a regulatory agreement with federal housing and mortgage funding agencies. Pursuant to those agencies\u2019 requirements, the sales price of an individual owner\u2019s interest in the Center is limited to its 1966 level. The Center\u2019s dispute with the City is about the manner in which the Center\u2019s real estate\u2019s value is assessed for real estate tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">In an earlier appeal filed by the Center, we addressed the City\u2019s assessments for the years 2003 through 2005<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Pantasote Co. v. City of Passaic, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>408, 412-13, 495 A.2d 1308 (1985) finding that, based on the evidence presented then, the Center failed to overcome the presumption of correctness for municipal assessments. Specifically, we agreed that the Center \u201cfailed to provide evidence that the City\u2019s Tax Assessor neglected to consider the sales restriction affecting resale of the co-operative apartments.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Elizabeth Center Apartments, Urban Renewal Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>Elizabeth City, </em>No. A-3383-06, 2007 <em>WL </em>4355517 (App.Div. December 14, 2007) (slip op. at 2). In the present appeal by the City, we are asked to review the Tax Court\u2019s opposite determination for 2006 and 2007 in which there was no dispute that the Tax Assessor did not consider the restriction on the sale of cooperative units.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In Judge Brennan\u2019s recent opinion, the Tax Court determined that not only did the Center overcome the presumption<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but that the City was obligated to assess the Center\u2019s property by considering the restrictions that were imposed by the Center\u2019s controlling regulatory agreement on the prices of units offered for sale by the Center\u2019s shareholders, as the court deemed required by our opinion in <em>Prowitz v. Village of Ridgefield Park, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 568 A.2d 114 (App.Div.1989), <em>aff'd, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>199, 584 A.2d 782 (1991). Judge Brennan then went on to accept the Center\u2019s expert, Gary Manzione\u2019s approach for determining value which applied the method adopted in <em>Southbridge Park, Inc. v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>4 <em>N.J.Tax </em>30 (Tax 1981), <em>aff'd, </em>6 <em>N.J.Tax </em>351 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">On appeal the City argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">I. <em>PROWITZ [Prowitz] </em>DOES NOT CONTROL THIS CASE BECAUSE THE RESTRICTIONS ON SALE PRICE ARE NOT CONTAINED IN DEED RESTRICTIONS AND DO NOT RUN WITH THE LAND.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>II. THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE REJECTED MR. MANZIONE\u2019S FIRST APPROACH BECAUSE IT WAS NOT BASED ON SALES THAT WERE EXPOSED TO THE MARKET.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">III. THIS COURT SHOULD REJECT MR. MANZIONE\u2019S SECOND APPROACH BECAUSE IT WAS NOT BASED ON SALES THAT WERE EXPOSED TO THE MARKET.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">We find no merit to these arguments and hold that our decision in <em>Prowitz </em>does require the consideration of the sale restrictions in this case, even though they are not contained in a Master Deed or other recorded instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">At the outset, we note the well-settled principles that guide our review of Tax Court determinations. Our scope of review in these matters is circumscribed. We recognize the expertise of the Tax Court in state tax matters and will not disturb its rulings unless we find its rulings are arbitrary or its findings of fact are unsupported by substantial credible evidence in the record. We do not, however, defer to the Tax Court\u2019s legal determinations. \u201cOur review of those conclusions is de novo.\u201d <em>UPS v. Dir. Div. of Tax., </em>430 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 8, 61 A.3d 160 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>5, 75 A.3d 1160 (2013). The City\u2019s challenge in this case focuses on the proper method for assessing the Center\u2019s property, which is a legal question that we review de novo. <em>Southbridge, supra, </em>4 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 34-35 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">The history of the formation of the Center, its purpose to provide affordable housing to the residents of the City, and the nature of its property are set forth at length in Judge Brennan\u2019s opinion and need not be repeated here. <em>Elizabeth Center Apts., supra, </em>27 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 199-201. In summary, as we also noted in our earlier opinion, the Center is \u201ca not-for-profit corporation operating under the auspices of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The building consists of a total of 260 low- and moderate-income co-operative apartments.\u201d <em>Elizabeth Center Apartments, Urban Renewal Corp., supra, </em>(slip op. at 1-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">The Center\u2019s formation predated by decades the enactment of affordable housing statutes in this state as we know them today. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>See e.g. N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-301 to -329.4 (\u201cFair Housing Act of 1985\u201d). Importantly, as found by Judge Brennan, the lynchpin to the Center\u2019s utility as a tool to bring affordable housing to the city was the restriction imposed on the sales price of any unit through the Center\u2019s entry into a regulatory agreement with the FHA that \u201crun[s] with the land so long as there is a mortgage on the [Center\u2019s property] that is either insured or owned by HUD.\u201d <em>Elizabeth Center Apts., supra, </em>27 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 200. The effect of the regulatory agreement was to limit sales prices to 1966 levels so that the value of a shareholder\u2019s certificates \u201cwill never appreciate in market value and no member will profit upon its subsequent sale.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The limitation on sales price as well on the income levels of prospective purchasers were incorporated into the Center\u2019s by-laws as required by FHA. And, the Center could not amend its by-laws without the approval of the FHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The thrust of the City\u2019s argument in this appeal is that those restrictions on the sale price of shares, which have existed for almost fifty years, are temporary in nature. According to the City, the minimal principal balance of the existing HUD mortgage \u2014 originally almost $4.7 million dollars and, as of 2006, approximately $400,000 \u2014 can be satisfied at any time, if it has not already been paid. The Center can then amend its by-laws to free itself of the FHA\u2019s restrictions. According to the City, because of the mortgage\u2019s temporary nature, our holding in <em>Prountz, supra, </em>does not apply and the City, therefore, properly did not consider the restriction on sale price in its valuation of the Center\u2019s property. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">As we discussed in <em>Prowitz, </em>governmental regulation, like a deed restriction, that limits the resale value of property, is a factor to be considered by a tax assessor when determining assessed value. Judge Brennan accurately and succinctly summarized our holding and reasoning in <em>Prowitz </em>before she applied its holding to the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">In <em>Prowitz v. Village of Ridgefield Park, supra, </em>the Appellate Division addressed whether the property assessment of a single-family residential unit, which comprised a portion of the municipality\u2019s official affordable housing stock, must consider a deed restriction that limits the unit\u2019s resale value to its initial purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>price plus Consumer Price Index increases in order to ensure the unit\u2019s continuing status as affordable housing. 237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 437 [568 A.2d 114]. The <em>Prowitz </em>court held that \u201cwhile the maximum resale price obtainable under the deed restriction does not necessarily define assessable value, the resale restriction nevertheless is a factor that must be considered in fixing the assessment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439 [568 A.2d 114]. This court finds that the same holds true for the Taxpayer in the present matter. While individual Taxpayer members are enjoying home ownership at below-market financing, they do so without the ability to make a profit at the time of sale. This in turn helps to perpetuate the City\u2019s low to moderate income housing stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">The rationale of the <em>Prowitz </em>opinion was stated concisely and articulately and thus bears repeating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">We ... deem the restriction here analogous to value-depreciating government regulation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">We note, moreover, the conceptual similarity between the deed restriction here and the protective statute the Tax Court addressed in <em>Schwam v. Cedar Grove Tp., supra. </em>In both, the market value of the property, that is, the amount which a bona fide buyer would otherwise pay a bona fide seller in an arms-length transaction, is significantly affected by governmental action taken for the beneficent public purpose of advancing and protecting the housing needs of classes of persons legislatively determined to require housing assistance. The form of that assistance here relevant is the imposition of a value-depreciating burden upon private ownership. That direct burden is justified on the basis of paramount public policy. It is fundamentally fair then for the public to share that burden with private ownership at least to the extent of recognizing, for tax assessment purposes, the market-place consequences of the restriction. We agree with the observation of Judge Crabtree in <em>Schwam ... </em>that there is an apparent element of injustice in imposing an onus on municipal taxpayers that [i]nures to the benefit of the State as a whole. But that is the consequence of the Legislature having made no specific provision for the allocation of the ensuing tax burden between local and State government. It is also, of course, a consequence of the nature of this State\u2019s real property tax base. But these are not matters before us or which the judiciary has a present competence to correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">Although the <em>Prowitz </em>decision involved a deed-restricted property, this court does not interpret that decision to exclude the non-deed restrictions imposed on the Taxpayer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\"><em>[Elizabeth Ctr. Apartments Urban Renewal Corp., supra, </em>27 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 211-12 (quoting <em>Prowitz, supra, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 443-44, 568 A.2d 114 (citations omitted)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">In <em>Prowitz, supra, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 442-43, 568 A.2d 114, we determined that the impact of \u201cvalue-depreciating government regulations,\u201d including those that required a deed restriction\u2019s limiting sales in affordable housing projects, must be taken into account in a municipality\u2019s assessment of a property where its purpose is dedicated to a \u201cparamount public policy\u201d goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>We disagree with the City that because the FHA mortgage encumbering the Center\u2019s property can be satisfied by the Center, the public policy reasoning behind the regulatory agreement\u2019s and by-laws\u2019 imposition of sales restrictions is not a factor to be considered. The City\u2019s argument ignores the undisputed facts that the Center has operated under those agreements and regulations for almost fifty years for the sole purpose of providing affordable housing and that it cannot do anything to amend its corporate structure without approval from the governing agencies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is nothing temporary about the limitations imposed on the sale units in the Center\u2019s property. They continue to exist today as they have for decades and until the federal government approves their removal, if ever, they must be considered in the property\u2019s valuation. The limitation imposed \u201ctranscend individual or particular ownership [and are] required to be taken into account in assessing value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 568 A.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In light of our agreement with Judge Brennan\u2019s decision regarding the impact of the restriction on the shareholder\u2019s certificates, we find that the City\u2019s remaining arguments are without sufficient merit to warrant further discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(A) and (E). The court\u2019s calculation of the Center\u2019s property\u2019s proper assessment for 2006 and 2007, applying the method adopted in <em>Southbridge, supra </em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>for assessing cooperative units and recognizing the unique nature of the Center\u2019s property\u2019s value because of the restrictions, <em>Hackensack Water Company v. Borough of Old Tappan, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>208, 215, 390 A.2d 122 (1978), was well within the court\u2019s discretion, expertise and authority. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-6. In fact, other than the consideration of the restriction\u2019s impact, both the Center\u2019s and the City\u2019s expert\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>agreed that the method applied was correct in all other aspects. Judge Brennan was free to accept or reject the balance of either expert\u2019s methods, in whole or part, in calculating the proper assessments. <em>Southbridge Park Inc. v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 94, 492 A.2d 1026 (App.Div.1985).
