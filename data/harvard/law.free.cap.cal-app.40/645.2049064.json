J., <em>pro tem.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A6Y\">This is an action to quiet title against a lien arising out of the issuance of a bond for street improvements on plaintiff\u2019s lot in the city of San Jose. Plaintiff had judgment, from which defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-14\">Appellant\u2019s contention in this case that the street in question had not been previously accepted has been sustained by the supreme court in the case of <em>Ransome-Crummey Co. </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>177 Cal. 560, [171 Pac. 304].</p>\n<p id=\"b677-15\">Also respondent\u2019s contention that the Bond Act under which the bond in question was issued does not apply to San <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Jose has been recently disposed of in appellant\u2019s favor by this court in the ease of <em>Ahlman </em>v. <em>Barber Asphalt Paving Co. et al., ante, </em>p. 395, [181 Pac. 238].</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Further, for the purpose of sustaining the judgment, respondent in this court contends for the first time that from a certain paragraph in defendant\u2019s answer and the finding made thereon it appears \u201cthat there was no authority in law to issue\u201d the bonds in question. Respondent quotes as follows from the answer and finding: \u201cThat before the passing of the resolution . . . careful estimates of the costs and expenses thereof had been required by it to be furnished to said common council by the city engineer of said city. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Relying upon this, respondent claims that the bend issue is defective because it does not appear from defendant\u2019s answer and finding herein that there was a compliance with section 3 of the Vrooman Act, which provides that \u201cbefore passing any resolution for the construction of said improvements, plans and specifications, and careful estimates of the cost and expenses thereof <em>shall be furnished </em>to said city council <em>if required </em>by it, by the city engineer of said city. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Respondent filed no demurrer, either special or general, attacking the foregoing allegation and the finding was made accordingly. But it should be noted that the allegation and finding contained also the following language immediately following the language quoted and relied upon by counsel: \u201cWe believe that this language, in the absence of any special demurrer, possesses sufficient scope and pregnancy to supply the defect indicated by counsel. The language being as follows: \u201c . . . and <em>special specifications therefor </em>had been furnished by him and had been filed in the office of the said city clerk on the eighth day of April, 1912.\u201d The words \u201cspecial specifications therefor\u201d can be deemed to refer to and embrace the \u201ccareful estimates&lt; of the costs and expenses.\u201d <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> And certainly a furnishing by the city engineer of specifications or a specification of \u201ca careful estimate\u201d is in substance and effect the furnishing by him of a statement of the estimates. The Century Dictionary gives as one of the meanings of \u201cSpecification: An act of specifying, or making a detailed statement, or the statement so made; a definite or formal mention of price; as, a specification of one\u2019s requirements, for example, 'all who had relatives or friends in this predicament were required to furnish a specification of them\u2019: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Prescott, Ferd. &amp; Isa., 1, 7.\u201d And for an example of the scope of the word \u201ctherefor,\u201d see <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>City of Olympia, 2 </em>Wash. Tr. 314, [5 Pac. 606, 607] ; <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Rovinsky, </em>95 Me. 106, [49 Atl. 420, 421].</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Also, the form of expression used by the pleader to convey the above idea of compliance with the statute has received a certain countenance and approval in this state from its use in the well-known California text-book, Page on California Street Law, page 891, section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Also, if there had been a special demurrer, it does not appear that the facts were such that the answer could not have been so amended as to obviate the objections made. <em>(Ransome-Crummey Co. </em>v. <em>Bennett, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Hart, J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
