(Pico v. <em>Sunol, </em>6 Cal. 294 ; <em>Eichhoff </em>v. <em>Eichhoff, </em>107 Cal. 42, [48 Am. St. Rep. 110, 40 Pac. 24] ; 23 Cyc. 996.) And it is the established law in this state that a bill of equity must allege and show that the complainant has a good and meritorious defense to the action at law. <em>(Burbridge </em>v. <em>Rauer, </em>146 Cal. 21, [79 Pac. 526] ; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>147 Cal. 689, [82 Pac. 327] ; <em>Matson </em>v. <em>John Batto &amp; Sons, </em>173 Cal. 800, [161 Pac. 1144]. See, also, Freeman on Judgments, sec. 498 ; 23 Cyc. 1031.)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Under these authorities it must be held that the equitable relief of setting aside a judgment obtained in a court of law will not be granted without an affirmative showing in the complaint that the complainant, as defendant in said action, has ! a good defense on the merits. It should have been made to appear in the complaint in this proceeding that a like judgment would in all probability not result from a new prosecution of the action at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Waste, P. J., and Richards, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
