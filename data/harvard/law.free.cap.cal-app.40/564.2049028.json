On November 23,1917, the following order was entered in the minutes of the court: \u201cThis cause having-been heretofore submitted to the court for consideration and decision, and now the court having considered the same and being fully advised herein, it renders the following decision: \u2018Plaintiff\u2019s prayer for a divorce is denied. Defendant\u2019s prayer for a divorce is denied. \u2019 \u201d On February 28, 1918, plaintiff made a motion for an order directing the clerk of the lower court to issue an execution in said action in favor of plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of $150, claimed to be due her as alimony for three months, commencing December 16, 1917, and ending March 15, 1918. On March 18, 1918, the court made an order denying the said motion of plaintiff, from which latter order plaintiff attempts to prosecute this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The entry on the minutes of the court on November 23, 1917, is not a final judgment in the action. Issues were tendered by the pleadings, and there is no showing that findings were waived. Consequently there could have been no rendition of judgment until such findings were made and filed with the clerk. <em>(Crim </em>v. <em>Kessing, </em>89 Cal. 478, 488, [23 Am. St. Rep. 491, 26 Pac. 1074].) 'The record does not disclose that this has been done. The order from which this appeal is attempted to be taken, is, therefore, not an order made after final judgment and is not an appealable order under section 963 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Langdon, P.
