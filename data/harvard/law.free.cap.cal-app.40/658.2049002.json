J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnJb\">This is an appeal by the defendant from a judgment rendered against it in a suit to recover upon an insurance policy issued by defendant company covering loss by fire. The facts of the case are briefly these: The plaintiff was the owner of a building in San Francisco which was insured against fire by defendant. The policy had been in force for some years. The fire which caused the loss upon which suit is brought occurred on August 7, 1915. Prior to that time, to wit, on July 10, 1915, a small fire on the premises had occurred. The insurance company settled the claim therefor by paying the plaintiff $18, and it is claimed by the defendant that upon mating this payment the policy was canceled by attaching to the draft sent to plaintiff a receipt which contained the statement, just above where plaintiff placed his signature, \u201cSaid policy is hereby surrendered for cancellation,\u201d and that Lutge by signing the receipt containing this statement consented to the cancellation of the policy. This is the one issue between the parties, and the appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to justify the implied finding of the jury that the policy had not been canceled prior to the loss, and, further, that the trial court abused its discretion in denying to the defendant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Appellant\u2019s argument upon the weight of the evidence has much force, but it is one that should properly be addressed to a jury. <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Whatever we may think as to the preponderance of the evidence, we may not substitute our opinion for that of the jury wherever there is a fair, reasonable ground for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>difference of opinion. It is true that the claim of the appellant that the words purporting to cancel the policy were a part of the receipt at the time it was signed by the plaintiff is upheld by the testimony of the clerk in defendant\u2019s employ who prepared the draft; by the testimony of the general agent of the defendant company who signed it, and by the testimony of an insurance broker to whom it was sent by the defendant and who.in turn delivered it to plaintiff. There is the further testimony of the insurance broker to the effect that he specifically called plaintiff\u2019s attention to the fact that the insurance policy was canceled, and that plaintiff replied that he did not care. On the other hand, the plaintiff denied that the words \u201csurrendered for cancellation\u201d were on the receipt when he signed it, or that he had any notice of any kind that the policy was canceled, or that he consented to the cancellation in any way. There are the additional circumstances that the insurance company did not accompany its receipt alleged to have embodied the agreement for cancellation with any letter calling attention to the cancellation; that the policy was in the possession of the plaintiff at the time of the fire and had never been surrendered and its surrender had not been demanded by the defendant; that the defendant company had not offered, prior to the loss, to return to plaintiff the unearned premium paid upon the policy; that, after the loss occurred, plaintiff employed an insurance adjuster to present his claim, who notified the defendant of the loss and presented the preliminary proofs of loss on August 25th; that five days thereafter the defendant replied to this letter, making some technical\u201d objection to the proofs, but not intimating in any way that the policy had been canceled, and it was not until September 14th that the defendant asserted th\u00e1t the policy had been canceled and denied liability thereunder. <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We cannot, under such a condition of the evidence, hold that there was no substantial conflict in the evidence, and that the jury rendered a verdict .which was unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\">The only other point made by appellant is that the motion of the defendant for a new trial should have been granted. The affidavits filed upon the motion are all to the effect that the printed receipt had been altered and the words \u201csurrendered for cancellation\u201d made a part thereof before it was signed by the plaintiff. The statements in the affidavits con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>stituted material and valuable evidence for the defendant, but such evidence was merely cumulative and it should have been produced upon the trial. Defendant did produce evidence upon this very question in the testimony of the clerk of the defendant company who prepared the draft, in the testimony of the general manager who signed it, and in the testimony of the broker who delivered it to the plaintiff. Defendant, therefore, anticipated that this would be an issue in the ease, and, after the decision has been adverse to it, it may not retry the case in order to produce other and perhaps stronger evidence upon a question which was contested at the trial, when such evidence was available to the defendant at the time of the trial. <bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> A trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing a new trial applied for on the ground of newly discovered evidence where the new evidence is merely cumulative. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Selby S. &amp; L.
