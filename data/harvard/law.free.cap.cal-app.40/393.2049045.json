J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZO\">The appeal is from \u201cthe judgment entered in the above-entitled court on the fourth day of February, A. D. 1916.\u201d We have searched through the record in vain to find such a judgment, or, indeed, any judgment. There is none.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We do not know to what appellant' refers when, in its notice of appeal, it says it \u201chereby appeals . . . from the judgment entered ... on the fourth day of February, A. D. 1916, \u2019 \u2019 unless it be the findings and conclusions of law, which, for some unaccountable reason, bear the indorsement, \u201cEntered February 4th, 1916. \u2019 \u2019 <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> These, however, do not constitute a judgment. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>54 Cal. 590 <em>; Thompson </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>43 Cal. 482.) The clerk\u2019s certificate certifies that \u201cthe foregoing transcript on appeal is correct and contains a true copy of the judgment-roll in the action.\u201d In the absence of anything to the contrary, we must assume that the clerk\u2019s certificate states the truth; if it does, then the transcript \u201ccontains a true copy of the judgment-roll.\u201d <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Since no judgment appears in the judgment-roll as printed in the transcript, the only possible conclusion is that, as yet, no judgment has been given or made. There is therefore nothing from which to appeal, and the appeal should be dismissed. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Sharpe, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Sloane, J., and Thomas, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
