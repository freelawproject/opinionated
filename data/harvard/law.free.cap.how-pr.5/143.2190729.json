The charge was that the defendant had fraudulently contracted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>debt in question in this, that he had falsely represented himself as a partner in the house of Churchill &amp; Co. of Kalamazoo, Michigan. The allegations of indebtedness and of the representations were positively made in the affidavit on which the order for arrest was made, but there was no allegation of the falsity of the representations except in these words: \u201cthis deponent is informed and believes and expects to prove that said Roth was not at the time of contracting for such goods a member of any such firm as M. C. Churchill &amp; Co., or authorized by them to purchase such goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">The motion to discharge the order of arrest, was made on affidavits on the part of the defendant in which, among other things, he swore positively that he was a member of that firm, and it was opposed by affidavits on the part of the plaintiff, setting forth that he had sued Churchill &amp; Co. in Michigan, in which suit Churchill put in a sworn plea, of which as plaintiff was \u201c informed and believed\u201d a copy was annexed, and in which Churchill makes oath that \u201c he was never a partner with or of said Roth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">In the special term, the order of arrest was discharged on the ground that the falsity of the representations was stated on information and belief.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-7\">G. Bowman and C. O\u2019Conor, <em>for Plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-8\">-\u2014 Tracy, <em>for Defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"AcX\">Edmonds, <em>Pres. </em>J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avp\">It would not do to lay it down as a general rule that an order of arrest could never be granted on information and belief, or without a positive averment of facts, by persons conversant of them. That would be to forbid an'arrest in a large class of cases, where it would be manifestly proper; such, for instance, as those where a purchaser from the country makes representations in the city, the truth or falsity of which can be ascertained only in the country, in the vicinity of the purchaser\u2019s residence. Such a rule in that case, especially where this contract of sale is rescinded because of fraudulent representations, would require for a provisional remedy as much evidence as would be necessary for a final recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>But, on the other hand, those considerations, would not justify the ordering an arrest upon the general allegation contained ip this case that the plaintiff has been informed and believes that the representation was false. The nature and quality, and per-* haps the sources of the. information obtained' must be set forth, so that the court may be - able to ascertain whether the party is right in entertaining the belief to which he deposes. By the Code, the officer applied to for the order to arrest must determine upon the propriety of granting it. There must be something for his mind to act upon. He must entertain a belief that the charge made is true. Such an affidavit as that used in this case would answer none of these requisites, but would substitute the belief of the party for that of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">If in this case, the plaintiff had stated that he had made inquiries in Michigan and had there been informed by Churchill and others, who would be likely to know, that there was no such firm as Churchill &amp; Co., or that defendant had never been a member of it; or if he had stated that he had ascertained, stating the source of his information, that Churchill had made oath in court there, that there was no such firm, there would have been some\u00bb thing for the judge\u2019s mind to act upon; some means for that offi= tier\u2019s determining whether the plaintiff was right in believing the representation false; there would have been some means afforded the defendant of testing the accuracy of the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit; some mode provided of ensuring accuracy by the fear of a conviction for -perjury. But upon this affidavit there is not only nothing for the judge\u2019s mind to act upon and ascertain whether the plaintiff\u2019s belief was well founded, but no means for the defendant\u2019s proving the incorrectness of the affidavit, however false it might be, and no mode of punishing such falsehood. To allow such a practice would be in fact, substituting the opinion of the party for that of the. judge and removing all control and supervision by the judges, which the law has provided over the p\u00f3wer of arresting defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">So far as the facts may be within the knowledge of the plaintiff. such as the existence of the debt and the manner in which if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>was contracted, they must be stated positively; but so far as they necessarily rest on information derived from others, they may be so stated, when the sources and nature of the information are particularly set out and good reason is given, why a positive statement of them can not be procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The original affidavit therefore on which the order of arrest was obtained in this case, was defective and did not warrant the defendant\u2019s arrest. The other affidavits used on this motion do not supply the defect. The only material additional allegation contained in them is in reference to Churchill\u2019s affidavit in the courts of Michigan. That affidavit is not so verified that it can be referred to as such on this motion, and it is presented simply as a paper which the plaintiff is informed and believes is a copy of one filed in Michigan. There is no statement of the sources of that information, no means of the defendant\u2019s ascertaining whether such information had actually been received by the plaintiff nor for the court\u2019s determining whether he was right in believing it. It is, in fact, liable to the same objection that exists against the original affidavit, and both are defective inasmuch as they substitute the belief of the party for that of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The order of the special term must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
