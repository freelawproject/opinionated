J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsI\">As a general rule the court does not inquire into the fractions of a day, except for the purpose of guarding against injustice (Small vs. McChesney, 3 <em>Cow. </em>19; Clute vs. Clute, 3 <em>Denio, </em>263). We think that a sufficient answer to this motion. Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
