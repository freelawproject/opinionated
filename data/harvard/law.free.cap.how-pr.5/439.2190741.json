The complaint contains six different <em>counts, </em>or causes of action,, stated, substantially, according to the forms of counts in a declaration at common law, in an action against common carriers. The defendants move either to set aside the complaint altogether, or to strike out all but one of the counts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-10\">E. P.

To sustain such a pleading, would be to hold that any party is at liberty to choose between common law pleadings, and the pleadings prescribed by the Code. If a pie ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ing like this, is sanctioned by the Code, then, indeed, it is a <em>misnomer </em>to call that act, <em>\u201c </em>an act to simplify and abridge plead ings. The complaint is in no respect conformable to the requirements of the <em>second </em>subdivision of the 142d section of the Code. Unless, therefore, the plaintiffs shall, within twenty days amend their complaint so as to make it conform to those requirements, all the causes of action, or counts, stated therein, except the first, are to be stricken out as redundant, or irrelevant. The defendants are also entitled to the costs of this motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
