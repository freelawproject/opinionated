The note is in the words and figures following: \u201c$70. For value received in policy No. 7295, dated Nov. 27th 1848, issued by the \u2018 Genesee Mutual Insurance Company,\u2019 I promise to pay the said Company or their treasurer for the time being, the sum of seventy dollars, in such portions and at such time or times as the directors of said company, may, agreeably to their act of incorporation require. \u2019 Andrew Moynihen.\u201d The complaint sets forth the note, the issuing of the policy of insurance, together with other facts by reason of which the plaintiff claims the defendant is liable to pay the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-9\">The answer is in the following words: \u201cThe said defendant, Andrew Moynihen, for answer to the complaint of the plaintiff, says that he admits the execution of the said note and the delivery of the said policy of insurance; and the defendant further says that as to each and every other allegation in the said complaint set out and not herein expressly admitted, this defendant has not any knowledge thereof sufficient to form \u00e1 belief.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-10\">Hatch &amp; Hatch, <em>for Plaintiff</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A6xo\">J.
