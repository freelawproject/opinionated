Notice of judgment was received by defendants\u2019 attorneys on the 1st.day of July 1849. On the 29th July the defendants filed the requisite undertaking with a view to an appeal. Notice of the appeal and of the undertaking, with a copy of the undertaking, was mailed at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>post office at Rochester, where the defendants\u2019 attorneys resided, on the 29th day of July 1850, between 1 and 4 P. M., postage paid, directed to the attorney for the defendant at \u201c Clarkson Corners, Mon. Co.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">In the town of Clarkson there are three post offices bearing the names of \u201c Clarkson,\u201d \u201c Clarkson Centre,\u201d and \u201c East Clark-son.\u201d There is no post office in Monroe county by the name of \u201c Clarkson Corners.\u201d The action was commenced by summons and complaint, to both of which and to the plaintiff\u2019s reply to the defendants\u2019 answer, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s name was subscribed as such, with the addition of \u201c Clarkson.\u201d The letter enclosing the notice of appeal, &amp;c. was sent from the post office at Rochester to the post office at \u201c Clarkson Centre,\u201d from which it was forwarded to the \u201c Clarkson\u201d post office charged with five cents postage, where it arrived on the 3d day of August and was handed to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney on the evening of that day; an execution had been issued upon the judgment on the 2d of August.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">The post office named \u201c Clarkson Centre\u201d is located about four miles north of the village of Clarkson, where the post office of the name of \u201c Clarkson\u201d is situated, and is where there are four corners made by the crossing of an east and west and north and south roads. The village of Clarkson, as one of the affidavits states, is usually called Clarkson Corners. A motion is now made to set aside the execution for irregularity.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-7\">O. M.

Notice of the judgment was served on the 1st day of July, and on the 1st day of August the time for appealing expired. The notice of appeal was misdirected, and did not reach the plaintiff\u2019s attorney until the 3d day of August. That was too late and he had a right to disregard it. The envelope was directed to Clarkson Corners, where there was no post office of that name, and if it went to either of the post offices in the town of Clarkson, it was as likely to go to one as the other of the three. It is shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>that it in fact went on to one four miles beyond the right one and was sent hack charged with postage, which the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had to pay before he was entitled to receive it. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney in conformity with rule 5, in subscribing and endorsing his name to the previous papers, had added his place of residence, and the notice of appeal5 <em>See. </em>should have been directed to that place. An attorney has the right himself to decide where he resides for the purposes of the rule, and if papers are served upon him by mail, they must be directed accordingly, provided he has complied with the rule in subscribing and endorsing his papers. The words \u201cplace of residence,\u201d in rule 5, must be understood with reference to the name of the post office to which papers are to be directed. The motion must therefore be denied with $7-00 costs. I am not able to see that there is any relief for the defendant. By \u00a7 332 of the Code, the appeal must be made in thirty days after written notice of the judgment; and section 405 seems to contemplate that the time can in no case be enlarged. /*// U'&lt; / / -</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
