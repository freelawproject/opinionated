Rosekrans, <em>for Plaintiff,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah0y\">insisted that it was clear from the opinion of the court, given on a motion for a new trial, that the defendant had no defence; and that it was discretionary, with the court whether a new trial should be granted; \u201c shall\u201d meaning \u201cmay,\u201d in such cases (\u00a737).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-10\">Hand, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AkU\">The court has no discretion. The statute is imperative that a party, on application and payment of all the costs and damages recovered, shall have a second trial (2 R. S 309 \u00a7 37; 2 <em>Paine </em>&amp; <em>Duer\u2019s Pr. </em>517; <em>Gra. Pr. </em>676; Shaw v. McMaren, 2 <em>Hill, </em>417). \u201cMay\u201d and \u201cshall or may,\u201d and \u201c shall and may,\u201d sometimes, are imperative, and sometimes discretionary (see Malcolm v. Rogers, 5 <em>Cow. </em>193; Mayor of New York v. Furze, 3 <em>Hill, </em>612; Rex. v. Com. Flockwood Inclosure, 2 <em>Chit. R. </em>251; Hudd v. Ravenor 2 <em>B. &amp; B. </em>664; King v. Bailiffs of Eyre, 4 <em>B. &amp; Ald. </em>271; <em>Smith on Stat. </em>724; <em>Dwarr. on Stat. </em>712; <em>1 Pet. U. S. R. </em>64). But here it is \u201cshall,\u201d and confers a right upon the party. The Code has made no change in this part of the practice (5 <em>Wend. </em>101). Even in suits commenced under it. For, although the action of \u201c ejectment\u201d is not retained by that name, in actions for land, these provisions of the Revised Statutes apply. They are not inconsistent with the Code (\u00a7\u00a7 455, 471; Cooke v. Passage, 4 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>360). Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
