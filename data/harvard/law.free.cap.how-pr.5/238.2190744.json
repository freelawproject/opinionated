The summons was served on the defendant Thomas, on the 2d of December; a notice of appearance and a demand of a copy of the complaint was served by the attorney for the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney on the 10th of the same month. On the 21st of December the copy complaint was received, and entered as received in the register of the defendants\u2019 attorney on that day; and on the 29th January an answer was mailed' at Utica to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney who resides at Herkimer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-5\">Wm.

It is indeed an unusual event that the letter should have been seven days in traveling from Herkimer to Utica; but it is <em>positively </em>sworn that the letter was mailed on the 14th, and Messrs. Bacon &amp; White did not preserve the envelope, so as to determine when it was actually put in the post office. The answer was therefore served too late, and was accordingly returned with that information on the next day after it was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The complaint purported to be <em>verified. </em>It was sworn to by Harvey Doolittle, the cashier of the bank, and he states that\" <em>he had read the complaint and that the same was true according to the best of his knowledge and </em>belief.This is no verification under section 157, if the cashier is to be regarded as a party. Still less, is it a good verification if he supposed to act as an agent or attorney; for then he should set forth his means of knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The action was on a promissory note, and the complaint not being verified, the damages must have been assessed by the clerk) and as a notice of appearance was given, the defendants\u2019 attorney was entitled to five days notice of assessment <em>(section </em>246 <em>of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>the Code). </em>This notice was not given, and the judgment is therefore irregular, and must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Still the defendants\u2019 time to answer has expired, and to enable him to plead, he must obtain the leave of court. He has shown a mistake as to the time when an answer was due, which is satisfactory; and he has made an affidavit of merits in a general form pursuant to the rule as laid down in the old Supreme Court rules, and in the 4th <em>Hill, </em>61, <em>note.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">I am aware that it has been said in several cases, since the adoption of the Code, that the affidavit of merits should be special, setting up the facts, which constitutes the ground of defence, conformably to the practice in the Court of Chancery. But I see no reason for adopting that practice in common law actions. The guards, which the rule of the Supreme Court provided, are sufficient, in a case where no suspicion is thrown on the application by the circumstances of the case. The circumstances <em>may be </em>so suspicious in their character, that a party would be called on to explain those circumstances, and to state the facts, on which he relies for explanation or avoidance, in his affidavit. That, however, waS always the case; and affords no reason why, in an ordinary case at law, we should disregard the settled practice which has obtained in like cases since the court was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The result is, that the defendant is entitled to set aside the judgment with costs; but is obliged to ask as a favor to be permitted to answer, notwithstanding the time has expired. The proper mode is to grant the entire motion without costs (5 <em>Wendell, 78).</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
