On the 26th May 1849, the answer was served. The plaintiffs have never replied to the answer. On the contrary they amended their complaint by striking out the names of David Russell and James Brown.

All the papers needed for such motion are the summons, complaint and answer and the notice of motion. The motion clearly relates only to a case, where the answer relies on new matter, which constitutes a defence. That is not this case. The defendants interposed an answer denying the whole case of the plaintiffs. In short, the answer amounted only to the old general issue. The additional matter stated, constitutes no defence, and required no reply. It may all be true, and the defendants be mere squatters.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The defendants have mistaken their remedy; they should have noticed the cause for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The motion must be denied with seven dollars- costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
