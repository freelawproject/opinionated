That for that purpose this bond was given, and if they found that the allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s were sustained by the evidence, their verdict should be in favor of the plaintiffs. But if on the other hand, they found, as was contended for by the defendants, that the plaintiffs were doing no business on the day of the issuing of the attachment \u2014 that they had closed their own store, and placed all their property in the hands of a third person, that then the grounds of the action were untenable and their verdict should be in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The jury retired, and after an absence of an hour, returned into court with a verdict for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
