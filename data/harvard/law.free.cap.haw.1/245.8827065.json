G. THURSTON, [Seal.]</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">E. S. RUGGLES, [Seal.]</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The first question presented for our consideration, is that relating to the description of the property mortgaged. It is contended by the learned counsel for the defendants, that the description contained in the mortgage of itself alone, that is, without the aid of the schedule referred to, is loose, vague and insufficient, and such as to render the mortgage void for uncertainty. That the description of the mortgag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>ed property is so general as to have no legal force and effect, and that nothing short of a specific description of the articles mortgaged can avail a mortgagee relying upon a recorded mortgage, while the possession of the property remains with the mortgagor.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">The general rule on this subject is, that the description of the property mortgaged must be sufficiently definite to enable it to be identified. But we consider the principle well settled, that it is not essential to the validity of a mortgage of personal property that it should contain a schedule or particular enumeration of the goods, if it be made without fraud, and sufficiently indicate the goods intended to be mortgaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The description of the property in this mortgage is certainly a most sweeping one, covering not only all the mortgagor\u2019s \u201cstock in trade now on hand,\u201d but \u201call the incoming stock in trade of every kind and character whatsoever,\u201d and we would here remark, that while we do not condemn such general conveyances where it is clear they were made in good faith, still we cannot regard them with favor, but, on the contrary, feel bound to scrutinize them jealously, and restrict them to reasonable bounds. We fully concur with the court below, in the opinion that the mortgage is of no validity to bind the incoming stock, unless such new goods are purchased with the proceeds of the sale of those actually mortgaged, and I do not commit myself to the opinion that such a clause would be binding even were the goods so purchased. .Where live stock is mortgaged, its natural increase and produce become subject to the mortgage, but that class of cases does not control one like the present. The authorities on this subject are numerous and clear, and I will briefly refer to some of the most prominent.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In the case of Winslow <em>vs. </em>Merchants\u2019 Ins. Co., 4 Metcalf\u2019s R., 306, it was held that the mortgage of a building, \u201cand also such tools and other property as is now contemplated to be placed in said building,\u201d with a covenant that the instrument shall be effectual to create a lien on such property, does not create a lien on the property afterwards placed in the building; but is void for uncertainty, as against a mortgagee of the property, whose mortgage is executed after the property is placed in the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In Jones <em>vs. </em>Richardson, 10 Metcalf\u2019s R., 482, it was held that a, mortgage of goods which the mortgagor does not own when the mortgage is made, though he afterwards acquires them, is void as against bis attaching creditors. Justice Wilde, in delivering the opinion of the court, says, \u201c That a person cannot grant or mortgage property of which he is not possessed and to which he has no title, is a maxim of the law too plain to need illustration, and which is fully supported by all the authorities. Jtt is true that a person may grant personal property of which he is potentially, though not actually, possessed. A man may therefore grant all the wool that shall grow on the sheep which he owns at the time of the grant, but not the wool which shall grow on sheep not his, but which he may afterwards buy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The same doctrine was fully affirmed in Moody <em>vs. </em>Wright, 13 Metcalf, p. 17, This was a mortgage of certain tannery stock, and also whatever stock of every description that might thereafter belong to the mortgagor, wherever situated, and whether manufactured or not, or the proceeds of the same if sold, also all leather that might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>thereafter be manufactured from the proceeds of the property then' on hand, and in whatever shape the property might thereafter exist, or whatever form it might assume. Justice Dewey, in delivering the opinion of the court, afier a thorough review of the cases bearing up\u00bb on this point, arrives at the following result: \u201c The petitioner cannot hold the property in controversy as mortgaged property, because it was not in existence, and therefore not capable of being conveyed in mortgage at the time the mortgage was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In the case of Barnard vs. Eaton, 2 Cushing, 294, which was a mortgage of all the goods, &amp;c., then in the mortgagor\u2019s store, and all which might be substituted for them; provided that until default he might use and sell the mortgaged property, other goods,' &amp;c., of equal value being substituted, it was held the mortgage could not apply to goods not in existence or not capable of being identified at the time it was made, or to goods intended to be afterwards purchased to replace those which should be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">A still later and equally strong case, is that of Codman <em>vs. </em>Freeman, 3 Cushing, 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">But, while we are clearly of the opinion that the mortgage is void, so far as it relates to incoming stoek, we see no good ground for the argument that it is wholly void on account of the uncertainty of the description of the property mortgaged. On the contrary, we think the mortgage is valid, so\u2019far as relates to the stock on hand at the time of its execution. That is to say, we are of opinion that the words \u201call their right, title and interest in and to their stock in trade now on hand, consisting of the various articles usually sold and vended in the business aforesaid,\u201d when taken in connection with the first part of the mortgage, which shows the place where the mortgagors were carrying on business, sufficiently indicate the goods intended to be mortgaged, and is therefore a good description.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">In the case of Winslow <em>vs. </em>Merchants\u2019 Insurance Co., 4 Metcalf, 306, already cited, it was held that a mortgage describing the property as all and singular the goods, wares and stock in and about a certain building, with a provision that a schedule of the articles shall be annexed, is valid as to all the articles that can be identified, though no schedule thereof is ever annexed to the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">A mortgage of \u201c all and singular the stock, tools and chattels belonging to\u201d the mortgagor, \u201c in and about the wheelwright\u2019s shop occupied by him,\u201d was held to be valid as against attaching creditors, in the case of Harding <em>vs. </em>Coburn, 12 Metcalf, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">In the case of Pettis <em>vs. </em>Kellogg, 7 Cushing, 456, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts reviewed and confirmed the doctrine of its former decisions on this point. The property mortgaged in this case was described as \u201call the staves I have in Monterey, the same I had of Moses Fargo,\u201d and it appearing that the mortgagor had no staves in Monterey, but had some in the adjoining town which he bought of Fargo, it was held that the first part of the description might be rejected as false, and that the remainder was sufficient to pass the property. See also Brinley <em>vs. </em>Spring, 7 Greenleaf, 241, note (6) and 2 Hilliard on Mortgages, 194, where the principal authorities are referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">We now come to the final point, namely, whether the schedule referred to in this mortgage should have been recorded in order to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>a full compliance with the registry law. The language of the mortgage in reference to the schedule is as follows, viz: \u201cfor a more full and complete description whereof,\u201d (that is of the stock in trade) \u201creference is hereby made to a bill of items, of which a copy is in the hands of the parties of the first and second part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">We entirely agree with the general doctrine announced by the court below, that when the schedule is contained in the mortgage, or annexed thereto, or in any other way clearly made a part of the instrument, so as to make a reference thereto necessary to render the description of the mortgaged property certain and valid, then it should be recorded with the mortgage, for otherwise it would not give effectual notice to all concerned of what was intended to be conveyed. But, upon mature reflection, we are of the opinion that in the case before us, the reference to the schedule, or bill of items, does not necessarily make it a part of the mortgage, because the general description which precedes that reference is sufficient to give effectual notice of the property which was intended to be conveyed, and therefore it was not necessary that it should be recorded. The object of the schedule, it strikes us, was rather to fix the valuation of the various articles named therein, than to effect any other purpose. The main case bearing upon this point, is that of Winslow <em>vs. </em>Merchants\u2019 Ins. Co., already cited, where it was objected to the mortgage that it was invalid because there was no schedule annexed, according to a stipulation contained in it. Chief Justice Shaw, in delivering the opinion of the court, said, \u201c that it was good and available for all the articles in the shop at the time it was executed, so far as they remained and could be identified, although no schedule was annexed.\u201d We do not wish to be understood, in giving our opinion in this matter, as going to the full length of the decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In the case of Sawyer <em>vs. </em>Pennell, 19 Maine R., 167, referred to in Brinley <em>vs. </em>Spring, 7 Greenleaf, 241, (note <em>b.) </em>and 2 Hilliard on Mortgages, 266, it was held that, although a mortgage of personal property need not contain a specific schedule, in order to be valid, yet if it does contain such a schedule, so as to make it clearly a part thereof, the schedule must be recorded. We regret that we have not the whole case before us, but as we understand it, we regard the doctrine laid down therein as not conflicting with our opinion, but on the contrary as sustaining it.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Being of opinion that it was unnecessary to record the schedule, we sustain the exceptions so far as they relate to that point.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
