Hadley, in October last, with a sword or cutlass, with intent to murder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-3\">It appeared in evidence that the accused being the owner, and Hadley the captain of the lorcha -\u2018Premier,\u201d fell into a dispute about an item of ten dollars in the Captain\u2019s account, and from words came to blows. That they grappled and fell, the Captain being uppermost, and that upon the ret'action of some hard words used by the accused, Hadley let him up and walked to the outer door, where hejstood with his back towards Howard. That after standing there a short time, he heard footsteps, and turning, saw Howard rushing upon him with a drawn sword; that the accused struck Hadley three times with the sword or cutlass, and inflicted a severe wound upon his knee, which confined him to the house for several days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-4\">Tile defence sought to justify the act by showing that, previous to the attack, the accused ordered Hadley to leave his house, which he did not do, and consequently that Howard was authorized in making the assault.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aqi\">Mr. Bates, for the Crown.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"APP\">Mr. Harris, for Howard.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b41-5\">Chief Justice Lee</author>\n<p id=\"Aq6r\">charged the jury that the ground insisted upon by the defence was unsound That no man could ever be justified in using a deadly weapon against another except in the most extreme cases. That it was a mistaken opinion that when one man declined leaving another\u2019s house the owner was justified in attacking him with a deadly weapon. The rule of law, said the court, is, that before assaulting an intruder, the owner or occupant of the house must request him to leave, and allow him a reasonable time to depart, after which, if he refuse to go out, the owner or occupant may use such means to eject him, as are reasonable and necessary. He can only use deadly weapons in defence of himself and f.mily; and that if they found that Howard assaulted Hadley with the intent to murder him, the accused was guilty under the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The jury failed to find the intent to murder, and returned a veidict of \u201cnot guilty under the indictment.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
