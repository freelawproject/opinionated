Some forty-odd. school districts are included in the plan. The greater part of the money required is to be furnished by the State; but certain districts must bear a part of the cost. The amount to be contributed by each such district is specified in the Act. To enable such districts to finance the desired construction, \u00a7 15 of the Act provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cAny school district which is entitled under the provisions of this Act to an apportionment of a state share and which is required to provide a local share, is hereby authorized to issue its bonds for the purpose of raising money to pay its local share and raising such additional amount, if any, as such school district may desire to expend for school construction. If such bonds are issued, they shall be issued by the Board of Trustees or Board of Education of the school district pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 21 of Title 14 of the Delaware Code of 1953 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The Alfred I. Du Pont School District No. <em>7 </em>is one of the districts required to bear a share of the cost of school construction in that district. The board of trustees of that district has taken the necessary steps to authorize the issuance of bonds for school construction purposes. Pursuant to 14 <em>Del.C. </em>\u00a7 2120, the board on October 10, 1953, held an election in the nature of a referendum in order to authorize the proposed bond issue. <em>Section </em>2120 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">\u201cBefore any bonds shall be authorized and issued under the provisions of this chapter a special election shall be held in the usual places and in the same manner as other school elections of which notice shall be given by advertisements setting out the purpose of the election published in at least two newspapers in the county at least once a week for at least two weeks before the day of the election, the last publications thereof to be at least five days before the election, and by notice posted on the door of the voting place where such election is to be held. In all of such advertisements and notices the amount of bonds proposed to be issued and the purposes and reasons therefor shall be set forth plainly and in detail. At the election, at each voting place there shall be provided a sufficient number of ballots on which shall be written or printed the words \u2018for the bond'issue,\u2019 and an equal number of ballots on which shall be written or printed the words \u2018against the bond issue,\u2019 and each voter shall be entitled to receive both of said ballots, one of which the voter may deposit as his ballot, but any voter may prepare his own ballot and deposit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>that in lieu of the ballot provided. The polls for the election shall open at one o\u2019clock P. M. of the day advertised for holding the election and remain open until eight o\u2019clock P. M. The election shall be held by such persons as shall be designated by the School Board of the District concerned, and if the persons so designated are not present at the time for opening the polls, the voters present may name election officers consisting of an inspector, two judges and two tellers to hold the election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">It is to be observed that the quoted section does not in terms specify the qualifications of the voters of the district. It requires the election to be held \u201cin the same manner as other school elections\u201d. The qualifications of voters in school districts in which school trustees are elected are prescribed in 14 <em>Del.C. </em>\u00a7 314, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">\u201cEvery citizen who resides in the District in which the school election is being held and who would be entitled at the time of the holding of the school election to register and vote in any election district, of which the School District or Special School District is a part, at a general election, if such general election wrere held on the day of such school election, may vote at the school election in the District in which he resides, whether or not he is at the time a registered voter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">At the referendum held on October 10, 1953, voters with the qualifications specified in \u00a7 314 were permitted to vote. The result was a large majority in favor of the proposed issue. Thereafter objection to the validity of the referendum was made by a resident and taxpayer of the school district. It was asserted that \u00a7 2120 does not specify the qualifications of voters at the election, and notice was given that, if necessary, an injunction would be sought to prevent the issuance of the bonds. Thereupon the trustees filed in the court below against the taxpayer a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the bonds had been lawfully authorized. The Chancellor, pursuant to <em>Article </em>IV, \u00a7 11(9) of the <em>Constitution, Del.C.Ann., </em>has certified to us for answer the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u201cAre the qualifications of voters as set forth in 14 <em>Del.C. </em>\u00a7 314 incorporated by reference or implication in 14 <em>Del.C. </em>\u00a72120?\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The answer to the question thus propounded turns primarily upon the meaning of the phrase \u201cin the same manner\u201d appearing in \u00a7 2120. Does it include the voting qualifications prescribed for \u201cother school elections\u201d, or does it refer merely to procedure ?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The natural meaning of the phrase is plain. When a public body is directed by statute to perform a certain act \u201cin the same manner\u201d as that already prescribed by an earlier statute for the doing of a similar act, the obvious intent is that all the necessary steps so prescribed in the earlier statute shall be taken under the later one.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Since it is the undoubted legislative purpose that a valid election be held, the conclusion seems clear that the phrase in \u00a7 2120 was used in the natural sense, that is, in a broad sense, and was designed to incorporate by reference all the election provisions of the related school laws necessary to enable a valid election to be held. Certainly, a statement of the qualifications of voters is a necessary provision. The School Building Act of 1953, and \u00a7 2120 of <em>Title </em>14, are examples of the familiar statutory usage of incorporation by reference. It is a frequent practice, intended to.avoid duplication and prolixity, and calls for practical and sensible interpretation in fitting the provisions of the adopted statute into the scheme of the adopting one. In <em>Taft v. </em>Adams, 3 <em>Gray (Mass.) </em>126, Chief Justice Shaw said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\u201cWhen one statute thus refers to another, to avoid the prolixity arising from a repetition of all the provisions of the act referred to, it must be construed with this qualification, that the provisions of act referred to shall be applied in all those particulars, in which they can be applied without leading to absurd results; and if they cannot be applied in all particulars, they shall be applied as nearly as possible consistently with the provisions of the new act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">That case concerned a statute providing for an election of a county officer \u201cin the manner prescribed\u201d in another statute. It did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>not involve the determination of voting qualifications, but the court\u2019s statement of the applicable rule of construction is pertinent. It was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">\u201cWhen it is said in this statute, that county commissioners shall be chosen \u2018in the manner prescribed in the revised statutes,\u2019 we think this expression means not only the warrant for a meeting, and balloting by the voters in towns, but extends to all the other provisions necessary to give effect to the choice; such as returning, examining and declaring the votes, so as to make a complete election to the office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In <em>Consolidated Common School District v. Wood, (Tex.Civ. App.) </em>112 <em>S.W.2d </em>231, 236, a statute, <em>Vernon\u2019s Ann.Civ.St. Art. </em>2815, providing for dissolution of school districts \u201cin the same manner provided for their consolidation\u201d was held to incorporate by reference all the provisions of the consolidation statute, including those relating to the calling and holding of an election pursuant to the petition of qualified voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">If the rule of these cases is sound, it would follow that the qualification provisions of \u00a7 314 are sufficiently incorporated into \u00a7 2120 by reference, since the adoption of such provisions is necessary to give effect to the election. Such a conclusion seems especially appropriate here, because \u00a7 2120 deals specifically with many matters of procedure, and if the phrase \u201cin the same manner\u201d does not embrace voting qualifications, it has only minor significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">But we are met with a contention of the taxpayer that is not without plausibility. It is founded upon the legislative history of \u00a7 2120 and \u00a7 314, and upon a decision of the Superior Court in 1937 construing the language of \u00a7 2120, which at that time appeared as <em>Par. </em>2725 <em>of the Revised Code of </em>1935. This contention must now be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">First. Legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The forerunner of \u00a7 2120 is found in the fifth paragraph of \u00a7 53 <em>of the School Code of </em>1921, 32 <em>Del.L. c. </em>160. It provides, as does \u00a7 2120, that before bonds are authorized and issued by any school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>district a special election shall be held \u201cin the' same manner\u201d as other school elections. It also provides, as \u00a7 2120 does not, that: \u201cAt said election every person qualified to vote at a general election shall be entitled to vote.\u201d The subsequent deletion of this sentence came about in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In 1923 the <em>School Code </em>was amended by adding a new <em>Section </em>66 relating to elections in school districts outside of the City of Wilmington. 33 <em>Del.L.Ch. </em>181. The first paragraph of that section, as far as here pertinent, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201cIn every School Election in any School District or Special School District outside of the City of Wilmington, whether held for the purpose of a referendum or to elect school officers, or otherwise, every citizen, male or female, resident of said District, who would be entitled at the time of the holding of the School Election, to register and vote in any election District of which said School District or Special School District is a part at a General Election, if such General Election were to be held at the time of such School Election, shall be deemed to be a qualified voter and \u25a0 entitled to vote at such School Election in the School District or Special School District where he or she then resides, regardless of the fact whether he or she is at that time a registered voter or not * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">This section, applying as it did to every kind of school election, rendered superfluous the above quoted sentence in \u00a7 53. Accordingly, when \u00a7 53 was amended in 1925, 34 <em>Del.L. c. 173, </em>that sentence was deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The fifth paragraph of the former \u00a7 53 became the eighth paragraph of the new \u00a7 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In the <em>Revised Code of </em>1935 the eighth paragraph of \u00a7 53 as amended appears as <em>Par. </em>2725, and in the 1953 <em>Code </em>it appears as \u00a7 2120 of <em>Title </em>14. No change of importance was made in the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">As to the first paragraph of \u00a7 66 <em>of the School Code, </em>however, prescribing the general qualifications of voters at all school elections, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>a different situation appears. It was carried into the 1935 <em>Code </em>as <em>Par. </em>2753 without change in substance, but in compiling the 1953 <em>Code, </em>the Code Commission re-wrote the paragraph and made substantial changes. <em>Sections </em>314 <em>and </em>315 <em>of Chapter </em>3, dealing with \u201cSchool Board Elections\u201d, are based upon <em>Par. </em>2753, but the introductory language of that paragraph referring to \u201cevery School Election * * *, whether held for the purpose of a referendum or to elect school officers, or otherwise,\u201d has been omitted. As written, \u00a7 314 applies on its face only to the election of the members of the local School Board. Its application is further limited by \u00a7 302(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">\u201cThis Chapter applies to all Districts in Kent and Sussex Counties and to the following Districts in New Castle County: Claymont, Middletown, New Castle, Rose Hill-Minquadale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Now, it is plain that if the language of \u00a7 2120, providing that the bond election shall be held \u201cin the same manner as other school elections\u201d, is broad enough in itself to include the voting qualifications prescribed by \u00a7 314, all of the foregoing legislative history is immaterial. Defendant argues, however, that it follows from the legislative history that the quoted phrase must have originally referred only to procedure, because in the original statute a voting qualification was added, and when the voting qualification was dropped out the phrase retained its narrow meaning. Moreover, says defendant, it was so held by the Court in Banc in the case of <em>Du Pont v. Mills, 9 W.W.Harr. </em>42 ( 39 <em>Del. </em>42, 43), 196 <em>A. </em>168, 119 <em>A.L.R. </em>174.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Second. Du Pont v. Mills.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">This case involved the legality of a bond issue authorized by a special act of the General Assembly of 1937, 41 <em>Del.L. c. </em>171, for the purpose of borrowing money to erect a school building in Rehoboth. <em>Section </em>13 of that Act provided that before the bonds should be authorized and issued \u201ca Special Election shall be held * * * in the same manner as other school Elections\u201d. The court said that \u00a7 13 of the special act was in substance a copy of the eighth paragraph of \u00a7 53 <em>of the School Code, </em>embodied in the <em>Revised Code of </em>1935 <em>as Par. </em>2725. Because of the legislative history of that sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tion, above discussed, the court held that the quoted phrase referred to procedure only and did not include voting qualifications. The court also held that the Special Act of 1937 was passed in derogation of the School Code and was not <em>in pari materia </em>with the provisions of the Code, and hence the general voting qualification statute, <em>Par. </em>2753, was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Defendant argues that when <em>Par. </em>2725 was codified in 1953 as \u00a7 2120, its scope was limited by the construction placed upon it by the Superior Court in the <em>Mills </em>case. Defendant invokes the principle that when a statute that has received judicial construction is re-enacted it carries with it the construction so placed upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Defendant accordingly contends (1) that \u00a7314 on its face does not apply to bond referendums or indeed in any respect to the Alfred I. Du Pont School District; and (2) that \u00a7 2120, as judicially construed prior to its codification, does not refer to voting qualifications. There is hence a <em>casus </em>omissus, says defendant, and the attempted referendum in the district is a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">If this reasoning is correct, \u00a7 2120 is void for uncertainty and the greater part of the school building program must fail. The result is sufficiently startling to cause any court to hesitate to accept the somewhat technical reasoning upon which is based the alleged inadequacy of the language of \u00a7 2120 to incorporate the voting qualification of \u00a7 314. The opinion in <em>Du Pont v. Mills </em>recognizes the duty imposed upon courts to construe statutes to give them effect if it is reasonably possible to do so, and it was said that courts often \u201cgo far afield to avoid the consequences resulting from declaring invalid a statute, where grave questions of public convenience or necessity are involved\u201d. [9 <em>W.W.Harr. </em>(39 <em>Del.) </em>42, 196 <em>A. </em>179.]</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We do not think, however, that we are required to go far afield to sustain the validity of the act here assailed. For the following reasons, we think that <em>Du Pont v. Mills </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The rule of legislative approval of prior judicial construction by re-enactment of a statute is not a rule of law, but a rule of construction only. It must often yield to other and more persuasive con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>siderations. <em>American Ins. Co. v. Iaconi, Del., </em>89 <em>A.2d </em>141, 153. Such considerations exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The question before us involves not only the construction of \u00a7 2120, but the construction as a whole of the school election provisions of the entire School Code. When the Revised Code Commission codified the manifold laws relating to the public schools, it undertook, as authorized and directed by the General Assembly, to re-write the statutes in simple and direct language and to integrate and synthesize the multiplicity of statutes relating to the public schools. See the Report of the Revised Code Commission of December 31, 1952, <em>Vol. </em>2 <em>Del.C. pp. </em>ix-xix. An examination of the school laws in the 1953 <em>Code </em>shows that the eighteen articles in <em>Chapter 71 of the </em>1935 <em>Code, </em>the subsequent amendments to the 1935 <em>Code, </em>and other related statutes not found in <em>Chapter 71, </em>are incorporated in the 1953 <em>Code </em>as <em>Part </em>I of <em>Title </em>14. These laws were re-arranged, revised, and to some extent re-written. They are set forth in twenty-one chapters, many of the subjects of which do not follow the headings or arrangement of the 1935 <em>Code. </em>As so codified, <em>Title </em>14 is definitive law, and must be construed as such. <em>Monacelli v. Grimes, Del., </em>99 <em>A.2d </em>255.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In these circumstances we think that all of the related provisions of <em>Title </em>14 relating to school elections must be construed together and that construction must be adopted which achieves harmony and produces a reasonable result. It does not always follow, because a particular section has been judicially construed, that such construction was necessarily carried into the Code even if the language is unchanged. If the section stands alone, the prior construction may well control. But here we have a section that is closely linked to other sections in a comprehensive revision of statutes dealing with various aspects of the same subject \u2014 that of school district elections. <em>Section </em>2120 is to be construed in the light of its bearing upon the related sections, and that construction which brings accord will be chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Applying this principle, we see that the narrow construction of \u00a7 2120 contended for by defendant will produce a <em>casus omissus </em>and render the School Building Act of 1953 largely ineffective; whereas, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>if the language of \u00a7 2120 be given its natural meaning, the section is brought into harmony with the related sections, and a public project of great moment is saved from failure. The choice is not difficult to make; the latter construction is the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Accordingly, we think that the legislative history and the prior judicial construction of \u00a7 2120 are without significance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Defendant advances a subsidiary argument based upon the language of certain sections of <em>Chapters 9 </em>and 11 of <em>Title </em>14, relating to other school elections. <em>Section </em>1107, relating to elections on changing boundaries of school districts, incorporates by specific reference the voting qualifications prescribed in \u00a7 314. <em>Section </em>1108, relating to elections on the consolidation of districts, contains a like specific reference. <em>Section </em>1905, relating, to the raising of local school district taxes, also contains a specific incorporation of the provisions of \u00a7 314. Hence it is argued that the failure to incorporate in \u00a7 2120 a specific reference to \u00a7 314 is a manifest oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">This conclusion does not follow. None of the sections cited by defendant contains the phrase found in \u00a7 2120, i.e., that the election shall be held \u201cin the same manner as other school elections\u201d. This suggests that the practice of incorporating the provisions of \u00a7 314 by specific reference is not uniform in all sections of the Title. And in fact \u00a7 1106, dealing with the procedure for changing the boundaries of special school districts, contains a third species of incorporation by reference. In that section it is provided that the question to be voted upon shall be submitted \u201cto the qualified voters of the territory to be added to or taken from the Special School District\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Thus on the face of the Code there exists no uniform pattern of reference with respect to voting qualifications. In some of the sections the provisions of \u00a7 314 are specifically incorporated; in \u00a7 1905 the reference is to \u201cqualified voters\u201d; and in \u00a7 2120 appears the phrase we are here considering, viz., \u201cin the same manner as other school elections\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">We are justified in concluding that all of these three methods of referring to the conduct of the elections have the same purpose and meaning. Thus an analysis of the sections of <em>Title </em>14 dealing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>school elections constitutes a refutation of defendant\u2019s argument and affords support for the conclusion above indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Another argument of defendant must be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">It is said that, legislative history apart, the phrase \u201cin the same manner as other school elections\u201d has been generally held to refer to procedural details only and not to embrace voting qualifications. <em>Du Pont v. Mills </em>is cited as so holding. The majority opinion in that case does, indeed, appear to adopt such a construction of the phrase, independent of its legislative history. But we find ourselves unable to agree with it. The cases cited do not, in our opinion, sustain the holding. They are for the most part cases turning on the construction and scope of constitutional provisions prescribing voting qualifications for general elections, which qualifications, it is held, may not be varied in the election of local officials to be chosen \u201cin the manner\u201d to be prescribed by law. These holdings do not touch the question before us, which is one of the construction of a statute embodied in a revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We are of opinion that \u00a7 2120, read together with other pertinent sections of <em>Title </em>14, incorporates by reference the voting qualifications of \u00a7 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">It follows that the question certified must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
