In light of our additional determination, inter alia, that certain other signatures in dispute are also invalid, the appellant\u2019s designating petition does not contain a sufficient number of valid signatures. Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>petition, inter alia, to validate the designating petition and dismissed the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">The appellant\u2019s remaining contentions are either not properly before this Court or without merit.
