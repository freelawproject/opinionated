At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> overruled Russell\u2019s objection to the assignment of 3 criminal history points for a 1991 Kansas burglary sentence of 2-5 years imprisonment. In addition, the district court permitted a psychologist who had examined Russell to testify on matters that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>help the court recommend an appropriate facility for treatment, but did not allow testimony as to why Russell committed his crime. The court then sentenced Russell to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, Russell challenges the criminal-history calculation and the exclusion of evidence pertaining to his state of mind at the time he committed his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in assigning 3 points for the prior burglary sentence, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(a) (add 3 points for prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding 1 year and 1 month): the Kansas court \u2014 upon revoking Russell\u2019s probation \u2014 ordered execution of the originally suspended sentence of 2-5 years, and Russell in fact served some jail time on that sentence, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.2) (criminal history points are based on sentence pronounced, not length of time actually served; prior sentence is considered sentence of imprisonment if defendant actually served a period of imprisonment on such sentence). We further conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the state-of-mind evidence, especially in light of Russell\u2019s insistence that he did not seek to present the evidence in support of a diminished-capacity departure. <em>See United, States v. Granados, </em>202 F.3d 1025,1027-28 (8th Cir.2000) (district court has discretion to determine whether to allow testimony or receive additional evidence at sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-16\">.
