At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed a two-level obstruction-of-justice adjustment based on the escape; denied a three-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction; overruled McDanniel\u2019s objection to treating his three prior forgery sentences as unrelated; and imposed concurrent sentences of 78 months in prison on the firearm charge and 60 months on the escape charge, and three years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>On appeal, counsel filed a brief and moved to -withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the district court\u2019s rulings on McDanniel\u2019s criminal history and on the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. We conclude the district court did not err in treating McDanniel\u2019s prior forgery sentences as unrelated, because each was separated by an intervening arrest. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) <em>&amp; </em>comment, (n.3). The district court also did not err in concluding that McDanniel\u2019s case was not so extraordinary as to warrant both an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction and an obstruction-of-justice enhancement. <em>See United States v. Honken, </em>184 F.3d 961, 970 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 1056, 120 S.Ct. 602, 145 L.Ed.2d 500 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In a pro se supplemental brief, McDanniel argues that statements he made at the plea hearing denying his ownership of certain firearms indicated his plea was not knowing and voluntary. However, McDanniel\u2019s plea-hearing statements that he possessed the firearm and ammunition described in the indictment, and that he had been convicted previously of a felony, established an adequate factual basis for his plea. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); <em>United States v. Marks, </em>38 F.3d 1009, 1012-13 (8th Cir.1994), <em>cert, denied, </em>514 U.S. 1067, 115 S.Ct. 1700, 131 L.Ed.2d 562 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Having reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, deny McDanniel\u2019s request for new counsel, and affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-15\">. The HONORABLE MICHAEL J.
