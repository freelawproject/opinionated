Cleland, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Betty L. Sneed, an Ohio resident proceeding pro se, appeals a district court judgment dismissing her civil action filed pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">On July 27, 2000, Sneed filed a complaint against the United States Department of Labor, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d). Sneed alleged that she had requested certain documents from her workers\u2019 compensation file under the FOIA and the Privacy Act, but the OWCP refused to provide her with those documents. Specifically, Sneed sought \u201cMemorandums To The Director\u201d dated August 20, 1985, March 8, 1996, December 30, 1998, and July 20, 1999. On November 28, 2000, Sneed filed an amended complaint in which she asserted a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits that had previously been denied her by the OWCP during the administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">The OWCP filed a motion for summary judgment, to which Sneed responded. On December 26, 2000, the district court granted the OWCP\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Sneed\u2019s motion to amend her complaint. Sneed has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Kincaid v. Gibson, </em>236 F.3d 342, 346 (6th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence presented shows \u201c \u2018that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the OWCP with respect to Sneed\u2019s FOIA/Privacy Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>A plaintiff may bring a private cause of action under the FOIA in federal court upon a showing that an agency has improperly withheld its records. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B); <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 150, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980). The agency\u2019s possession of the requested documents is an indispensable prerequisite to liability in a FOIA suit. <em>See Kissinger, </em>445 U.S. at 155, 100 S.Ct. 960. A plaintiff \u201cmay bring a civil action against an agency that fails to comply with any provision of the [Privacy] Act \u2018in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.\u2019\u201d <em>Cardamone v. Cohen, </em>241 F.3d 520, 525 (6th Cir.2001) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(1)(D)).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The OWCP filed affidavits by two OWCP officials, in which both stated that they had reviewed official files and that no documents had been withheld. In response, Sneed did not present any evidence that the OWCP possesses the documents she seeks, which is a prerequisite for FOIA liability. <em>See Kissinger, </em>445 U.S. at 155, 100 S.Ct. 960. Since the documents requested by Sneed did not exist, the OWCP did not improperly withhold agency records. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We also conclude that the district court properly denied Sneed\u2019s motion to amend her complaint. <em>See Fisher v. Roberts, </em>125 F.3d 974, 977 (6th Cir.1997); <em>LRL Properties v. Portage Metro Hous. Auth., </em>55 F.3d 1097, 1104 (6th Cir.1995). In her amended complaint, Sneed claimed that she suffered a knee injury during the course of her employment with the United States Postal Service, which rendered her disabled. A claim for such an injury is covered by the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, which provides the sole avenue for redress. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8102; <em>Jones v. TVA </em>948 F.2d 258, 265 (6th Cir. 1991); <em>McCall v. United States, </em>901 F.2d 548, 549 (6th Cir.1990). Thus, any amendment of Sneed\u2019s complaint to add a claim based upon the OWCP\u2019s denial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits would have been futile. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b); <em>Owens, v. Brock, </em>860 F.2d 1363, 1367 (6th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
