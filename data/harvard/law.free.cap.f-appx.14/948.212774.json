Specifically, they argue that their due process rights were infringed when the BIA summarily dismissed their appeal. The BIA summarily dismissed the appeal because counsel for the Bolanos failed to provide an additional brief as he indicated he would on the appeal form. The parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of the case; therefore, we will not recount it here. We have jurisdiction under the \u201ctransitional rules\u201d for judicial review under \u00a7 309(c)(4) of IIRIRA, and we affirm the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1149-50 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-19\">The BIA based its summary dismissal on 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.1(d)(1-a)(i)(E).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BIA was correct in dismissing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>appeal because Bolanos failed to file a brief as indicated on the appeal form (EOIR-26). Appeal form EOIR-26 is not misleading as the Bolanos contend it is. Last amended in 1996, EOIR-26 provides clear, easy to read instructions along with ample room for petitioners to write reasons for appeal. Counsel for the Bolanos voluntarily marked the box indicating a separate brief would be filed, he later filed for extensions to file the brief, and after refusing to grant the second extension, the BIA explained to the Bolanos that \u201cbriefs must be RECEIVED at the Appeals Processing Unit by the due date.\u201d Thus, the Bolanos\u2019 due process rights were not violated as they were on clear notice of what the repercussions would be if they failed to provide a brief to the BIA. Even if the Bolanos had not indicated they would file an additional brief, \u00a7 3.1(d)(1-a)(i)(A) would still apply as the reasons specified on the form for the appeal are inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">On the appeal form, counsel for the Bolanos gave these reasons for appeal: 1, \u201cThe Immigration Judge erred in deciding that Francisco Bolanos (A73-972-947) would not suffer \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 were he required to return to Mexico,\u201d and 2, \u201cThe Immigration Judge erred in deciding that the other Respondents had not been \u2018continuously physically present\u2019 in the United States for seven years.\u201d In giving reasons for the appeal, the petitioner should \u201cinform the BIA of what aspects of the IJ\u2019s decision were allegedly incorrect and why.\u201d <em>Reyes-Mendoza v. INS, </em>774 F.2d 1364 (9th Cir.1985). Here, even though counsel for the Bolanos had ample room to explain the appeal, he only briefly mentioned the reasons and did not explain why the IJ\u2019s decision was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">This is an unfortunate case where the incompetency of counsel jeopardized the Bolanos\u2019 appeal. Under the law, however, the BIA was justified in the summary dismissal of the appeal. Although we affirm the BIA\u2019s summary dismissal of the appeal, it is important to note that the Bola-nos are still entitled to voluntary departure which was granted by the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b977-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
