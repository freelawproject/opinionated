Scullin, Jr., <em>Chief District Judge </em>), convicting him, after a plea of guilty, of transporting illegal aliens within the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii); sentencing him to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release; and assessing against him a fine of $12,500. Kong seeks a remand for resentencing on the basis that this sentence was unduly harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">\u201c[A] sentence that falls within a Guidelines range is not appealable absent a showing that the Guidelines were misapplied or the sentence imposed was illegal.... The remaining subsections of [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3742 do not apply to sentences imposed within a Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Soliman, </em>889 F.2d 441, 443 (2d Cir.1989). Kong concedes that the sentence and fine imposed were within the applicable Guidelines range. We find that Kong has failed to point to anything in the record or to any case law that suggests that the district court misapplied the Guidelines or imposed a sentence in violation of the law. We therefore lack jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">For the reasons set forth above, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
