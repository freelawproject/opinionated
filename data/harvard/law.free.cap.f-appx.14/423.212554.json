Originally estimated to take three days to try, the case had stretched into a second week when District Judge Richard A. Enslen declared a mistrial. The case was reassigned to District Judge David W. McKeague for a new trial, and Spears filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on a claimed double jeopardy violation. Judge McKeague denied Spears\u2019s motion to dismiss and a subsequent motion for rehearing. Spears invoked his right to an immediate appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-20\">Judge Enslen determined that \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 compelled a mistrial due to possible jury bias and prejudice to Spears resulting from defense counsel\u2019s dismal performance and commission of various errors at trial, and the belated revelation that his client, Spears, had been unable to hear anything during the first two days of the proceedings. Judge McKeague reviewed the record and the legal issues and, in a well-crafted opinion, denied Spears\u2019s motion to dismiss because he also found, on the same grounds, that manifest necessity warranted a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-21\">After thoroughly reviewing the entire record, the pertinent precedents and authority on double jeopardy, the parties\u2019 arguments, and the district court\u2019s detailed and able resolution of the motion to dismiss, we conclude that there is no merit to Spears\u2019s appeal. For these reasons, and for the reasons explained in the district court judges\u2019 opinions, we AFFIRM Judge McKeague\u2019s order denying the motion to dismiss, filed March 8, 2000, and his order denying the motion for rehearing, filed April 5, 2000.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
