New-ell. Count 7 charged Newell with making a materially false statement to Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) Special Agent Blanche Wilson in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2), which prohibits the making of \u201cany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\u201d concerning \u201cany matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully.\u201d The government alleged that Newell falsely stated to Wilson that he never told anyone he was a certified public accountant (\u201cCPA\u201d), nor had he ever held himself out to be a CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-20\">On January 31, 2000, the district court held a hearing on Newell\u2019s motion to dismiss Counts 6 and 7, granting Newell\u2019s motion with respect to Count 7 on the ground that whether or not Newell ever held himself out to be a CPA was not material within the meaning of \u00a7 1001. The government filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied by order dated March 17, 2000. The district court held that the government failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>to show that Newell\u2019s false statement to Wilson was material within the meaning of \u00a7 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">After careful review of the record in this case, the applicable law, counsels\u2019 briefs and arguments, and the opinion of the district court, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Count 7 of the superseding indictment. We also believe that the issuance of a full written opinion in this case would be duplicative and serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, based upon the reasoning set forth in the district court\u2019s March 17, 2000, order, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
