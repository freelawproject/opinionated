Kahn, Judge) granting plaintiff-appellee Steven True-man\u2019s motion for reconsideration and establishing his title to the Historic Steam-tug <em>New York, </em>pursuant to the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(a)(3). Dluhos was not a party to the action below. This is Dluhos\u2019s third appeal in this court, in which he claims ownership in the <em>New York, </em>an iron steam tugboat built in 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-23\">Dluhos first filed suit <em>in rem </em>under admiralty jurisdiction to assert title to the <em>Neto York. </em>In <em>Dluhos v. Floating and Abandoned Vessel, Known as \u201cNew York\u201d, </em>162 F.3d 63 (2d Cir.1998) <em>(\u201cDluhos </em>I\u201d) we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>concluded that the district court properly declined to \u201carrest\u201d the vessel because Dluhos failed to post the necessary bond. Thus, we determined that because arrest was a required precondition to the action, the district court lacked <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the vessel. We affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Dluhos\u2019s motion to amend his complaint to assert diversity jurisdiction as an alternative basis for the action. We held that the nature of Dluhos\u2019s action was exclusive to admiralty jurisdiction, and that even if it were cognizable in diversity the court would have had to apply the substantive law of admiralty, which \u201ccarries with it a legal fiction that a vessel may not be abandoned. Because a successful claim under the law of finds requires that the found property be abandoned, the fiction of nonabandonment dictates that Mr. Dluhos\u2019s claim must fail.\u201d <em>Dluhos I, </em>162 F.3d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In Dluhos\u2019s second action commenced in 1999, Dluhos sued Steven Trueman (the plaintiff here) in diversity, as the \u201cowner\u201d seeking the \u201cimmediate return and possession of [Dluhos\u2019s] property,\u201d the <em>Neiu York. </em>Dluhos characterized the action as a diversity suit under the common-law doctrines of \u201creplevin\u201d \u201cdetinue\u201d and \u201cconversion.\u201d The district court denied Dluhos\u2019s claim, which it construed as sounding in admiralty, on the basis that it sought the same <em>in rem </em>relief as in <em>Dluhos I. </em>We dismissed Dluhos\u2019s appeal as frivolous because to the extent that \u201cappellant had the opportunity in a prior proceeding to raise the claims he is now asserting, his complaint is barred by res judicata.\u201d. <em>See Dluhos v. Trueman, </em>No. 99-9518 (2d Cir. Oct. 20,2000) <em>(\u201cDluhos II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In the case now on appeal, the plaintiff Steven Trueman commenced an <em>in rem </em>action seeking a declaration of legal title to the <em>New York. </em>Trueman\u2019s claim was based on a contract with the State of New York awarding him \u201cany interest\u201d the State had in the vessel in exchange for his restoring and towing it from the Erie Canal. Initially the district court rejected his claim, but on Trueman\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the district court found that (1) the State of New York had legal title to the vessel as \u201cabandoned property\u201d under the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(a)(3); (2) the State properly transferred legal title to Trueman as part of the towing agreement; and therefore (3) True-man had legal title to the <em>New York. </em>Dluhos continues to assert that he is the ship\u2019s true owner, but did not move formally to intervene in the district court. He now \u201cappeals\u201d from the district court\u2019s judgment, claiming principally that the State of New York never gained title over the <em>New York </em>because the ship could not have been \u201cabandoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Nonparties do not have standing to appeal an order of the district court. <em>See United States v. International Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>931 F.2d 177, 183 (2d Cir.1991). An exception to this general rule permits a nonparty to appeal \u201cwhen the nonparty has an interest that is affected by the trial court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). However, this exception does not apply where Dluhos\u2019s claims of ownership -were litigated and determined in <em>Dluhos I </em>and he thus has no cognizable interest in the outcome. <em>See Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). Res judicata bars litigation even of claims that are predicated on new legal theories. <em>See L-Tec Elecs. Corp. v. Cougar Elec. Org., </em>198 F.3d 85, 88 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam). We conclusively determined Dluhos\u2019s lack of ownership interest in the <em>New York </em>when we held that a motion to amend his complaint to allege diversity jurisdiction would have been futile in <em>Dluhos I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">In addition, we hereby serve notice to Dluhos that further filing of suits and appeals in connection with the ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>of the <em>New York </em>may result in the imposition of sanctions, including (in this Court) the imposition of a requirement that he obtain leave of court prior to the filing or acceptance of any appeal by him. Such sanctions are appropriately applied to those litigants who have a \u201cclear pattern of abusing the litigation process by filing vexatious and frivolous complaints.\u201d <em>In re Sassower, </em>20 F.3d 42, 44 (2d Cir. Jud. Council 1994). Dluhos has demonstrated this through his previous and current frivolous appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We have considered Dluhos\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons set forth above, the appeal is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
