We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">1. We review the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA de novo. <em>Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 896 (9th Cir.2000). Because Mr. Barron-Flores\u2019 immigration proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997, the provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 are not applicable here. <em>Rivera Morena v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 481, 485 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">2. Mr. Barron-Flores, a citizen of Mexico, is charged with deportability for entry without, inspection in violation of INA \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B). Because there is no comparable ground for exclusion under INA \u00a7 212(a), he is ineligible for a waiver of deportation under INA \u00a7 212(c). <em>Komarenko v. I.N.S., </em>35 F.3d 432 (9th Cir. 1994); <em>Cabasug v. I.N.S., </em>847 F.2d 1321 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">3. Mr. Barron-Flores is further charged with deportability for helping Martha Cecilia Castillo, also a citizen of Mexico, to enter into the United States illegally. Mr. Barron-Flores was not married to Ms. Castillo at the time of her illegal entry. Therefore, he is also ineligible for a waiver under INA \u00a7 241(a)(1)(E)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-15\">For the forgoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1005-12\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 *h Cir.
