She contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that summary judgment was inappropriate because a reasonable factfinder could have found that she was terminated because of those inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>We reject Vasquez\u2019s argument. Vasquez\u2019s former employer made a strong showing that it discharged Vasquez because it wanted to automate most of the functions that she performed and because it wanted to hire a staff accountant supervisor. Vasquez did not produce evidence that would permit a reasonable factfinder to find that she was dismissed in retaliation for her inquiries relating to her \u00a7 401 (k) plan balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
