We dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-26\">IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules apply to this case as deportation proceedings began before April 1, 1997, and the final order of deportation was ordered after October 30, 1996. Under the transitional rules, all petitions for review must be \u201cfiled not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of exclusion or deportation.\u201d <em>Narayan v. INS, </em>105 F.3d 1335, 1335 (9th Cir.1997). Ashenafi filed her petition for review more than a year after the BIA\u2019s April 30, 1999 final order of deportation, well beyond the 30 day time period. This court does not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>and withholding of deportation if the petition for review is filed untimely. <em>Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996). Ashenafi\u2019s filing of a motion to reopen or for reconsideration did not toll the statutory time for filing the petition for review of the underlying final deportation order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">This court also lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Ashenafi\u2019s motion for reconsideration of suspension of deportation. Under IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules, \u201cthere shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision.\u201d <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). The determination of \u201cextreme hardship\u201d for suspension of deportation is a discretionary act, and therefore not reviewable by this court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b902-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
