We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, <em>See Martinez-Villa-real v. Lewis, </em>80 F.3d 1301, 1305 (9th Cir.1996), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Weldon\u2019s contention that the district court erred by dismissing his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition for containing an unexhausted claim lacks merit because Weldon\u2019s fourth claim was never fully and fairly presented to the California Supreme Court. <em>See Anderson v. Harless, </em>459 U.S. 4, 6, 103 S.Ct. 276, 74 L.Ed.2d 3 (1982) (holding that in order to satisfy the \u201cfair presentation\u201d requirement, \u201ca federal habeas petitioner [must] provide the state courts with a \u2018fair opportunity\u2019 to apply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing upon his constitutional claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Indeed, review of the record shows that Weldon\u2019s claim alleges additional claims of ineffective assistance that were not raised in either his state habeas petition or his supplement to the state habeas petition. <em>See Anderson, </em>459 U.S. at 6, 103 S.Ct. 276. Because a habeas petition containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims generally must be dismissed in its entirety, <em>see Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 510,102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982), the district court did not err by dismissing Weldon\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as unexhausted. <em>Carriger v. Lewis, </em>971 F.2d 329, 333-34 (9th Cir. 1992) (en banc) (stating that defendant\u2019s new theories of ineffective assistance of counsel not previously included in the state petition were unexhausted).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b811-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
