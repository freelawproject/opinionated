Her conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Missouri Court of Appeals, her motion for state post-conviction relief was denied by the trial court, and that ruling was affirmed by the Missouri Court of Appeals on September 24, 1996. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), she had one year from that date to file a petition for federal habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(d)(2). Instead, she filed a motion to recall the mandate in the Missouri Court of Appeals on January 11, 1999, which was promptly denied, and then filed this \u00a7 2254 petition on May 14, 1999. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed the petition as time-barred, and Ms. Greene appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">The court then granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of equitable tolling, observing that \u201cthe circumstances under which AEDPA\u2019s time limitations may be equitably tolled are not completely settled in this circuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">On appeal, Ms. Greene argues, as she did in the district court, that AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations should be equitably tolled in this case because her post-conviction attorney mistakenly advised Ms. Greene that the filing of a motion to recall the mandate in the Missouri Court of Appeals after the one year limitations period had expired would \u201cafford [Ms. Greene] a new one year period before her time to file a 2254 action lapses.\u201d However, while her appeal was pending, this court issued its decision in <em>Kreutzer v. Bowersox, </em>231 F.3d 460, 463 (8th Cir.2000)<em>,petition for cert, filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W.(U.S. June 11, 2001) (No. 00-10520), which rejected the contention that equitable tolling is appropriate when counsel has misled a petitioner as to the applicable limitations period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-15\">Equitable tolling is proper only when extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a [\u00a7 2254] petition on time.... Even in the case of an unrepresented prisoner alleging a lack of legal knowledge or legal resources, equitable tolling has not been warranted.... Thus, tolling is even less appropriate in a case where the petitioner is represented by counsel.... We agree with those courts that have found that counsel\u2019s confusion about the applicable statute of limitations does not warrant equitable tolling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-16\">(Citations omitted.) Ms. Greene urges us to reconsider <em>Kreutzer, </em>but a panel of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>court may not do so. Applying <em>Kreutzer, </em>the district court was correct in concluding that Ms. Greene can point to no extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling of the AEDPA statute of limitations, and its judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-17\">.
