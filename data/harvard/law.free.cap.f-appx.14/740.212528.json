Mr. Rosendahl claimed that defendants (1) retaliated against him for filing lawsuits and grievances by issuing him false conduct violations and placing him in administrative segregation, (2) denied him access to the courts by seizing and storing his legal materials, and (3) violated his free speech rights by opening an envelope con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>taining a letter he wrote and then punishing him for the letter\u2019s contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Having reviewed the record de novo, we affirm for the reasons explained by the district court. <em>See Davis v. Norris, </em>249 F.3d 800, 801 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (\u201cPrisoners\u2019 First Amendment rights may be circumscribed if legitimate penological objectives outweigh preservation of their rights.\u201d); <em>Rouse v.

Howard, </em>109 F.3d 427, 430 (8th Cir.1997) (there is no \u00a7 1983 liability based on prison officials\u2019 violation of prison policy; inmate must prove constitutional-right violation); <em>Goff v. Burton, </em>91 F.3d 1188, 1191 (8th Cir.1996) (to avoid liability on inmate\u2019s retaliatory-discipline claim, defendants must simply prove there was \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting their decision to discipline him; claim must fail if contested discipline was imposed for actual rule violation); Gas<em>sler v.
