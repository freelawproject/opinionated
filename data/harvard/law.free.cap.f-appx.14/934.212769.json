We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines and its application of those guidelines to a particular case for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d 464, 472 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">Summers contends that the district court erred by denying his request for a mitigating role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2 because the district court misinterpreted and misapplied the sentencing guidelines. We conclude that the district court, not having the benefit of our decision in <em>Rojas-Millan, </em>erroneously limited the scope of its evaluation of Summers\u2019 role in the offense, and accordingly vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. <em>Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d at 473-474 (concluding that defendant\u2019s culpability should be evaluated relative to all participants in a criminal scheme); <em>see also United States v. Demers, </em>13 F.3d 1381, 1386 (9th Cir.1994) (concluding that the district court must determine whether defendant\u2019s role and culpability in larger context of his offense were sufficiently minor or minimal compared to other participants).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">VACATED and REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b963-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
