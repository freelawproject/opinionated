We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni </em>31 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">With respect to defendants Dupnik and Carmona, the district court properly granted summary judgment because Cox attempted to base their liability on a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory. <em>See Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989). With respect to defendant Pima County Jail, the district court properly granted summary judgment because Cox failed to present evidence of a policy or custom which caused his alleged injuries. <em>See Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 403-04, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">With respect to defendants Dexter and Slocum, the district court properly granted summary judgment because Cox demonstrated, at most, that defendants engaged in medical malpractice or that they had a different opinion about proper medical care for Cox. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Jackson v. McIntosh, </em>90 F.3d 330, 332 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-16\">With respect to defendant Jaskiewicz, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Cox\u2019s claims relating to pain management and the provision of a wheelchair because these amounted to differences of opinion, <em>see Jackson, </em>90 F.3d at 332, and Cox submitted no admissible evidence demonstrating that a delay in treatment of his herniated discs caused further injury, <em>see McGuckin v. Smith, </em>974 F.2d 1050, 1059 (9th Cir.1992), <em>overruled on other grounds, WMX Techs., Inc. v. Miller, </em>104 F.3d 1133 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc). With respect to Cox\u2019s claim concerning incontinence, the district court properly granted summary judgment because Cox failed to demonstrate that his condition was a serious medical need. <em>See McGuckin, </em>974 F.2d at 1059-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>We reject Cox\u2019s remaining contentions as meritless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZzF\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b940-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-18\">. Although our review of Cox\u2019s summary judgment motion convinces us that the error is harmless in this case, we note that the district court\u2019s notice concerning the requirements for opposing summary judgment, since it is phrased almost entirely in technical legal terminology, is inadequate. See <em>Rand v. Rowland, </em>154 F.3d 952, 960, 961-62 (9th Cir. 1998) and Appendix \"A\u201d (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
