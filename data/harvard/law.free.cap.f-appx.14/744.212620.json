On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment before he could complete discovery. However, he neither sought an extension nor filed an affidavit describing the facts he sought, as required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f). Consequently, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the case was ripe for summary judgment. <em>See Dulany v. Carnahan, </em>132 F.3d 1234, 1237-38 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-20\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-17\">.
