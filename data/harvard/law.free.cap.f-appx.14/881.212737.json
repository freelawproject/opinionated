Cezberg-Loarca contends that in light of <em>Apprendi v. Neto Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court erred in imposing a sentence in excess of the two-year maximum set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) based upon prior aggravated felonies which the indictment did not allege, to which he did not admit, and which were not submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He also contends that <em>Apprendi </em>renders inapplicable <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a sentencing factor and not a separate offense), because he did not admit to an aggravated felony at his plea hearing. He further contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), as construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>is unconstitutional on its face after <em>Apprendi. </em>His arguments are foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b909-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
