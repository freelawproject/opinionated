We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-20\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>United States v. Charlesworth, </em>217 F.3d 1155, 1157 (9th Cir.2000), as well as the legal issue of whether the district court provided adequate reasons for sentencing a defendant to a particular point within the guideline range, <em>United States v. Duran, </em>37 F.3d 557, 560 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-21\">Douglas contends that because his use of force occurred during an arrest two months after his initial escape from custody, the district court erred in imposing a five-level upward adjustment for use of force during an escape, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2P1.1(b)(1). We disagree. Because escape is a continuing offense, it is irrelevant that Douglas did not use force to instigate his initial escape from custody, but rather to avoid subsequent capture. <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 413, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980) (recognizing escape as continuing offense); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a) (defining relevant conduct to include defendant\u2019s actions during commission of and in attempting to avoid responsibility for offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Douglas next contends the district court failed to adequately state its reasons for imposing a sentence at the high end of the guideline range. This contention fails because the district court was not required to do so. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1); <em>see United States v. Howard, </em>894 F.2d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.1990) (requiring district court to state reasons only if sentencing range, and not sentence itself, exceeds twenty-four months).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b961-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
