In the first order appealed, the district court denied Coffey\u2019s motion to amend his action to add a claim based upon the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal of this order substantially on the reasoning of the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Coffey, </em>Nos. CR-98-192-V; CA-00-170-1V (W.D.N.C. filed Jan. 30, 2001; entered Feb. 2, 2001). In the second order, Coffey appeals from the district court\u2019s final order denying him relief under \u00a7 2255. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Coffey v. United States, </em>Nos. CR-98-192-V; CA-00-170 (W.D.N.C. filed Apr. 19, 2001; entered May 8, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b227-10\"> We recently held in <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139 (4th Cir.2001), that the new rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. Accordingly, Appellant\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim is not cognizable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
