Patton challenges the district court\u2019s failure to grant him an acceptance-of-responsibility sentencing reduction, arguing that the district court\u2019s application of an obstruction-of-justice enhancement did not, as the district court found, preclude a simultaneous acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, because his case is an \u201cextraordinary case\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d). The Government concedes that Patton\u2019s case should be remanded for resentencing because the district court, in refusing to grant Patton an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, failed to consider only that portion of Patton\u2019s conduct that occurred after he was put on notice of a federal interest in his case, as required by our decision in <em>United States v. Jeter, </em>191 F.3d 637 (6th Cir.1999). We therefore VACATE Patton\u2019s sentence and REMAND his case for resentencing in accordance with <em>Jeter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Triggs assigns error to: (1) the district court\u2019s sentencing enhancement for his abduction of a customer during the commission of a robbery; (2) the district court\u2019s determination that Triggs was required to serve his federal sentence consecutive to the sentence stemming from his state parole violation; and (3) the district court\u2019s refusal to sentence him as a minor participant in the criminal enterprise. All of Triggs\u2019s claims lack merit, and accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s disposition of his case in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">On the afternoon of January 15, 1999, armed gunmen Martilus Patton, Lafayette Howard, and Mark Crawford entered the First Tennessee Bank in Memphis, Tennessee, whereupon they ordered the bank\u2019s customers to he face down on the floor and its employees to turn over all available funds to them. Howard jumped the teller counter and collected the money, after which he and the other gunmen fled the bank. Before exiting the bank, the gunmen took a customer hostage; once outside and some distance from the bank, however, they released the hostage and fled in a getaway car driven by Courtney Triggs. An observer outside the bank witnessed their escape, cahed law enforcement authorities, and provided them with a description of the getaway car. Upon locating the car, officers gave chase. The car stopped and its four occupants jumped out and attempted to escape. Crawford and Patton were apprehended on the scene. Howard and Triggs evaded immediate capture but were apprehended shortly thereafter. The defendants were advised of their rights and escorted to a secure detainment room for questioning. While awaiting interrogation, Patton removed one of the ceiling tiles and attempted to escape by crawling through the ceiling to safety. He was apprehended without incident when an officer observed his foot hanging from the ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">A federal grand jury in the Western District of Tennessee named Patton, Triggs, Crawford, and Howard in a seven-count indictment on February 25, 1999. The indictment charged Patton and Triggs with armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d) (Count One); confining a victim during a bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(e) (Count Two); carrying and using a firearm during and in relation to a bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j) (Count Three); and possessing a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j) (Count Four). Triggs was also charged with possessing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>firearm after a prior felony conviction, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">On July 19, 1999, Patton entered a plea of guilty to Counts One, Two, and Three. The district court concluded that Patton\u2019s prior attempted escape on January 15, 1999, while awaiting questioning provided a sufficient basis for an obstruction-of-justice enhancement. In light of the obstruction enhancement, the district court found that Patton was precluded from receiving an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. A nineteen-year imprisonment term resulted. On the subsequent motion of the Government, the district court granted a downward departure for Patton\u2019s substantial assistance in the Government\u2019s investigation and prosecution of this case and sentenced him to fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Triggs pleaded guilty to Counts One and Three of the indictment on July 21, 1999. At sentencing, the district court applied a four-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A) of the Guidelines because a person was abducted during the commission of the offense. It also refused to apply a minor-participant sentencing reduction. The district court did, however, grant the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure and sentenced Triggs to 194 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"pAeo\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">A. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">A defendant who clearly demonstrates an acceptance of responsibility for his offense may be entitled to a two or three-level reduction in his offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Although conduct that results in a \u00a7 3C1.1 obstruction enhancement, as Patton\u2019s in the present case, generally indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct, there may be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \u00a7 3C1.1 and \u00a7 3E1.1 are appropriate. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. 4 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Patton concedes that the district court\u2019s application of an obstruction enhancement for his attempted escape was appropriate, but argues that his is an extraordinary case and that the district court\u2019s refusal to grant him an aeceptanee-of-responsibility reduction was error. In support of his argument, he points to the fact that all of his actions evidencing such an acceptance occurred <em>after </em>his attempted escape from the detention facility: \u201c[s]ince his arrest, [he] has confessed, truthfully admitted the offenses of conviction and applicable relevant conduct, waived his detention hearing, promptly negotiated and entered a guilty plea, admitted his conduct in open court at the change of plea hearing and made a voluntary statement regarding his involvement to [a probation officer].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determination of whether a defendant has accepted responsibility for his crime. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>152 F.3d 507, 512 (6th Cir.1998). A district court\u2019s determination that a defendant\u2019s case is an \u201cextraordinary case\u201d permitting a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement and a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction, however, is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>246 F.3d 520, 525 (6th Cir.2001). A defendant seeking an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction must prove facts entitling him to such a reduction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Tucker, </em>925 F.2d 990, 991 (6th Cir.1991). Because, however, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility ...., the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">We identify extraordinary cases by conducting a fact-based inquiry referring to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u00a7 3E1.1\u2019s application notes for guidance. <em>See Robinson, </em>152 F.3d at 512-13. Appropriate considerations for determining whether a reduction is warranted include the defendant\u2019s truthful admission of the offense conduct, the defendant\u2019s voluntary assistance to authorities in recovering the fruits and instrumentalities of the offense, and the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s conduct in affirmatively accepting responsibility for his actions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. 1. Our recent cases have emphasized that a district court, in determining whether such a reduction is appropriate, may consider only a defendant\u2019s conduct occurring after he is placed on notice \u201cthat the federal government has an interest in his or her affairs.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeter, </em>191 F.3d 637, 639-40 (6th Cir.1999). That is, only when a defendant is aware that his conduct may subject him to federal prosecution may his conduct properly be considered by a district court in evaluating his eligibility for such a reduction. See <em>United States, v. Harper, </em>246 F.3d 520, 526-27 (6th Cir.2001) (holding that the district court properly evaluated only defendants\u2019 post-indictment conduct for purposes of determining the applicability of a \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment); <em>United States v. Tilford, </em>224 F.3d 865, 868 (6th Cir.2000) (concluding that only a defendant\u2019s post-plea conduct could properly be considered in making this determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">At oral argument, Patton contended, and the Government conceded, that the district court in refusing Patton\u2019s request for an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, improperly considered conduct that occurred before Patton was aware that he was the subject of a federal investigation. In light of the Government\u2019s concession, we are persuaded that we should vacate Patton\u2019s sentence and remand this case for resentencing in light of our holdings in <em>Jeter, Tilford, </em>and <em>Harper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">B. Abduction Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Triggs argued before the district court, as he does now, that the district court erred by applying a four-level enhancement for his co-defendant\u2019s abduction of a bank customer during the course of the robbery, because he neither \u201caided or encouraged\u201d such behavior nor, as the getaway driver, was even aware of his co-defendant\u2019s abduction of the bank customer until after he had released her. The district court rejected Triggs\u2019s argument and concluded that the customer\u2019s abduction was foreseeable given the nature of the criminal activity that the Defendants had agreed to undertake. <em>See </em>J.A. at 110 (\u201c[The kidnapping of the hostage] was simply a natural extension of what would be anticipated under the circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">We agree. Section 1B1.3 of the Guidelines provides that \u201cin the case of jointly undertaken criminal activity,\u201d a defendant may be held criminally accountable for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d Application Note 2(b)(1), upon which the district court relied in determining that an abduction enhancement was appropriate, is illustrative of what activity warrants such an enhancement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken under subsection (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of taking the money (the taking of money was the specific objective of the offense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the injury to the teller under (a)(1)(B) because the assault on the teller was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. 2(b)(1). Similarly, we recognize that while Triggs may not have intended for his co-defendants to take a hostage, he is nevertheless criminally accountable for the abduction, because it was in furtherance of the criminal conspiracy (to provide protection in the event the gunmen were approached by police) and was reasonably foreseeable given the inherently violent nature of an armed robbery offense. The district court\u2019s enhancement, therefore, was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">C. Consecutive Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">At the time that Triggs committed the instant offense, he was under state supervision for a 1994 aggravated robbery conviction for which he served forty months before his 1997 parole. Triggs\u2019s parole was scheduled to expire on December 11, 2002, but it was revoked on February 19, 1999, slightly more than a month after he was arrested for the instant offense. Although unclear from the record, it appears that it was revoked for his January 15, 1999, arrest for the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Triggs suggests that he violated the terms of his probation <em>prior to </em>his commission of the instant offense, and that the district court disregarded U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) by refusing to order his federal sentence to run concurrent with his remaining state time. The crux of his argument seems to be that because he had already violated the terms of his state probation at the time that he robbed the bank, he had already had his probation revoked, and thus was not within the purview of \u00a7 5G1.3(a), which requires that the defendant have committed a new offense while serving a term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dispositive issue before us then is whether Triggs\u2019s case is governed by \u00a7 5G1.3(a), as the Government asserts and as the district court found, or by \u00a7 5G1.3(c), as Triggs suggests. We review a district court\u2019s decision to impose a concurrent or a consecutive sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Covert, </em>117 F.3d 940, 945 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">A close examination of \u00a7 5G1.3\u2019s application notes suggests that the Government has the better of the argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, cmt. 6. It is undisputed that Triggs committed the instant offense on January 15, 1999, and that he was on state probation until February 19, 1999. Thus, his argument that he violated the terms of his state probation <em>before </em>he was arrested for the offenses at issue in this case is simply unsupported by the record. His case therefore is squarely governed by \u00a7 5G1.3(a). Accordingly, the district court properly ordered his federal sentence to run consecutive to his state probation violation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>D. Minor Participant</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Triggs submits that the district court erred by refusing his request for a minor-participant sentencing reduction. He contends that he was entitled to such a reduction because he was not made aware of his co-defendants\u2019 plans to rob the bank until the day of the offense, and because he \u201cwas not in the bank, did not have contact with the hostage involved, didn\u2019t have any money coming away from the bank, [and] didn\u2019t have a weapon on his person.\u201d In dismissing Triggs\u2019s argument, the district court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">[T]he problem [with Triggs\u2019s argument] is that a get-away driver in a bank robbery is essential to the commission of the offense. You have got to have some mechanism for getting away or you\u2019re going to be a pretty unsuccessful bank robber. They were unsuccessful in any event, but this was an essential aspect of the offense and, of course, the probation officer pointed that out, and you\u2019re right, it is a \u2014 it is a situation that comes up often, and we\u2019re urged to say that a person is a minor participant or a person is a minimal participant, and my response on a lot of those has been there are a lot of people who are just participants, they\u2019re right there in the middle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2S\">Triggs now urges us to reject the district court\u2019s finding that the conspiracy would not have been consummated if there had been no driver of the getaway car and its consequent conclusion that Triggs could not have been a minor participant in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3B1.2 minor participant reduction. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>56 F.3d 719, 720 (6th Cir.1995). A defendant seeking the benefit of such a reduction must prove by a preponderance of the evidence mitigating factors justifying a reduction for being a minor participant in the criminal activity. <em>See id. </em>at 721. Only if the sentencing court concludes that the defendant was \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant in the criminal enterprise\u201d is a minor-participant reduction appropriate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">On the facts of this case, it is clear that the district court committed no error, as Triggs has failed to demonstrate that he was substantially less culpable than his co-defendants. While it may be true that Triggs learned of the planned criminal activity only a few hours before the robbery, he nevertheless participated as the getaway driver and provided an essential part of the conspiracy, i.e., a ready means of escape for his co-defendants who actually robbed the bank. <em>Cf. United States v. Lowery, </em>60 F.3d 1199, 1202 (6th Cir.1995) (finding that a minor-participant reduction was unavailable for a getaway driver who failed to participate in the actual robbery of a bank, but nevertheless actively participated in the development of the criminal scheme).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the sentence of the district court as to Martilus Patton and REMAND his case for resentencing; and AFFIRM the judgment of the district court on all issues as to Courtney Triggs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\">. Triggs argues in the alternative that parole is not a \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d covered by the language of \u00a7 5G1.3(a), as evidenced by the Guidelines\u2019 drafters intentional omission of any reference to parole in the language of the subsection; this omission suggests that the drafters did not contemplate that parole violations would be included among those violations for which a new offense would trigger the imposition of a consecutive sentence. This argument, however, is foreclosed by the plain language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, cmt. 6, discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
