Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-17\">Siegel challenges his conviction for being a felon in possession of firearms on the ground that the evidence was insufficient. To prove a violation of \u00a7 922(g), the Government had to show that Siegel voluntarily and intentionally possessed the firearms. <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 136 (4th Cir.2001) (discussing elements of the offense).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the evidence was sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 136-37 (providing that possession may be actual, constructive, or joint); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc) (providing standard for determining sufficiency of evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-18\">As for Siegel\u2019s claim that the district court should have awarded a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Siegel required the Government to prove at trial that he possessed the firearms \u2014 an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>relating to factual guilt. <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>114 F.3d 464, 470 (4th Cir.1997) (citing USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.2)). Thus, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the adjustment was not warranted. <em>United States v. Note, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1004-05 (4th Cir. 1995) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-12\">. Siegel also pled guilty, without the benefit of a written plea agreement, to possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (West 1999). He does not challenge this conviction or the concurrent fifty-seven-month sentence he received on that count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-19\">. The Government also must prove that Siegel was previously convicted of a felony and that the firearm had traveled in or affected interstate commerce. <em>Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d at 136. Siegel does not challenge these elements of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
