Upon review of the briefs on appeal and the record before the court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">The district court properly grants a \u00a7 4245 motion if the government proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the inmate currently suffers from a mental disease or defect requiring \u201ccustody for care or treatment in a suitable facility.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>45 F.3d 837, 840 (4th Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s determination of this issue is one of fact, which is reviewed by the appellate court under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>See United States v. Steil, </em>916 F.2d 485, 487 (8th Cir.1990). A finding is clearly erroneous when \u201cthe reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Faulconer v. Commissioner, </em>748 F.2d 890, 895 (4th Cir. 1984). At the hearing on the government\u2019s motion to determine Akere\u2019s present mental condition, the magistrate judge considered Akere\u2019s own testimony, two psychiatric evaluations, and the testimony of Dr. Bruce Berger, a psychiatrist from FCI-Butner.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">In light of the fact that both psychiatric evaluations concluded that Akere was suffering from a mental disease or defect requiring custody for care or treatment in a suitable facility and Akere presented no evidence to the contrary other than his own self-serving assertions, we have no difficulty in concluding that the district court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous. In addition, contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>counsel\u2019s assertion, we find no support in the statute or in this court\u2019s precedent<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for the proposition that the district court erred in committing Akere without a finding of dangerousness. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-18\"> We find that a fair reading of the language in <em>United States </em>v.. <em>Muhammad, </em>165 F.3d 327, 334 (5th Cir.1999), upon which Akere relies for this proposition, suggests that the Fifth Circuit was paraphrasing the Appellant\u2019s argument rather than imposing an additional requirement of a finding of dangerousness. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
