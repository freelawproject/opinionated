Pursuant to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), and we therefore have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), as amended by IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c), <em>see Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1195 n. 4 (9th Cir.2000). We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Karunaratna contends that substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">An adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence where the BIA provides specific, cogent reasons for its adverse credibility finding that are substantial and bear a legitimate nexus to the petitioner\u2019s fear of persecution. <em>See Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1013 (9th Cir.1998). The BIA relied on substantial inconsistencies in Karunaratna\u2019s testimony regarding events purportedly causing his fear of persecution: threatening letters, an arrest, and the murder of his brother. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the denial of his application for asylum, <em>see Lata, </em>204 F.3d at 1245-46, and denial of his application for withholding of deportation, <em>see Aruta v. INS, </em>80 F.3d 1389, 1396 (9th Cir.1996) (higher standard for withholding of deportation cannot be satisfied by petitioner who fails to demonstrate eligibility for asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b951-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
