Rakoff, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b108-15\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b108-16\">This is an appeal by defendants Luis Alberto Vega, Maria Marilu Lara-Nausa, Max Olaya-Rodriguez and Julio Cesar Casas from judgments of conviction upon their pleas of guilty to conspiracy to distribute heroin, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. We reject their claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-17\">Vega\u2019s claim that his allocution failed to furnish adequate basis under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f) for the judge to accept the plea has no merit. Vega stated that he understood the charges, that he engaged with other persons to make deliveries of heroin and prepare the proceeds of sales for shipment to Colombia and that he engaged in a narcotics conspiracy. The allocution showed there was \u201ca factual basis for the plea.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-18\">Vega and Casas claim their sentences violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). There is no basis for the claim. Vega\u2019s sentence was below the statutory maximum of 20 years provided by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Casas\u2019s sentence \u2014 above the maximum provided by \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) \u2014 was justified because the indictment charged a conspiracy involving more than one kilogram of heroin and in his plea allocution he admitted that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-19\">There is no merit to defendant Lara-Nausa\u2019s claim that the sentencing court abused its discretion in failing to consider her psychologically dependent mental state in reaching the conclusion that she played the role of manager or supervisor, which resulted in the addition of three levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Judge Schwartz explicitly found that the abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband had no effect on her participation in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We reject also Olaya-Rodriguez\u2019s contentions that the evidence (a) did not support a finding of his awareness of 80 kilos, and (b) required a minor role adjustment. There is no merit to these contentions. The information furnished by Olaya in his safety valve proffer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(5), together with other information available to the sentencing judge, showed Olaya\u2019s awareness of, and significant participation in, a vast and complex conspiracy involving numerous participants and large amounts of drugs. The commentary to the guidelines explicitly provides that the information provided by a defendant in his safety valve proffer \u201cmay be considered in determining the applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, app\u2019n note 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We have considered the defendants\u2019 other contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be, and it hereby is, AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
