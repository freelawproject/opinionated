Williams appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his civil complaint in which he alleged racial discrimination claims. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>See Williams v. School of Prof l Studies in Bus. and Educ. John Hopkins Univ., </em>No. CA-01-842-CCB (D. Md. filed Mar. 22, 2001; entered Mar. 23, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b267-18\"> In regard to Williams\u2019 claims concerning his March 2000 application, we generally do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal, except under narrow circumstances not present here. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir. 1993) (holding that issues raised for the first time on appeal generally will not be considered absent plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justice).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
