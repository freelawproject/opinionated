Weaver\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In 1996, Plaintiff filed an action in the district court on behalf of a putative class of owners and lessees of certain minivans manufactured by Chrysler Corporation, alleging various state law claims. In a memorandum and order dated March 27, 1997, the court granted Chrysler\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Amended Complaint. <em>Weaver v. Chrysler Corp., </em>172 F.R.D. 96 (S.D.N.Y.1997). The following December, Chrysler moved for sanctions against Plaintiffs counsel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, for filing a frivolous class action. Plaintiffs counsel opposed the motion, and cross-moved for sanctions. In a memorandum and order dated August 14, 1998, the court denied Chrysler\u2019s motion and granted Plaintiffs cross-motion. <em>Weaver v. Chrysler Corp., </em>No. 96 Civ. 2245(DAB), 1998 WL 477725, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to impose sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>Revson v. Cinque &amp; Cinque, P.C., </em>221 F.3d 71, 78 (2d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., </em>115 F.3d 143, 154 (2d Cir. 1997)). To impose sanctions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, \u201cthe trial court must find clear evidence that (1) the offending party\u2019s claims were entirely meritless and (2) the party acted for improper purposes.\u201d <em>Revson, </em>221 F.3d at 79 (quoting <em>Agee v. Paramount Communications Inc., </em>114 F.3d 395, 398 (2d Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The district court did not reach the question of whether Chrysler\u2019s motion was \u201centirely meritless.\u201d Nor did it discuss in sufficient detail its reasons for concluding that Chrysler\u2019s motion was made \u201cfor improper purposes.\u201d We therefore retain jurisdiction over this appeal while vacating the order and remanding to the district court for additional findings and reasoning as appropriate, in accordance with this order. <em>See United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 21-22 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
