INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2001). We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find no abuse of discretion in its refusal to grant the motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s denial of relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
