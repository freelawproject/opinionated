(\u201cMNSB\u201d), in Marik\u2019s quiet title action removed from state court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also moves for judicial notice of certain court orders in a prior related action.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we agree with the district court that Marik\u2019s claims are subject to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d), a provision of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery <em>&amp; </em>Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), which provides mandatory administrative remedies against subject failed financial institutions and bars courts from considering unexhausted claims. Marik\u2019s suit is grounded in the pre-receivership conduct of Metro North State Bank, a failed financial institution- within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D) (ii), for which FDIC was appointed receiver. It is undisputed that Marik did not exhaust his administrative remedies. We agree with the district court, therefore, that dismissal of FDIC without prejudice was required. <em>See Resolution Trust Corp. Mortgage Trust 1994-N2 v. Haith, </em>133 F.3d 574, 578-80 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing defendant MNSB: after this lawsuit was filed, MNSB assigned to FDIC all of MNSB\u2019s interests in the property that is the subject of this suit. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(c). We clarify that MNSB\u2019s dismissal also is without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-17\">Accordingly, we grant Marik\u2019s motion on appeal, but we affirm the district court\u2019s orders and judgment. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-18\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-13\">. The Honorable Nanette K.
