Because the district court\u2019s dismissal was without prejudice, it is not appealable. <em>Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066 (4th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. If he chooses, Rhodes may refile his complaint in district court, being careful to be sufficiently particular in the details of his claim to satisfy the district court\u2019s prior order. We also deny Rhodes\u2019 motion for the appointment of counsel. <em>See Whisenant v. Yuam, </em>739 F.2d 160,163 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately addressed in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
