Arcara, <em>Judge </em>) granting defendant-appellee, Bryant &amp; Stratton Business Institute, Inc. (\u201cB &amp; S\u201d), summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-23\">Plaintiffs-appellants filed a complaint in district court seeking relief under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq., the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\u201cFMLA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601, et seq., and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>New York Executive Law \u00a7 296 (\u201cN.Y. Human Rights Law\u201d or \u201cNYHRL\u201d) as a result of B &amp; S\u2019s decision to fire John Asztalos (\u201cAsztalos\u201d). Asztalos alleged that his rights under the ADA and NYHRL were violated when he was fired and by the manner in which B &amp; S addressed his sick pay, severance, and long term disability insurance after he was terminated. Pamela Asztalos raised a loss of consortium claim based on the ADA and NYHRL claims of her husband. Finally, Asztalos alleged that his rights under the FMLA were violated because B &amp; S did not grant him leave under the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Carol Heckman pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) on March 2, 1998. On March 3, 1999, B &amp; S filed a motion for summary judgment. On September 15, 1999, Magistrate Judge Heckman filed a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R\u201d), recommending that B &amp; S\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs filed objections to the R &amp; R, defendants filed a response thereto, and oral arguments on the objections were heard by Judge Arcara. On August 11, 2000, Judge Arcara issued an opinion in which he (1) conducted a de novo review of those portions of the R &amp; R to which objections had been filed, (2) granted summary judgment as to those portions of the R <em>&amp; </em>R to which objections had been filed and (3) accepted Magistrate Judge Heckman\u2019s recommendation for summary judgment as to those portions of the R &amp; R to which objections had not been filed. This Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">As for all of appellants\u2019 arguments, except for their ADA claims, we affirm for substantially the same reasons as stated in the district court opinion. <em>See Asztalos et al. v. Bryant and Stratton Business Institute, Inc., </em>No. 98-CV-74A (W.D.N.Y. August 11, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 ADA claim, this Court has held that \u201c \u2018the plaintiff bears the burden of proving ... that an accommodation exists that permits her to perform the job\u2019s essential functions.\u2019\u201d <em>Jackan v. New York State Dept, of Labor, </em>205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Borhowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>63 F.3d 131, 137-38 (2d Cir.1995)). An ADA \u201cclaim fails unless the plaintiff establishes that an effective accommodation exist[ed] that would render [him] otherwise qualified. The burden of persuasion on the existence of an effective accommodation is not satisfied by mere speculation.\u201d Jackan, 205 F.3d at 566. Because plaintiffs did not meet their burden of establishing that a reasonable accommodation exists that would render Mr. Asztalos capable of performing the essential functions of his job, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 ADA claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-5\">. Although Magistrate Judge Heckman recommended denial of summary judgment on the issue of whether Asztalos was a \"qualified individual with a disability\u201d under the ADA, she found, as a matter of law, that plaintiffs\u2019 communications with B &amp; S were not requests for reasonable accommodations and that B &amp; S had legitimate reasons for discharging Asztalos. Magistrate Judge Heck-man also recommended dismissal of plaintiffs' FMLA and derivative claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
