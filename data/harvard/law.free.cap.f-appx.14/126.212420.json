Garvan Murtha, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Vermont, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b155-16\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-18\">Donatien Lake appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (Kahn, J.) denying his motion for habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Lake challenges his state conviction for second degree murder on the ground that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-19\">Lake and his co-defendant Michael Counts attacked a man in the street. Counts stabbed the victim to death. Lake was charged as an accessory and was convicted by a jury of second degree murder on the basis of \u201cdepraved indifference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-20\">Lake cites his counsel\u2019s a) rejection of the court\u2019s offer to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses, and b) failure to seek severance. Lake also brings to this Court\u2019s attention the inexperience of his trial counsel, who had only recently been admitted to the bar and had never tried a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-21\">\u201cIn order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must first show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and must then show that the deficiency caused actual prejudice to his defense.\u201d <em>Clark v. Stinson, </em>214 F.3d 315, 321 (2d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). The petitioner must overcome the \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s con-duct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>466 U.S. at 689. Moreover, \u201cerror[s] by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, [do] not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding\u201d unless the defendant can also show \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 694. We review a district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief <em>de novo. See Smalls v. Batista, </em>191 F.3d 272, 277 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">a) A decision to forgo a charge on lesser included offenses is strategic in nature. <em>See, e.g., Vasquez v. United States, </em>96 Civ. 2104, 1997 WL 148812 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. March 28, 1997). Strategic choices made after reasonable investigation \u201cwill seldom if ever be found wanting,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 681, because we are reluctant to \u201csecond-guess matters of trial strategy simply because the chosen strategy has failed,\u201d <em>United States v. Helgesen, </em>669 F.2d 69, 72 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The trial court offered a charge on lesser included offenses, expressly confirmed that defense counsel had fully discussed the matter with Lake, and- then questioned Lake directly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\"><em>Court: </em>You have no question about the decision you\u2019re making in conjunction with his legal advice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\"><em>Lake: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\"><em>Court: </em>In essence you are rolling the dice. That\u2019s really the words out of your attorney\u2019s mouth. I mean, it\u2019s either murder or nothing, right, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeking to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\"><em>Lake: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">After a review of the record, we conclude that this decision, though ultimately unsuccessful, was not so foolhardy as to raise a question of constitutional ineffectiveness under <em>Strickland. </em>Nor can we find sufficient evidence to indicate that, as Lake contends on appeal, defense counsel labored under a misunderstanding of the principles governing a decision to accept or decline a lesser included offenses charge. Disquieting though it is that local court procedures evidently allow the assignment of a novice lawyer to defend a murder case as his first experience, that suggestive circumstance is not a ground for habeas relief. <em>See United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 665, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">b) We likewise find that the decision to forgo a severance motion did not render Lake\u2019s counsel constitutionally ineffective. This strategic choice appears to have been animated by the idea that Lake might appear a relative innocent next to Counts, the knife-wielder. (Indeed, Lake\u2019s counsel attacked Counts so aggressively that <em>Counts\u2019s </em>lawyer repeatedly moved to sever.) <em>See Amaker v. Lacy, </em>941 F.Supp. 1340, 1349-50 (E.D.N.Y.1996) (finding no ineffectiveness where decision to forgo a severance motion \u201cserved a legitimate trial strategy by retaining defendant\u2019s trial with that of the co-defendants who appeared to be the more culpable actors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
