Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount it here except as necessary to explain our disposition. We have jurisdiction under \u00a7 106 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), as amended, and we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners neither endured past persecution nor have the requisite fear of future persecution on account of their political opinion. Their own testimony before the Immigration Judge concedes that they had no independent knowledge of the alleged acts of persecution suffered by their parents while living in the Philippines, the identities of the persecutors, or with what group they were affiliated. Accordingly, petitioners did not establish that they had been persecuted. <em>See Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 889 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The evidence presented is not so persuasive that a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to find that petitioners would be persecuted because of their political views if returned to the Philippines. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Joseph admitted that the group he asserted persecuted his parents, the New People\u2019s Army, was not looking for him. Instead, he testified that in light of his father\u2019s activities, he would fear returning because \u201cyou can\u2019t really be too safe.\u201d This testimony and the lack of testimony to the contrary is substantial evidence that petitioners\u2019 subjective fear of returning to the Philippines is not genuine or objectively reasonable. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Because petitioners failed to establish eligibility for asylum, they necessarily cannot satisfy the higher standard of proof necessary for withholding of deportation. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b999-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
