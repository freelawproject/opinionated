ARNOLD, and BEAM, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b746-23\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b746-24\">After Miguel Guerrero-Villasenor pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States illegally after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 30 months imprisonment and 2 years supervised release. By that time, Guerrero-Villasenor had already begun serving a 55-year Iowa state sentence for unrelated convictions. To be sure that Guerrero-Villasenor would serve a total sentence of at least 10 years, the court made the federal sentence commence when he was paroled, or upon a fixed date, whichever occurred first.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-25\">In a brief submitted pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel challenges the structure of this sentence. We find no abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Cotroneo, </em>89 F.3d 510, 512-13 (8th Cir.) (standard of review), <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 1018, 117 S.Ct. 533, 136 L.Ed.2d 419 (1996), because this sentence structure is expressly authorized, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, comment, (n.4). In a pro se supplemental filing, Guerrero-Villasenor challenges the district court\u2019s authority to consider his state parole date in fashioning his federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>sentence. This argument also lacks merit. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">We have located no non-frivolous issues for appeal after reviewing the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny GuerreroVillasenor\u2019s request for substitute counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-18\">.
