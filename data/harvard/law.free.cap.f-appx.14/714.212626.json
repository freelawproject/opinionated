The Honorable Richard G. Kopf, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b744-4\">[UNPUBLISHED]</p>\n<author id=\"b744-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">This appeal consolidates two securities fraud actions alleging that the defendants, Digi International, Inc. and three of its former officers, artificially and fraudulently inflated Digi\u2019s earnings during a portion of fiscal year 1996 by improperly accounting for Digi\u2019s investments in AetherWorks Corporation, by running an alleged \u201cnew sales program\u201d which allegedly impacted the timing of product returns by Digi\u2019s customers and by other alleged accounting errors. Two orders of the district court are appealed. We affirm them both.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">One of the suits is brought on behalf of a putative class (the Class Plaintiffs). The other is brought by a pension fund, the Louisiana State Employees Retirement System (LASERS). The Class Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Amended Complaint alleges claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78t(a), on behalf of a purported class consisting of all persons who purchased Digi\u2019s stock in the market between January 25 and December 23, 1996 (the Fraud Period). LASERS\u2019 Amended Complaint made similar factual allegations, pleaded similar claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and pleaded additional claims for violation of Section 18(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78r(a), for common law fraud, and for negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">Defendants moved to dismiss both complaints for failure to plead fraud with particularity pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On May 22, 1998, the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted the motion to dismiss as to all claims brought in both cases except the fraud claims asserted under sections 10(b) and 20(a) against defendants Digi, Kamm, and Wall with respect to Digi\u2019s alleged improper accounting for its investments in AetherWorks. (This is the Digi I decision.) Among the claims dismissed in Digi I were claims with respect to the alleged \u201cnew sales program\u201d and LASERS\u2019 claims for shares it sold during the Fraud Period while the stock price was allegedly inflated. The dismissals of these two claims are before us on the Digi I appeal. After the close of discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment on the securities fraud claims relating to the accounting for Digi\u2019s investments in AetherWorks. The district court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> granted the motion and entered final judgment on August 17, 2000. In the memorandum and order granting summary judgment (the Digi II decision), the district court also referred Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions against LASERS to the Magistrate Judge. The grant of summary judgment in Digi II is before us on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>the portions of Digi I before us on appeal. <em>Young v. City of St. Charles, </em>244 F.3d 623, 627 (8th Cir.2001). We have carefully considered the arguments raised on appeal and find them without merit, for the reasons articulated in the well-reasoned opinion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We also review <em>de novo </em>the grant of summary judgment in Digi II. <em>Gentry v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., </em>250 F.3d 646, 649 (8th Cir.2001). The district court granted summary judgment after finding that the issue of how to properly account for the AetherWorks investments was subject to differing opinions. Thus, the district court reasoned that no reasonable jury could find that Defendants acted with scienter since reasonable people could disagree about how the investments should have been treated for accounting purposes. For the reasons articulated in the well-reasoned opinion of the district court in Digi II, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to Defendants. In doing so, we pause only to make a brief observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Scienter is \u201ca mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\u201d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 194 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). Severe recklessness can be sufficient to meet the scienter requirement, <em>K &amp; S Partnership v. Continental Bank, N .A., </em>952 F.2d 971, 978 (8th Cir.1991), but it is limited to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AML\">\u201c \u2018those highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations that involve not merely simple or even inexcusable negligence, but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, and that present a danger of misleading buyers or sellers which is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-8\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Woods <em>v. Barnett Bank of Fort Lauderdale, </em>765 F.2d 1004, 1010 (11th Cir.1985) (in turn quoting <em>Broad v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>642 F.2d 929, 961-62 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert, denied, </em>454 U.S. 965, 102 S.Ct. 506, 70 L.Ed.2d 380 (1981)). The evidence in this case was not sufficient to go to the jury on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">We have carefully considered the arguments raised on appeal, in particular the question of whether the manner in which Digi made its decision regarding the proper accounting treatment for the Aether-Works investments establishes scienter or negates scienter. In this regard, we have carefully examined the evidence regarding the actions of Digi\u2019s independent accountants, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and Digi\u2019s outside legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">We fully agree with the district court that Coopers &amp; Lybrand\u2019s changing posture about how to account for the AetherWorks investments, coupled with the opinions of outside legal counsel rendered to Digi during the pertinent time frame, establishes that no reasonable jury could find the necessary element of scienter even if the accounting treatment was improper. As the district court correctly noted, \u201c[t]he undisputable fact that the Defendants were in consultations with their outside accountants and legal counsel during the period in question is in itself evidence which tends to negate a finding of scienter. <em>See S.E.C. v. Caserta, </em>75 F.Supp.2d 79, 94-95 (E.D.N.Y.1999)....\u201d <em>(In re: Digi International Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>No. 97-5, slip <em>op. </em>at 15 n. 7 (D.Minn. August 17, 2000), found in LASERS\u2019 App. at 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>In summary, the dismissal and summary judgment decisions were correct.

LASERS attempted to appeal that portion of Digi II referring Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge to whom the motion was referred has not issued a decision, so the order of referral is not a final, appealable order and is not properly before us on appeal. <em>See Lee v. L.B.
