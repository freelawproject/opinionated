Specifically, Leguizamo argues that the enhancement was inappropriate because the state of Kentucky placed him on conditional discharge less than ten days after sentencing, and therefore he did not receive a term of imprisonment of at least one year for his prior conviction as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-25\">On November 14, 1995, Leguizamo was convicted in a Kentucky state court of two counts of Possession of a Forged Instrument in the Second Degree, and on April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>19, 1996, he was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment. On April 24, 1996, the state court ordered that Leguizamo\u2019s sentence be conditionally discharged, effective upon his being taken into the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. After being deported in 1996, Leguizamo was found in Arizona on April 19, 2000 and pled guilty to illegal re-entry after deportation on May 26, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The district court determined that Leguizamo was an alien \u201cwhose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), because he had been convicted of \u201can offense relating to .. .forgery ... for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R). The district court concluded that Leguizamo\u2019s eighteen month sentence and subsequent conditional discharge qualified as a \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B). (\u201cAny reference to a term of imprisonment or a sentence with respect to an offense is deemed to include the period of incarceration or confinement ordered by the court regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that imprisonment or sentence in whole or in part.\u201d). It then applied a sixteen level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Leguizamo argues that the conditional discharge vacated and replaced the original eighteen-month sentence, and therefore, he did not fall under the purview of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Leguizamo\u2019s argument, however, must fail. The commentary to Kentucky statute 533.020, which defines when conditional discharge is appropriate, states that the \u201cconcept of conditional discharge ... merely codifies prior practice and serves to supplant the well-known judicial tool entitled \u2018suspended sentence.\u2019\u201d Thus, under Kentucky law, Leguizamo\u2019s conditional discharge merely suspended his eighteen month sentence. Because Leguizamo was sentenced by the Kentucky court to more than one year imprisonment, his sentence constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R). We therefore hold that the district court did not err in applying a sixteen level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b975-26\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
