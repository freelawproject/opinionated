Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b818-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(c), and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny Garibay\u2019s petition for habeas corpus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Similarly, dismissal based on state procedural default presents issues of law reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Review of a state court\u2019s findings of fact is deferential, however. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, state court findings of fact are presumed to be correct, and the petitioner must rebut them with clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Only two issues were certified for appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-8\">1. Whether the failure of petitioner\u2019s trial counsel to make the proper objection under California law to the evidence of a prosecution witness\u2019s willingness to take a lie detector test constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">2. Whether petitioner made the requisite showing to overcome the state procedural bar to consideration on the merits of his due process and prosecutorial misconduct claims relating to the evidence of the prosecution witness\u2019s willingness to take a lie detector test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">As for the first issue, we conclude that the district court was correct when it determined that Garibay had not demonstrated prejudice from his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object adequately to the evidence of the willingness of a witness to take a lie detector test. Although counsel\u2019s failure to object was error, it did not prejudice Garibay in light of the weakness of the evidence itself and the overwhelming evidence against him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-17\">The district court was also correct when it determined that the claims composing the second part of this appeal were procedurally defaulted. Trial counsel did not, as California law requires, make a contemporaneous objection to the issues advanced on review,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the state courts rejected Garibay\u2019s claims on the ground that they were procedurally defaulted. We may review a procedurally defaulted issue if the petitioner demonstrates \u201ccause;\u201d however, attorney error falling short of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute \u201ccause.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b818-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-12\">. <em>Bribiesca v.
