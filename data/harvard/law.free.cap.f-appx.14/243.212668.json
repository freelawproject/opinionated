We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. Jones has waived review of the claims he raised in the district court by this failure to address those claims in his informal brief. 4th Cir. R. 34(b). We decline to review the claims he has raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir .1993). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
