Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the district court that Harris\u2019s disclosure of Tart\u2019s drug test results to a third party did not arise to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>See Eagle v. Morgan, </em>88 F.3d 620, 625 (8th Cir.1996) (setting forth standard for determining whether disclosure of \u201cprivate\u201d information constitutes constitutional violation). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-16\">.
