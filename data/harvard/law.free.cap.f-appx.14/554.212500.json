Petitioner Jordan has moved for a stay pending appeal. A number of cases similar to this case were held in abeyance pending a decision in the Supreme Court\u2019s case of <em>Lopez v. Davis, </em>No. 99-7504, and this court\u2019s case of <em>Powell v. Thoms, </em>No. 99-5974. These cases have now been decided. <em>See Lopez v. Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 121 S.Ct. 714, 718, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001); <em>Powell v. Thoms, </em>No. 99-5974 (6th Cir. April 5, 2001) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">Upon consideration, we conclude that the district court is in a better position to resolve the impact of the <em>Lopez </em>decision upon this case than we are. <em>See Hardy v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>246 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam). Therefore, it is sua sponte ordered that the judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Lopez. </em>The motion for a stay is denied without prejudice to its renewal before the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
