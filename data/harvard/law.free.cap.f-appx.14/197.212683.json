Strable appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.2000) complaint. Strable\u2019s case was referred to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (1994). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Strable that failure to file timely and specific objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Strable failed to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The timely filing of objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b); <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-47 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 155, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Failure to file specific and written objections shall constitute a waiver of a party\u2019s appellate review if the recommendation is accepted by a district judge. <em>United States v. Schronce, </em>727 F.2d 91, 94 <em>&amp; </em>n.4 (4th Cir.1985); <em>Wright, </em>766 F.2d at 845-47 &amp; nn. 1-3. Strable has waived appellate review by failing to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
