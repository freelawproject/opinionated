Korman, <em>Chief Judge), </em>convicting him, following a jury trial, of one count of importation of cocaine, and one count of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 841, respectively. Lathens was sentenced to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by four years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, Lathens contends that his due process rights were violated when (1) the district court committed prejudicial error in charging the jury as to his credibility; and (2) the prosecutor appealed to racial bias in closing argument. Having carefully considered these arguments, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Lathens was apprehended by the United States Customs Service at John F. Kennedy International Airport upon arrival on a flight from Haiti, after a routine check at Customs revealed that Lathens was wearing sandals filled with cocaine, and carrying a pair of women\u2019s sandals also filled with cocaine. Although Lathens conversed with the Customs inspectors in English at the airport, Detective Carmelo Maldonado testified that he enlisted the aid of Senior Customs Inspector Catrina Essen, who was fluent in French. Maldonado and Essen testified that Lathens admitted during this interview that he knew he was carrying drugs. At trial, Lathens testified in his own defense that he was unaware that the sandals in his possession were filled with cocaine, but that he did not remember whether Maldonado and Essen had asked him any questions after they read him his rights. Thus, Lathens characterizes the trial as a credibility contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Lathens contends that the district court called unwarranted attention to the defendant\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case, while portraying Customs officers as neutral. We disagree, and find that the district court included appropriate balancing language in the instruction. <em>See United States v. Gleason, </em>616 F.2d 2, 15-16 (2d Cir.1979). We review jury instructions in the context of the charge as a whole. <em>See United States v. Bonito, </em>57 F.3d 167, 173 (2d Cir.1995). Over a defense objection, the district court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">Now, in a criminal case, the defendant cannot be required to testify, but if he chose to do so, he is of course, permitted to take the witness stand on his own behalf. In this case, the defendant decided to testify. You should examine and evaluate his testimony as you would the testimony of any witness with an interest in the outcome of the case. You should not disregard or disbelieve his testimony simply because he\u2019s charged as a defendant in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\u2018Where the court points out that testimony of certain types of witnesses may be suspect and should therefore be scrutinized and weighed with care ... it must also direct the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that it may well find these witnesses to be truthful, in whole or in part.\u201d <em>Gleason, </em>616 F.2d at 15; <em>United States v. Matias, </em>836 F.2d 744, 750 (2d Cir.1988). The last sentence of the district court\u2019s instruction appropriately informed the jury that it could believe the defendant\u2019s testimony over conflicting accounts given by other witnesses. The charge as a whole made clear that the jury was not to give greater weight in its credibility assessment to the testimony of law enforcement officers: \u201cYou should not presume that a law enforcement officer is any more or less credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ble or that his or her testimony is entitled to any more or less weight than others who may testify.\u201d We find no error in the jury instruction on credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Lathens also contends that he was denied a fair trial because the prosecutor, in summation, asked the jurors to consider whom they would choose \u2014 Lathens or Detective Maldonado \u2014 to approach on a street corner to ask for directions if they were lost. Lathens characterizes this hypothetical as \u201cflagrant abuse\u201d requiring reversal of his conviction, notwithstanding his lack of objection, because the prosecutor was appealing to race and class bias. We review for plain error. <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1,14-15,105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). However, in light of the fact that the record is devoid of any reference \u2014 explicit or otherwise \u2014 to the defendant\u2019s or the Detective\u2019s racial background, we cannot conclude that an error occurred. <em>See United States v. Weiss, </em>930 F.2d 185, 196 (2d Cir.1991). Even if we were to assume that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was improper, when considered against the proof offered by the prosecution at trial, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We have considered appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
