UNUM Life Insurance Co. of America, </em>223 F.3d 130 (2d Cir.2000) <em>(\u201cJones I </em>\u201d), for explanations by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Kevin Thomas Duffy, <em>Judge, </em>of its reasons for denying attorney\u2019s fees and a higher rate of prejudgment interest to plaintiff Linda B. Jones in connection with her successful claim against defendant UNUM Life Insurance Company of America (\u201cUNUM\u201d) under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cERISA\u201d). Finding the court\u2019s explanations sufficient to show that there has been no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">On remand, in an Order dated February 26, 2001 (\u201cOrder\u201d), the district court explained that it denied Jones\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees for essentially two reasons. First, noting the standard set out in <em>Chambless v. Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots Pension Plan, </em>815 F.2d 869, 871 (2d Cir. 1987), <em>cert, denied, </em>496 U.S. 905, 110 S.Ct. 2587, 110 L.Ed.2d 268 (1990), the court stated that two of the five <em>Chambless </em>factors were most relevant here, to wit, \u201cthe degree of the offending party\u2019s culpability or bad faith and the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.\u201d Order at 1. The court stated that \u201cthis was an extraordinarily close case,\u201d <em>id., </em>and implicitly found that UNUM had not conducted itself in bad faith. The second reason stated by the court was that, because it had remanded an additional claim by Jones to UNUM, as required by ERISA, <em>see Jones I, </em>223 F.3d at 140 (\u201cthere is a firmly established federal policy favoring exhaustion of administrative remedies in ERISA cases\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), the court viewed any award of fees to Jones as \u201cpremature,\u201d Order at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">As discussed in <em>Jones I, </em>a district court\u2019s decision to award or deny attorney\u2019s fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>223 F.3d at 138; <em>New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund v. Boening Brothers, Inc., </em>92 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir.1996). In the present case, given the court\u2019s explanations on remand, we see no basis in the record for overturning the court\u2019s weighing of the <em>Chambless </em>factors, and no abuse of discretion in the decision that the lack of bad faith on the part of UNUM and the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions militated against an award of fees. Further, the district court\u2019s reasoning that such an award would be \u201cpremature\u201d indicates that the possibility remains open that Jones may ultimately be awarded attorney\u2019s fees following the conclusion of the administrative proceedings and any judicial review of the administrative decision on her additional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>With respect to prejudgment interest, which the district court awarded to Jones at the rate set out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, <em>Jones I </em>stated that \u201c[o]n remand, the court should briefly explain its reason\u201d for adopting that rate or any higher rate. 223 F.3d at 140. In its Order, the court adhered to the rate set out in \u00a7 1961, stating that it did so because of the closeness of the case, because \u201cit was the most fair and equitable rate available,\u201d and because \u201cthe evidence [Jones] offered to prove why a higher rate of interest was justified, was unpersuasive.\u201d Order at 2. Although we do not see that the rate of prejudgment interest should be determined by the closeness of the case, we see no error or abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s assessment of the persuasiveness of Jones\u2019s evidence to support a higher rate than that set out in \u00a7 1961. The record indicates that Jones\u2019s original proffers were of a general nature and that she made no attempt on remand to supplement her proof that a higher interest rate was necessary in order to compensate her fully. We cannot conclude on this record that the court\u2019s use of the \u00a7 1961 rate was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We have considered all of Jones\u2019s contentions on this reinstated appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal. The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
