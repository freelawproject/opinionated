The district court sentenced him principally to 77 months\u2019 imprisonment. The sentence was increased beyond the maximum prescribed under \u00a7 1326(a) because the district court found that Mejia-Vasquez had committed an aggravated felony prior to deportation, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2), a fact not alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-22\">On appeal, Mejia-Vasquez challenges only his sentence. First, he argues that the sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) because \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which authorizes a maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>prison term of 20 years for a person whose deportation followed a conviction for an aggravated felony, must be construed as setting out an offense distinct from the one described in \u00a7 1326(a), which does not mention prior convictions and limits the term of imprisonment to two years. Mejia-Vasquez believes that <em>Apprendi </em>overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that \u00a7 1326(b) is merely a penalty provision and does not set out a separate offense. We reject this argument for the reasons stated in <em>United States v. Latorre-Benavides, </em>241 F.3d 262 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Second, Mejia-Vasquez argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>should be limited to cases in which the defendant <em>admitted </em>in his plea allocution to having committed an aggravated felony prior to deportation. Mejia-Vasquez did not admit this fact in his allocution, but neither did he deny it, and does not contest it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><em>Almendarez-Torres </em>nowhere imposes the limitation sought by Mejia-Vasquez; instead, the opinion explained that the fact of a prior conviction is a \u201csentencing factor\u201d for the district court\u2019s determination. <em>Id., </em>523 U.S. at 230. A trial judge is not limited to a defendant\u2019s allocution in making factual findings for sentencing purposes, and \u201cmay rely upon any information known to it.\u201d <em>United States v. Franklyn, </em>157 F.3d 90, 97 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
