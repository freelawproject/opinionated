The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment to Vallen, and she appeals. Having reviewed de novo the record and considered the parties\u2019 briefs, <em>see Hardin v. Hussmann Corp., 45 </em>F.3d 262, 264 (8th Cir.1995) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We agree with the district court that Roach\u2019s Missouri Human Rights Act (MHRA) failure-to-promote claim was time-barred, notwithstanding Roach\u2019s continuing-violation-doctrine argument, as the promotion decision was a discrete act occurring more than 180 days prior to her MHRA complaint. <em>See </em>Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 213.075.1 (2000); <em>High v. Univ. of Minn., </em>236 F.3d 909, 909 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (this court has never applied continuing-violation-doctrine to discrete act such as failure to promote). The Title VII failure-to-promote claim also fails for lack of evidence that Roach was similarly qualified to the male who was given the advertised position. <em>See McCullough v. Real Foods, Inc., </em>140 F.3d 1123, 1126 (8th Cir.1998) (fourth element of prima facie failure-to-promote claim is that employer promoted similarly qualified person who was not member of protected group).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">To avoid summary judgment on her discriminatory-termination claim, Roach had to show she was qualified for her job; she was discharged; and she was replaced by a male, the job remained open while Vallen sought a replacement, or circumstances surrounding her termination otherwise created an inference of discrimination. <em>See Johnson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., </em>97 F.3d 1070, 1072 (8th Cir.1996). Roach did not satisfy the final element, as she was replaced by a female, and the circumstances surrounding her dismissal \u2014 her counseling and subsequent refusal to supply a requested doctor\u2019s slip for sick days, culminating in her telling her supervisor to \u201ckiss my ass\u201d \u2014 did not raise an inference of discrimination. Although Roach presented evidence that a male employee also made a similar comment to Roach\u2019s supervisor without consequences, we agree with the district court that Roach and the male employee were not similarly situated: when the male employee allegedly made the statement he had not just been counseled, he had not consistently refused to submit a requested doctor\u2019s excuse, and he held a different position in a different department with a different supervisor. <em>See LaCroix v. Sears, Roebuck, and Co., </em>240 F.3d 688, 694 (8th Cir.2001) (employees who worked in entirely different departments and had different positions were not similarly situated in all relevant respects); <em>Palesch v. Mo. Comm\u2019n on Human Rights, </em>233 F.3d 560, 568 (8th Cir.2000) (test for whether employees are similarly situated to justify comparison is rigorous; employees are similarly situated if they are involved in or accused of same conduct but are disciplined differently).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Finally, we conclude Roach\u2019s general disparate-treatment claim fails as well given the lack of evidence that similarly situated males were treated more favorably; and we decline to consider her newly raised retaliation claim. <em>See Berg v. No-rand Corp., </em>169 F.3d 1140, 1145 (8th Cir.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 872, 120 S.Ct. 174, 145 L.Ed.2d 147 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">. The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
