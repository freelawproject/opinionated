O\u2019Connor appeals from the summary judgment granted by the District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to The Clorox Co. and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>codefendants on O\u2019Connor\u2019s defamation claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The facts leading up to this suit, as viewed in the light most favorable to O\u2019Connor, are as follows. In 1999, O\u2019Connor was a director of sales in Clorox\u2019s Bentonville, Arkansas, office. After receiving a sexual harassment complaint concerning O\u2019Connor from a Bentonville employee, a human resources consultant from Clorox\u2019s headquarters in Oakland, California, conducted an investigation, including interviews with employees in the Arkansas office. As a result, other misconduct on the part of O\u2019Connor was uncovered. On June 28, 1999, a termination letter was hand-delivered to O\u2019Connor\u2019s home. The letter indicated that O\u2019Connor was being terminated \u201cfor overall misconduct and behavior not becoming of a Director.\u201d Letter from Rick Rexing, General Sales Manager, to Joseph O\u2019Connor (June 23, 1999). The letter specified that O\u2019Connor had: violated the company\u2019s sexual harassment policy, forged Rexing\u2019s signature on company and government documents, failed to reimburse the company for personal FedEx charges, used company e-mail to send messages \u201cof a sexual nature,\u201d and used a company charge card for personal expenses. A copy of the letter also was left on O\u2019Connor\u2019s desk in his unlocked office at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">O\u2019Connor sued Clorox on various theories; the only claim remaining when summary judgment was granted was that of defamation for the statement in the letter that O\u2019Connor had forged Rexing\u2019s signature. The District Court, in granting summary judgment for Clorox, concluded there was no publication of the letter. <em>See Southall v. Little Rock Newspapers, Inc., </em>332 Ark. 123, 964 S.W.2d 187, 192 (Ark. 1998) (elements of defamation under Arkansas law). Upon de novo review, we agree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s theory was that various Clorox employees, one in particular, saw the letter in O\u2019Connor\u2019s office and then spoke of it to others. The named employee, however, signed a declaration in which he denied ever seeing the termination letter or being informed of its contents. Moreover, O\u2019Connor\u2019s friend, the individual who purportedly heard the allegations set forth in the letter, actually heard something quite different: that there had been gross misconduct on the part of O\u2019Connor having to do with foreign travel and theft. Further, O\u2019Connor\u2019s theory that his friend (an individual twice removed from the employee who supposedly saw and then published the letter) learned the contents of the letter as O\u2019Connor suggests is speculation and does not create a genuine issue of material fact on the question of publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">The District Court also held that O\u2019Con-nor had no claim of compelled self-publication under Arkansas law. In his brief on appeal, O\u2019Connor purports to \u201cincorporate!] his argument and authorities regarding negligent publication/limited compelled self-publication made in the District Court.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 28. Although the argument does not appear to be properly before us, <em>see </em>8th Cir. R. 28A(j) (\u201cA party may not incorporate by reference the contents of a brief filed elsewhere.\u201d), we nevertheless conclude that the District Court correctly held that the doctrine of self-publication is not available under Arkansas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment to Clorox. Further, to the extent O\u2019Connor has appealed from the court\u2019s decision denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motions, we hold that they were properly denied for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-28\">. The Honorable Jimm Larry Hendren, United States District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\">. Clorox also argued that the statement in issue (that O\u2019Connor had forged Rexing's signature) was not false and that O\u2019Connor suffered no damages, two additional elements of defamation under Arkansas law. The District Court did not reach these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
