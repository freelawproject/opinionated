We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-20\">\n<em>A. Base Offense Level</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-21\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, its application of the Guidelines to the facts for an abuse of discretion, and its findings of facts for clear error. <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number><em>ed States v. King, </em>246 F.3d 1166, 1176-77 (9th Cir.2001). At Espinoza\u2019s sentencing hearing, the parties disputed the proper way to calculate Espinoza\u2019s base offense level. Espinoza and the government agreed that, because Espinoza had attempted to manufacture methamphetamine from the pseudoephedrine found in the barn, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.11(c)(1) required the district court to use U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), the Drug Quantity Table, in determining Espinoza\u2019s base offense level. The government argued that the pseudoephedrine found in the storage locker constituted \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. It argued that the pseudoephedrine found in the locker should be added to that found in the bam and that this combined amount should be used to calculate the amount of methamphetamine for which Espinoza is responsible under \u00a7 2D1.1. To the contrary, Espinoza argued that the pseudoephedrine found in the storage locker did not constitute \u201crelevant conduct\u201d and so should not be included in the calculation of his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2), all acts and omissions by the defendant that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction that were part of the same course or conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction are \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d provided that the offenses are of a character for which \u00a7 3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts. By its plain terms, \u00a7 3D1.2(d) applies to offenses covered by \u00a7 2D1.1 (unlawful manufacturing of a controlled substance) and \u00a7 2D1.11 (unlawful possession of a listed chemical). Because Espinoza used the pseudoephedrine in the barn in an attempt to manufacture methamphetamine, it is covered by \u00a7 2D1.1. Because he possessed the pseudoephedrine in the locker with the intent to manufae- \u2019 ture methamphetamine, it is covered by \u00a7 2D1.11. Section 3D1.2(d) would require grouping, so the pseudoephedrine in the locker is relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2). Because possession of the locker pseudoephedrine was \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2), the district court properly aggregated the locker and barn pseudoephedrine in calculating Espinoza\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 12. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s calculation of Espinoza\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">\n<em>B. Doumward Departure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">While we review a district court\u2019s decision to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines for an abuse of discretion, <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 99, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996), we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward from the Guidelines, <em>United States v. Tam, </em>240 F.3d 797, 805 (9th Cir.2001). We do, however, have jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacks legal authority under the Guidelines to depart downward. <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 100; <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>121 F.3d 510, 513 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">At the sentencing hearing, Espinoza argued that the district court had the authority to grant a downward departure based on a sentencing disparity that resulted from improper prosecutorial manipulation of co-defendants\u2019 indictments. <em>Cf United States v. Daas, </em>198 F.3d 1167, 1180-81 (9th Cir.1999) (recognizing that \u201c[djownward departure to equalize sentencing disparity is a proper ground for departure under the appropriate circumstances\u201d). On appeal, Espinoza claims that the district court did not recognize that it had the authority to depart to remedy an inappropriate manipulation of the indictment. However, the record belies Espinoza\u2019s characterization. In ruling on this issue, the district court clearly recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>nized that it had the legal authority to grant a downward departure if it found that the government had engaged in inappropriate manipulation of Espinoza\u2019s and Joy\u2019s indictments. The court declined to exercise its departure power because it found that the government had not, in fact, inappropriately manipulated the indictments. Therefore, we are without jurisdiction to review Espinoza\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s departure decision. We therefore dismiss his appeal on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"ABD\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b880-14\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir.
