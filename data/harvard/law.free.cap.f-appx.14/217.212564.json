The district court found Macedo-Molina had been convicted of two prior aggravated felonies, making the statutory maximum sentence a twenty-year term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Macedo-Molina argues he should have been sentenced under the provisions of \u00a7 1326(a), which provides a maximum sentence of two years, because the Government did not charge a violation of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) in the indictment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-25\">Because the Supreme Court has held \u00a7 1326(b)(2) sets forth a sentencing factor rather than an element of the offense, this claim is without merit. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Contrary to Macedo-Molina\u2019s assertions, we find <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (finding <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres), cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 1214, 149 L.Ed.2d 126 (2001); <em>United States v. Gatewood, </em>230 F.3d 186, 192 (6th Cir.2000) (finding that, despite <em>Apprendi, Almendarez-Torres </em>remains the law); <em>see also Columbia Union Coll. v. Clarke, </em>159 F.3d 151, 158 (4th Cir.1998) (stating that lower courts should not presume the Supreme Court has overruled one of its cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>by implication; courts must follow case law that directly controls unless clearly overruled by subsequent Supreme Court case).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Consequently, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
