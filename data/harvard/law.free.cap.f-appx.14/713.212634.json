Jackson was sentenced to life imprisonment following his conviction by a Missouri jury of second-degree murder. After exhausting his state remedies, Jackson filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in United States District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied Jackson\u2019s petition, but issued a certificate of appealability on Jackson\u2019s claim that his constitutional rights were violated when a state prosecutor knowingly failed to disclose a \u201cdeal\u201d he had reached with a witness and when the pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>ecutor suborned perjury from the witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">We affirm on the grounds set forth by the district court in its well-reasoned order denying Jackson\u2019s petition. Having reviewed the record, we agree with the district court that Jackson\u2019s claim regarding the alleged prosecutorial misconduct is procedurally defaulted. Thus, Jackson must demonstrate either (1) actual innocence or (2) cause and prejudice to excuse the default. <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 748-49, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); <em>Dejan v. United States, </em>208 F.3d 682, 685 (8th Cir.2000). Jackson does not allege actual innocence, and we agree with the district court that he has failed to establish cause and prejudice. In particular, we observe that Jackson has not established prejudice because he has not demonstrated that \u201cthe errors of which he complains \u201cworked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ivy v. Caspari, </em>173 F.3d 1136, 1141 (8th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 170, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982)) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">AFFIRMED. <em>See </em>8th Cir.
