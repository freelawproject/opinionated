We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Alexander\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, deny his motion for a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v.

Appeal Number 01-6571 is Alexander\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3), (4), and Number 01-6572 is Alexander\u2019s appeal from the denial of his emergency motion requesting the issuance of an opinion on his Rule 60(b)(3), (4) motion. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinions and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Alexander\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel in each of these appeals and affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v.

We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
