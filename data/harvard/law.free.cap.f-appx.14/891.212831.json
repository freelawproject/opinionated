We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on the following, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">In order to be eligible for a discretionary grant of asylum, an alien has the burden of demonstrating that he has been persecuted, or has a well-founded fear of persecution in his native country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We review credibility findings under a substantial evidence standard of review. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-17\">Singh claimed that he is entitled to asylum based upon his Sikh religion and his political opinion, as a member and officer (district supervisor) of the All India Sikh Student Federation (AISSF). He also claims he was once arrested and beaten.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-18\">However, Singh\u2019s testimony and documentation, together with his wife\u2019s testimony, contain inconsistent facts and discrepancies relating to his alleged fear of persecution. <em>See de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393-94 (9th Cir.1997). In addition, Singh was unaware of the elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>tions in the Punjab during the time he states he was an AISSF officer, and he failed to accurately account for his whereabouts during the time he was hiding from police.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The inconsistencies, discrepancies, and gaps in testimony were material. They provide substantial evidence to support the adverse credibility findings of the IJ and the BIA. Further, as Singh has failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he has necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Singh-Kaur, </em>183 F.3d at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b920-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-19\">.
