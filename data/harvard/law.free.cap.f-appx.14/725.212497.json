The District Court concluded that Noble had procedurally defaulted five of the six claims he presented in his petition. We agree, and affirm the dismissal of these five claims. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-23\">The District Court determined that Noble\u2019s sixth claim, ineffective assistance of counsel founded in counsel\u2019s failure to preserve Noble\u2019s right to appeal the denial of a motion to suppress, was not procedurally defaulted. The Court dismissed it, however, concluding that Noble\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-24\">Subsequently developed case law has rendered the court\u2019s conclusion incorrect because Noble had a \u201cproperly filed\u201d post-conviction petition pending in state court from February 1996 through June 11, 1998. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (Supp. IV 1998) (\u201cproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d tolls limitations period); <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 363-65, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000) (defining \u201cproperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>filed\u201d); <em>Snow v. Ault, </em>238 F.3d 1033, 1035 (8th Cir.) (applying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) definition in concluding that second post-conviction motion in state court, subject to dismissal as successive under state law, was nonetheless \u201cproperly filed\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1663, 149 L.Ed.2d 644 (2001). As such, his June 10, 1999 \u00a7 2254 petition was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We therefore remand this case to the District Court for consideration of the ineffective-assistance claim on the merits. <em>See Burns v. Gammon, </em>173 F.3d 1089, 1094 (8th Cir.1999). The judgment of the District Court is affirmed in all other respects. Noble\u2019s motion to supplement the appellate record with the documents he has tendered is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
