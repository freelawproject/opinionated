Magana brought this pro se suit against the railroad in 1999, alleging that it improperly computed severance benefits due him. The district court granted the railroad\u2019s motion to dismiss, and Magana appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-22\">We cannot review this appeal, however, because neither Magana\u2019s opening brief nor his reply brief meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a). He does not explain why the district court erred in granting the railroad\u2019s motion to dismiss, and indeed fails to reference the district court\u2019s judgment anywhere in his briefs. The briefs set forth no coherent legal argument and cite no cases. Even though Magana is proceeding pro se, his briefs must contain a legal argument and some supporting authority. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9), <em>Mathis v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>133 F.3d 546, 548 (7th Cir.1998) (per curiam); <em>United States ex rel. Verdone v. Circuit Court for Taylor County, </em>73 F.3d 669, 673 (7th Cir.1995) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-23\">Accordingly, we DISMISS Magana\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
