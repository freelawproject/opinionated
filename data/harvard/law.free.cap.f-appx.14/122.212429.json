We interpret the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the action as pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), which allows a district court to dismiss an action <em>sua sponte </em>for failure to comply with any order of the court and review the dismissal for abuse of discretion. <em>See LeSane v. Hall\u2019s Security Analyst, Inc., </em>239 F.3d 206, 209 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The District Court noted that it had given Plante two opportunities to file an amended \u201cNotice of Removal.\u201d The District Court also expressly warned that a failure to comply with the rules regarding the \u201cNotice of Removal\u201d in her second amended pleading would result in dismissal. The District Court\u2019s previous orders had discussed the deficiencies in Plante\u2019s filings and the ways in which Plante could correct them. Plante\u2019s subsequent submissions failed to correct the errors discussed by the District Court. Accordingly, we find that the dismissal was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
