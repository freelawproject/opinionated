Hooks appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Lockheed Skunk Works (\u201cLockheed\u201d) in his action alleging racial discrimination in employment. We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, <em>Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1219-20 (9th Cir.1998), relying on federal decisions to interpret the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. <em>See id. </em>at 1219; <em>Nelson v. United Techs., </em>74 Cal.App.4th 597, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 239, 249 n. 5 (Ct.App. 1999). Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-19\">I. <em>Racial discrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-20\">Hooks must first establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination by showing that: (1) he belongs to a protected group, (2) he applied and was qualified for a job which was open for applications, (3) he was rejected, and (4) the position remained open after his rejection and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of the plaintiffs qualifications. <em>Lindahl v. Air France, </em>930 F.2d 1434, 1437 (9th Cir.1991). Hooks established a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-21\">The defendant must then articulate a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for the employment decisions. <em>Godwin, </em>150 F.3d at 1220. \u201c[T]he defendant is only required to set forth a legally sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>explanation.\u201d <em>Harris v. Itzhaki </em>183 F.3d 1043, 1051 (9th Cir.1999). Lockheed satisfied its burden by stating that Hooks lacked mechanical engineering skills and experience necessary for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The burden then shifts back to Hooks to present specific and substantial evidence that the proffered reason is a merely a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>Hooks argues that pretext is demonstrated by circumstantial evidence because Lockheed provided inconsistent reasons for its refusal to promote him, Hooks is more qualified than Michael Walker, and Lockheed conducted a \u201csham\u201d investigation of Hooks\u2019 administrative complaint of racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">A. <em>Inconsistent Reasons</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">\u201c[F]undamentally different justifications for an employer\u2019s action would give rise to a genuine issue of fact with respect to pretext since they suggest the possibility that neither of the official reasons was the true reason.\u201d <em>Payne v. Norwest Corp., </em>113 F.3d 1079, 1080 (9th Cir.1997) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Patrick Foley documented the reasons for not promoting Hooks in an August 1996 \u201cDisposition.\u201d He stated that Hooks \u201clacks experience in design development of aircraft electrical systems; lacks experience in aircraft electrical cable and harness design; lacks experience in aircraft electrical power systems; needs improvement in oral and written communication.\u201d Hooks contends these reasons differ materially from those expressed in Foley\u2019s later letter dated November 7, 1997 and other documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">The Disposition states that Hooks \u201clacks experience in aircraft electrical cable and harness design.\u201d The November 7th letter states the exact opposite, that Hooks has experience in \u201cwiring cable and harness design.\u201d The statements are definitely inconsistent, which Lockheed concedes. Nevertheless, this single inconsistency related to one of four reasons that Hook was not promoted is not so substantial or material as to create a triable issue that Lockheed intended to discriminate. <em>See Godwin, </em>150 F.3d at 1222 (circumstantial evidence of pretense based on inconsistencies must be specific and substantial to create triable issue of discriminatory intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">Foley\u2019s November 7th letter states that \u201cHooks <em>has </em>experience in service bulletin writing, CATLA proficiency, deficiency reports and writing skills.\u201d (Emphasis added). A June 19, 1998 letter from Leo Hill to the EEOC states the exact opposite: \u201cAccording to Mr. Hooks\u2019 Manager, Patrick Foley, Mr. Hooks <em>lacks </em>experience in service bulletin writing, CATIA proficiency, deficiency reports and writing skills.\u201d We agree with the district court that this is not an inconsistency but a typographical error substituting \u201clacks\u201d for \u201chas.\u201d Hill\u2019s letter referenced Foley\u2019s letter as an \u201cAttachment,\u201d and attached a copy. Under these circumstances, a reasonable jury could not believe Hill was intentionally trying to misrepresent the contents of Foley\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">B. <em>Better Qualifications</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">Hooks also argues he was more qualified than Walker for the position. \u201cFacts tending to show that the chosen applicant may not have been the best person for the job are probative as they suggest that the explanation may not have been the real reason for choosing the chosen applicant over the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets, internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">Hooks fails to identify any aspect in which he was more qualified than Walker. Further, there is no need for Lockheed to demonstrate that Walker was substantially more qualified than Hooks for the job. It is Hooks\u2019 job to produce evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>dence of his superior qualifications, and \u201c[t]he closer the qualifications of the candidates, the less weight the court should give to the perceived differences in qualifications in deciding whether the proffered explanations were pretextual.\u201d <em>Blue v. Widnall, </em>162 F.3d 541, 546 (9th Cir.1998) (quotations omitted). Hooks has not demonstrated that he was clearly more qualified for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">C. <em>\u201cSham\u201d Investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">A \u201csham\u201d investigation can be evidence of a company\u2019s lack of good faith efforts to comply with anti-discrimination law. <em>See Bruso v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>239 F.3d 848, 860-61 (7th Cir.2001). Hooks has not presented substantial evidence that the investigation was actually a \u201csham.\u201d Hill contacted all of the relevant people and, at least, provided most of the relevant documents requested by the EEOC. Contrary to Hooks\u2019 contention, Hill\u2019s failure to conduct in-person interviews of the relevant people does not appear improper. Nor does Hill\u2019s failure to provide the EEOC with all requested generic company information and all documents regarding Walker\u2019s qualifications suggest the investigation was a sham. If additional documentation was necessary for resolution of the complaint, the EEOC could have issued a subpoena. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">D. <em>Favorable Employment Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Lockheed points out that Frank Bates, one of the two managers who decided not to give Hooks the job, gave Hooks a promotion two years earlier. When an individual makes a favorable employment decision and then, within a short period of time, the same actor makes an adverse employment decision, \u201ca strong inference arises that there was no discriminatory motive.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., </em>104 F.3d 267, 270 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">We conclude that Hooks did not present substantial evidence of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">II. <em>Retaliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">Hooks argues that Lockheed gave him a negative performance rating and a lower ESG job ranking because he filed complaints with the EEOC and DFEH. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Hooks must show that: (1) he engaged in protected activity, (2) he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co., </em>25 F.3d 1459, 1464-65 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">A. <em>Negative Performance Evaluation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">Hooks argues that Lockheed gave him a negative performance evaluation in retaliation for his complaining about discrimination. A negative performance evaluation may constitute an adverse employment action. <em>See Korian v. California Youth Authority, </em>217 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">It is not apparent that the 1997 evaluation was materially lower than the two previous evaluations. The only difference is that, in one of the ten categories, Hooks was rated \u201chighly competent\u201d in 1997 as opposed to \u201cdistinguished\u201d in 1996. Moreover, the 1997 evaluation was actually <em>higher </em>than the one in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">Hooks contends that the 1997 evaluation is nevertheless adverse because it contains a comment that \u201cit is imperative that Kevin continue his formal education.\u201d His 1996 evaluation, however, reflected a similar sentiment: \u201cKevin should consider continuing his education\u201d and should \u201ccompleten at least one engineering class.\u201d This difference is not material. Likewise, the comment that Hooks\u2019 \u201cjudgment could be improved\u201d is not materially negative, considering that it was followed by the statement that he \u201chas the potential and ability to assume increasing [sic] demanding assignments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>B. <em>Employee Rankings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Hooks argues that his ranking at or near the bottom of his job classification in Lockheed\u2019s Classification Ranking List constitutes an adverse employment action because it renders him vulnerable to being laid off. Lockheed responds that merely increasing an employee\u2019s vulnerability to layoff does not tangibly affect the terms and conditions of employment. At least one California court has indicated otherwise. <em>See Heard v. Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., </em>44 Cal.App.4th 1735, 52 Cal. Rptr.2d 620, 624, 633-34 (Ct.App.1996) (low ranking, combined with other adverse actions, was sufficient to support inference of racial discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Hooks was ranked at or near the bottom both before and after complaining about discrimination. The September 1997 ranking, the first after Hooks complained of discrimination, is essentially identical to the previous rankings. The major change occurred in March 1998 when the number of employees in Hooks\u2019 job classification increased to nine. While Hooks again was placed near the bottom, this time there were six employees ahead of him. However, there were also two employees below him. It is not apparent that these subsequent rankings rendered Hooks more vulnerable to being laid off and Hooks does not provide an explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Hooks also claims that Hill\u2019s investigation of Hooks\u2019 retaliation complaint was a \u201csham\u201d to cover up the retaliatory motives of the decision-makers. For the same reasons that Lockheed\u2019s investigation of Hooks\u2019 discrimination complaint does not add to Hooks\u2019 showing of pretext, Lockheed\u2019s investigation of Hooks\u2019 retaliation complaint does not add anything either. Hooks also repeatedly suggests that Hill\u2019s request that the managers provide \u201cwritten rationale\u201d for Hooks\u2019 rankings was really an instruction to \u201cfabricate reasons\u201d to cover up the retaliation. It is not apparent that providing \u201cwritten rationale\u201d means \u201cfabricate reasons\u201d and Hooks does not offer any evidence to suggest that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Finally, Lockheed points out that it offered Hooks a promotion to the same pay grade level as the position Hooks was initially denied. Hooks applied for and was offered the position, but declined to accept Lockheed\u2019s offer. Lockheed\u2019s offer of a promotion is inconsistent with an intent to retaliate against Hooks or set him up for a layoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Hooks did not present sufficient evidence of an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b798-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
