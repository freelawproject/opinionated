Mordue, <em>Judge </em>) following a six-day jury trial. The jury found Anderson guilty of the only count in the indictment, which charged Anderson with mailing a threatening letter to Joseph Heath, an attorney for the Onondaga Nation, with intent to extort, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876. Anderson was sentenced to, inter alia, three years probation including six months of home detention. This Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">On appeal, Anderson argues that (1) he was prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876 for engaging in political speech that is protected by the First Amendment; (2) the government failed to prove his intent to extort a thing of value, which is a necessary element of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7. 876; (3) the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence that may have been relevant to intent, state of mind, and the alleged victim\u2019s bias and hostility toward the defendant; (4) the district court erred in refusing to charge the jury that it must find Anderson\u2019s intent to extort to be \u201cwrongful\u201d and in instructing the jury that motive is irrelevant; (5) the district court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the alleged perjury of Heath and in refusing to read back Heath\u2019s testimony on prior correspondence between Anderson and Heath; and (6) the district court committed reversible error by delivering an unduly coercive <em>Allen </em>charge and by denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. We find all of these arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">We reject Anderson\u2019s first argument regarding the nature of his speech because the letter that he sent to Joseph Heath unequivocally, unconditionally and specifically stated that if Heath goes upon Iroquois Confederacy land, much of which he works on and around on a daily basis, his car would be confiscated and burned. As the district court indicated, this was a true threat. <em>See United States v. Francis, </em>164 F.3d 120, 123 (2d Cir.1999) (explaining that \u201c[o]nce a statement meets [the <em>Kelner </em>] test, it is no longer protected speech because it is so intertwined with violent action that it has essentially become conduct rather than speech\u201d); <em>United States v. Kelner, </em>534 F.2d 1020, 1027 (2d Cir. 1976) (explaining that \u201c[s]o long as the threat on its face and in the circumstances in which it is made is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to the person threatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution, [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876] may properly be applied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">As for Anderson\u2019s second argument, we have held previously that the ability to peacefully carry on one\u2019s business is a \u201cthing of value\u201d for purposes of statutes dealing with extortion. <em>See United States v. Arena, </em>180 F.3d 380, 392 (2d Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014 , 121 S.Ct. 33, 148 L.Ed.2d 13 (2000); <em>cf. United States v. Girard, </em>601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir.1979). Therefore, we reject Anderson\u2019s argument that the government failed to prove his intent to extort a thing of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">Appellant\u2019s third argument concerning the exclusion of evidence is rejected because the district court did not abuse its discretion when it applied Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b). In applying these rules correctly, the district court excluded from evidence a videotape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>and an eyewitness account authored by Joseph Heath that had minimal probative value, potentially high prejudicial value, and the effect of attacking the credibility of Mr. Heath through extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">As for Anderson\u2019s requested jury charge, the district court did not misrepresent the law in its charge, and in fact, did explain that \u201cto extort\u201d means to \u201cwrongfully induce someone else to give up something of value by threatening injury to property of another if the thing of value sought is not surrendered.\u201d As a matter of law, Anderson had no legal right to threaten violence to Heath\u2019s property, and therefore it was unnecessary for the district court to charge the jury that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, first, that the defendant had no lawful claim or right to the thing of value he allegedly sought or attempted to obtain, and second, that the defendant knew that he had no lawful claim or right to the thing of value he allegedly sought or attempted to obtain. In addition, the district court\u2019s charge as to Anderson\u2019s motive did not misconstrue the law. <em>See </em>1 L. Sand, <em>et al., Modem Federal Jury Instructions, </em>Instruction 6-18 (2000); 5 K. O\u2019Malley, <em>et al., General Instructions for Federal Criminal Cases, </em>\u00a7 17.06 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Anderson\u2019s motion for a new trial because, as the district court correctly indicated, (1) Anderson did not establish that Heath in fact committed perjury, <em>see United States v. White, </em>972 F.2d 16, 20 (2d Cir.1992) (explaining that \u201ca threshold inquiry is whether the evidence demonstrates that the witness in fact committed perjury\u201d), (2) the allegedly false testimony was not before the jury but only the court, and (3) the allegedly false testimony was not material to the jury\u2019s verdict because it had nothing to do with the mailing of an extortionate threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">With respect to the read back, the district court\u2019s refusal to allow a read back of Heath\u2019s testimony about the newspaper article in which he called Anderson a \u201cwindbag,\u201d assuming it was.error, must be considered harmless because of the district court\u2019s willingness to read back other testimony in which Heath directly testified that Anderson was a \u201cwindbag.\u201d As for read backs concerning prior correspondence between Heath and Anderson, the district court did not abuse its discretion because such testimony did not address the jury\u2019s request as to Heath\u2019s reaction to the threatening letter that formed the basis for the charges against Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In the context of an <em>Allen </em>charge, this Court is required to consider whether a given charge \u201ctends to coerce undecided jurors into reaching a verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Melendez, </em>60 F.3d 41, 51 (2d Cir.1995), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>516 U.S. 1105, 116 S.Ct. 900, 133 L.Ed.2d 834 (1996). Based on a reading of the charge as a whole, the district court\u2019s <em>Allen </em>charge was not unduly coercive and is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
