We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-18\">Torres was convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to concurrent 87-month terms of imprisonment. In December 2000 Torres moved to vacate his sentences, claiming that they run afoul of Apprendi <em>v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because drug quantities were not charged in his indictment or proved at trial. The district court denied the motion on the ground that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively but then granted Torres a certificate of appealability, stating that reasonable jurists could disagree as to the retroactivity of <em>Apprendi </em>in initial \u00a7 2255 proceedings. But irrespective of its retroactivity, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to Torres\u2019s case because his prison terms do not exceed the default 20-year maximum penalty for cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. His motion was therefore properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
