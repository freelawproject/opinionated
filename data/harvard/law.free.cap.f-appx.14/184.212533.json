The district court dismissed Carter\u2019s sexual harassment claims without prejudice because he did not allege physical injury pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1997e(e) (West Supp.2000). Because Carter may re-file his complaint to allege physical injury, the order in question is not a final, appealable order as to those claims. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we dismiss Carter\u2019s appeal as to the sexual harassment claims for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">We have reviewed the record as to the remaining claims and the district\u2019s opinion and orders and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court as to all other claims. <em>Carter v. Angelone, </em>No. CA-00-951-7 (W.D.Va. Dec. 11 and 28, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
