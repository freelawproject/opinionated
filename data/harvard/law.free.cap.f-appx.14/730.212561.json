Black Bull, Jr., pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual abuse of a child in Indian country, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). In a pre-indictment interview with an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Mr. Black Bull had admitted having sexual intercourse with the victim but had shifted part of the responsibility to her, claiming that she \u2014 at age six, and later at age eight \u2014 had initiated the intercourse with him. The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>trict court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> refused to apply an aceeptance-of-responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, based on its disbelief of the statements Mr. Black Bull made to the FBI agent regarding the victim\u2019s conduct, and sentenced him to 262 months imprisonment and 4 years supervised release. On appeal, Mr. Black Bull argues the court clearly erred in denying him a section 3E1.1 reduction, because the relevant period for assessing acceptance of responsibility is primarily between indictment and sentencing, and no evidence supports the view that his pre-indictment statements reflected his post-indictment attitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We have previously upheld the denial of section 3E1.1 reductions based on pre-indictment factors, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Keester, </em>70 F.3d 1026, 1027 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Dortch, </em>923 F.2d 629, 632 (8th Cir.1991), and we give great deference to the district court because it is in a unique position to evaluate Mr. Black Bull\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5). Thus, we conclude the district court did not clearly err in denying Mr. Black Bull the reduction. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Rodriguez, </em>239 F.3d 948, 954 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Further, as Mr. Black Bull concedes on appeal, commentary to section 3E1.1 permits the district court to consider his preindictment behavior in determining whether he has accepted responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.1(a)) (appropriate considerations include truthfully admitting conduct comprising offense of conviction and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which defendant is accountable), (n.3) (truthfully admitting conduct comprising offense of conviction and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which defendant is accountable constitutes significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\">. The Honorable Charles B. Kommann, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
