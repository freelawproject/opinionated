Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the district court that the complaint raises unreviewable challenges to a state court decision, as well as claims barred by judicial immunity. We also conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brooks\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We thus affirm the judgment of the district court, <em>see </em>8th Cir. R. 47B, and deny the pending motions on appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
