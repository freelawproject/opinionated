We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-22\">Alesenko was arrested and convicted in state court of violating a provision of a protective order that prohibits him from calling his estranged wife at night. As a result of the conviction, the INS charged that Alesenko was subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii). That section provides that \u201c[a]ny alien who at any time after admission is enjoined under a protection order issued by a court and whom the court determines has engaged in conduct that violates the portion of a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>teetion order that involves protection against credible threats of violence, repeated harassment, or bodily injury to the person or persons for whom the protection order was issued is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Alesenko claims that the INS failed to prove that his conduct violated \u201ca portion of a protection order that involves protection against credible threats of violence, repeated harassment, or bodily injury.\u201d The record belies that claim. The prohibited conduct, making late night phone calls to his wife, was clearly intended to protect the wife from credible threats of violence and harassment. Moreover, we agree with the BIA\u2019s observation that Alesenko was found guilty of violating the protective order and that <em>every </em>provision of that order prohibits Alesenko from harassing or threatening his wife. Accordingly, we conclude that the INS carried its burden under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Alesenko also argues that the administrative record should have been limited to his \u201cRecord of Conviction\u201d rather than including other documents, such as the protective order and underlying police reports. He contends that if the record were limited to his \u201cindictment, plea, verdict, and sentence,\u201d there exist insufficient evidence to support a violation of \u00a7 1227(a) (2)(E) (ii). We can discern no reason, however, to so limit the record. Nothing in the statute limits review to the conviction record itself. In fact, the IJ is permitted to consider any evidence that reasonably indicates the existence of a criminal conviction. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.41(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Finally, Alesenko argues that he was denied due process by not being allowed to \u201crelitigate\u201d his criminal case. There is no question that an alien \u201cis entitled to a full and fair hearing on his claims and a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his behalf.\u201d <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). The record here shows, however, that the parties agreed that they were \u201cdealing with an issue of law with regard to whether the respondent is removable\u201d and that, accordingly, they would not be \u201cgoing behind the documents of record which speak to the conviction.\u201d Given the extensive briefing and arguments on the issue, we conclude that Alesenko was not denied any due process rights. <em>See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1270 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b823-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
