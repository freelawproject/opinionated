R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b911-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Eryln Edward Bishop appeals the 30-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea to unlawful reentry of a deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Bishop contends that in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court erred in imposing a sentence in excess of the two-year maximum set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) based upon a prior felony which he did not admit occurred prior to his deportation. He also contends that <em>Apprendi </em>renders inapplicable <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a sentencing factor and not a separate offense), because he did not admit to any aggravated felony at his plea hearing. His arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">The sentence is AFFIRMED. This matter is REMANDED to the district court with directions to correct the judgment of conviction to exclude the reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), consistent with <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d 1057 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b911-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
