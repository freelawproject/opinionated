We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a), we review de novo, <em>See Dows v. Wood, </em>211 F.3d 480, 484 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Mercado contends that his convictions for first degree murder and related crimes must be reversed because his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated by admission of a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession that implicated Mercado. Mercado\u2019s contention lacks merit because, although the evidence was admitted in violation of Mercado\u2019s right to confrontation, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (holding that a harmless error standard maybe applied to confrontation clause violations if a court is able to declare a belief that such an error was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Indeed, the record is replete with overwhelming evidence of Mercado\u2019s guilt including: 1) testimony by Mercado\u2019s best friend that Mercado informed him of the plan to kill the victim prior to commission of the crime, and later confessed, and confession to the crime; 2) a shotgun found in Mercado\u2019s home identified by Mercado\u2019s best friend as the weapon he helped Mercado clean after the crime, and matching expended shells found at the crime scene, and 3) the testimony of the co-defendant\u2019s girlfriend placing Mercado with the victim around the time that the murder took place. In light of the substantial evidence of guilt, the admission of the challenged evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (holding that a harmless error standard maybe applied to constitutional violations if a court is able to declare a belief that such an error was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b967-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
