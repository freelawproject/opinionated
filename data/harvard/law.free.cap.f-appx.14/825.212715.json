We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">Ware contends that the district court erred by refusing to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 439 to the Sentencing Guidelines regarding the definition of \u201crelevant conduct.\u201d We disagree. The guidelines specifically limit which amendments retroactively apply on a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c), comment (n.1); <em>United States v. Cruz-Mendoza, </em>147 F.3d 1069, 1073 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by </em>163 F.3d 1149 (9th Cir. 1998). Accordingly, an amendment not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c) is not retroactively applicable in a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See United States v. Cueto, </em>9 F.3d 1438, 1440-41 (9th Cir.1993). Because \u00a7 lB1.10(c) does not include Amendment 439, the district court did not err by refusing to apply it to Ware\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b854-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-13\">. We reject the Government\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction. The appeal is not moot because a reduced sentence would in turn shorten the statutorily mandated term of supervised release that Ware is currently serving. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>991 F.2d 1468, 1470 (9th Cir.1993). Although we have held that we lack jurisdiction under \u00a7 3742 to review a district court's discretionary decision not to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>see United States v. Lowe, </em>136 F.3d 1231, 1233 (9th Cir. 1998), we have jurisdiction here because the district court ruling was one of law and not discretion, <em>see id. </em>at 1232.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
