We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-26\">Nelson contends that his writ of habeas corpus filed with the California Supreme Court on April 23, 1997 tolled the statute of limitations so that his Amended Petition originally filed on March 28, 1997, and still pending before the district court on August 27,1997, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-27\">We review the dismissal of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo. <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-28\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) imposes a one-year statute of limitations on habeas petitions by state prisoners. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Since Nelson\u2019s conviction became final before the enaction of AEDPA, the statute of limitations was due to expire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>on April 24, 1997, one year after the act\u2019s implementation. <em>Calderon v. United States District Court (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283,1287 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Calderon v. United States District Court (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530 (9th Cir.1998). The statute of limitations is tolled, however, while a \u201cproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Nelson filed a writ of habeas corpus with the California Supreme Court on April 23, 1997, which tolled the statute of limitations until August 27, 1997, the date on which the California Supreme Court dismissed Nelson\u2019s petition on procedural grounds. A state habeas petition is still \u201cproperly filed\u201d with the state court sufficient to toll the statute of limitations even though a petitioner\u2019s claims may be deemed procedurally barred by the state court. <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 364, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000); <em>Dictado v. Ducharme, </em>244 F.3d 724, 726 (9th Cir.2001). Nelson\u2019s habeas petition was therefore exhausted and before the district court on August 27, 1997, one day before the statute of limitations would have run. The district court should proceed with that petition, although it may allow Nelson leave to amend his petition to cure the defects described in the district court\u2019s November 7, 1997 order. Such an amendment would relate back to the petition timely before the district court on August 27, 1997. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(2); <em>Anthony v. Cambra, </em>236 F.3d 568, 576 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-19\">.
