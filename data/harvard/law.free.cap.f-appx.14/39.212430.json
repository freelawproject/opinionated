Scheindlin, <em>Judge, </em>granting summary judgment dismissing his complaint alleging violations of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq. </em>Defendants have cross-appealed, seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>affirmance. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">At the oral argument of this appeal, this Court inquired of defense counsel whether either the district court or defendants had given Hussein notice, in accordance with cases such as <em>Vital v. Interfaith Medical </em>Center, 168 F.3d 615 (2d Cir.1999), of the consequences of failing to respond properly to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Although defense counsel stated his belief that such notice had been given, the documents he has now submitted to this Court in support of that belief do not show the requisite notice. While Hussein responded to the summary judgment motion with certain affidavits, his own affidavit appears merely to reiterate allegations of his complaint, and it is not clear from the record that he was aware of the type of response needed to defeat such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is vacated, and the matter is remanded for the giving of notice and for further proceedings not inconsistent with <em>Vital v. Interfaith Medical Center </em>and the authorities cited therein. <em>See also McPherson v. Coombe, </em>174 F.3d 276 (2d Cir.1999). We express no view as to the merits of defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, and nothing in this order forecloses the granting of such relief following the appropriate proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Defendants\u2019 cross-appeal, filed \u201csolely for the purpose of preserving alternative arguments in support of the Judgment\u201d (Defendants\u2019 brief on appeal at 1), is dismissed as improvidently filed. <em>See generally Great American Audio Corp. v. Metacom, Inc., </em>938 F.2d 16, 19 (2d Cir.1991) (per curiam) (prevailing party is entitled to urge affirmance on any basis submitted to the district court and supported by the record, including a basis rejected by the court; but the prevailing party is not entitled to cross-appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing. The cross-appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
