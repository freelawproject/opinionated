We have jurisdiction pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Romero argues that the district court erred by sentencing him according to the guidelines for the substance he actually he imported \u2014 cocaine\u2014and not based on the controlled substance he thought he was importing \u2014 marijuana. Romero\u2019s challenge has been squarely foreclosed by this Court. It is well-established that \u201cthe base level offense for guideline sentencing may be determined by the volume of the drug actually imported, whether or not the defendant knows ... the nature of the substance \u2014 if he knows only that he is importing a controlled substance.\u201d <em>United States v. Salazar, </em>5 F.3d 445, 446 (9th Cir.1993). There is no question that Romero knew he was importing a controlled substance, he was indicted for and pleaded guilty to importation of cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance. Accordingly, the district court correctly imposed a sentence based on what Romero actually possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">Romero additionally argues that his sentence was imposed in contravention of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), due to his alleged lack of knowledge regarding the type of controlled substance he imported. This argument is without merit. First, Romero\u2019s sentence does not run afoul of <em>Apprendi </em>because it falls below the statutory maximum applicable where an indictment fails to state any amount of narcotics involved. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(3) (prescribing not more than 20 years imprisonment for importation of a amount of a schedule II controlled substance, including cocaine); <em>cf. United States v. Garcia-Guizar, </em>234 F.3d 483, 489 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>(9th Cir.2000) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not require reversal when defendant\u2019s sentence is less than the statutory maximum for the offense). Second, in contrast to <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir.2000), relied on by Romero, he pleaded guilty to the precise offense to which he was sentenced. <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>Nos. 99-10416, 99-10422, 99-10524, 2001 WL 396534, at *9 (9th Cir. April 20, 2001) (\u201cAn unconditional guilty plea constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal all non-jurisdictional antecedent rulings and cures all antecedent <em>constitutional </em>defects.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted) (emphasis in original). The district court\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b806-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
