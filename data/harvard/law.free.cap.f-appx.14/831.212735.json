Pinkerton was sentenced to life, two concurrent twenty-five-year sentences, one concurrent five-year sentence, and one consecutive twenty-five year sentence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">In his motion, Pinkerton claims the portion of the written judgment and commitment order providing for a consecutive sentence contradicts the district court\u2019s alleged oral pronouncement that all sentences were to run concurrently with each other. We review the grant or denial of a Rule 36 motion for clear error. <em>United States v. Dickie, </em>752 F.2d 1398, 1400 (9th Cir.1984). Pinkerton failed to produce any evidence of his alleged discrepancy between the oral sentencing pronouncement and the written judgment. Our search of the record reveals none. We therefore have no basis to conclude that the district court clearly erred in denying Pinkerton\u2019s Rule 36 motion. <em>See Hill v. United States ex rel. Wampler, </em>298 U.S. 460, 464, 56 S.Ct. 760, 80 L.Ed. 1283 (1936) (explaining, \u201c[i]n any collateral inquiry, a court will close its ears to a suggestion that the sentence entered in the minutes is something other than the authentic expression of the sentence of the judge\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b860-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
