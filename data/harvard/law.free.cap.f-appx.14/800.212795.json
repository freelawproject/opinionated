Breyer, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b828-29\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-30\">Petitioner Derek Wayne Hughes was convicted of 14 counts of lewd acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>upon a child under the age of 14, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 288(a). Hughes petitioned for habeas relief on three grounds: (1) insufficient evidence; (2) videotaped interview in violation of due process and right to confrontation; and (3) admissibility of prior uncharged acts evidence. The District Court denied Hughes\u2019 habeas petition on the basis of procedural default, and subsequently granted a Certificate of Appealability (COA) for Hughes\u2019 claim regarding his right to confrontation. Because Hughes\u2019 petition cannot succeed on the merits, we need not address the question of procedural default. Additionally, our review is limited to the issue specified in the COA. <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Zuno-Arce, </em>209 F.3d 1095, 1102 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, this Court must uphold the state court\u2019s decision unless it \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">\u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause is not violated by admitting a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements, as long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination.\u201d <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). These requirements are satisfied even when the testifying declarant cannot remember the events relayed in the out-of court statements. <em>United States v. Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 559, 108 S.Ct. 838, 98 L.Ed.2d 951 (1988). Thus, the state court was not unreasonable in admitting the videotaped testimony despite the child witness\u2019s inability to remember the events she relayed in the videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">Finally, even if the child had not appeared in court to testify, the videotape evidence would have been admissible. Hearsay statements by children regarding sexual abuse may be admissible even when the child is unavailable, as long as the statements are supported by \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 816, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990). The witness\u2019s use of language unexpected of a child of similar age, and her lack of motive to fabricate support a finding that her testimony was trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b828-32\"> ThiS disposition is not appropriate for publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>cation and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
