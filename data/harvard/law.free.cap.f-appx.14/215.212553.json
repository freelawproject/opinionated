Collins noted a timely appeal and his counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he represents that there are no arguable issues of merit in this appeal. Nonetheless, in his brief, counsel addressed the possibility that the district court had committed reversible error in conducting Collins\u2019 Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing. Appellate counsel also suggested that the imposition of an enhanced sentence on the second firearms offense pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i) was in error. The time for filing a supplemental brief has passed and Collins has not responded, despite being advised of his right to do so. Because we find counsel\u2019s assignments of error to be without merit and can discern no other reversible error in the record on appeal, we affirm Collins\u2019 conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">On appeal, counsel identifies no specific error in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 hearing and our review of the record reveals none. The district court conducted a thorough hearing, insuring that Collins understood the rights that he would forego by pleading guilty, the elements of the charge to which he was pleading guilty, the penalties he faced, the effect of supervised release, and the impact of the. Sentencing Guidelines. Further, the court ascertained that Collins\u2019 plea was voluntary and that a factual basis existed for his plea. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11; <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116-17 (4th Cir.1991). Collins\u2019 substantial rights were adequately protected by the district court\u2019s proceedings. <em>See DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d at 117. With respect to Collins\u2019 suggestion that he was improperly sentenced under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i), that claim is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 132, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the entire record and all pertinent documents. We have considered all possible issues presented by this record and conclude that there are no non-frivolous grounds for this appeal. Pursuant to the plan adopted by the Fourth Circuit Judicial Council in implementation of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A (1994), this court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court for further review. If requested by the client to do so, counsel should prepare a timely petition for writ of certiorari, unless counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous. In that case, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">Collins\u2019 conviction and sentence are affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
