Jefferson appeals, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to support the \u00a7 924(c) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 854 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc), established the following. On December 8, 1997, a confidential informant arranged to make a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from Jefferson at the home of Jefferson\u2019s girlfriend, Beverly Tibbs. When Jefferson arrived, he had a handgun plainly visible, tucked into the waistband of his pants. Jefferson left the house to pick up the cocaine and when he returned, he placed the gun on the kitchen table and carried on a short discussion with Tibbs regarding the phone bill. He then sold to 'the informant a sixteenth of an ounce of crack cocaine for $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">To sustain a conviction under \u00a7 924(c), the Government must prove that the defendant: (1) used or carried a firearm and (2) did so during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 652 (4th Cir.1997). Jefferson was indicted and convicted only under the carry prong of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">This court has defined \u201ccarry\u201d as \u201cknowing possession and bearing, movement, conveyance, or transportation of the firearm in some manner.\u201d Id. at 653; <em>see also Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 139, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998). \u201cA firearm is carried \u2018in relation to\u2019 a drug trafficking offense if it has \u2018some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime\u2019 and if its presence was not \u2018the result of accident or coincidence.\u2019 ... The firearm must facilitate, or potentially facilitate, the drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d at 654 (quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">We find that there was ample evidence to support a finding that Jefferson \u201ccarried\u201d the weapon in relation to the drug deal. <em>See Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 146, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995) (carry prong applies \u201cwhen an offender keeps a gun hidden in' his clothing throughout a drug transaction\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 266 (4th Cir.2000) (\u201c[I]t is enough for \u00a7 924(c)(1) purposes if the firearm was present for protection or to embolden the actor.\u201d) (citing <em>Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d at 654).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Jefferson\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
