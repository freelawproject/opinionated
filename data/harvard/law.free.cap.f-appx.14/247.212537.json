(\u201cMorganite\u201d), alleging discrimination on the basis of race and/or national origin and disability, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1981 (West Supp.2000), and the American with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d). He now appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Morganite, granting Morganite\u2019s motion to strike, denying Gibbs\u2019 motion to amend, and dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-23\">This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). This Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the materials submitted in the joint appendices, and fully considered the arguments raised on appeal. We find that the district court\u2019s opinion is thorough and well-reasoned. We therefore affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Gibbs v. Morganite, Inc., </em>No. CA-99-309-5-BR2 (E.D.N.C. Oct. 6, 2000) (J.A. at 68-103). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
