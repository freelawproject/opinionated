We conclude that the District Court did not err. Although Yisrayl submitted numerous grievances, he did not present proof that he fully exhausted any of his claims. See <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 1825, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001) (\u00a7 1997e mandates exhaustion regardless of relief offered through administrative procedures).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Accordingly, we affirm, but we modify the judgment of the District Court to reflect that Yisrayl\u2019s claims are dismissed without prejudice to his right to refile if and when he exhausts as to these specific claims. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">We also deny Yisrayl\u2019s pending motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-15\">.
