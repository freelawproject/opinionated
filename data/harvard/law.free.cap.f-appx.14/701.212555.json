The district court dismissed the case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), and Byrd appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-22\">Byrd does not dispute that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies but submits that exhaustion would be futile because the prison\u2019s review procedure is \u201ctainted\u201d and because he is seeking only monetary damages. But as the Supreme Court held in <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001), an inmate seeking only money damages must exhaust administrative remedies even if the grievance process does not provide for monetary relief. And Byrd\u2019s contention that exhaustion is not required because the grievance procedure is \u201ctainted\u201d also fails \u2014 as we have said before, there is no futility exception to the exhaus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>tion requirement of \u00a7 1997e(a). <em>Massey v. Helman, </em>196 F.3d 727, 733 (7th Cir.1999); <em>Perez v. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>182 F.3d 532, 537 (7th Cir.1999). Our focus is on the availability, not the effectiveness, of administrative remedies, <em>see Massey, </em>196 F.3d at 733, and because an administrative review process is available to Byrd, he must exhaust that process even if he believes it to be deficient and regardless of what relief he seeks. <em>See Perez, </em>182 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Although we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Byrd\u2019s complaint, we disagree with the court\u2019s decision in one respect: because the Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>Booth </em>to resolve one of the questions presented by this case, we do not think that Byrd should have received a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) for bringing this suit prior to exhausting his administrative remedies. With this modification the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
