Syrus was terminated after she violated her employer\u2019s policies several times during her ninety-day probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-23\">We agree with the District Court that Ms. Syrus\u2019s claims of religious and disability discrimination were barred because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as to both claims. See <em>Williams v. Little Rock Mun. Water Works, </em>21 F.3d 218, 222-23 (8th Cir.1994) (prior to filing federal lawsuit, Title VII plaintiff must exhaust administrative remedies by filing timely EEOC charge and receiving notice of right to sue; plaintiff will be deemed to have exhausted administrative remedies as to allegations that are like or reasonably related to substance of charge). As to the race discrimination claim, which was administratively exhausted, we see nothing in the record tending to show that Harbor-view\u2019s legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Ms. Syrus was pretextual. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Thus, the District Court properly rejected this claim on its merits. See <em>Rose-Maston v. NME Hosps., Inc., </em>133 F.3d 1104, 1108-09 (8th Cir.1998). The Court also did not abuse its discretion in refusing to appoint counsel. See <em>Stevens v. Redwing, </em>146 F.3d 538, 546 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review; relevant factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Accordingly, we affirm. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-17\">. The Honorable Robert T.
