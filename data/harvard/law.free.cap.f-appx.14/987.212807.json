Brambila-Sanchez claims that the full forfeiture would violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment and that the district court did not make necessary factual findings. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we agree that the district court did not make sufficient factual findings in order to apply the \u201cgrossly disproportional\u201d test. Therefore, we vacate the forfeiture order and remand for further proceedings in accordance with our instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">We must consider whether Brambila-Sanchez\u2019s forfeiture is excessive under the test established by <em>United States v. </em>Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998). Under the <em>Bajakajian </em>test, \u201ca punitive forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant\u2019s offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334, 118 S.Ct. 2028. In <em>Bajakajian, </em>the Supreme Court held that the criminal forfeiture of $357,144, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(a)(1) and 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5316, violated the Excessive Fines Clause where the defendant\u2019s criminal violation was \u201cunrelated to any other illegal activities\u201d and the money subject to forfeiture was not the proceeds of illegal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 338-40, 118 S.Ct. 2028.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">In deciding whether the forfeiture before it was grossly disproportional to the offense, the <em>Bajakajian </em>Court considered the nature and extent of the criminal activity, its relation to other crimes, its penalties, and the harm it caused. <em>Id. </em>at 337-41, 118 S.Ct. 2028. The Court recognized that the crime at issue was \u201csolely a reporting offense\u201d and that transporting the currency out of the country is lawful as long as it is reported. <em>Id. </em>at 337, 118 S.Ct. 2028. The Court also emphasized that the reporting offense was unrelated to any other illegal activities\u2014the currency was produced by and used for legal activities. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 118 S.Ct. 2028.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">Although it recognized that the maximum statutory penalty of a $250,000 fine and five years\u2019 imprisonment was \u201ccertainly relevant evidence\u201d of the offense\u2019s gravity, the Court determined that the maximum sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, a $5,000 fine and six months\u2019 imprisonment, confirmed a \u201cminimal level of culpability .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338-39, 118 S.Ct. 2028. Finally, the Court considered that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>the harm caused by the offense was minimal, affecting the Government in a relatively minor way and with no loss to the public fisc, because the Government would have been deprived only of the information that the currency had left the country if the crime had gone undetected. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 118 S.Ct. 2028.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Here, the district court made no finding as to whether the currency involved was related to or obtained from other illegal activities. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s findings of fact are insufficient to determine whether the forfeiture was \u201cgrossly disproportional\u201d to the gravity of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. $273,969.04. U.S. Currency, </em>164 F.3d 462, 466 (9th Cir. 1999), where the district court had made no finding as to whether the currency was illegally acquired or intended for illicit purposes, we remanded to allow the court to make additional findings in order to determine whether the amount of the forfeiture was grossly disproportional to the gravity of the reporting offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Therefore, we vacate the forfeiture order of Brambila-Sanchez\u2019s currency and remand to allow the district court to determine whether the amount of the forfeiture is grossly disproportional to the gravity of Brambila-Sanchez\u2019s offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
