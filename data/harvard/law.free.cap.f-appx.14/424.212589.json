This court has already held that the Commissioner lacks such authority. <em>See Dixie Fuel Co. v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>171 F.3d 1052 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Recognizing that <em>Dixie Fuel </em>controls our disposition of this case, the government explicitly (and the trustees implicitly) concedes that this panel must affirm the district court\u2019s decision to declare all initial assignments made after October 1, 1993, null and void. We agree. \u201c[A] subsequent panel of this circuit court is powerless to revisit, modify, amend, abrogate, supersede, set aside, vacate, avoid, nullify, rescind, overrule, or reverse any prior Sixth Circuit panel\u2019s published precedential ruling of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunlap, </em>209 F.3d 472, 481 (6th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>6th Cir. R. 206(c) (\u201cCourt en banc consideration is required to overrule a published opinion of the court.\u201d). Our decision in <em>Dixie Fuel </em>thus controls until and unless \u201can inconsistent decision of the United States Supreme Court requires modification of the decision or this Court sitting en banc overrules the prior decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>73 F.3d 1414, 1418 (6th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Salmi v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the basis of our prior opinion in <em>Dixie Fuel.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
