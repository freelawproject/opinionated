The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b31-22\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed July 24, 2000, be affirmed. To succeed on his Eighth Amendment claim, appellant must show that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference. <em>See Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 296-303, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). Deliberate indifference requires that the prison official \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). The allegations in appellant\u2019s complaint indicate that prison officials took prompt good faith remedial measures after learning of a potential risk caused by a product prepared by a third party. <em>See generally Scott v. District of Columbia, </em>139 F.3d 940, 944 (D.C.Cir.1998) (where prison officials made good-faith attempt to enforce prison nonsmoking policy, imperfect enforcement did not demonstrate deliberate indifference); <em>cf. George v. King, </em>837 F.2d 705, 707 (5th Cir.1988) (deliberate indifference could be shown if \u201cprisoners regularly and frequently suffer from food poisoning with truly serious medical complications as a result of particular, known unsanitary practices which are customarily followed by the prison food service organization, and the authorities without arguable justification refuse to attempt remedial measures\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AIS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Therefore, the district court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because it \u201cappears beyond doubt\u201d that appellant \u201ccan prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). Appellant does not challenge the district court\u2019s refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
