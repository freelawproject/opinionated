Mr. Islam argues the BIA ignored evidence that would have sustained his burden of proof that he suffered past persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>tion and had a well-founded fear of future persecution. Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record as a whole supports the BIA\u2019s determinations that Mr. Islam failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of any statutorily protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (refugee is alien unwilling to return to home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d); <em>Feleke v. INS, </em>118 F.3d 594, 597-98 (8th Cir.1997) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Specifically, we conclude that an isolated incident \u2014 Mr. Islam was allegedly removed from his vehicle by a student faction of a political party to which he did not belong, but was not physically harmed\u2014 did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Ramos-Vasquez v. INS, </em>57 F.3d 857, 861 (9th Cir.1995) (allegations of isolated violence are insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">We also find Mr. Islam\u2019s fear of future persecution not objectively reasonable. <em>See Feleke, </em>118 F.3d at 598 (well-founded fear must be subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable). First, he provided no evidence \u2014 nor did he even argue \u2014 that he was harmed during the one-year period he remained in his family\u2019s apartment after the alleged persecution against himself and his father, both of whom belong to a minority political party in Bangladesh. <em>See Safaie v. INS, </em>25 F.3d 636, 640-41 (8th Cir.1994) (by remaining without incident in home country after alleged persecution, alien undercut her well-founded-fear claim). Second, Mr. Islam\u2019s father has remained unharmed in Bangladesh, where he operates a large business and is politically active. <em>See Manivong v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 432, 433 (8th Cir.1999) (fact that relatives still reside in country without incident undermines reasonableness of alien\u2019s fear). Third, the Immigration and Naturalization Service submitted an uncontradicted 1996 United States Department of State \u201cProfile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions,\u201d which showed that Bangladesh\u2019s political climate has improved since the political party that allegedly persecuted Mr. Islam and his father lost power in June of 1996. <em>See Cigaran v. Heston, </em>159 F.3d 355, 358 (8th Cir.1998) (relying on State Department\u2019s profile to conclude that alien\u2019s fear of future persecution on political grounds was unreasonable); <em>In re T-M-B, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 775 (BIA 1997) (en banc) (State Department profile, in absence of contradictory evidence, is entitled to considerable deference).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Because substantial evidence supports the denial of asylum, we also affirm the denial of withholding of deportation. <em>See Safaie, </em>25 F.3d at 640 (standard for withholding of deportation is more stringent than well-founded-fear standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996), <em>amended by </em>Act of Oct. 11, 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-302, 110 Stat. 3656, repealed 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a (1994) and replaced it with a new judicial review provision codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 306. As the new provision does not apply to deportation proceedings that commenced before April 1, 1997, this court continues to have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
