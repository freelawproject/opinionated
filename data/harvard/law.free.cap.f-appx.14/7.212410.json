Zarrilli appeals from a decision by the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d) affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of certain motions he filed in two bankruptcy proceedings. In its decision, the BAP concluded that the doctrine of res judicata barred Zarrilli\u2019s claims. We affirm, essentially for the reasons given by the BAP in its decision dated April 19, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In the present appeal, Zarrilli disputes the BAP\u2019s ruling in only one pertinent respect. He suggests that rulings by this court in a prior appeal were not decisions \u201con the merits\u201d for res judicata purposes because the rulings failed to adequately explain the court\u2019s adverse decision. We find this claim meritless. The rulings in question did explain the decision reached by the court, and, in any event, a court\u2019s failure to explain a decision does not mean that the decision is not \u201con the merits.\u201d <em>See </em>C. Wright, A. Miller <em>&amp; </em>E. Cooper, 18 <em>Fed. Prac &amp; Proc. </em>\u00a7 4435, at 348 (2001 Supp.) (\u201cFinally, it should be clear that a decision may be \u2018on the merits\u2019 even though it is reached without opinion or other explanation.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
