S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-20\">The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) sufficiently addressed Petitioner\u2019s assignments of error. It also stated the specific grounds for its decision which enables us to conduct our review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to Petitioner\u2019s argument, the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cme[t] the minimum standards for articulating reasons for denying relief\u2019 and was not an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-21\">Moreover, there was substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioner had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution and thus was not eligible for asylum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Most importantly, Petitioner failed to address the opinion letter from the Department of State, which details the changed country conditions in Bulgaria.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, there was evidence that Petitioner had earned financial success in his career as a ship\u2019s captain in the Bulgarian merchant marine, that Bulgarian authorities never disturbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>his family, and that he had no difficulty traveling out of Bulgaria. In light of this evidence, Petitioner\u2019s testimony concerning his fears that the hard-line communists know of his assistance to the Movement for Protection of People Rights and Freedom and his contacts with ethnic Turks and that these hard-line communists are still in power does not compel the conclusion that he has a well-founded fear of persecution if he returns to Bulgaria.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Accordingly, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b979-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-11\">. <em>See Castillo v.

We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum. <em>Lopez-Galarza v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 954, 958 (9th Cir.1996). Under the substantial evidence standard, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s determination if it has made no error in law and if its factual findings are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b979-23\">.

Thus, we are without jurisdiction to address this claim. <em>Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906, 908 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
