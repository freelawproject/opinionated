The falsehoods were not the result of any confusion, mistake or faulty memory, <em>United States v. Monzon-Valenzuela, </em>186 F.3d 1181, 1183 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993)), but rather were willful and material. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>173 F.3d 1192, 1205 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\">However, the district court did abuse its discretion in departing upward by increasing Schweitzer\u2019s offense level by two points on the stated basis that the criminal history calculation in the PreSentence Report under-represented Schweitzer\u2019s criminal history. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3. The district court improperly increased Schweitzer\u2019s offense level, instead of increasing his criminal history category, <em>see United States v. Connelly, </em>156 F.3d 978, 983 (9th Cir.1998), and failed to refer to specific instances of past criminal conduct justifying any increase. <em>United States v. Green, </em>105 F.3d 1321, 1322 (9th Cir.1997) (sentencing court\u2019s rationale to depart must be \u201csufficiently specific ... to allow appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b861-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
