We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The causal nexus between Stepper\u2019s injury and the Shipyard\u2019s discriminatory conduct was too attenuated to merit compensatory damages of this type. The relevant statutory and regulatory provisions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, in conjunction with our prior case law, do not justify the awarding of lost future earnings under Stepper\u2019s theory of \u201cbut for\u201d causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Although Stepper successfully represented herself at the administrative hearing on her initial claim of sex discrimination, she did not prevail in any of her subsequent claims for compensatory damages while represented by counsel. She is not a prevailing party. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b888-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
