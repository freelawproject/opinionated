Hamric filed his claim for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994). Because he was challenging his sentence, the district court construed his action as a 28 U.S.C.A \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2000) motion and denied relief on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction. Hamric seeks to challenge the validity of his drug conspiracy conviction under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>580 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Even if <em>Apprendi </em>claims are cognizable under \u00a7 2241, Hamric\u2019s eighty month sentence for conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 846 (West 1999) does not violate <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 515, 516 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc) (finding no <em>Apprendi </em>error where sentence for conspiracy to commit a drug offense involving unspecified drug quantity was under twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>years). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief without prejudice. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
