McClellan, </em>95 CV 2412(NG) (June 19, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In May 1991, Wakefield was indicted in Nassau County Court for sexual assault in two separate incidents involving two separate victims. In June 1992, after a jury trial, Wakefield was convicted on two counts each of rape in the first degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.35[1] and sodomy in the first degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.50[1]. After exhausting his state court remedies, Wake-field filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in United States District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1992). In his petition, Wakefield alleges that his due process rights to a fair trial and an impartial jury were violated when the state trial court allowed the jury to continue deliberating and to render a verdict after the jury reported that the foreperson had told the other jurors of a rumor he heard which suggested that Wakefield had been previously convicted of rape. In its opinion and order, the district court concluded that \u201cpetitioner has failed to show that the state court\u2019s conclusion with respect to the jurors\u2019 ability to deliberate in an impartial manner is incorrect. The trial court\u2019s factual determination is entitled to deference, and the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is <em>denied.\u201d Wakefield, </em>at 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo. <em>Cruz v. Artuz, </em>133 F.3d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We affirm for substantially the same reasons as set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion and order. <em>See Wakefield, </em>at 14-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
