Because we do not have jurisdiction to consider Schetzer\u2019s appeal, we dismiss. Although Schetzer filed his notice of appeal with this court within 90 days of the tax court\u2019s decision, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure required Schetzer to file his notice of appeal with the tax court clerk and do not make an exception for tax court appeals mistakenly filed with this court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 13(a)(1), 14; <em>cf. </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(d). Although the government takes a different view, we do not believe 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 cures the jurisdictional defect in this case. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 610 (as used in \u00a7 1631, term \u201ccourts\u201d applies only to courts of appeal, district courts, and certain other courts; it does not apply to tax courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-21\">We thus dismiss Schetzer\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction and deny his pending motion as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
