We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">The District Court dismissed Koch\u2019s claims of discrimination involving incidents before December 1994, noting that Koch\u2019s attorney had conceded the claims were time-barred. The Court did not err, because Koch is bound by her counsel\u2019s concession below that these claims are barred. See <em>Link v. Wabash R., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633-34, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (client bound by acts of attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-17\">The District Court granted summary judgment for USPS on Koch\u2019s claim that she was subjected to retaliation for Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaints. This, too, was proper. USPS submitted evidence showing that Koch had threatened her supervisor after her supervisor denied her requested leave, that she had failed to report back to work on time, and that she was suspended and later terminated after failing to attend a mandatory fitness-for-duty examination. Koch did not offer evidence showing that these legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for her suspension and termination were a pretext for retaliation. See <em>Rose-Maston v. NME Hosp., Inc., </em>133 F.3d 1104, 1108-09 (8th Cir.1998); <em>Scrog-gins v. Univ. of Minnesota, </em>221 F.3d 1042, 1045 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">Accordingly, we affirm. We also deny Koch\u2019s pending motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-14\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
