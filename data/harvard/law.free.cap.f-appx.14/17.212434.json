Hiltz appeals from the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Hiltz moved to withdraw his plea prior to sentencing. Therefore, the court was permitted to grant the motion for \u201cany fair and just reason.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e). In reviewing plea withdrawal rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ings, this court \u201caccord[s] considerable deference to the firsthand assessment ultimately made by the district court, which must be affirmed absent a demonstrable abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Marrero-Rivera, </em>124 F.3d 342, 348 (1st Cir.1997). In particular, \u201cthe factfinding underlying the plea withdrawal ruling may not be set aside for anything less than \u2018clear error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347. Because we conclude that the district court\u2019s determination that the .plea was knowing and voluntary was neither clear error nor an abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Hiltz pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and multiple counts of trafficking in counterfeit goods, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320. He entered his plea, pursuant to a written plea agreement, after seven days of jury trial. Represented by new counsel, he filed his motion to withdraw his guilty plea after the presentence report was issued, but before sentencing. The district court held a hearing and Hiltz submitted affidavits in support of the motion. He did not request an evidentiary hearing and none was held. The court considered the affidavits and rejected Hiltz\u2019 claims that he did not understand the charges against him and that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel which invalidated his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">On appeal, Hiltz argues that: 1) his plea violated core concerns of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 because Hiltz did not understand the charges to which he was pleading guilty and 2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney misinformed him about the sentencing consequences of his plea and pressured him to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">II. <em>Understanding of the Charges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">In his brief on appeal, Hiltz makes only vague references to his claim that he did not understand the charges against him. He does not identify the specific elements of the charges that he did not understand. Having failed to make a developed argument on appeal, Hiltz has waived this issue. <em>See United States v. Zannino, </em>895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Even if he had not waived the argument, however, it would not entitle him to relief. In his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, Hiltz argued that he pled guilty without an understanding of the charges against him. In his affidavit accompanying that motion, he stated that when he pled guilty he was \u201cconfused, and did not have any understanding as to what it was I was pleading guilty to.\u201d More specifically, he recounted that at the change-of-plea hearing he denied that he had conspired with Mr. Leppo and that he had \u201cknowingly\u201d trafficked in counterfeit goods. Hiltz stated in his affidavit that he now understands that \u201cthe government would be required to prove that at the time I took the actions set forth in the indictment I knew and intended to commit a crime. I had no such knowledge or intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">The district court, in its Memorandum and Order of June 16, 2000, denying Hiltz\u2019 motion to withdraw his plea, found that \u201cthe plea colloquy met the requirements of Rule 11,\u201d that the court had \u201caddressed the three core concerns underlying the rule\u201d and that \u201cHiltz plainly, and on the record, plead to the facts as outlined.\u201d We agree. The record, including the transcript of the change-of-plea hearing, supports those conclusions. \u201c[W]here the prosecutor\u2019s statement or the defendant\u2019s description of the facts sets forth all elements of the offense and the conduct of the defendant that constitutes the offense, \u2018the defendant\u2019s admission that the allegations are true is sufficient evidence that he understands the charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cotal-Crespo, </em>47 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1995). That was the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Although Hiltz initially denied that he conspired with Andrew Leppo, he admitted that he obtained the counterfeit packaging from Mr. Leppo and that he conferred with Mr. Leppo about how the invoices should read and on matters of \u201cquality control.\u201d Those admissions demonstrate Hiltz\u2019 understanding of the charges that he conspired with Mr. Leppo. Hiltz admitted that he was guilty \u201cat the minimum\u201d of \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d That satisfies the knowledge requirement under \u00a7 2320. <em>See </em>130 Cong. Rec. 31,-674 (1984) (Joint Statement on Trademark Counterfeiting Legislation). Hiltz claims in his affidavit that he was unaware of the requirement that the government prove that Hiltz knew that his conduct was a crime. There is no such requirement under \u00a7 2320, however. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>807 F.2d 427, 428 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">III. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u201c[T]he two-part <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). The first part of the test requires a showing that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The second part of the test, in the context of guilty pleas, requires a defendant to show that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u201cWe do not normally consider ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Natanel, </em>938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.1991). However, this case seems to fall within the following exception to that rule: \u201cwhere the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of an ineffective assistance claim, an appellate court may dispense with the usual praxis and determine the merits of such a contention on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Hiltz\u2019 primary claim of ineffective assistance is that his attorney misrepresented that, although the plea agreement precluded him from arguing for a downward departure from the guideline imprisonment range, he could still argue for a downward departure. Based upon its review of the submitted affidavits and its familiarity with the parties and the case, the district court concluded that counsel\u2019s statements regarding the effect of the plea agreement on Hiltz\u2019 ability to argue for a downward departure did not constitute a misrepresentation on which Hiltz relied in deciding to plead guilty. On this record, there is no basis for concluding that that determination by the district court was clearly erroneous or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Similarly, the record also provides no grounds for overturning the district court\u2019s rejection of Hiltz\u2019 claim that his attorney told him that he was not prepared to continue with the case. The court was entitled to rely upon its observation of Hiltz\u2019 performance during the trial and at the change of plea hearing and on Hiltz\u2019 statements at the change of plea hearing that he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s representation and that no one had pressured him \u201cin any way\u201d to plead guilty. <em>See Marrero-Rivera, </em>124 F.3d at 349. Nor did the district court err in rejecting Hiltz\u2019 argument that his attorney\u2019s allegedly inaccurate description of the leniency he would receive at sentencing if he pled guilty invalidated the plea. <em>See id. </em>Finally, counsel\u2019s alleged attempt to persuade Hiltz to plead guilty did not rise to the level of coercion. An attorney\u2019s mere attempt to persuade his client that a guilty plea is in his best interest does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>invalidate the plea. <em>See, e.g., Miles v. Dorsey, </em>61 F.3d 1459, 1470 (10th Cir.1995); <em>Williams v. Chrans, </em>945 F.2d 926, 933 (7th Cir.1991); <em>Lunz v. Henderson, </em>533 F.2d 1322, 1377 (2d Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed. See </em>Loc. R. 27(c). The motion for release pending appeal is <em>denied as moot.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
