This appeal was held in abeyance pending decisions by the Supreme Court in <em>Lopez v. Davis, </em>No. 99-7504, and by this court in <em>Powell v. Thoms, </em>No. 99-5974. These cases have now been decided. <em>See Lopez v. Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 121 S.Ct. 714, 718, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001); <em>Powell v. Thoms, </em>No. 99-5974 (6th Cir. April 5, 2001) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-28\">In <em>Powell, </em>the court noted that the petitioner had been released from custody, so the case was now moot. In this case, the home address for Bobby Altwon Hart re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>fleets that he, too, has been released from custody. Therefore, his appeal is also moot. In this situation, the proper procedure is to vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and to remand the case to the district court with directions to dismiss the petition as moot. <em>United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 39-40, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to dismiss the petition as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
