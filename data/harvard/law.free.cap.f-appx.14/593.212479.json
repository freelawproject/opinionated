Perkins (\u201cPerkins\u201d) applied for and was denied disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) and Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits under the Social Security Act (\u201cSSA\u201d). Perkins seeks a remand pursuant to sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) based on new and material evidence. The district court affirmed the decision by the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denying all benefits to Perkins. In his appeal to this court, Perkins contends that the new evidence submitted to the Commissioner\u2019s Appeals Council meets the statutory requirements for sentence six remand and that the District Court\u2019s rationale for denying sentence six remand was legally erroneous. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b621-23\">A. Medical History</p>\n<p id=\"b621-24\">At the time of his application, Perkins was thirty seven years old and had an eleventh grade education. (TR 89, 111; TR Findings 7, 8). He could no longer perform his past work as a carpenter. (TR 111, TR 30, Finding 6). Perkins alleged that he could no longer work due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>deterioration of his right knee and two degenerative discs in his lower back. (TR 107).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Medical evidence available to the ALJ shows that Perkins\u2019s treating general practice physician, Dr. Joel Perkerson (\u201cDr.Perkerson\u201d), saw Perkins on June 5, 1996, \u201cbasically because he wanted to apply for disability.\u201d (TR 276). At that time, Dr. Perkerson noted that Perkins appeared to suffer from some fairly significant problems, but did not know if he should apply for disability. (TR 276). On June 19, 1996, Perkins\u2019s back was \u201csubjectively tender.\u201d (TR 275). A June 26, 1996 MRI showed degenerative disc disease at L4-5 and prominent posterior bulging annulus fibrosis, or more likely a small ligamentous herniation of nuclear material. (TR 277). Dr. Perkerson referred Perkins to a specialist. (TR 275).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Perkins complained of pain and swelling in his right knee on July 14, 1996. (TR 144). The x-rays showed marked degenerative changes predominantly involving the lateral compartment and large joint effusion, but no definite bone abnormality. (TR 148). Neurosurgeon William Reid. (\u201cDr. Reid\u201d) examined Perkins on July 17, 1996 for his complaints of pain in his right knee and lower back. (TR 150). An MRI of Perkins\u2019s back showed mild degenerative changes at the L4-5 level with a mild degree of facet hypertrophy and lateral recess stenosis. (TR 150). It was Dr. Reid\u2019s opinion that the MRI did not show any significant stenosis or herniation. (TR 150). Dr. Reid told Perkins there was no need for surgery and suggested physical therapy and non-narcotic analgesics for pain control. (TR 151).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Dr. Stephen Natelson (\u201cDr. Natelson\u201d), also a neurosurgeon, examined Perkins on July 24, 1996. (TR 158). Dr. Natelson\u2019s clinical examination revealed that both of Perkins\u2019s knees looked extremely arthritic and had a diminished range of motion. (TR 158). Perkins\u2019s right calf was about three centimeters smaller than the left. (TR 158). Rotation of Perkins\u2019s right hip was painful. (TR 158). Perkins\u2019s sensory and motor function and his reflexes and coordination were normal. (TR 158). Dr. Natelson reviewed the MRI and noted that it \u201callegedly\u201d showed spinal stenosis, but he could not confirm this diagnosis. (TR 158). Dr. Natelson recommended a myelogram, bone scan, and x-rays. (TR 159). He did not give Perkins any medication. (TR 159).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The x-rays Dr. Natelson ordered showed that neither of Perkins\u2019s hips were fractured. (TR 160-161). There was no acute bony destruction and the joint space was maintained. (TR 160-161). A CT scan of Perkins\u2019s lumbar spine showed mild degenerative changes in the facet joints at L4-5 and L5-S1. (TR 162). There was no disc herniation. (TR 162). A CT scan of Perkins\u2019s cervical spine showed focal left vertebral spur and left paracentral disc protrusion at C4-5. (TR 163). It was Dr. Natelson\u2019s opinion that the lumbar myelogram was essentially normal and the cervical myelogram showed some spondylosis with a bulge at C4-5. (TR 168).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Dr. Natelson examined Perkins on August 5, 1996 when he complained of pain in his left arm. (TR 168). Dr. Natelson ordered an MRI to investigate the problem. (TR 168). The MRI was normal. (TR 167, 180). An August 14, 1996 myelogram showed an epidural defect at C4-5 which may have increased in severity since the previous study. (TR 182). A postmyelogram CT scan showed some mild degenerative change at C5-6 but was otherwise unremarkable. (TR 183).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">When Perkins returned to Dr. Natelson on September 4, 1996, Perkins was using his left arm \u201cfor everything.\u201d (TR 166). His reflexes and strength were normal. (TR 166).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Perkins visited the emergency room on September 23, 1996, complaining that he was out of pain medication and his doctor was out of town. (TR 199). Dr. Natelson examined Perkins on October 9, 1996 and noted that he was using his arm normally. (TR 291). Dr. Natelson noted that Perkins continued to complain about how much pain he experienced, but Dr. Natelson thought that was \u201cjust his personality.\u201d (TR 291). Dr. Natelson was to see Perkins only on an as-needed basis. (TR 291).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Dr. Natelson saw Perkins again on January 6, 1997, and noted that Perkins told him his neck and arm were better. (TR 291). Perkins complained of low back pain without any significant radiation. (TR 291). Dr. Natelson ordered an MRI, but noted that the neurological examination was unremarkable. (TR 291). The MRI showed a slight bulge at L4-5, but was otherwise normal. (TR 299). Dr. Natelson recommended that Perkins be gradually removed from his pain medication. (TR 291). Additionally, Dr. Natelson ordered a series of physical therapy treatments, but Perkins refused to cooperate. (TR 234).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Perkins\u2019s medical history constitutes the focal point of his appeal from the denial of Social Security benefits. The record reveals that Dr. Paul Gurecki (\u201cDr. Gurecki\u201d) had treated Perkins for seizures, but did not see any indication that Perkins was disabled from that well-controlled problem as long as he did not work in extremely dangerous places or with extremely dangerous equipment. (TR 244). Dr. Gurecki also treated Perkins for migraine or muscle contraction headaches but, again, did not find them disabling. (TR 244). Dr. Gurecki summarized that, from a neurological standpoint, he did not find any indication \u201cfor a total and permanent disability of any sort in [Perkins].\u201d (TR 245).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Dr. McMahon examined Perkins on July 11, 1997, and made the following observations: \u201c[He] is doing excellent with the right knee. He is having no real pain at all. He is very pleased with how he is doing. His knee is very stable. He has a good range of motion.\u201d (TR 299). Dr. McMahon released Perkins from his care without suggesting any limitations. (TR 299).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">State Agency Medical Consultant Mona Mishu reviewed the medical evidence on December 16, 1996, and was of the opinion Perkins could perform a reduced range of light work. (TR 217-224).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Mishu considered the fact that Perkins had arthritis and had undergone a total replacement of his right knee in October 1996. (TR 218).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">The ALJ considered the evidence of record and found that Perkins had the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with a sit/stand option. (TR 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Finding 5). The ALJ also found that Perkins was unable to perform frequent postural activities, to reach or grasp heavy objects with his left hand, or to work at unprotected heights or around moving machinery, and had a limited but satisfactory ability to use judgment, deal with job stresses, maintain attention and concentration, demonstrate reliability, and understand, remember, and carry out detailed or complex job instructions. (TR 30, Finding 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Nearly one year after the ALJ issued his September 22, 1997 decision, Perkins submitted evidence directly to the Appeals Council. (TR 13-14, 316-36). This evidence included medical records from Dr. Bertram Henry covering the period between February 17, 1998 through July 23, 1998, and a letter and functional assessment from Dr. Perkerson dated June 3, 1998. (TR 316-36). The Appeals Council considered this post-decision evidence and concluded that the additional evidence did not provide a basis for altering the ALJ\u2019s decision. (TR 10). The Appeals Council denied Perkins\u2019s request for review. (TR 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Perkins brought an appeal in District Court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and brings this appeal to this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation to grant Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Magistrate Judge found that the Commissioner had the benefit of Dr. Perkerson\u2019s opinion of disability at the time of the ALJ decision, properly rejected it, and could \u201cnot find anything in Dr. Perkerson\u2019s new assessment that would persuade the ALJ/Commissioner to give it any more weight than was previously given.\u201d Consequently, the Magistrate Judge found the Dr. Perkerson medical assessment form not material, and denied remand. R <em>&amp; </em>R at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Perkins objected to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, arguing only that the post-decision evidence warranted a sentence six remand. R. 18: Objections. The District Judge considered Perkins\u2019s argument but agreed with the magistrate judge. R. 19: Memorandum and Order at 2. Consequently, the District Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision that Perkins was not disabled and denied Perkins\u2019s request to remand the case pursuant to sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Perkins filed applications for a period of disability, DIB, and SSI on July 17, 1996, claiming a disability onset date beginning May 15, 1996. (TR 89-92, 302-304). After initial and reconsideration denials, (TR 71-76, 79-80, 306-311, 314-315), a hearing was held before an ALJ on September 10, 1997. (TR 42-64). This hearing resulted in a September 22, 1997 decision unfavorable to Perkins. (TR 20-31). Perkins requested administrative review and submitted evidence to the Appeals Council that was not available to the ALJ. (TR 12-14). The Appeals Council considered the post-decision evidence but concluded that it did not provide a basis for changing the ALJ\u2019s decision. (TR 10-11). The Appeals Council declined to review the case, and the ALJ\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Commissioner. (TR 10-11).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Perkins appealed to the District Court and sought judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. R. 1: Complaint. The matter was referred to United States Magistrate Judge Robert P. Murrian, who considered the evidence and the parties\u2019 arguments, and on March 27, 2000 issued a Report and Recommendation finding the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. R. 17: Report and Recommendation. Perkins objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, arguing only that evidence not available to the ALJ, specifically, a letter and medical assessment from Perkins\u2019s treating physician and treatment notes from Baptist Hospital of East Tennessee, was new and material, and warranted a remand pursuant to sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). R. 18, R. 19. On April 26, 2000, the District Judge affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision finding that Perkins was not disabled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">A. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), the ALJ\u2019s findings are conclusive so long as they are supported by substantial evidence. This court\u2019s review \u201cis limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the findings.\u201d <em>Duncan v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>801 F.2d 847, 851 (6th Cir.1986). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 means more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kirk v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>667 F.2d 524, 535 (6th Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). Furthermore, this Court must defer to an agency\u2019s decision \u201ceven if there is substantial evidence in the record that would have supported an opposite conclusion, so long as substantial evidence supports the conclusion reached by the ALJ.\u201d <em>Key v. Callahan, </em>109 F.3d 270, 273 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">It is not the role of this Court to resolve conflicting evidence in the record or to examine the credibility of the appellant\u2019s testimony. <em>See Gaffney v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 98, 100 (6th Cir.1987) (per curiam). This Court\u2019s inquiry instead focuses on whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s failure to find claimant disabled and therefore eligible for SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">B. Legal framework for disability claims</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">A person is considered disabled under the Social Security Act \u201cif he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">an individual shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(B). The burden lies with the claimant to prove that he is disabled. <em>See Casey v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>987 F.2d 1230, 1233 (6th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">The regulations outline a five-step analysis for evaluating disability claims. 20 C. F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. Under the fourth step, the Commissioner determines whether a claimant is capable of performing past relevant work. This step provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-16\">If we cannot make a decision based on your current work activity or on medical facts alone, and you have a severe impairments), we then review your residual functional capacity and the physical and mental demands of the work you have done in the past. If you can still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>do this kind of work, we will find that you are not disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">C. The United States District Judge did not abuse his discretion when he found that evidence not before the ALJ was not new and material and accordingly did not warrant remand pursuant to the sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Perkins contends that medical reports and opinions presented to the Appeals Council on September 9, 1998, nearly one year after the ALJ made his decision, warrant remand. Specifically, Perkins argues that a letter and a functional assessment written by Dr. Perkerson, both dated June 3, 1998, probably would have changed the ALJ\u2019s September 22, 1997 decision if the ALJ had seen them. For the reasons set forth herein, Perkins\u2019s argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Evidence which was not available to the ALJ cannot be considered by the court in its substantial evidence review, but may be considered only as a possible basis for remand under sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Cline v. Commissioner of Social Security, </em>96 F.3d 146 (6th Cir.1996); <em>Cotton v. Sullivan, </em>2 F.3d 692, 695-696 (6th Cir.1993); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.955, 416.1455 (1999). A remand is possible only if Perkins demonstrates that the evidence is new and material, and that good cause exists for his failure to introduce the evidence at the administrative level. <em>See Willis v. Secy, of Health and Human Servs., </em>727 F.2d 551, 553 (6th Cir.1984). The party seeking remand bears the burden of showing it is proper. <em>See Sizemore v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>865 F.2d 709, 711 (6th Cir.1988); <em>Oliver v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>804 F.2d 964, 966 (6th Cir.1986). In this case, Perkins has not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">Perkins has not demonstrated good cause for his failure to introduce Dr. Perkerson\u2019s report and assessment in a timely manner. <em>Oliver, </em>804 F.2d at 966.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The mere fact that the evidence at issue was not created until nine months after the ALJ\u2019s decision and was not submitted to the Appeals Council until nearly a year after the ALJ\u2019s decision does not establish good cause. This Court takes a harder line: Perkins must establish good cause for his failure to obtain the evidence prior to the hearing. <em>Id. </em>Perkins attempts, unsuccessfully, to blame Dr. Perkerson for his failure to provide the evidence in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>timely fashion. <em>(See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 13-14).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Perkins further asserts that his attorney asked Dr. Perkerson to provide an assessment seven months prior to the hearing and left the decision to Dr. Perkerson after making the request. <em>(See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 13). Dr. Perkerson, however, did not have any interest in the outcome of this case. Perkins is responsible for providing evidence to establish his disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1512(a), 416.912(a)(1999); <em>See McCoy v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 44, 47 (6th Cir.1995). Perkins\u2019s attorney reviewed the evidence available at the hearing and did not suggest that additional information was expected from Dr. Perkerson or that such information was necessary to the adjudication of Perkins\u2019s disability claim. (TR 44-45).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Perkins argues that if Dr. Perkerson did not voluntarily complete an assessment by the time of the ALJ hearing \u201cthere was no other way to obtain one.\u201d <em>(See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 15). Actually, when it is reasonably necessary for the full presentation of a case, an ALJ can subpoena the appearance of a witness. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.950(d), 416.1450(d) (1999); <em>See Calvin v. Chater, </em>73 F.3d 87, 89 (6th Cir.1996). The ALJ found there was adequate information in the record, including Dr. Perkerson\u2019s discounted opinion, and did not find it necessary for the Commissioner to request additional information. Perkins, however, was free to inform the ALJ that Dr. Perkerson was not responsive to his plea for an assessment and request a subpoena for his appearance and failed to do so. Thus, Perkins has not established \u201cgood cause\u201d and remand is precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">Moreover, even if good cause existed for his failure to introduce Dr. Perkerson\u2019s report and assessment earlier, Perkins has not proven the report material. To show materiality, Perkins must demonstrate a reasonable probability that the Commissioner would have decided the case differently had the evidence been considered. <em>Sizemore, </em>865 F.2d at 711. It is not reasonable to believe Dr. Perkerson\u2019s June 1998 post-decision report and assessment would have changed the Commissioner\u2019s decision as to Perkins\u2019s disability status.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Dr. Perkerson\u2019s post-decision report and assessment suffers the same flaw that diminished the importance of his earlier opinions, specifically, that it is not supported by his own treatment notes and is inconsistent with the record as a whole. The record shows that the ALJ considered Dr. Perkerson\u2019s earlier opinions suggesting that Perkins was disabled and found them not supported by Dr. Perkerson\u2019s own treatment notes and inconsistent with the other medical evidence showing that Perkins had recovered substantially from his neck and right knee surgeries. (TR 27-28). The Magistrate Judge found that the ALJ had correctly discounted Dr. Perkerson\u2019s earlier opinion that Plaintiff was \u201cprobably\u201d disabled because Dr. Perkerson\u2019s \u201copinion is not supported by objective medical evidence or the opinions of the specialists to whom he referred the plaintiff for treatment of his complaints.\u201d R. 19: Report and Recommendation at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">In his June 1998 post-decision report and assessment, Dr. Perkerson continues to rely on objective evidence that was in the record properly before the ALJ, evidence that actually supports the ALJ\u2019s decision that Perkins was not disabled. In suggesting Perkins is disabled, Dr. Perkerson relies on a January 1997 MRI, a July 1996 myelogram,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> an August 1996 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>myelogram, and July 1996 and July 1997 CT scans. (TR 332-333). Those objective studies, however, were all considered by medical specialists, none of whom concluded Plaintiff was unable to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">For instance, Dr. Natelson reviewed the January 1997 MRI and found that it showed only a slight bulge at L4-5 and was otherwise normal (TR 299). As Dr. Perkerson himself noted, the July 1996 myelogram was normal. (TR 332, 165). It was Dr. Natelson\u2019s opinion that the July 1996 lumbar myelogram was essentially normal and the cervical myelogram showed only some spondylosis with a bulge at C4-5. (TR 168). Dr. Natelson thought the August 1996 myelogram showed an epidural defect at C4-5 which may have increased in severity since the previous study, but the post-myelogram CT scan showed only some mild degenerative change at C5-6 and was otherwise unremarkable. (TR 182-83).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Moreover, Dr. Perkerson\u2019s post-decision report and assessment deal only with Perkins\u2019s \u201ccurrent\u201d condition as of June 1998. (TR 332). Dr. Perkerson lists Perkins\u2019s \u201ccurrent diagnosis\u201d; lists his \u201ccurrent medications\u201d; and opines that Perkins \u201cis impaired.\u201d (TR 332). Dr. Perkerson does not attempt to pe\u00edate his opinion back to the period prior to the ALJ\u2019s September 1997 decision, the time period relevant to this adjudication. Even if the limitations suggested by Dr. Perkerson were supported by the record, this post-decision evidence cannot be considered \u201cmaterial\u201d because it does not relate to the period under adjudication. <em>See Casey v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., </em>987 F.2d 1230, 1233 (6th Cir.1993). Remand is not warranted. The district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to remand this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Perkins further argues that, because the post-decision evidence contains a list of specific functional limitations, the court should have applied a different standard in considering whether remand was appropriate. <em>(See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 17-19). Perkins\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Perkins asserts that the ALJ discounted Dr. Perkerson\u2019s earlier opinion because it did not contain any specific limitations and was merely conclusory. <em>Id. </em>While Perkins is correct in stating that the ALJ could have discounted Dr. Perkerson\u2019s earlier opinion because it made a legal conclusion reserved to the Commissioner, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527, 416.927(e)(1999); <em>Hardaway v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>823 F.2d 922, 927 (6th Cir.1987), the ALJ explained that he did not assign great weight to Dr. Perkerson\u2019s opinion that Perkins \u201cprobably\u201d could not perform gainful activity because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">[Perkerson\u2019s] subsequent accounts of symptomatic pain, sleep, and mood improvement with monitored medication therapy, and his consideration of resumption of physical therapy, appear to counter his tentative determination of \u201cdisability\u201d in February 1997.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">(TR 27).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">The ALJ pointed out that \u201c[i]t appears, rather, that [Perkins] recovered substantially from his neck and right knee surgeries in 1996, such that neither caused disabling limitations for a continuous period of not less than twelve months thereafter.\u201d (TR 28). The ALJ clearly discounted Dr. Perkerson\u2019s opinion because it was not supported by the evidence of record, not merely because it failed to suggest any specific functional limitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">While Dr. Perkerson\u2019s earlier opinion did not suggest any specific functional limitations, there can be no doubt that both the ALJ and the Magistrate Judge understood that Dr. Perkerson thought Perkins was disabled. Perkins\u2019s belief that the Magistrate Judge should have somehow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>viewed Dr. Perkerson\u2019s post-decision assessment differently because it suggested specific limitations is not supported by any statute, regulation, or authoritative case-law. Dr. Perkerson\u2019s post-decision assessment relied on objective medical evidence that did not support his opinion and was inconsistent with the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">The ALJ undoubtedly would have discounted Dr. Perkerson\u2019s June 1998 assessment if it had been before him. Even a treating physician\u2019s opinion must be supported by \u201csufficient clinical findings and [be] consistent with the evidence.\u201d <em>See Cutlip v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., 25 </em>F.3d 284, 287 (6th Cir.1994); Social Security Ruling 96-2p (1996) (noting that a treating source\u2019s opinion is not entitled to controlling weight if it is \u201cnot well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques or it is inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the case record\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, there is no reason to believe that Dr. Perkerson\u2019s post-decision opinion would probably alter the Commissioner\u2019s decision simply because it contained a list of specific limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">For all the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">. Light work involves lifting no more than twenty pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to ten pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing or pulling of arm or leg controls. To be considered capable of performing a full or wide range of light work, the individual must have the ability to do substantially all these activities. If someone can do light work, the Commissioner determines that person can do sedentary work, unless there are additional limiting factors. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(b), 416.967(b) (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-14\">. Sedentary work involves lifting no more than ten pounds at a time and occasionally lifting and carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools. Although a sedentary job is defined as one which involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary to carry out job duties. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required occasionally and other sedentary criteria are met. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567, 416.967(b) (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">. The district court's decision that substantial evidence supported the Commissioner\u2019s decision that Plaintiff was not disabled is not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\">. The sixth sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">The court may, on motion of the Commissioner of Social Security made for good cause shown before the Commissioner files the Commissioner\u2019s answer, remand the case to the Commissioner of Social Security for further action by the Commissioner of Social Security, and it may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of Social Security, but only upon a showing that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding; and the Commissioner of Social Security shall, after the case is remanded, and after hearing such additional evidence if so ordered, modify or affirm the Commissioner's findings of fact or the Commissioner\u2019s decision, or both, and shall file with the court any such additional and modified findings of fact and decision, and a transcript of the additional record and testimony upon which the Commissioner\u2019s action in modifying or affirming was based.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-16\">. The magistrate judge did not consider the \"good cause\u201d prong of sentence six. Instead, he assumed \"for the purpose of the plaintiff's motion that he has established good cause for his failing to submit the records at issue ...\u201d and found that the post-decision evidence was not \"material.\u201d R. 17: Report and Recommendation at 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">. Dr. Perkerson\u2019s letter cites to a \"myelogram of the cervical region ... performed 7-97 at Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center.\u201d (TR 332). The Commissioner suggests this is a typographical error and refers to the July 30, 1996 myelogram performed at the Fort Sanders Medical Center (TR 165).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">. The ALJ relied, in part, on a functional capacity assessment provided by State Agency Medical Consultant Mona Mishu. (TR 27). The ALJ was required to rely on the State Agency Medical Consultant\u2019s opinion where, as in this case, there are no assessments from examining doctors. <em>See Fletcher v. Commissioner of Soc.
