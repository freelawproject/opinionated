The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Woulard to 24 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release, imposed a fine, and ordered restitution. On appeal, Woulard\u2019s appointed counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising numerous issues, some of which Woulard reasserts in a pro se brief. Having carefully reviewed the record, we reject each of the issues raised, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-18\">Specifically, (1) the evidence was sufficient to support Woulard\u2019s conviction, and thus the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motions for acquittal and for a new trial, <em>see United States v. Strok, </em>176 F.3d 439, 440 (8th Cir.1999) (sufficiency of evidence); <em>United States v. James, </em>172 F.3d 588, 591 (8th Cir.1999) (motion for judgment of acquittal); <em>United States v. Goodson, </em>155 F.3d 963, 967 (8th Cir.1998) (new-trial motion); (2) Woulard did not suffer an ex post facto violation by being charged with a felony, even though section 1383a(a) classified the offense only as a misdemeanor until August 1994, because the charged conduct occurred in 1996; (3) Woulard is not entitled to relief merely because the jury acquitted him on a related count, <em>see United States v. Finch, </em>16 F.3d 228, 230-31 (8th Cir.1994) (jury\u2019s province will not be invaded); (4) the district court did not violate Woulard\u2019s right of self-representation or abuse its discretion in refusing to appoint substitute counsel on the day of his trial, <em>see United States v. Kind, </em>194 F.3d 900, 904-05 (self-representation), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 1180, 120 S.Ct. 1217, 145 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>1117 (2000); <em>United States v. Davidson, </em>195 F.3d 402, 407 (8th Cir.1999) (substitute counsel), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 1180, 120 S.Ct. 1218, 145 L.Ed.2d 1118 <em>and </em>529 U.S. 1093, 120 S.Ct. 1732, 146 L.Ed.2d 651 (2000); (5) the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to exclude evidence that Woulard admitted forging his wife\u2019s signature on the SSA application at issue, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403, 404(b), 801(d)(2)(A); and (6) the district court did not err in imposing Woulard\u2019s sentence consecutively to a Delaware sentence he was then serving, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(e), p.s., &amp; comment. (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no other nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-16\">.
