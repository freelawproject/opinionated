We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-21\">We reject Mason\u2019s assertion that the district court abused its discretion in staying discovery; we note that Mason did not move for a continuance and identify what discovery was lacking that prevented him from adequately resisting summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) (to protect party from undue burden or expense of discovery, district court \u201cmay make any order which justice requires\u201d); <em>Dulany v. Carnahan, </em>132 F.3d 1234, 1238 (8th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>1997) (standard of review; under Fed. R. Civ.P. 56(f), party opposing summary judgment may seek continuance by filing affidavit showing what specific facts further discovery might unveil).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">We also conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment. <em>See Kurtz v. City of Shrewsbury, </em>245 F.3d 753, 756-57 (8th Cir.2001) (de novo standard of review). The evidence does not show that defendants knew of any particular risk to Mason that they disregarded by not assigning him to protective custody upon his arrival at the prison. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 838, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (official\u2019s failure to alleviate significant risk that he should have perceived but did not is not punishment). Further, the evidence does not show that defendants were deliberately indifferent for not continuously monitoring the weight room, where Mason was attacked. <em>Cf. Steidl v. Gramley, </em>151 F.3d 739, 741 (7th Cir.1998) (absence of guards in towers and catwalk overlooking prisoner\u2019s unit at time of attack did not give rise to liability on warden\u2019s part).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-14\">.
