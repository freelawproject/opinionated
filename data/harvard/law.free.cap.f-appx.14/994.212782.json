The beneficiaries brought suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 et seq., after David was shot and killed by James Laverty, a Special Agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">An advisory jury found, and the district court agreed, that the government should be hable for David\u2019s death because Laverty was not acting in self-defense when he shot David. The district court then awarded damages to the estate\u2019s beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">The FTCA\u2019s provisions incorporate the law of the state where the alleged tort occurred. Because the alleged tort occurred in Arizona, its law determines whether Aguilar\u2019s estate can recover on account of David\u2019s death. <em>See Shaw v. United States, </em>741 F.2d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir.1984). The determination of whether someone acted in self-defense is a factual one, reviewed for clear error. <em>See Garcia v. United States, </em>826 F.2d 806, 810 (9th Cir.l987)(holding, under Arizona law, that the question of whether a person acted in self-defense is a question of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">There is no indication that the district court erred in stating, or misapplied, the law. The district court correctly concluded that self-defense is an affirmative defense. <em>See Hansen v. Garcia, </em>148 Ariz. 205, 713 P.2d 1263, 1265 (Ariz.App. 1985). The district court also explained, correctly, the legal standard for determining whether someone is entitled to use deadly force in self-defense. <em>See </em>A.R.S. \u00a7 13-405. The government disputes none of these legal conclusions. Rather, the dispute between the plaintiffs and the government appears to be primarily factual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">The district court resolved that dispute in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor, concluding that Laverty did not act in self-defense. Its conclusion is supported by the record. The court found Dominic\u2019s testimony was more credible than Laverty\u2019s. Laverty testified that David pointed his rifle at Laverty through the windshield of Laverty\u2019s car, and continued to point it at Laverty even after the DEA agent pulled out his own gun. Laverty also testified that David never tried to run away. Dominic testified that as soon as Laverty backed up his car and before Laverty began firing, David lowered his gun, and did not raise it again. Instead, Dominic testified, David ran away from Laverty\u2019s car, through a small patch of desert toward a neighbor\u2019s house. Laverty followed David, then pulled up to the house, rolled down the driver side window, and continued shooting at David from the window. In sum, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>testimony that the district court found more credible indicates that David was trying to retreat. None of the expert testimony or objective evidence before the court contradicted Dominic\u2019s testimony, and Dominic withstood aggressive cross-examination. The district court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Neither does A.R.S. \u00a7 12-712 protect the government from liability to David\u2019s estate. That statute prevents recovery by anyone injured as a result of negligence or gross negligence while the person is committing a felony. David undeniably committed a felony when he first approached Laverty\u2019s vehicle and pointed his sawed-off rifle at Laverty, but Laverty did not negligently kill David. Instead, Laverty intended to fire upon David. The government, for tactical reasons, did not want to characterize Laverty\u2019s actions as negligence at trial, and sought to prevent, for its part, the advisory jury from receiving any instructions on negligence. It acknowledged the shooting was deliberate but was justified by self-defense. The trial court and advisory jury credited Dominic\u2019s version of events rather than Laverty\u2019s. The government waived any defense based on the contention that Laverty\u2019s actions constituted negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">The government also challenges the district court\u2019s award of $1.3 million to David\u2019s estate. The award is supported by the findings of fact arising from the testimony of a dozen witnesses indicating that David\u2019s family suffered loss of love, pain, and expenses as a result of his death. These are all losses that merit compensation under Arizona law. <em>See South. Pac. Trans. Co. v. Lueck, </em>111 Ariz. 560, 535 P.2d 599, 612 (Ariz.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1023-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.

As our Court has cautioned in reviewing police deadly force cases, \u201cliability cannot rest upon such an exercise in \u201920-20 hindsight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garcia v. United States, </em>826 F.2d 806, 812 n. 14 (9th Cir.1987). Assuming Dominic\u2019s testimony is accurate, I fail to see how Aguilar\u2019s slight lowering of the gun while Laverty began to back up his car dissipated the state of imminent danger the officer still faced. Laverty was always well within range of the rifle, which Aguilar could easily have raised and fired within an instant. As Justice Holmes so trenchantly observed, \u201c[djetached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife.\u201d <em>Brown v. United States, </em>256 U.S. 335, 343, 41 S.Ct. 501, 65 L.Ed. 961 (1921). I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
