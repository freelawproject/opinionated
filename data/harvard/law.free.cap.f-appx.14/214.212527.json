McNally was sentenced to a total of 850 months imprisonment, ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $218,653, and given three years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of supervised release. On appeal, McNally raises three issues. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">First, we do not find that the district court erred by denying McNally\u2019s motion for acquittal on the firearm counts because these convictions are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996). Second, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion by allowing certain evidence to be presented at trial, <em>United States v. Bostian, </em>59 F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995), or that such admissions were plain error, <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Finally, we decline to address McNally\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in this direct appeal because the record does not \u201cconclusively\u201d reveal that McNally received defective representation. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 1096, 120 S.Ct. 837, 145 L.Ed.2d 704 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm McNally\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
