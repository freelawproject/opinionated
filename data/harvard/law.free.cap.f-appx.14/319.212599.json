BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Miquan Leach (\u201cLeach\u201d) appeals his sentence, imposed after he pled guilty to possessing with intent to distribute approximately 36 .8 grams of cocaine base. Leach complains that his sentence was improperly enhanced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a) because the prior conviction contained in the information filed by the government did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 851(b)(2) and because the district court did not engage in the colloquy required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) before it sentenced him to ten years in federal prison. He also challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to award him a 2-point reduction for being a minor participant. Finding no merit to these contentions, we will affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Police officers in Union City, Tennessee, executed a search warrant on a house on North Home Street in Union City on February 22, 1999. After knocking and announcing their presence, the police officers entered the house, which is located within 1,000 feet of an elementary school and a city park. When police entered the house, Leach and Damon Biffie bolted for the back door. Before they could escape, the police subdued them.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Searching the house, police found 10.9 grams of crack cocaine. Leach then gave officers permission to search a second house \u2014 a house that Leach shared with his girlfriend. Searching the second house, police found about 25.9 grams of crack cocaine. When questioned at the police station, Leach admitted that the 25.9 grams belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">The government filed a twelve-count superseding indictment against Leach and eight others on November 22, 1999. Count One of that indictment charged Leach with conspiring to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine. Count Ten charged Leach with possessing and intending to distribute 36.8 grams of crack cocaine (the 10.9 grams found at North Home Street plus the 25.9 grams found in the house that Leach shared with his girlfriend). Leach was not charged in the other ten counts of the indictment. The day that Leach\u2019s trial was to begin, Leach decided to plead guilty to Count Ten in exchange for the government\u2019s dismissing him from Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">At the outset of the plea hearing, the Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) offered for filing an \u201cInformation Regarding Previous Conviction.\u201d At that point, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">AUSA: Before we get started with Mr. Leach\u2019s change of plea, I wanted to file an information in open court concerning a prior conviction for Mr. Leach. I had told \u2014 His lawyer and I had spoken about it earlier today, and she\u2019s aware that we were going to file that prior to the change of the plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">COURT: Ms. Smothers, are you familiar with this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-16\">SMOTHERS: Yes, Your Honor, I have a copy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-17\">COURT: Okay, the information regarding previous convictions has been filed. Ms. Hern, you can mark that filed at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-18\">The district court clerk docketed the Information, which states that in December of 1995, the County Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Winnebago County, Illinois sentenced Leach to two years\u2019 probation for \u201cManufacturing/Delivery [of] Cocaine.\u201d At a later point in the plea hearing, as the district court was explaining to Leach the total possible sentence that could be imposed, the AUSA reminded the court that Leach\u2019s minimum sentence might double because of Leach\u2019s prior cocaine conviction in Illinois. The court paused and asked if Leach understood the implications of the prior conviction and the government\u2019s notice that it would seek an increase in Leach\u2019s sentence because of that prior conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">AUSA: Your Honor, I wanted to point out, because the government has filed the enhancement, in essence, the minimum sentence is doubled from five to ten.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">COURT: All right. I wasn\u2019t aware of the enhancement until just now. But, Mr. Leach, do you understand that the filing of that notice of enhancement means that your penalties are doubled and \u2014 the minimum is doubled, so it\u2019s at least ten years in jail and up to forty. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">LEACH: Hold on before I answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">COURT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">(Leach confers with his lawyer, Ms. Smothers.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">LEACH: Yes, I understand that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">After this short colloquy, the government explained that, had the case gone to trial, the government would have proved that Leach had admitted possessing at least 25.9 grams of the 36.8 grams of crack cocaine that were the subject of Count Ten \u2014 the count to which Leach was pleading guilty. The court then asked Leach if the 25.9 grams were his, and Leach confirmed that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">After Leach pled guilty, the government filed a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The Illinois cocaine conviction appears in paragraphs 25, 29 and 30 of that report and on the Criminal History Worksheet attached to the report. Paragraph twenty-five of the PSR explains that Leach pled guilty to the Illinois cocaine charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">Although Leach filed objections to the PSR, he did not object to the paragraphs which referenced the Illinois conviction. Addressing paragraph 25, Leach said that he had \u201c[n]o dispute as to this charge.\u201d Responding to paragraphs 29 and 30 in the PSR, which further explained that Leach had entered into a plea agreement on the Illinois charge and that he served probation, Leach said: \u201cNo dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">At the sentencing hearing, both the minor-participant reduction and the enhancement were discussed. Leach objected only to the court\u2019s denying him a minor-participant reduction. Responding to Leach\u2019s objection, the district court determined that Leach \u201cmay have been less involved than some of the others in the overall conspiracy ... but on ... count number 10 ... it\u2019s clear that [Leach was] not a minor participant in that erime[.]\u201d Based on this determination, the court rejected Leach\u2019s request for a minor-participant reduction on Count Ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">On appeal, Leach complains that the district court did not comply with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b). That section requires that prior to imposing sentence, the court shall</p>\n<p id=\"Au_W\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b). Leach contends further that \u00a7 851(a)(2) does not permit the filing of an information unless the offense raised in that information was prosecuted by indictment or the defendant waived indictment; because the information filed by the government in this case contains no facts demonstrating that the Illinois conviction is properly the subject of a \u00a7 851(a) information, Leach asserts, the information was not proper under the statute and he was not required to make any response or objection. Notably, Leach does not cite any authority for the latter proposition, nor does he challenge the fact of the Illinois conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>... inquire of the person with respect to whom the information was filed whether he affirms or denies that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the information, and shall inform him that any challenge to a prior conviction which is not made before sentence is imposed may not thereafter be raised to attack the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The government concedes that the district court did not comply with \u00a7 851(b), but points out that in <em>United States v. Hill, </em>142 F.3d 305, 313 (6th Cir.1998), this court held that a district court\u2019s failure to make the inquiry and issue the caution required by \u00a7 851(b) is harmless error when the defendant, having notice that the government will seek an enhancement, fails to follow the procedures set down in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(c). The government further points out that before the district court, Leach raised no objection whatsoever to the information filed by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In <em>Hill, </em>we agreed with the Fifth Circuit that \u00a7 851(c) requires a defendant to \u201cgive advance notice concerning the basis of his challenge\u201d to the validity of the prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>954 F.2d 273, 278 (5th Cir.1992)). Here, as in <em>Hill, </em>there is \u201cno indication in the record that defendant ever complied with the mechanisms of section 851(c)[.]\u201d <em>Hill, </em>142 F.3d at 313. Leach identifies no action that we might construe as an attempt to challenge the Illinois cocaine conviction. Like Hill, Leach made no objection to the portions of the presentence report that referred to the prior conviction. Indeed, the record shows not only that Leach has never disputed the Illinois cocaine conviction \u2014 even in Illinois, he pled guilty to the charge \u2014 he specifically stated in his response to the presentence report that he did not dispute the conviction. Finally, although Leach\u2019s counsel mentioned the enhancement at least twice during the sentencing hearing, she never challenged the enhancement itself or the prior conviction that supported the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">We recognize that one of the bases for the finding of harmless error in <em>Hill </em>is not present here because a challenge to Illinois conviction would not be time-barred under the statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 851(e). <em>See Hill, </em>142 F.3d at 313 (noting that, in any event, the conviction at issue could not be collaterally attacked because it occurred more than five years before the information was filed.) Nonetheless, the finding of harmless error in <em>Hill </em>was independently grounded on the failure of the defendant to give advance notice concerning the basis of his challenge to the conviction as required by \u00a7 851(c). Here, Leach not only failed to give any such notice, he explicitly stated that he did not challenge the Illinois conviction. We hold that the district court\u2019s failure to recite the inquiry and cautionary instruction required by \u00a7 851(b) was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Leach also argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(2) requires the government to show that Leach either \u201cwaived or was afforded prosecution by indictment\u201d in the Illinois cocaine-trafficking case. Not surprisingly, Leach cites no authority for this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Section 851(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">An information may not be filed under this section if the increased punishment which may be imposed is imprisonment for a term in excess of three years unless the person either waived or was afforded prosecution by indictment <em>for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>the offense for which such increased punishment may be imposed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(2) (emphasis added). It is clear from the language of this section and the law of this circuit that the section applies to the offense of conviction in this federal case, wherein Leach\u2019s sentence was enhanced, and not to the Illinois conviction that was the basis for enhancing Leach\u2019s sentence in this case. <em>See United States v. Gaitan-Acevedo, </em>148 F.3d 577, 594 (6th Cir.1998) (\u00a7 851(a)(2) \u201crefer[s] to the federal offense for which the mandatory sentence is sought,\u201d not the prior conviction that is the basis for an enhancement of the mandatory sentence.). Section 851(a)(2) is satisfied here. Leach was indicted for the offense that was the subject of Count Ten and pled guilty to the indictment. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Leach complains that he was a minor participant in the offense and that the district court erred in denying him a 2-point reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines. This claim is likewise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">We review for clear error the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings; while giving due deference to the sentencing court\u2019s application of the guidelines to those facts, we review de novo the court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>152 F.3d 507, 509 (6th Cir.1998). To receive a minor-participant reduction, Leach was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was \u201cless culpable than most other participants,\u201d <em>United States v. Perry, </em>908 F.2d 56, 58 (6th Cir.1990), and that he was \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Leach failed to make that showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Leach maintained at sentencing that \u201chis involvement was less than other charged defendants as shown by recorded conversations of drug transactions.\u201d The district court agreed that as to the overall conspiracy, Leach was indeed a minor participant. But the court pointed out that as to Count Ten of the indictment, the count to which Leach had pled guilty and for which he was being sentenced, Leach was no minor participant. We think the district court was entirely correct. Leach admitted during his plea hearing that he possessed and intended to distribute 36.8 grams of crack cocaine. Leach presented no evidence at sentencing comparing his role to that of his co-defendants on Count Ten. We conclude that Leach failed to carry his burden under <em>Perry. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
