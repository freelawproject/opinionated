Santana alleged that Dr. Ohmann was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs because he failed to treat Santana\u2019s injuries adequately after a slip and fall. The District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to Dr. Ohmann, who examined Santana each time Santana visited him, and administered some tests, referred him to a cardiologist, and prescribed medication. At most, Santana has shown disagreement with a prescribed course of treatment, which does not establish an Eighth Amendment violation. See <em>Long v. Nix, </em>86 F.3d 761, 765 (8th Cir.1996). His First Amendment claim also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-23\">Accordingly, we affirm. See 8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny Santana\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-17\">. The Honorable Michael J.' Davis, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Arthur J.
