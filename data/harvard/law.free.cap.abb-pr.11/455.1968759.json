The first cause of action is founded on an implied contract; the second upon a liability created by operation of law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-11\">Demurrer to the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-12\">Frederick T. Mappier brought this action against John Mortimer and three others, to charge them individually, under sections 10 and 13 of the manufacturing Companies\u2019 act of 1848, as having been stockholders and trustees in the Kelly Skirt Manufacturing Company. The defendant made a motion to strike out certain parts of the complaint on the ground that allegations to charge one as trustee under section 12 could not be added to a complaint in an action to charge the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>person as stockholder under section 10, since the liabilities created by those two sections constituted different causes of action. The motion was granted, and leave given to amend the complaint by setting out the causes separately.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\">The amended complaint alleged as follows: For a first cause of action, 1. That the Kelly Manufacturing Company was a corporation organized under the manufacturing companie\u2019s act of 1848. 2. That' by reason of various promissory notes, the company was indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of about eight thousand dollars, in June, 1869. 3. That on August 1, 1869, and within one year from the accruing of the indebtedness, the plaintiffs commenced an action therefor against the company, in the New York, superior court, and, on September 7, 1869, recovered judgment for the full sum. 4. Execution against the company returned unsatisfied, and that the whole debt was still due. 5. That at the time when the indebtedness accrued, the defendants were each of them a stockholder in the company. 6. That by the terms of the certificate of incorporation, the whole amount of capital stock was fixed at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, but the same was not paid in, one-half within one year, and the other half within two years of the incorporation of the company, nor was any certificate of the amount of capital stock fixed and paid in, ever subscribed by the president and a majority of the trustees of said company, nor was any such certificate ever recorded in the office of the clerk of New York county, where the business of the company was carried on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\">For a second cause of action, the plaintiff repeated all the foregoing allegations, except the last clause, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>further alleged: 1. That the defendants were trustees of the company, and had been so since its incorporation. 2. That, the company had made no report within twenty days from January 1,1866, nor for 1867,1868, or 1869, nor had any report ever been made as required by the statute. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">Wherefore the plaintiffs demanded judgment against the defendants for the sum due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">The defendant, Mortimer, demurred, on the grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">1. That several causes of action were improperly united. 2. That the first pretended cause of action did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-8\"><em>Charles M. Marsh, </em>in support of demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXAg\">I. No actions can be united except as provided by section 167 of the Code of Procedure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-9\">II. These causes can by no possibility be included under any one of the subdivisions of this section, except 1 or 2; that is, 1. As arising out of the same transaction or transactions connected with the same subject matter; or, 2. Contract, express or implied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-10\">III. Do they come under these subdivisions ? They are not both on contract, <em>(a.) </em>The action against them as stockholders, has been settled as being one on contract (Corning <em>v. </em>McCullough, 1 <em>N. Y. </em>[1 <em>Comst.], </em>47). (5.) The cause of action against them as trustees, is equally weU settled to be for a penalty (Merchants\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Bliss, 35 <em>N. Y., </em>412). (c.) The two actions thus come under different branches of legislation, for one is remedial, the other penal, <em>(d.) </em>An examination of another part of the same statute, shows this construction to be correct\": The Code, section 91 (statute of limitations), provides: \u201cWithin six years upon a contract obligation or liability, express or implied.\u201d . . . Section 92 says: \u201c Within three years .... an upon a \"statute for a penalty or forfeiture.\u201d Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>action against them for the penalty for neglect of duty in filing their report, <em>is not upon a contract, obligation, or liability, express or implied. </em>2. They do not arise ont of the same transaction, for under the authorities above quoted, the cause of action in one is the original purchase of the goods (Corning <em>v. </em>McCullough, <em>supra). </em>The other is for a neglect of a duty imposed by statute (Merchants\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Bliss, 35 <em>N. Y., </em>412). This clearly is not the same transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-5\">IV. But not only do they not come under any one subdivision, but they are actually under different subdivisions. 1. The one against them as stockholders, is under the second subdivision, upon implied contracts. 2. The other cause of action comes under the seventh, as \u201ca claim against a trustee by virtue of a contract or by operation of law.\u201d To set forth this cause of action, it is alleged : <em>(a.) </em>The defendants were trustees. <em>(b.) </em>They neglected their duty as such, and failed to file their report. (&lt;?,) From this arises a liability to this claim, by operation of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-9\">V. It thus seems: 1. That the actions cannot be brought under any one subdivision of section 167. 2. That they are in terms, under separate subdivisions. 3. The section expressly says : \u201cBut the causes of action, so united, must all belong to one of these classes.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-11\"><em>John Townsend, </em>for plaintiffs, opposed.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">See Sterne <em>v. </em>Hermann, p. 376, ante, where a motion to the same effect was denied by the supreme court at special term in the same district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b472-12\">Cardozo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALL\">The complaint states two different causes of action. The defendants are sought to be held upon the first because of their being stockholders. There is no averment in the first cause of action that the defendants were trustees, and it would be inappropriate to that cause of action. The second cause of action is based upon an omission to do a duty which belonged to the defendants, as trustees. The first cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>action is founded on implied contract (Corning <em>v. </em>McCullough, 1 <em>N. Y. </em>[1 <em>Comst.], </em>47). The second is against a trustee, upon a liability created by operation of law (35 N. <em>Y., </em>412 <em>; </em>19 <em>Barb., </em>529).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">These causes of action do not belong to the same class; they are not both upon contract, neither are both against a trustee. \u2022 They cannot, therefore, be united <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 167), and the demurrer on that ground, is, therefore, well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Judgment for plaintiff on demurrer, with leave to plaintiff to amend, on usual terms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
