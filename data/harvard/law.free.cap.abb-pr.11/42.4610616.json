Mott; the default was afterwards opened on terms, but the judgment ordered to stand as security. Both defendants, by separate answers, denied the complaint, and set up the statute of limitations. After answer, the defendants were arrested and held to bail in the sum of $142,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The cause was by consent referred, and, on the hearing before the referee, the evidence given covered the whole period stated in the complaint, from which it appeared that the plaintiff was an institution organized under the general banking law, in December, 1852, and commenced business January 1, 1853; that the institution known as the Union Bank, existing before the last date, was chartered in 1811 by the name of \u201cThe President, Directors, and Company of the Union Bank of the city of Hew York,\u201d and that the said charter expired, and said bank ceased to exist, on the last day of December, 1852; that all the claims against the defendants but $1000 occurred previous to 1852, and were held by the plaintiff as assignee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">JJpon the close of the proof, it was insisted that, under the complaint, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for any claim prior to 1853. The court subsequently allowed an amendment by inserting allegations to show those facts, upon the following terms: the judgment to stand as security; the undertaking and bail to be discharged without prejudice to a new application for an arrest under the amended complaint; the order of reference to stand, and the testimony already taken to be made applicable to the amended pleadings; the answers already put in to stand unless cause should be shown to the contrary; and plaintiff to pay $10 costs of motion.

The court has not power to grant this amendment. The trial now pending is for the sole purpose of determining whether the judgment already recovered shall be enforced. The court could not insert a new cause of action into the judgment-roll now on the records of the court, and it cannot do this indirectly by making this amendment. A new cause of action now interposed may give plaintiff a lien under that judgment for a cause of action not contained in its record; and for which, for aught the record would show, a new action might be instituted. (Miller <em>a. </em>Eagle Life Insurance Co., 3 <em>E.

It would be also necessary, in answer to the new cause of action, to follow up the denial of indebtedness by denials of the newly alleged facts; namely, in the obtaining of money from the old bank by over-drafts upon that bank, and the assignment to the plaintiff before the commencement of this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-7\">V. The order of reference was by consent, and referred to the issues then <em>existing; </em>the court can only extend the defendant\u2019s consent to a reference of other issues, not anticipated by him when his consent was given.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-8\"><em>John Foot, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU\">I. Hie court had full power to make the amendment. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 169, 171, 173; Hagins <em>a. </em>De Hart, 12 <em>How. Pr., </em>322; Hall <em>a. </em>Gould, 3 <em>Kern., </em>134; Prindle <em>a. </em>Aldrich, 13 <em>How. Pr., </em>466.) The claim is not changed by the amendment asked and allowed. The claim is the relief sought. An amendment of a complaint changing the cause of action may be allowed if the <em>claim </em>remain the same. (Chapman <em>a. </em>Webb, 6 <em>How. Pr., </em>390 ; Prindle <em>a. </em>Aldrich, 13 <em>Ib., </em>466.) A variance sufficient to defeat the action, must leave the case unproved in its entire scope and meaning. If left unproved in some particulars, it is a subject of amendment. (Fay <em>a. </em>Grimstead, 10 <em>Barb., </em>330.) In this ease the referee decided the proof complete with respect to $1000 of the claim. The balance if left unproved is, therefore, the subject of amendment. Full proof has been given in respect to the balance of the claim, and the assignment of the claim. All that is asked, is an allegation setting it forth in the complaint to conform the pleadings to the facts proved. The issue is not changed. The old complaint covers the money claimed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>amendment. The defendants\u2019 answers fully meet the amendment allowed. The defendants, to show that they were not indebted, proved the existence of the old bank. The plaintiff, to meet and rebut that fact, showed the assignment to the plaintiff. The defendants attacked its legality. Full proof has been given respecting it. All that was asked, was to conform the pleadings to the facts proved before the referee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-5\">II. The amendment was allowed after full argument and proof of its necessity, and it should not be altered in its terms.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b57-6\">By the Court.*\u2014E. Darwin Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvI\">The first question presented upon this appeal is, whether or not the order of the special term is reviewable. The power of this court to amend a complaint in any stage of the action, by allowing the plaintiff to insert a new count therein, cannot be doubted. An application for leave to make such amendment is addressed to the sound judicial discretion of the court. The exercise of this discretion is among the most embarrassing duties cast upon the courts, and yet its existence and exercise is indispensable to the proper administration of public justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">It is well-settled law, that orders resting in discretion cannot be reviewed upon appeal. But this doctrine is obviously subject to some limitation. The discretion which is confided to the courts is not an arbitrary and capricious discretion. It is a power regulated by legal principles, and which cannot be used for the purpose of injustice or oppression. An order in an action which the court may in its discretion grant or deny, clearly cannot be reviewed upon appeal, unless in the <em>terms </em>which it imposes, or upon which it is granted, it invades <em>\u201c some substantial right\u201d </em>or transcends the limits of legal discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Courts constantly exercise the power, when a party has made a slip in his proceedings, or is in default, and asks a favor, to grant such favor upon conditions that the party asking it waives some strict legal right,\u2014such as that he consent that a judgment be entered to stand as security,\u2014that he consent to refer a cause not referable,\u2014that he takes short notice of trial,\u2014that he indemnify the opposite party by the payment of costs, and other like equitable terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>In such cases the order is not appealable. But this rule only applies as against the party asking for a favor. A party asking no favor of the court, and standing upon his strict legal rights, and who has been guilty of no default, cannot be required to waive any of those rights, and they cannot be taken away from him by the court without his consent. It is because I think the order granted at special term violates this principle that I think it may so far be reviewed upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">When the trial was arrested before the referee, and the amendment granted by him was allowed, the defendants had really succeeded in successfully defending the suit to the extent of the whole claim of the plaintiffs, except the sum of $1,000. The plaintiffs then asked to insert a new count in their complaint to cover a claim for the sum of $141,586, which they had acquired by purchase and assignment. We agree with Judge Allen, that the referee had no power to allow such an amendment, and that it was not a case of variance, and was not such an amendment as should be allowed on the trial of a cause; but the <em>court </em>could undoubtedly allow such amendment upon proper terms. But when the plaintiffs asked and were allowed to insert such new count for a second and separate cause of action, we think the defendants had the right to have such amended complaint served upon them in the usual manner, and had the legal right to answer or demur to the same as in other cases. Of this right they were deprived by the order made at special term, extending the answer to such amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">I cannot conceive upon what ground the defendants could be lawfully deprived of this right. It seems to me it was just as absolute as though a new suit had been commenced for this $141,586. The right to answer or demur to a complaint, or to an amended complaint, inserting an entire new cause of action, is a strict legal right, and the court cannot take it away from any person, not in default, who is prosecuted in a suit at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The defendants did not, in this case, ask any favor. They were not before the court, therefore, in any position to be required to waive any legal rights, or to submit to any equitable terms. It may be that the right to answer over would be of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>practical use to them; but that is a question the court cannot decide for them. They are entitled to decide it for themselves upon the advice of their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The order deprives them of this right, and so far, I think, it <em>affects a substantial </em>right, and within the spirit and intent of subdivision number 3 of section 349 of the Code, is reviewable upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The provision in the order also, that the testimony already taken on the first hearing be adopted on the further hearing under the amended complaint, as testimony in the case under the pleadings as amended, also, I think, invades a substantial right of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">If such evidence was pertinent to the new issue to be formed, and the defendants were satisfied to have it received upon the trial of such issue; and if they had fully cross-examined the witnesses of the plaintiffs\u2014they probably would do so\u2014it might have been with their consent, and doubtless would, in fact, with such consent, have been so used and applied. But I cannot see what power the court has, arbitrarily and without such consent, in opposition to the wishes of the defendants, to order that it shall be so received and used.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">As we think the order as it stands cannot be sustained, the question is presented whether we shall reverse or modify it. Ordinarily the court of review should in such cases make such order as the court below, in its opinion, should have made. The order, so far as it grants leave to amend, is right, and should be affirmed; but as the question of terms, except as hereinbefore considered, has not been particularly discussed here, I should have preferred simply to reverse the order and leave the court at special term, upon a hearing of the parties, to make such new terms as may be proper in view of our decisions. But the press upon the courts in this city, in respect to this particular class of business, is so great, that it is quite undesirable and inexpedient to send cases back to special term unless it is indispensably necessary so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The rule in all cases of the amendment of pleadings is, that the amendment shall not be made at the expense of the opposite party, and that he be indemnified for all additional expense involved in such amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">The amendment in this case upon strict right, and unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>defendant consents to use the testimony before taken by the referee upon the new issues to be found, involves virtually a new trial of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We think, therefore, the amendment should not have been allowed without payment at least of a trial fee, and the disbursements incurred by the defendants. The order above should, therefore, so far as it extends the answer to the amended complaint, and adopts or applies the testimony taken before the referee to the issues to be made by the amended pleadings, be reversed with $10 costs, and that the residue of said order be affirmed upon the payment of a trial-fee, and the disbursements incurred by the defendants for witness-fees, printing expenses, and other disbursements on such trial and since. The plaintiffs to serve their amended complaint in the usual manner, making such amendments as they may be advised, and the defendants to have the usual time to answer or demur to such amended complaint; and it is so ordered.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Mullin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b57-9\"> Present, Ingraham, E.

Superior Ct., </em>1847, Proctor <em>a. </em>Andrew, 1 <em>Sand/., </em>70.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The plaintiff, on petition, after exception to the answer, may have leave to amend, by adding new charges and new parties, upon payment, not of a fixed sum, but of costs, to be taxed. <em>(Chancery, </em>1818, Beekman <em>a. </em>Waters, 3 <em>Johns. Ch., </em>410.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">An amendment, by striking out counts or parts of counts from the declaration, allowed by a judge during the trial, without costs, is authorized by section 149 of the Code of 1848, which permits amendment on such terms as may be proper. <em>{Ct. of Appeals, </em>1851, Cayuga County Bank <em>a. </em>Warden, 6 TV\". Pi (2 <em>Scld.), </em>19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">In an action on a promissory note brought by indorsee against maker, the complaint merely alleged that the plaintiff was the lawful holder of the promissory note, but omitted to state that the note was indorsed by the payee to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\"><em>Held, </em>on demurrer, that the defect was technical, and plaintiff might amend without costs. (TV. Pi <em>Com. PI., Sp. </em>21, 1849, Vanderpool <em>a. </em>Tarbox, 7 TV. <em>7. Leg. Ohs., </em>150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">The provision giving leave to amend, of course, <em>without costs, </em>applies only where the first pleading has been regular. If the opposite party has moved to set aside the first pleading for an irregularity which is cured by the amendment, the party amending must pay costs, even if his amendment is in time under that section. <em>{Supreme Ct., Sp. </em>21, 1850, Williams <em>a. </em>Wilkinson, 9 TV. <em>7.

The defendant answered ; the cause was referred, and the referee found for the plaintiff $100, as being the amount at which the parties had compromised their controversies, and which amount it appeared the defendant had promised to pay. The defendant appealed from the judgment, and it was reversed, and a new trial ordered. The plaintiff now moved to amend the complaint so as to claim a recovery upon an agreement to pay S100 in compromise of disputed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\"><em>Held, </em>that the amendment was allowable ; but that the only terms that would be just in such a case were to require the plaintiff to make the defendant whole by paying all the legal taxable costs to which he had put the defendant by suing on a claim to which the defendant had a good defence, and the plaintiff no just right of recovery. <em>{Supreme Ct., Sp. </em>21, 1856, Prindle <em>a. </em>Aldrich, 13 <em>How.

[3 How. Pr., 296.] <em>(Supreme Ct., Sp. T., </em>1856, Turner <em>a. </em>Hillerline, 14 <em>How.

[8 Wend., 356; 2 Seld., 97.] (IV. <em>T.
