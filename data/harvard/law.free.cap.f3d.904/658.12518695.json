BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Villavicencio is a native and citizen of Mexico, who entered the United States illegally in 1979 and adjusted his status to lawful permanent resident in the following decade. On January 20, 2010, an information was filed in Nevada charging Villavicencio with burglary and grand larceny under N.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 205.060 and 205.220, respectively. The state subsequently filed two amended informations containing the same charges, and a third amended information charging Villavicencio solely with grand larceny. A judgment of conviction was entered on the grand larceny charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Three months before entry of the judgment of conviction on the grand larceny charge, an information was filed in Nevada charging Villavicencio with possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell ( N.R.S. 453.337 ), and sale of a controlled substance ( N.R.S. 453.321 ), identifying methamphetamine as the controlled substance. An amended information charged Villavicencio with conspiracy to possess drugs that may not be introduced into interstate commerce ( N.R.S. 199.480 and N.R.S. 454.351 ), also identifying methamphetamine as the controlled substance. Villavicencio agreed to plead guilty to three conspiracy counts in two separate cases. Judgments of conviction were entered in both cases pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) subsequently served Villavicencio with a Notice to Appear charging him with removability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii) for having been convicted of an aggravated felony relating to a theft offense, and under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i) for having been convicted of a violation relating to a controlled substance. At his removal proceedings, Villavicencio admitted that he was not a citizen or national of the United States, that he was a native and citizen of Mexico, and that his status was adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident. Villavicencio denied that he was convicted of grand larceny and that he was convicted of a conspiracy to possess drugs. Nevertheless, the IJ found Villavicencio removable, noting that the government had withdrawn the charge relating to the theft conviction, leaving only the drug conspiracy charge as the basis of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Villavicencio appealed the IJ's decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA affirmed the IJ's removability determination, and Villavicencio filed a timely petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
