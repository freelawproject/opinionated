Telemarketing sales had \"skyrocketed to over $435 million in 1990,\" which was a \"fourfold increase since 1984.\" 137 Cong. Rec. S16,971 (daily ed. June 27, 1991) (statement of Rep. Pressler). \"This marketing success ha[d] created an industry in which over 300,000 telemarketing solicitors call[ed] more than 18 million Americans every day.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In part, this was due to the advent of machines that \"automatically dial a telephone number and deliver to the called party an artificial or prerecorded voice message.\" S. Rep. No. 102-178, at 2 (1991). Advertisers found these autodialers highly efficient because they could \"ensure that a company's message gets to potential customers in the exact same way, every time, without incurring the normal cost of human intervention.\" H.R. Rep. No. 102-317, at 6 (1991). At that time, a single autodialer could cause as many as 1,000 phones to ring and then deliver a prerecorded message to each.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The dark side of this success story caught Congress's attention. As Senator Fritz Hollings complained, \"[c]omputerized calls are the scourge of modern civilization. They wake us up in the morning; they interrupt our dinner at night; they force the sick and elderly out of bed; they hound us until we want to rip the telephone right out of the wall.\" 137 Cong. Rec. S16,205 (daily ed. Nov. 7, 1991) (statement of Sen. Hollings). Recipients deemed that \"automated telephone calls that deliver an artificial or prerecorded voice message are more of a nuisance and a greater invasion of privacy than calls placed by 'live' persons.\" S. Rep. No. 102-178, at 4. Among other reasons, \"[t]hese automated calls cannot interact with the customer except in preprogrammed ways, do not allow the caller to feel the frustration of the called party\" and deprive customers of \"the ability to slam the telephone down on a live human being.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 &amp; n.3 (citation omitted). Congress also noted surveys wherein consumers responded that the two most annoying things were (1) \"[p]hone calls from people selling things\" and (2) \"phone calls from a computer trying to sell something.\" H.R. Rep. No. 102-317, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The volume of automated telemarketing calls was not only an annoyance but also posed dangers to public safety. S. Rep. No. 102-177, at 20 (1991). \"Due to advances in autodialer technology,\" the machines could be programmed to call numbers in large sequential blocks or dial random 10-digit strings of numbers.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . This resulted in calls hitting hospitals and emergency care providers \"and sequentially delivering a recorded message to all telephone lines.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . And because some autodialers would \"not release [the line] until the prerecorded message is played, even when the called party hangs up,\" H.R. Rep. No. 102-317, at 10, there was a danger that the autodialers could \"seize\" emergency or medical assistance telephone lines, rendering them inoperable, and \"dangerously preventing those lines from being utilized to receive calls from those needing emergency services,\" H.R. Rep. No. 101-633, at 3 (1990). Representative Marge Roukema noted that it was \"not just calls to doctors' offices or police and fire stations that pose a public health hazard.\" 137 Cong. Rec. H35,305 (daily ed. Nov. 26, 1991) (statement of Rep. Roukema). She recounted \"the sheer terror\" of a New York mother who, when she tried to call an ambulance for her injured child, \"picked up her phone only to find it occupied by a computer call that would not disconnect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35,305-06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In light of these and other concerns, Senator Hollings introduced a bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934, in order to \"protect the privacy interests of residential telephone subscribers by placing restrictions on unsolicited, automated telephone calls to the home and to facilitate interstate commerce by restricting certain uses of facsimile (fax) machines and automatic dialers.\" S. Rep. No. 102-178, at 1. This bill became the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As originally enacted, the TCPA placed restrictions on the use of automated telephone equipment, including automatic telephone dialing systems and telephone facsimile machines. The statute defined \"automatic telephone dialing systems\" (ATDS) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) The term 'automatic telephone dialing system' means equipment which has the capacity-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (A) to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (B) to dial such numbers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pub. L. No. 102-243, \u00a7 227,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Stat.%202394\">\n    105 Stat. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2395. This language established Congress's intent to regulate equipment that is \"automatic,\" and that has \"the capacity\" to function in two specified ways: \"to\n   store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator\" and \"to dial\" those telephone numbers. Although the TCPA has been amended several times since its original enactment, Congress has never revised the definition of an ATDS. Therefore, Congress's decision to regulate only those devices which have the aforementioned functions, capacity, and ability to function automatically remains unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The TCPA prohibited the use of an ATDS to make \"any call (other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party) using any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice\" to emergency telephone lines, hospital rooms or other health care facilities, and paging and cellular telephones.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) (1991). It also prohibited the use of an ATDS \"in such a way that two or more telephone lines of a multi-line business are engaged simultaneously.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227(b)(1)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As required by the TCPA,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227(b)(2), in 1992 the FCC promulgated rules to implement the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel.

The FCC did not elaborate on the functions of an ATDS and its definition merely tracked the statutory definition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20FCC%20Rcd%208752\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8755 n.6, 8792.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It was not until ten years later that the FCC realized that \"the telemarketing industry ha[d] undergone significant changes in the technologies and methods used to contact consumers,\" and such marketplace changes warranted modifications to the existing rules.\n   <em>\n    Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,014, 14,017 (2003) (\n   <em>\n    2003 Order\n   </em>\n   ). In particular, the FCC was concerned about the proliferating use of the predictive dialer, which is \"an automated dialing system that uses a complex set of algorithms to automatically dial consumers' telephone numbers in a manner that 'predicts' the time when a consumer will answer the phone and a telemarketer will be available to take the call.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,022 n.31. Unlike the automated telemarketing devices prevalent in the early 1990s, which dialed a random or sequential block of numbers, predictive dialers generally automatically dialed a list of numbers that had been preprogrammed and stored in the dialer, or were downloaded from a computer database.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    at 14,090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In order to determine whether the TCPA applied to this new technology, the FCC had to assess whether the predictive dialer qualified as an ATDS. This required consideration of the statutory definition: whether the equipment was \"automatic\" and whether it had the capacity to function in the two relevant ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In a series of rulings, from 2003 to 2015, the FCC determined that predictive dialers and other new technology qualified as an ATDS, even if they did not generally generate or store random or sequential numbers. In its 2003 ruling, the FCC reasoned that a predictive dialer may have the \"capacity\" to dial random and sequential numbers, even if it was not currently being used for such a purpose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    at 14,091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FCC acknowledged the telemarketing industry's argument that predictive dialers do not fall within the statutory\n   definition of ATDS because they \"do not dial numbers 'randomly or sequentially,' \" but nevertheless concluded that predictive dialers' \"hardware, when paired with certain software, ha[d] the capacity to store or produce numbers and dial those numbers at random, in sequential order, or from a database of numbers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    at 14,090-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In its later 2015 order, the FCC went even further, and determined that a device could have the requisite capacity if it had any potential to be configured for that purpose.\n   <em>\n    Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. 7961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7974 (2015) (\n   <em>\n    2015 Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n   ) (holding that \"the capacity of an autodialer is not limited to its current configuration but also includes its potential functionalities\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, the FCC suggested that a device could qualify as an ATDS even if it entirely lacked the capacity to dial numbers randomly or sequentially. Thus in its 2012 ruling, the FCC stated that the definition of an ATDS \"covers any equipment that has the specified\n   <em>\n    capacity\n   </em>\n   to generate numbers and dial them without human intervention regardless of whether the numbers called are randomly or sequentially generated or come from calling lists.\"\n   <em>\n    Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel.

The FCC's subsequent 2015 ruling, however, made the contrary suggestion that a device would not meet the definition of an ATDS unless it had the capacity to dial random or sequential numbers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    2015 Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at 7971-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We reaffirm our previous statements that dialing equipment generally has the capacity to store or produce, and dial random or sequential numbers (and thus meets the TCPA's definition of 'autodialer') even if it is not presently used for that purpose, including when the caller is calling a set list of consumers.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The FCC relied on policy and legislative history to support its application of the definition of ATDS to new technology. The FCC reasoned that \"through the TCPA, Congress was attempting to alleviate a particular problem-an increasing number of automated and prerecorded calls to certain categories of numbers,\" and therefore Congress intended for any device that had the basic function of being automatic, i.e., had \"the\n   <em>\n    capacity\n   </em>\n   to dial numbers without human intervention,\"\n   <em>\n    2003 Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. at 14,092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to be regulated under the TCPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the FCC thought that it was clear \"that Congress anticipated that the FCC, under its TCPA rulemaking authority, might need to consider changes in technologies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the FCC concluded that an interpretation of the statutory definition of ATDS which excluded new technology that could automatically dial thousands of numbers merely because it \"relies on a given set of numbers would lead to an unintended result\" and fail to effectuate the purpose of the statutory requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After the FCC's 2015 ruling, a large number of regulated entities challenged the FCC's definition of an ATDS in the D.C. and Seventh Circuits, and the petitions were consolidated in the D.C.

In challenging the 2015 order, petitioners argued that they had not received the clarification they sought, asserting specifically that the FCC erred in concluding that equipment that merely had the potential future capacity to function as an autodialer, taking into account possible upgrades or modifications, met the statutory definition of ATDS.\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Circuit concluded that the FCC's explanation of the functions of an ATDS was inadequate. The court explained that \"[a] basic question raised by the statutory definition is whether a device must\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   have the ability to generate random or sequential telephone numbers to be dialed,\" or whether it would be \"enough if the device can call from a database of telephone numbers generated elsewhere.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FCC had stated that a device qualified as an ATDS\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   it could generate random or sequential numbers to be dialed, but also indicated that a device which could only dial numbers from a stored list also qualified as an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    at 701-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While \"[i]t might be permissible for the Commission to adopt either interpretation,\" the D.C. Circuit held that \"the Commission cannot, consistent with reasoned decisionmaking, espouse both competing interpretations in the same order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The D.C. Circuit also noted that the 2015 ruling lacked clarity on whether an autodialer\n   must dial numbers without human intervention. Although the FCC indicated that \"the 'basic function[ ]' of an autodialer is to 'dial numbers without human intervention,' \" it declined a request to clarify that a dialer must have such a feature.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    2015 Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7975 ). Because \"[t]he order's lack of clarity about which functions qualify a device as an autodialer compounds the unreasonableness of the Commission's expansive understanding of when a device has the 'capacity' to perform the necessary functions,\" the court \"set aside the Commission's treatment of those matters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We now turn to the facts of this case. The device at issue in this appeal is called the Textmunication system, which is a web-based marketing platform designed to send promotional text messages to a list of stored telephone numbers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Phone numbers are captured and stored in one of three ways: An operator of the Textmunication system may manually enter a phone number into the system; a current or potential customer may respond to a marketing campaign with a text (which automatically provides the customer's phone number); or a customer may provide a phone number by filling out a consent form on a Textmunication client's website. A client of Textmunication can then design a marketing campaign that, for example, offers customers free passes and personal training sessions, provides appointment reminders and class updates, or sends birthday greetings, and the Textmunication system will automatically send the desired messages to the stored phone numbers at a time scheduled by the client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Crunch Fitness communicates with its prospective and current gym members by sending text messages through this Textmunication system. When Crunch wants to send a text message to its current or prospective customers, a Crunch employee logs into the Textmunication system, selects the recipient phone numbers, generates the content of the message, and selects the date and time for the message to be sent. The Textmunication system will then automatically send the text messages to the selected phone numbers at the appointed time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Jordan Marks signed up for a gym membership with Crunch Fitness in 2012. After joining the gym, Marks received three text messages from Crunch over a period of eleven months. Marks's phone carrier charged him incoming tolls for each of these text messages. In February 2014, Marks filed a putative class action complaint against Crunch, alleging violations of \u00a7 227(b) of the TCPA. He claimed that Crunch \"negligently contact[ed] [him] on [his] cellular telephone, in violation of the [TCPA], thereby invading [his] privacy.\" Marks alleged that the text messages were sent using an ATDS which has \"the capacity to send text messages to cellular telephone numbers from a list of telephone numbers automatically and without human intervention.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Crunch on the ground that the Textmunication system did not qualify as an ATDS because it presently lacked a random or sequential number generator, and did not have the potential capacity to add such a feature. Because it defined an ATDS as necessarily including a random or sequential number generator, the court did not consider the declaration\n   of Marks's expert witness, Jeffrey Hansen, stating that the Textmunication system called numbers from a stored list. The court therefore denied Crunch's motion to exclude Hansen's testimony as moot. Marks timely appealed. We vacated submission of Marks's appeal pending the issuance of\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   was issued, we ordered supplemental briefing to address the impact of the D.C.

The question is whether, in order to be an ATDS, a device must dial numbers generated by a random or sequential number generator or if a device can be an ATDS if it merely dials numbers from a stored list.

Circuit apparently agreed, stating that \"[i]t might be permissible\" for the FCC to adopt an interpretation that a device had to generate random or sequential numbers in order to be an ATDS, or that a device could be an ATDS if it was limited to dialing numbers from a stored list.\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 702-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore turn to other aids in statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because the statutory language is ambiguous, we look at the context and the structure of the statutory scheme. The structure and context of the TCPA as originally enacted indicate that Congress intended to regulate devices that make automatic calls. Although Congress focused on regulating the use of equipment that dialed blocks of sequential or randomly generated numbers-a common technology at that time-language in the statute indicates that equipment that made automatic calls from lists of recipients was also covered by the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This conclusion is supported by provisions in the TCPA allowing an ATDS to call selected numbers. For instance, the TCPA permitted use of autodialers for a call \"made with the prior express consent of the called party.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) (1991). To take advantage of this permitted use, an autodialer would have to dial from a list of phone numbers of persons who had consented to such calls, rather than merely dialing a block of random or sequential numbers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress's 2015 amendment to the TCPA provides additional information about Congress's views on the scope of the definition of ATDS. After the FCC issued its 2015 order, Congress added language to \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A)(iii), exempting the use of an ATDS to make calls \"solely to collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States.\" Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-74, \u00a7 301,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Stat.%20584\">\n    129 Stat. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588 (codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii) ). Like the exception allowing the use of an autodialer to make calls \"with the prior express consent of the called party,\" this debt collection exception demonstrates that equipment that dials from a list of individuals who owe a debt to the United States is still an ATDS but is exempted from the TCPA's strictures. Moreover, in amending this section, Congress left the definition of ATDS untouched, even though the FCC's prior orders interpreted this definition to include devices that could dial numbers from a stored list. We \"presume that when Congress amends a statute, it is knowledgeable about judicial decisions interpreting the prior legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

Because we infer that Congress was aware of the existing definition of ATDS, its decision not to amend the statutory definition of ATDS to overrule the FCC's interpretation suggests Congress gave the interpretation its tacit approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lorillard v.

Accordingly, we read \u00a7 227(a)(1) to provide that the term automatic telephone dialing system means equipment which has the capacity-(1) to store numbers to be called or (2) to produce numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator-and to dial such numbers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We also reject Crunch's argument that a device cannot qualify as an ATDS unless it is fully automatic, meaning that it must operate without any human intervention whatsoever. By referring to the relevant device as an \"\n   <em>\n    automatic\n   </em>\n   telephone\n   <em>\n    dialing\n   </em>\n   system,\" Congress made clear that it was targeting equipment that could engage in automatic\n   <em>\n    dialing\n   </em>\n   , rather than equipment that operated without any human oversight or control.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" '[A]uto' in autodialer-or, equivalently, 'automatic' in 'automatic telephone dialing system,'\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) -would seem to envision non-manual dialing of telephone numbers.\"). Common sense indicates that human intervention of some sort is required before an autodialer can begin making calls, whether turning on the machine or initiating its\n   functions. Congress was clearly aware that, at the very least, a human has to flip the switch on an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    See The Automated Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Commc'ns of the Comm. on Commerce, Sci., and Transp.\n   </em>\n   , 102nd Cong. 15 (1991) (statement of Robert Bulmash, President, Private Citizen, Inc.) (describing a pitch for autodialers in a telemarketing magazine as stating: \"You come home from work[, and] turn on the machine, just like turning on a radio.\"). Crunch does not dispute that the Textmunication system dials numbers automatically, and therefore it has the automatic dialing function necessary to qualify as an ATDS, even though humans, rather than machines, are needed to add phone numbers to the Textmunication platform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Because we read \u00a7 227(a)(1) to provide that the term \"automatic telephone dialing system\" means equipment which has the capacity-(1) to store numbers to be called or (2) to produce numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator-and to dial such numbers automatically (even if the system must be turned on or triggered by a person), we conclude there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Textmunication system is an ATDS. The evidence in the record shows that the Textmunication system stores numbers and dials them automatically to send text messages to a stored list of phone numbers as part of scheduled campaigns.
