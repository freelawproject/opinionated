His appeal requires us to resolve three matters of first impression for our Court: (1) what showing an inmate must make to establish that administrative remedies were not \"available\" within the meaning of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"); (2) whether the PLRA's exhaustion requirement is satisfied where a prison administrator elects to resolve a procedurally improper administrative request on the merits; and (3) whether a prison's housing and cellmate assignments meet the discretionary function exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act's limited waiver of sovereign immunity. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court's dismissal of Rinaldi's complaint in part and will vacate and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Between November 2011 and 2012, while housed at Lewisburg, Rinaldi filed a number of administrative requests, including one related to an alleged assault and one related to alleged retaliation. He initiated his assault claim with an \"informal resolution,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   dated January 29, 2012, alleging that he had been assaulted by a previous cellmate (Cellmate #1), and \"requesting the institution discontinue its practice of forcing inmates to cell together [ ] regardless of their compatibility.\" JA 160. On February 1, after that informal request was denied, Rinaldi filed a formal request (the \"Assault Request\"), which the Institution eventually denied on the ground that there was \"no basis for [Rinaldi's] accusations.\" JA 165.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following day, February 2, Rinaldi was transferred to another unit. According to Rinaldi's complaint, Appellee Counselor Baysore had previously warned Rinaldi that unless he stopped filing requests, \"she would have him moved to a different unit and placed in a cell with an inmate who was known for assaulting his cellmates,\" and Appellee Officer Gee, who conducted the transfer, told Rinaldi that the reason he was being moved was because he \"didn't listen\" to those warnings. JA 61. Despite his protests, Rinaldi was transferred and placed in a cell with a new cellmate (Cellmate #2), who, Rinaldi alleges, threatened him by informing Lewisburg personnel, including Officer Gee and Counselor Baysore, \"that if Rinaldi were placed in the cell he would kill [him].\" JA 61. Over the course of the next three weeks, Rinaldi asserts he \"suffered cuts and bruises and emotional distress\" from several physical altercations with Cellmate #2. JA 61\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rinaldi sought administrative relief for the alleged retaliatory transfer on February 2, but because he allegedly was concerned\n   about the risk of further retaliation, he opted not to file an informal resolution or initial retaliatory transfer request directly with the Institution. Instead, he followed the procedure for \"Sensitive\" requests, filing this claim (the \"Retaliation Request\") directly with the Regional Director. According to BOP records, the Retaliation Request was rejected as procedurally improper with directions to first file it at the Institution, which Rinaldi declined to do.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Separately, Rinaldi also sought to obtain administrative relief for the assault by Cellmate #2. Although Rinaldi was required to file an informal resolution and formal request with the Institution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   he did not do so. Rather, as he was then poised to appeal the denial of his original Assault Request (concerning Cellmate #1) to the Regional Director, he simply incorporated allegations as to both Cellmate #1 and Cellmate #2 into his appeal. As a result, the Regional Director could have rejected that appeal, at least as to Cellmate #2, on procedural grounds for failure to exhaust because his claim as to Cellmate #2 was never presented to the Institution in the first instance. Instead, however, he issued a decision that acknowledged that the appeal raised claims concerning the assaults by Cellmates #1 and #2 and rejected\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   claims on the merits. As the Regional Director put it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   You appeal the response from the Warden at USP Lewisburg and claim you were forced into a cell with another inmate who you allege threatened to kill you prior to being placed in the same cell. You also state you were once assaulted by a previous cellmate and received injuries ... [T]here is no record of you being assaulted by your previous or current cellmate ... Accordingly, your appeal is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   JA 168.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Unable to obtain redress through the BOP grievance process, Rinaldi, initially proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed a complaint in the Middle District of Pennsylvania raising three claims relevant to this appeal: (1) a First Amendment claim based on the retaliatory conduct alleged in the Retaliation Request; (2) an Eighth Amendment claim based on the cell placement and resulting attack by Cellmate #2 alleged in his appeal of the Assault Request; and (3) a claim pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against the United States for negligently placing Rinaldi with a cellmate that prison personnel knew or should have known would assault him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The District Court granted the Government's \"Motion to Dismiss or, in the alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment,\" concluding (1) the First Amendment claim was barred by the PLRA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), because Rinaldi had declined to file his Retaliation Request with the Institution and thus had not exhausted the Retaliation Request; (2) the Eighth Amendment claim covering the assault by Cellmate #2 was likewise unexhausted because Rinaldi failed to file an initial request and raised it only in the appeal of his Assault Request; and (3) the Court did not have jurisdiction over the FTCA claim because cellmate assignments fall within the discretionary function exception to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Rinaldi v.

As the\n   <em>\n    Tuckel\n   </em>\n   Court explained, the objective requirement allows courts to easily weed out suits that attempt to circumvent the PLRA, such as where \"a threat ... was allegedly made\n   years prior to the inmate's suit\" or \"an inmate is no longer held in the prison in which he experienced retaliatory violence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843520\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/1249/#p1252\">\n    660 F.3d at 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \"demonstrating that an official objectively chilled an inmate from relying on administrative remedies presents a significant challenge in any context,\" the objective prong leaves \"little incentive for an inmate to assert baseless retaliation claims rather than simply utilizing a grievance procedure,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., and it instead filters for those threats so serious as to lead a rational inmate to forego the benefits of administrative review,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363084\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/982/#p986\">\n    807 F.3d at 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the inmate failed to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   's objective prong where there was no \"basis in the record from which the district court could determine that a reasonable prisoner of ordinary firmness would have understood the prison official's actions to threaten retaliation if the prisoner chose to utilize the prison's grievance system\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   But the subjective component also has a role to play.

Accepting the allegation that Rinaldi's continued resistance to the grievance process is what led prison authorities to house him with a cellmate they knew threatened to kill him, we have little trouble concluding that \"a reasonable inmate of ordinary firmness and fortitude\" would be \"deter[red] ... from lodging a grievance or pursuing the part of the grievance process that the inmate failed to exhaust.\"\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752465\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/1077/#p1084\">\n    541 F.3d at 1084-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Government conceded as much at oral argument. The Government disputes, however, whether Rinaldi was subjectively deterred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Because the District Court did not have the benefit of the test we announce today and because we had not yet clarified in\n   <em>\n    Paladino\n   </em>\n   what procedures are required when a district court must resolve factual disputes relevant to exhaustion, the District Court did not have occasion to determine whether Rinaldi made the requisite showing of subjective deterrence. Nonetheless, the Government urges that we should affirm, rather than remand, because the record reflects that Rinaldi filed a number of grievances after the allegedly retaliatory transfer-a circumstance that the Government contends, in effect, negates subjective deterrence as a matter of law. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As the Seventh Circuit has observed, the \"ability to take advantage of administrative grievances is not an 'either-or' proposition.

Thus, the court concluded, it \"was unrealistic to expect [the inmate] to file a grievance against the very people who were threatening retaliation and preventing him from obtaining the proper forms,\" and the fact that an inmate files unrelated claims \"does not prove that remedies were available within the system\" for purposes of exhaustion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386198\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/678/#p684\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386198\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/678/#p684\">\n    at 685-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That observation holds true in this case, where Rinaldi's willingness to file grievances concerning unrelated and far less inflammatory subjects like cleaning supplies is hardly dispositive of whether he was subjectively deterred from pursuing his Retaliation Request at the Institution. Indeed, the Government has not identified any subsequent grievance that can be characterized as substantially similar to his Retaliation Request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court's dismissal of Rinaldi's First Amendment claim, and will remand for the District Court to consider subjective deterrence in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Rinaldi's Eighth Amendment Assault Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Rinaldi also challenges the District Court's dismissal of his Eighth Amendment claim for failure to exhaust.

This holding also satisfies the \"three interrelated objectives\" of exhaustion: \"(1) to return control of the inmate grievance process to prison administrators; (2) to encourage development of an administrative record, and perhaps settlements, within the inmate grievance process; and (3) to reduce the burden on the\n   federal courts by erecting barriers to frivolous prisoner lawsuits.\" Dissent at 277 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Spruill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9231025\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/218/#p226\">\n    372 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   230 ). That is, precisely because we recognize that control over the grievance process is appropriately vested in prison administrators and that such administrators are best positioned to ascertain the need for further development of the administrative record, we should not be second-guessing their decisions on the relative efficiencies of (a) rejecting a claim and requiring it to be re-initiated at the institution level, versus (b) opting to research it, to the extent needed, at the appellate level and addressing it on the merits. And when the prison chooses the latter course, as it did here, making clear with its merits decision what the inevitable result would be of a re-initiated claim, then treating the claim as exhausted does not increase \"the burden on the federal courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Spruill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9231025\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/218/#p226\">\n    372 F.3d at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It simply avoids subjecting prisoners and prison administrators alike to a futile exercise and provides judicial review of the prison's final decision on the merits. In short, where the prison has chosen to forgo a rejection on procedural grounds and has elected to research, analyze, and deny a claim on the merits, both the purposes of exhaustion-and exhaustion itself-are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, we are in good company. Other Courts of Appeals too have held that merits review satisfies exhaustion under the PLRA and that, because PLRA exhaustion turns on the remedies and grievance procedures that the particular prison has available, treating a claim as exhausted where a prison chooses not to enforce those procedures does not contravene the PLRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reyes v.

I recognize the well-established exceptions to exhaustion in habeas corpus and administrative law.

Rinaldi requested that the institution discontinue its practice of forcing inmates to cell together regardless of compatibility because \"[f]orced double celling creates a hostile environment and increases the incidence of assaults.\" JA 164. The informal request was denied and Rinaldi filed Request for Administrative Remedy #675165 (BP-9). This request was denied by the Warden on the grounds that \"[a]ll inmates are screened for compatibility prior to placement.\" JA 165.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Rinaldi appealed to the Northeast Regional Office. At this stage in the institutional review process (BP-10), Rinaldi introduced a new claim that, on February 2, 2012, he was celled with an inmate who had threatened to kill him. Rinaldi framed this as evidence that the Warden's reason for denying his remedy request-that inmates are screened for compatibility-was untrue, noting he had provided his case manager with the names of other inmates he \"would like to cell with.\" JA 167. The Regional Office denied his appeal, reasoning that inmate compatibility is considered and there was \"no record of [Rinaldi] being assaulted by [his] previous or current cellmate.\" JA 168. Rinaldi then appealed to the General Counsel, who denied the appeal and closed the case with the code \"DNY.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Thereafter, Rinaldi filed suit in federal court, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . As relevant here, Rinaldi alleged that being forced to cell with an inmate who had threatened to kill him violated his Eighth Amendment rights. The District Court dismissed the claim for Rinaldi's failure to exhaust because the BOP's regulations prohibit an inmate from raising issues for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20542.15\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).

Now, however, Rinaldi alleges that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated when, on February 2, 2012, he was celled with an inmate who had threatened to kill him and appeals the District Court's decision that this specific allegation was not exhausted. Rinaldi argues the District Court erred in dismissing this claim because the Regional Director's response (BP-10) addressed on the merits both the allegation he was assaulted by a previous cellmate and the allegation he was threatened by his subsequent cellmate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   My colleagues conclude Rinaldi's Eighth Amendment claim was exhausted because, even though he raised its factual predicate for the first time midway through the grievance process, his grievance was denied on the merits at the highest level.

This is not a case where the grievance bears some procedural defect, but the substance of the grievance is nevertheless considered at all administrative steps (for example, the initial filing was untimely or an appeal deadline was missed but these errors were overlooked). In such a case, the prisoner has used all steps the agency holds out, complying with the agency's \"critical rules,\" and the administrative remedy system functions effectively as if no defect were present. But here, Rinaldi raised the factual basis for his current Eighth Amendment claim only midway through the grievance process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As for the PLRA, we have described the \"three interrelated objectives\" of exhaustion as follows: \"(1) to return control of the inmate grievance process to prison administrators; (2) to encourage development of an administrative record, and perhaps settlements, within the inmate grievance process; and (3) to reduce the burden on the federal courts by erecting barriers to frivolous prisoner lawsuits.\"\n   <em>\n    Spruill v.

The Supreme Court has reasoned, in\n   <em>\n    Woodford\n   </em>\n   , that exhaustion gives the agency \"an opportunity\n   to correct its own mistakes with respect to the programs it administers,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p97\">\n    548 U.S. at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p97\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and promotes efficiency-\"[a] prisoner who does not want to participate in the prison grievance system will have little incentive to comply with the system's procedural rules unless noncompliance carries a sanction,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p97\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p97\">\n    at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p97\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These purposes are best served by requiring that the substance of the grievance be addressed at every available stage of the administrative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Take, for example, the goal of developing an administrative record. If the procedural defect is that an inmate interjects a claim at the final stage of the BOP's remedy process, then a denial with the code \"DNY\" would suffice to have exhausted that claim on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this scenario there is no creation of an administrative record. The administrative record is also not fully developed where, as here, a claim is interjected midway through the BOP's review process. As for compliance with critical procedural rules, there is less incentive for a prisoner to pursue separate grievances through all stages of review if a claim (or, as here, facts supporting a different claim) can instead potentially be added at the final hurdle. Finally, requiring a grievance to have been considered on the merits at all available stages of review makes it more likely a particular institution will have the full opportunity to address and correct a grievance because the institution itself will be put on notice first. The first step of the BOP's remedy program is designed to allow staff an opportunity to \"informally resolve the issue\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   an inmate submits a Request for Administrative Remedy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20542.13\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Analogies to well-established exceptions in habeas and administrative law are useful.
