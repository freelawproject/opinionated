The court noted the motion court's description of the insufficient pleading, including that the \"Movant's narrative does not connect a specific portion of the narrative to a particular witness, does not allege that counsel was informed of their existence, and does not state that any of these witnesses were available to testify.\" The court further noted that the motion's court cited established precedent in Missouri that spelled out these specific requirements for a rule 29.15 motion. The court pointed to the testimony of Mr. Tucci, one of Barnett's motion's attorneys, that although he was satisfied with the narrative form of the petition at the time, he now believes it was not properly drafted. The court also was influenced by the fact that, given an invitation to correct the deficient pleadings when the state moved to dismiss, Barnett's counsel chose not to file a response. Testimony from both of Barnett's post-conviction counsel was that they take great pains to make sure that they now identify witnesses with descriptions of their proposed testimony, show that the witnesses were available to testify, and inform the court that the witnesses would have been discovered through proper investigation. The court's findings of fact are supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous. The findings support the court's conclusion that \"the technical inadequacies, combined with the ease with which those inadequacies could have been avoided or neutralized, constitute deficient performance under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   \" and the performance \"fell 'below an objective standard of the customary skill and diligence displayed by a reasonably competent attorney.' \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2013662176\">\n    2015 WL 13662176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *75-76 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

In its memorandum decision following the evidentiary hearing, the district court noted that although Barnett's original Ground I alleged ineffective assistance of counsel \"for failing to investigate and provide information about the petitioner's background-specifically regarding his mother and her family,\" the parties agreed at the evidentiary hearing that the court would hear evidence unrelated to Barnett's biological family. The court noted that \"[b]oth parties agreed they were treating the case as 'a very general ineffective assistance of counsel penalty phase claim.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties' agreement is reflected in the record.

In his 60(b) motion, Barnett sought review of Ground I because the merits of his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim were never addressed by any court. The district court originally denied the review, concluding it was a successive petition that required authorization by this court. In granting Barnett's rule 59(e) motion as to Ground I, the district court concluded that the rule 60(b) motion as to Ground I did not state a new claim for habeas relief, but attacked the procedural bar to hearing the original claim. Barnett's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to investigate his background and family was never addressed on the merits prior to the district court's evidentiary hearing following the grant of the rule 59(e) motion. Prior to\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , the ineffective assistance of his post-conviction counsel would not have provided cause for overcoming the procedural default due to the deficient post-conviction pleadings. It is apparent that\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   does not require that the ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel be first addressed by the state court.
