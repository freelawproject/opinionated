This process consists of an interview before a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") asylum officer to make a preliminary determination of reasonable fear. If the asylum officer makes a negative reasonable fear determination, the alien may request a de novo review hearing by an immigration judge (\"IJ\") of the asylum officer's determination. These reasonable fear proceedings, as outlined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1208.31, are intended to provide a fair determination of whether an alien has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, which fear would require the alien to be referred to an IJ to review eligibility for withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). However, these reasonable fear proceedings are to be streamlined, not intended to have full evidentiary hearings, because the alien continues to be subject to the expedited removal process used for previously removed aliens with reinstated orders of removal. Thus, an IJ's failure specifically to address all of the evidence and claims before him or her (during the reasonable fear review proceedings) does not violate the alien's due process rights. Nevertheless, an IJ's failure to recognize that he or she has\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   authority to reopen\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   matter in which he or she made a decision (including reasonable fear review hearings) is an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Congress has authorized the expedited removal of aliens if \"an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed ... under an order of removal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5).

He first entered the United States in 1994 illegally and without any governmental permission. He applied for asylum, which was denied. He was thereafter deported from the United States in February 2008. In June 2008, Bartolome attempted to reenter the United States. However, DHS found him to be inadmissible and ordered his expedited removal. After removal, he remained in Guatemala until 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In February 2015, Bartolome illegally reentered the United States. In March 2015, DHS served Bartolome a Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order. In response, Bartolome expressed a fear of persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala. Based on his asserted fear, he was referred to an asylum officer for a reasonable fear interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 6, 2015, Bartolome and his attorney appeared before the asylum officer, and the asylum officer interviewed Bartolome. Bartolome explained to the officer that he feared returning to Guatemala, because gangs had extorted him. He claimed that gang members thought he had money, because his family resided in the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bartolome also feared that he could be subject to persecution because his brother was involved in politics in Guatemala.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the interview, the asylum officer issued a negative reasonable fear determination. Although the asylum officer found Bartolome credible, he concluded that Bartolome had failed to establish a reasonable possibility that he would be persecuted or subjected to torture upon his return. Bartolome then requested that an IJ review the asylum officer's negative reasonable fear determination. On May 14, 2015, the matter was referred to an IJ. The initial reasonable fear review hearing was scheduled for May 19, 2015. However, it was continued until May 22, 2015, to allow Bartolome's attorney time to prepare and to secure an appropriate interpreter. Prior to the hearing, Bartolome submitted additional documents in support of his claim that he has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture in Guatemala.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 22, 2015, Bartolome appeared with counsel before the IJ. Bartolome testified that he feared harm in Guatemala by local residents, who blamed him for damages caused by a civil engineering water project he was elected to oversee. He also claimed again that gang members had extorted him, because they believed he had money. After the IJ finished asking Bartolome questions, he asked Bartolome's counsel whether \"there's anything else she would like [him], as the Judge, to consider.\" Counsel referenced letters and statements and death threats. The IJ further questioned Bartolome regarding the threats. The IJ then inquired again whether there were any other areas of inquiry. Bartolome's counsel said there were none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At that point, the IJ concluded that the asylum officer correctly decided that Bartolome was ineligible for withholding of removal. The IJ explained that Bartolome was not eligible for withholding of removal based on the evidence presented. Specifically, the IJ noted that withholding of removal was not available, because (1) the threats by villagers surrounding the damages caused from the water project and the threats by gang members have no nexus to a protected ground, and (2) there was no evidence that the government would not help him with the villagers or the gangs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The IJ then issued the following written statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court concurs in the DHS Reasonable Fear Determination because Respondent's fear of possible civil liability for a village project he was elected to oversee, and fear of being harmed or killed by gang members who tried to extort money have no connection or nexus to a protected ground and there is no danger or evidence of torture risk from\n   government or with its acquiescence. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The case is returned to DHS for removal of the alien. This is a final order.

The IJ rejected the motion to reopen, concluding that \"[t]he court has no authority over this motion. It is returned. Only DHS has authority to consider this motion.\" Bartolome also separately requested that the USCIS reconsider its findings. USCIS responded that \"reasonable fear screening determinations are not subject to motions to reopen or reconsider\"; while it recognized it had sua sponte authority to reopen, it declined to do so in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Bartolome timely appealed the IJ's negative reasonable fear determination, and the IJ's rejection of his motion to reopen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We have jurisdiction to review \"[a]n IJ's negative determination regarding the alien's reasonable fear\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1).\n   <em>\n    Andrade-Garcia v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, a review of the asylum officer's notes shows that Bartolome indicated that he understood \"a lot\" of Spanish, \"but there [were] some words\" he did not know. He also consented to proceeding in Spanish and was provided a Spanish-language interpreter. The asylum officer made it clear that, if Bartolome did not understand something, he should tell the asylum officer. Bartolome agreed. At the conclusion of the hearing, the asylum officer asked Bartolome whether he had any problems understanding the interpreter, to which Bartolome stated he had none.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The asylum officer also read back the summary of Bartolome's testimony to Bartolome. When asked whether he had any corrections or changes to make to the asylum officer's summary, Bartolome stated that the summary was correct and did not request to add anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although Bartolome now argues that he was unable to present his whole story, he does not specifically indicate (outside of vague references to his political activities) what evidence he was unable to present. Further, the record does not demonstrate that Bartolome was prevented (based on\n   the interview in Spanish) from providing the evidence that establishes that he fears returning to Guatemala.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, even if there were evidence of error, any possible error was or could have been remedied before the IJ in the reasonable fear review hearing. In this case, after the asylum officer concluded Bartolome did not have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, Bartolome requested that an IJ conduct a reasonable fear review hearing, which applies de novo review. \"De novo review means that the [IJ] does not defer to the [asylum officer's] ruling but freely considers the matter anew, as if no decision had been rendered below.\"\n   <em>\n    Dawson v. Marshall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480148\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/930/#p933\">\n    561 F.3d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 933 (9th Cir. 2009) (alterations, quotation marks, and citation omitted). In conducting the reasonable fear review hearing, the IJ reviewed all of the previously produced evidence, along with the asylum officers notes; heard additional testimony from Bartolome in his native tongue; and accepted additional documents supporting his claim. The IJ then issued his decision after having considered all of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Lastly, both the asylum officer and the IJ found Bartolome to be credible and credited Bartolome's testimony. Bartolome was able to provide all additional details about his reasonable fear of persecution to the IJ.

However, the government has an obligation not to remove persons who may be subject to persecution or torture.

None of these claims have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A.

Extensive proof is not needed; rather an IJ need only determine whether there is at least a ten percent chance that the alien \"would be persecuted on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, or a reasonable possibility that he or she would be tortured in the country of removal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 1208.31(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, although an IJ may allow an alien to submit evidence to support his or her claim,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.42\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), the IJ is not required to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In accordance with these guidelines, the IJ reviewed the asylum officer's file and allowed Bartolome to testify in his native language and to present additional evidence (including statements from his wife and brother) prior to making his decision. Although Bartolome now argues that the IJ did not allow him to present evidence at a hearing, we can find no merit in that argument as Bartolome presented evidence at the hearing. Bartolome also made no effort to call any other witnesses. As to a prehearing statement, even assuming that Bartolome attempted to file a prehearing statement (which is not in the record), the IJ would have been within his or her discretion to disallow it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Bartolome was also provided more time than allowed by the regulations. A short continuance was granted to obtain a Chuj-language interpreter and to allow Bartolome's counsel to prepare. After the brief continuance was granted, neither Bartolome nor his attorney requested additional time to obtain supporting evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B. Reasonable fear review hearings again are not full evidentiary hearings. Like reinstatement orders, reasonable fear review proceedings are intended to be expedited and efficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales-Izquierdo v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3117085\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/484/#p489\">\n    486 F.3d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489-91 (9th Cir. 2007). In expedited proceedings (such as these), IJs do not have the ability nor are they required to provide detailed decisions outlining all the claims\n   raised by the alien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Immigration Court Practice Manual, ch. 7.4(e)(iv)(E). Instead, they review the evidence provided by the asylum officer, along with any new evidence or testimony provided, and issue a \"special order for reasonable fear review proceedings.\" OPPM No. 99-5 \u00b6 IV(D) (\"order X8\"). Here, the IJ made his conclusions without addressing all the evidence or claims before him. As a result, Bartolome assumes the IJ ignored the evidence and hence asserts that the IJ violated his right to a fair hearing. We disagree with this assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, the IJ noted that he considered all of the evidence, and concluded that he would not change the asylum officer's decision. We have no basis to assume that the IJ failed to consider the evidence before him. Although the IJ did not address all of the evidence and claims specifically, he concluded that Bartolome's activities and the incidents with gang members had no connection or nexus to a protected ground, and there was no \"danger or evidence of torture risk\" with government acquiescence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Where, as here, the evidence in the record does not compel a conclusion that the IJ erred in concluding that Bartolome did not establish a reasonable fear of persecution,\n   <em>\n    Andrade-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336342\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/829/#p833\">\n    828 F.3d at 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we cannot find Bartolome's due process claim that the IJ ignored evidence has merit,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larita-Martinez v. INS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11212336\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/1092/#p1095\">\n    220 F.3d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1095-96 (9th Cir. 2000) (\"[A]n alien attempting to establish that the Board violated his right to due process by failing to consider relevant evidence must overcome the presumption that it did review the evidence.\"). Reviewing for substantial evidence, the record supports the IJ's decision. Bartolome asserts three separate reasons for fearing return to Guatemala: (1) gang violence, (2) his participation in the water project, and (3) his brother's political activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Reviewing the testimony and the evidence submitted, substantial evidence supports the conclusion that none of these reasons provide a basis for withholding of removal. First, gangs did not target Bartolome based on a protected ground. Rather, the gangs targeted him because they perceived him to have money, which we have not recognized as a cognizable social group.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Munoz v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175314\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/1226/#p1229\">\n    816 F.3d 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1229 (9th Cir. 2016). Second, threats based on Bartolome's involvement in the installation of water pipes and a sewer system are not persecution on a protected ground. Although Bartolome attempts to couch the activity as politics, this is not a \"political opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhiqiang Hu v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759934\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/1011/#p1017\">\n    652 F.3d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1017 (9th Cir. 2011). Finally, although an imputed political opinion would be a basis for withholding of removal, Bartolome failed to establish any threat of future persecution based on his brother's membership in the Mano Duro Partido Party. His brother has not been harmed by the opposition party, nor did Bartolome establish that he, himself, was threatened or harmed by the opposition party. Speculation on what could occur is not enough to establish a reasonable fear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nagoulko v. INS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9113391\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/1012/#p1018\">\n    333 F.3d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1018 (9th Cir. 2003). Similarly, Bartolome failed to provide any evidence that he would be or was in danger of being tortured with the acquiescence of the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   C. Lastly, Bartolome argues that he was deprived of a fair hearing, because the IJ displayed bias when he commented that Bartolome might seek legal counsel with regard to his liability for the water project. An alien \"is not denied a fair hearing merely because the [IJ] has a point of view about a question of law or policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Exame\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20303\">\n    18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 306 (BIA 1982). Even if the IJ erred in commenting on how he thought Guatemalan civil liability worked, any error was harmless. Further, substantial evidence nonetheless supports the IJ's conclusion that Bartolome's fear that the villagers would seek him out because of damages caused by the water project is not a protected ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Motion to Reopen\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   No statute or regulation specifically addresses whether an alien may file a motion to reopen reasonable fear proceedings. However, in\n   <em>\n    Ayala v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that the IJ abused its discretion in not reconsidering the petitioner's motion for reconsideration of such proceedings.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277081\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/1012/#p1018\">\n    855 F.3d at 1020-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Ayala\n   </em>\n   filed a motion for reconsideration rather than a motion to reopen, the procedures are the same for both motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.23\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), (3). Nothing in this regulation precludes an alien from filing a motion to reopen before an IJ. To the contrary, \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) provides that an IJ has\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction to reopen \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   case in which he or she has made a decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, Bartolome filed a motion to reopen before the IJ. The IJ rejected the motion, concluding he lacked jurisdiction to reopen the matter. This conclusion is contrary to our holding in\n   <em>\n    Ayala\n   </em>\n   and thus was error. The IJ's failure to recognize that he had at least\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction to reopen proceedings was an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singh v.
