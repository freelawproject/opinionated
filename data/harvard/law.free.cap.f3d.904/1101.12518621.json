The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") concluded that Myers is removable based on his felony conviction under the Travel Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), for traveling in interstate commerce to facilitate an unlawful activity. The unlawful activity facilitated by Myers was identified as \"possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\" The BIA held that Myers is removable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i) because he had been convicted of a controlled substance offense. Myers challenges that conclusion. Although not all convictions under the Travel Act represent violations related to controlled substances, meaning that the statute is not a categorical match to the removal statute, we conclude that the Travel Act is divisible in that respect. We further conclude that Myers's conviction qualifies as a controlled substance offense under the modified categorical approach. As to that issue, we deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Myers also sought relief in the form of cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. The BIA concluded that Myers is ineligible for that relief because he had not been present in the United States prior to the initiation of the removal proceedings against him for the number of years required under the statute. That conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence. The statute states that the relevant time period ends \"when the alien is served a notice to appear.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1). The BIA used the date on which the notice to appear was issued, not the date when it was served on Myers. As a result, we grant the petition for review as to that issue and remand to the agency for consideration of Myers's claim for cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Myers is a citizen of the Philippines. He was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on September 20, 2006, when he was nineteen years old. In 2011 Myers was convicted, following his guilty plea, of one felony count of Interstate Travel in Aid of Racketeering in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). The district court sentenced him to sixty months of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Government commenced removal proceedings against Myers, ultimately alleging three alternative grounds for Myers's removability. The only ground relevant to our decision is the contention that Myers had been convicted of a controlled substance offense. Specifically, the Government alleged that Myers was removable based on his 2011 Travel Act conviction. The relevant subsection of the immigration statute provides for the removal of \"[a]ny alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), other than a single offense involving\n   possession for one's own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") sustained that charge. In a written order filed on February 2, 2016, the IJ noted that Myers did not dispute his criminal conviction for violation of the Travel Act. The IJ held that his conviction was based on a \"conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine\" and concluded that his conviction was related to a controlled substance. The IJ thus decided that Myers was removable as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Myers also sought relief before the IJ in the form of cancellation of removal. The IJ concluded that Myers is ineligible for cancellation of removal, however, as one of the requirements for relief is that the applicant must have lawfully resided in the United States for at least seven years prior to the commencement of the removal proceedings. The IJ found that Myers was admitted to the United States on September 20, 2006, but that removal proceedings started on January 3, 2013, less than seven years later. The IJ therefore ordered Myers removed to the Philippines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Myers appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ's decision on May 3, 2017. The BIA noted that it used the categorical approach to determine that Myers's conviction rendered him removable \"as an alien convicted of violating any law of the United States relating to a federally controlled substance.\" The BIA concluded that a conviction under the Travel Act could be analyzed under the modified categorical approach because the specific act that constituted the \"unlawful activity\" was an element of the Travel Act offense and that a jury was required to agree on a particular \"unlawful activity\" in order to find the defendant guilty. The BIA also stated that its reading of the Travel Act was supported by the superseding information to which Myers entered his guilty plea. As described by the BIA, that document specified \"that he traveled in interstate commerce with the intent to promote one particular unlawful activity to the exclusion of all others, that is, possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)\" (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Removability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Myers argues that a conviction under the Travel Act is not a controlled substance offense for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i). The Travel Act makes it a crime to travel in interstate or foreign commerce with intent, among other things, to \"promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate ... unlawful activity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). The statute lists the crimes that may constitute an \"unlawful activity\" under the Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). It includes violations of controlled substances laws but also includes a number of crimes other than drug offenses, including gambling, extortion, and arson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because a conviction under the\n   Travel Act does not necessarily mean a conviction for activity relating to controlled substances, Myers contends that his conviction cannot justify his removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To determine whether Myers's Travel Act conviction is a controlled substance offense we use the categorical approach articulated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The plea agreement that Myers signed explicitly stated that charge was the subject of his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As noted above, the Travel Act lists a number of violations that qualify as unlawful acts under the statute. The question here is whether the specific \"unlawful activity\" with which a defendant is charged from the list in \u00a7 1952(b) is an element of the offense. Put another way, the question is whether it is necessary to identify a specific unlawful act to obtain a conviction under the Travel Act, or whether it would be sufficient to conclude that the defendant committed one or more of the crimes listed in \u00a7 1952(b) without specifying or reaching agreement on which crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the Ninth Circuit, a specific \"unlawful activity\" is an element of a Travel Act offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The task of analyzing those cases is made more difficult because in none of the cases does the issue we must resolve appear to be the issue actually considered and discussed by the Fifth Circuit. That may not be surprising given that the concentration on the categorical approach, and in particular upon the divisibility of criminal statutes for application of the modified categorical approach, is a relatively recent concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The case principally relied upon by Myers is\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Myers cites the case because the elements of the Travel Act are described in terms of \"unlawful activity\" without including a description of a specific violation.

It was always clear that the unlawful activity consisted of controlled substances offenses. No other type of \"unlawful activity\" as defined in the Travel Act was at issue. As described by the Fifth Circuit, the relevant counts of the indictment for which the defendants were found guilty by the jury specified the unlawful activity as the \"intent to facilitate the carrying on of a drug distribution business.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1381-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The same is true for another case cited by Myers,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In that case the defendant challenged his Travel Act conviction on the grounds that such a conviction required proof that the activity was unlawful \"in the state of destination subsequent to the interstate travel,\" and that the travel was necessary to facilitate the commission of the unlawful act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1197148\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/642/909/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1197148\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/642/909/\">\n    at 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court rejected the challenges as based on incorrect understandings of the law. In the course of its discussion the court quoted an instruction given to the jury that identified the elements of the offense as including \"specific intent to promote an unlawful activity,\" without specifying the activity.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 915. The court went on to observe, however, that \"[f]ailure to give an instruction that is covered adequately elsewhere in the charge is not reversible error.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The court specifically stated that \"[b]y their verdict, the jurors found that Jones engaged in the 'unlawful activity' of running a 'business enterprise involving gambling.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 912.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Where the Fifth Circuit may differ from our court and other circuits pertains to a somewhat different question: whether a Travel Act conviction requires a finding that the defendant's activity was unlawful under a specific state or federal statute. The D.C. Circuit discussed that question at some length, including the different approach taken by the Fifth Circuit, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3483329,10537915\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/909/533/\">\n    909 F.2d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537-38 (D.C. Cir. 1990). It concluded that, in contrast to most circuits (including ours), the Fifth Circuit does not require that the specific elements of the underlying law that constitute the unlawful activity be found as elements of the Travel Act offense. Rather, it is sufficient under Fifth Circuit law to specify a generic version of the predicate underlying unlawful activity.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 537. For example, as described by the Fifth Circuit in another of its opinions, it would be enough to identify the unlawful activity as \" '[a]rson' [because that] is a commonly used and understood word .... There is no requirement that the jury be instructed on the Maryland definition of arson.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Conway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"130046\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/507/1047/#p1051\">\n    507 F.2d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1051-52 (5th Cir. 1975). The D.C. Circuit went on to explain why it concluded that the Fifth Circuit's approach is incorrect, and, as noted, our court's approach is different as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   That does not say, however, that the Fifth Circuit does not treat the underlying unlawful activity as an element of a Travel Act violation, albeit in generic form rather than tied to a specific state or federal statute. Neither party identified a Fifth Circuit case that involves a Travel Act conviction in which the underlying unlawful activity is not specified, and we did not find one either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Conducting that examination in the Fifth Circuit cases that the parties here identified supports the conclusion that the Fifth Circuit requires the identification of the underlying unlawful activity as an element of a Travel Act violation, even though it does not require incorporation of the elements of a specific state or federal statute covering that underlying activity as elements of the Travel Act offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Looking at the underlying documents in Myers's own case points to the same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents show that the charge against Myers under the Travel Act was for interstate travel to promote or facilitate a \"business enterprise involving ... narcotics or controlled substances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

But the BIA only peeked at the superseding information to determine if a listed item from the definition of \"unlawful activity\" was included as an element of the offense, not to find out the specific nature of Myers's offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2256\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    3. Pattern Jury Instructions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Myers cites the pattern jury instructions used in the Fifth Circuit at the relevant time to argue that identification of a specific unlawful act was not required for a Travel Act conviction. We are not persuaded. To begin with, pattern jury instructions are not precedent and cannot supersede Fifth Circuit decisions. Nor do they clearly demonstrate the point that Myers is trying to make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Myers quotes Fifth Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instruction \u00a7 2.74 (2015 ed.), for instance, as including the following as one of three elements for a violation of the Travel Act: \"\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   : That subsequent to the act of travel [use of the mail] [use of any facility] in interstate commerce [foreign commerce] the defendant did knowingly and willfully promote, manage, establish, or carry on [distribute the proceeds of] [commit any crime of violence to further] such unlawful activity.\" Myers also observes that under the jury instruction note, the jury is informed that \"unlawful activity is defined under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)\" and \"[t]he appropriate\n   <em>\n    one(s)\n   </em>\n   should be specified and addressed, as necessary, in the instructions provided to the jury.\" Fifth Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instruction \u00a7 2.74 note (emphasis added by Myers). Myers highlights the word \"one(s)\" to support his contention that more than one unlawful activity can be at issue in the Fifth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The pattern instructions cannot support the weight Myers attempts to place on them. On their face, they are tools intended for modification by the district court for use in a particular case. Where it is clear from other jury instructions what unlawful activity is charged, it may not be necessary to repeat the description of the unlawful activity. In the presumably rare case where more than one type of unlawful activity is alleged, the district court is directed to \"specif[y] and address[ the instructions], as necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That does not suggest lumping the multiple forms of unlawful activity together. Rather, we infer that the district court would adapt the pattern instruction as needed to specify the allegedly unlawful activity, as Fifth Circuit precedent suggests is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In sum, whether the Fifth Circuit requires that the precise \"unlawful activity\" among the alternatives be listed in \u00a7 1952(b) of the Travel Act does not appear to have been directly addressed by that court. It may be that the subject has not arisen because it is likely a rare case when the nature of the unlawful activity is at all in doubt. Nonetheless, it appears to us from the Fifth Circuit cases that the specification of \"unlawful activity\" is treated as an element for a conviction under the Travel Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    B. Myers's Conviction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because the Travel Act is divisible, the modified categorical approach\n   may be employed to determine whether Myers's conviction was for a controlled substance offense.

Neither the criminal charge nor the plea agreement identified a specific controlled substance.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1983. At the time, Kansas's controlled substance schedules included at least nine substances not included on the federal schedules.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1984. The Government alleged that the petitioner was deportable based on his conviction relating to a controlled substance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589908\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1980/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589908\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1980/\">\n    at 1983-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court rejected that argument, noting that Kansas's schedules were overinclusive as compared to their federal counterpart and further that the BIA's approach to drug paraphernalia possession offenses was not supported by statute or logic.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589908\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1980/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589908\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1980/\">\n    at 1984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

His crime related to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, not possession of paraphernalia.\n   <em>\n    Mellouli\n   </em>\n   does not speak to Myers's case.

Cancellation of Removal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The BIA concluded that Myers is ineligible for cancellation of removal. A person seeking cancellation of removal must have \"resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). The period is \"deemed to end,\" among other times, \"when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a) of this title.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The BIA concluded that Myers is ineligible for cancellation of removal \"because the notice to appear was served upon him in January 2013,\" which is less than seven years after he was admitted to the United States in September 2006. The IJ did not make any finding regarding when the notice was served on Myers. The IJ decision simply stated that he was \"placed into proceedings on January 3, 2013.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Myers contends that he was not served with the notice until October 30, 2015, a date that is more than seven years after his admission in September 2006. The notice contained a certificate of service signed by an immigration officer, but the space for the date of service was left blank. The form shows Myers's signature and an immigration officer's signature related to a request for a prompt hearing, but those signatures are dated October 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Government acknowledges that the document is unclear, and it does not dispute the plausible contention that Myers was not served until October 2015. The BIA could not have relied upon any finding by the IJ regarding the date of service, as the IJ made no such finding. The conclusion by the BIA that Myers is ineligible because he lacked the seven years of presence then required by the statute was not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Government states that \"these dates are ultimately irrelevant\" because, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(B), Myers's \"continuous physical presence in the United States\" ended when he violated the Travel Act in 2011. The Government argues that, because Myers had not resided in the United States for seven years in 2011, any error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The problem with the Government's argument is that the BIA did not make any such determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In reviewing the decision of the BIA, we consider only the grounds relied upon by that agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Andia v.
