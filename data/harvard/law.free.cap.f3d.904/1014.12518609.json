Karl Rove briefed attendees at the meeting that an anonymous donor had presented Crossroads with a three million dollar \"matching challenge\" to support the Republican challenger in the 2012 Ohio Senate race.

The nature of the allegations prompted the Commission's Office of General Counsel to observe the discrepancy between the scope of disclosure required by the Federal Election Campaign Act and the Commission's regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20109.10\">\n    11 C.F.R. \u00a7 109.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1)(vi).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First General Counsel's Report, dated Mar. 7, 2014 (\"FGCR\") at 12 n.57 (explaining that subsection (c)(2), which \"specifically mandates disclosure of the identity of those who contribute for the purpose of furthering 'an independent expenditure,' \" may take \"an arguably more expansive approach\" to disclosure than the challenged regulation).

More specifically, as the Commission's General Counsel worried, the regulation squeezes the Act's explicit disclosure obligation beyond what the plain statutory text can bear. In particular, the regulation shrinks the statutory duty to disclose contributions intended for \"an expenditure\" down to only those donations intended to support \"the\" specific \"reported independent expenditure.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20109.10\">\n    11 C.F.R. \u00a7 109.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1)(vi). In doing so, the Commission's regulation confines the reporting obligation to only that small subset of donors who not only earmark their contributions for a particular cause or candidate for the specific purpose of influencing the outcome of an identified election, but also pick the script of an independent expenditure that matches the actual form reported. Thus, the regulation empties Subsection (c)(1)'s disclosure obligation of a large portion of its intended operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Crossroads tries to marshal an argument that could give its appeal some promise, but is unable to demonstrate any \"likelihood\" of success, and certainly not a\n   \"substantial\" one.\n   <em>\n    Pursuing America's Greatness v.

Under that view, donations expressly given to support the running of a battery of as-yet unidentified advertisements expressly for or against a particular candidate need not be reported.

Cir. 1985). Crossroads' asserted injury is neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, Crossroads says that the district court's temporary stay of the vacatur has left it with inadequate guidance three months before an election, chilling both contributions and its \"ability\" to speak. Crossroads' Motion for Stay, Affidavit of Steven Law (\"Law Aff.\") at 2-3 \u00b6\u00b6 8,10. Any lack of clarity attributed to the district court's temporary stay order expires in 72 hours (on the 45th day after the district court's decision), so cannot possibly support a stay pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As for the claims that Crossroads' donors had an \"implicit understanding\" that they could make donations for independent expenditures intended to influence the outcome of an election without their contributions being disclosed, Law Aff. at 2 \u00b6 6, the Supreme Court has been clear: Parties who assert a chilling effect from disclosure requirements must offer actual \"evidence that * * * members may face * * * threats or reprisals.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p370\">\n    558 U.S. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 370,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p370\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p370\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Crossroads has made no effort to do that. Nor does Crossroads offer any briefing or argument to establish that an intrusion on private donors' implicit understanding constitutes an irreparable injury to Crossroads itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nor does Crossroads identify any actual independent expenditures it has made this quarter or had intended to make in the coming months that are deterred by the order. It says only that it \"would like to maintain the ability to continue making independent expenditures[,]\" and feels \"deterred and constrained\" from doing so. Law Aff. at 2-3 \u00b6 10. Nothing in the district court's order prohibits the making of independent expenditures. The order only affects quarterly reporting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In short, the irreparable injuries asserted fail to rise beyond the speculative level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Finance Comm. to Re-Elect the President\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3686312,130127\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/507/1194/\">\n    507 F.2d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1974).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, the harm to Mezlak's and the public's interest weighs against a stay. It is well settled that \"[d]isclosure [requirements are] justified * * * on the ground that they [ ] help citizens make informed choices in the political marketplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens United,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p370\">\n    558 U.S. at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p370\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). And here, where the complained-of disclosure covers only those who donate money\n   <em>\n    for the intended purpose of influencing an election\n   </em>\n   , the interest in anonymity does not, for purposes of an exceptional stay, outweigh Mezlak's and the public's countervailing interests in receiving important voting information and in transparency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing disclosure as \"the least restrictive means of curbing the evils of campaign ignorance and corruption\");\n   <em>\n    SpeechNow.org v.
