Its analysis on these factual inquiries was thorough and evenhanded, with findings well-supported by the record. Given the district court's extensive factual findings, much of DNC's appeal amounts to a request that we reweigh and reevaluate the evidence in the record. But we may not \"duplicate the role of the lower court\" or reject factual findings that, as here, are not clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 573,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor did the district court err in identifying and applying the correct legal standard to each of DNC's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in holding that H.B. 2023 and the OOP policy did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments because they imposed only a minimal burden on voters and were adequately designed to serve Arizona's important regulatory interests. We also conclude that the district court did not err in holding that H.B. 2023 and the OOP policy did not violate \u00a7 2 of the VRA. Given the minimal burden imposed by these election practices, DNC failed to show that minority voters were deprived of an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect candidates of their choice. Finally, we conclude that the district court did not err in holding that H.B. 2023 did not violate the Fifteenth Amendment, because DNC failed to carry its burden of showing that H.B. 2023 was enacted with discriminatory intent. We reject DNC's urging to toss out the district court's findings, reweigh the facts and reach opposite conclusions. As such, we affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court's order denying DNC's claims sets forth the facts in detail,\n   <em>\n    Reagan\n   </em>\n   , --- F.Supp.3d at ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-9, so we provide only a brief factual and procedural summary here.

In April 2016, DNC and other appellants sued the state of Arizona, challenging H.B. 2023 and Arizona's OOP policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In separate motions, DNC sought preliminary injunctions against H.B. 2023 and the OOP policy, respectively. On September 23, 2016, the district court denied the motion to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of H.B. 2023. The district court subsequently denied DNC's motion for a preliminary injunction pending appeal. On October 11, 2016, the district court likewise declined to issue a preliminary injunction with respect to the OOP policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   DNC appealed both denials. A motions panel denied DNC's request to issue an injunction pending appeal of the district court's ruling on the challenge to H.B. 2023, but the two appeals were expedited and calendared for arguments before a three-judge panel on October 19 and 26, 2016, respectively. The expedited appeals proceeded at a rapid pace. On October 28, 2016, a divided panel affirmed the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction as to H.B. 2023.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman v. Ariz.

The case was called en banc the same day, and on November 2, 2016-after a highly compressed five-day memo exchange and voting period-a majority of the active judges on this court voted to hear the appeal of the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction against H.B. 2023 en banc. Two days later, the en banc panel reconsidered the motions panel's earlier denial of an injunction pending appeal and granted DNC's motion for an injunction pending a resolution of the preliminary injunction appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman v.

(per curiam) (en banc). As a result of these proceedings, both H.B. 2023 and the OOP policy remained in effect for the November 2016 election.

DNC argued that H.B. 2023 imposed undue burdens on the right to vote, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. DNC also claimed that H.B. 2023 violated \u00a7 2 of the VRA because it resulted in a discriminatory burden on voting rights prohibited by that section. Finally, DNC claimed that H.B. 2023 was enacted with discriminatory intent, in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. DNC raised similar claims that the OOP policy imposed an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote and violated \u00a7 2 of the VRA, but did not claim that the OOP policy had a discriminatory purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court developed an extensive factual record on all five claims.

First, the court found that\n   H.B. 2023 posed only a minimal burden on Arizona voters as a whole. Twenty percent of Arizonans voted in person in the prior 2016 general election, and so were wholly unaffected.\n   <em>\n    Reagan\n   </em>\n   , --- F.Supp.3d at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12. As to the 80 percent of Arizonans who voted by mail, the district court noted that there were no records of the number of voters who returned their ballots with the assistance of third parties.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . After presenting various witnesses on this issue, DNC's counsel's \"best estimate of the number of voters affected by H.B. 2023 based on the evidence at trial\" was \"thousands ... but I don't have a precise number of that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The court found that the evidence suggested that \"possibly fewer than 10,000 voters are impacted\" out of over 2.3 million voters.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, the vast majority of Arizona voters were unaffected by the law.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, the district court found that H.B. 2023 imposed a minimal burden on even the small number of voters who had previously returned ballots with the assistance of third parties. Because \"[e]arly voters may return their own ballots, either in person or by mail, or they may entrust a family member, household member, or caregiver to do the same,\" the burden imposed by H.B. 2023 \"is the burden of traveling to a mail box, post office, early ballot drop box, any polling place or vote center (without waiting in line), or an authorized election official's office, either personally or with the assistance of a statutorily authorized proxy, during a 27-day early voting period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

The court determined that the plaintiffs had not made such a showing, because there was \"insufficient evidence from which to measure the burdens on discrete subsets of voters\" or to \"quantify with any degree of certainty\" how many voters had previously used ballot collection services.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, the district court could not determine the number of those voters who used those services merely \"out of convenience or personal preference, as opposed to meaningful hardship,\" and therefore could not evaluate whether any of them would face a substantial burden in relying on other means of voting offered by Arizona.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Having identified these major gaps in DNC's evidence, the district court evaluated the evidence presented.

Specifically, for voters with mobility issues, Arizona requires counties to provide special election boards, which, upon timely request, will deliver a ballot to an ill or disabled voter.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . While finding that \"relatively few voters are aware of this service,\" the district court pointed out that DNC could educate voters as to its availability.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Further, Arizona permits polling places to offer curbside voting, allowing voters to pull up to the curb by a polling place and have an election official assist them at their car.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Arizona law also requires employers to give their employees time off to vote in person if an employee is scheduled for an Election Day shift without at least a three-hour window to vote.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15.

As summarized by the district court, Arizona advanced two regulatory interests: (1) \"that H.B. 2023 is a prophylactic measure intended to prevent absentee voter fraud by creating a chain of custody for early ballots and minimizing the opportunities for ballot tampering, loss, and destruction\"; and (2) \"that H.B. 2023 improves and maintains public confidence in election integrity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18.

The record shows that DNC's witnesses could not specify how many voters would have been unable to vote without ballot collection services. For instance, a Maricopa County Democratic Party organizer, Leah Gillespie, testified that some voters who used ballot collection services told her that they had no other means of voting, but her only example was of a friend whose husband was supposed to deliver her ballot but forgot it at home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, Arizona State Senator Martin Quezada stated that his campaign received ballot collection requests after H.B. 2023 took effect and had been unable to provide rides to the polling place or other assistance to all such voters. But he did not know \"how many of those people had family members who could have turned in their ballot,\" and could only give his sense \"that several of them lacked anybody\" who could do so. Moreover, DNC failed \"to produce a single voter to testify that H.B. 2023's limitations on who may collect an early mail ballot would make voting significantly more difficult for her.\" Only one voter (Marva Gilbreath) testified that she did not vote in the 2016 general election, because she \"was in the process of moving,\" had no mailbox key due to \"misunderstandings with the realtor and things like that,\" and \"didn't know where the voting place was.\" This witness's highly idiosyncratic circumstances do not indicate that H.B. 2023 imposes a severe burden on an identifiable subgroup of voters.

Indeed, even evidence that third-party ballot collection is more useful to Native Americans than to other voters does not compel the conclusion that H.B. 2023 imposes a heavy burden on Native Americans' ability to vote. Most tellingly, the dissent does not meaningfully address the district court's most notable factual finding: that not a single voter testified at trial that H.B. 2023's limitations would make voting significantly more difficult. Although the dissent insists that there was evidence to this effect, Dissent at 753-54, it cites only to the testimony of a third-party ballot collector who conceded that his organization had not attempted to determine whether the voters they served could have returned their ballots some other way. There is thus no basis for holding that the district court's findings were clearly erroneous, and the dissent errs in arguing otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The dissent also faults the district court's decision not to conduct a subgroup analysis because it \"could not determine a precise number of voters that had relied on ballot collection in the past or predict a likely number in the future.\" Dissent at 753.

First, the dissent argues that unlike H.B. 2023,\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   's voter I.D. law was \"tied to 'the state's interest in counting only the votes\n   of eligible voters.' \" Dissent at 754 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673974\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/181/#p199\">\n    553 U.S. at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673974\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/181/#p199\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). But H.B. 2023's regulation of third-party ballot collectors is likewise tied to the state's interest in ensuring the integrity of the vote. As explained by the district court, Arizona could reasonably conclude that H.B. 2023 reduced \"opportunities for early ballots to be lost or destroyed\" by limiting the possession of early ballots to \"presumptively trustworthy proxies,\" and also lessened the potential for pressure or intimidation of voters, and other forms of fraud and abuse.\n   <em>\n    Reagan\n   </em>\n   , --- F.Supp.3d at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *20 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at 709-10.

For example, the bill's sponsor, Senator Michelle Ugenti-Rita, stated that H.B. 2023 was designed to \"limit fraud\" in ballot collection, which \"is important to maintaining integrity in our electoral process\" because the ballot collection practice \"is ripe to be taken advantage of.\" Senator Steve Smith testified that ballot fraud is \"certainly happening,\" and Michael Johnson, an African American who had served on the Phoenix City Council, testified that he had constituents call to complain about ballot collectors in minority communities. Senator Smith cited this testimony in a speech supporting the law. Senator Sylvia Allen expressed concern that \"we do not know what happens between the time the ballots are collected and when they're finally delivered.\" This concern was confirmed by State Election Director Eric Spencer, who testified that \"there is a huge imbalance in the amount of security measures that are in place for polling place voting compared to early voting.\" Even though \"77 percent of all the votes cast in Arizona\" are early votes, there are \"almost no prophylactic security procedures in place to govern that practice, whereas, at the polling place, where only 23 percent of the votes are taking place, we have every security measure in the world.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The legislature also heard testimony that other states had implemented similar security measures related to ballot collection. According to the legislative record, at the time H.B. 2023 was considered by the Arizona legislature, \"California, New Mexico, Colorado, [and] Nevada all ha[d] laws that restrict or prohibit ballot collection,\" and therefore Arizona was \"a little bit out of the norm especially among our neighbors.\" The legislature also heard that the California law was more draconian than H.B. 2023: it prohibited all ballot collection except by members of the household, family members, and spouses, and did not count votes in ballots that had been improperly collected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   DNC and the dissent claim that the district court erred in giving weight to this evidence because there was no evidence of actual fraud. According to DNC, this evidentiary gap established that the legislators' expressed concerns regarding fraud in ballot collection were merely a facade for racial discrimination. This argument fails. The Arizona legislature was free to enact prophylactic measures even when the legislative record \"contains no evidence of any such fraud actually occurring.\"\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673974\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/181/#p199\">\n    553 U.S. at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673974\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/181/#p199\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Multiple senators expressed their view that H.B. 2023 imposes only a slight burden on voters. For instance, Senator Michelle Ugenti-Rita stated that voters have \"[l]ots of opportunities\" to vote in the 27 day early-voting window, and expressed her view that there is no reason to presume a voter who previously used ballot collection would have trouble voting. Given that these voters have already asked \"that their ballot be mailed to them,\" Senator Ugenti-Rita stated \"logic would tell you they are perfectly capable and understand that, in order to then get their ballot in, they need to put it back in to the mailbox or drop it off.\" Another proponent of the bill, John Kavanaugh, expressed a similar view: \"The only way you get an early ballot is to have it delivered to you by mail, and the way you're supposed to return an early ballot is to reverse that process. And it's hard to imagine how, when you have an early ballot, somewhere in the area of 30 days, you somehow can't do that.\" Again, the record does not contain the sort of evidence that has led other courts to infer the legislature was acting with discriminatory intent, such as evidence that the legislators studied minority data and targeted the voting methods most used by minority voters.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCrory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349469\" index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/204/#p214\">\n    831 F.3d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, no\n   voters, minority or non-minority, testified that they faced a substantial obstacle to voting because of H.B. 2023.

The district court did not err in considering that fact, among others, in determining whether the supporters of H.B. 2023 were motivated by racial discrimination, and the district court need not have concluded, as does the dissent, that such evidence \"simply demonstrates that people of color have diverse interests.\" Dissent at 749. The Supreme Court has long held that an appellate court may not reject a district court's findings as clear error even when the court is \"convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\"\n   <em>\n    Bessemer City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    470 U.S. at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For instance, states typically have election rules that require voters to register to vote and to cast their votes in person during the hours when polls are open. These rules impose certain minimal burdens on voters-the ordinary burdens of registering to vote and showing up on time. If voters fail to comply, they may be unable to vote or their ballots may not be counted. But it is the election rules that impose a burden on the voter-not the enforcement of those rules.

For instance, it is possible that a state could implement such a system in a manner that makes it more difficult for a significant number of members of a protected group to discover the correct precinct in order to cast a ballot. This could occur, for instance, if the state did not provide necessary information in the language best understood by a language minority. But here, the district court found that DNC did not present any evidence of this sort of practice.\n   <em>\n    Reagan\n   </em>\n   , --- F.Supp.3d at ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23-24. DNC does not contest this finding on appeal, nor does it challenge any other elements of Arizona's precinct voting system, such as individual counties' location of polling places, as unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Therefore, the district court correctly determined that the precinct voter system did not lessen the opportunities of minorities to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice, and did not clearly err in rejecting DNC's argument that it need not provide evidence of this factor so long as there is evidence of some disparity in out-of-precinct voting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   After an exhaustive ten-day bench trial involving the testimony of 51 witnesses and over 230 exhibits, the district court made two key factual findings. First, it found that neither Arizona's precinct voter system nor H.B. 2023 imposed more than a minimal burden on voters or increased the ordinary burdens traditionally associated with voting. Second, it found that the Arizona state legislature was not motivated by a discriminatory purpose in enacting H.B. 2023. These findings, which were not clearly erroneous, effectively preclude DNC's claims. The finding that Arizona's two election practices place only the most minimal burden on voters necessarily leads to the conclusion that the practices did not result in less opportunity for minority voters to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice for purposes of \u00a7 2 of the VRA. Further, in light of the court's finding that the burden imposed on voters by the two election practices was minimal, Arizona easily carried its burden under the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   test to show that its election practices\n   were reasonably tailored to achieve the State's important regulatory interests. Finally, the court's finding that the legislature had no discriminatory purpose in enacting H.B. 2023 effectively eviscerates DNC's Fifteenth Amendment claim. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's determination that Arizona's election practices did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments or \u00a7 2 of the VRA, and H.B. 2023 did not violate the Fifteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-346\">\n    The appellants here (plaintiffs below) are the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Arizona Democratic Party.

Between 2006 and 2008, at least 43 percent of all polling places in Maricopa County-where approximately two-thirds of Arizona's registered voters live-changed locations, and 40 percent moved again between 2010 and 2012.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"463\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In 2016, Maricopa County went from 60 vote centers for the presidential preference election to 122 polling locations for the May special election to over 700 assigned polling locations in the August primary and November general elections.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"464\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, the paths to polling places in the Phoenix area is much like the changing stairways at Hogwarts, constantly moving and sending everyone to the wrong place.

Polls are likely to be placed on the edge of the precinct, and they are frequently clustered together-sometimes even in the same building. Unsurprisingly, voters who live further from their assigned polling location than from a location nearest to them or who are close to more than one location are likelier to end up casting a discarded ballot. Indeed, one-quarter of OOP voters cast their ballots in locations closer than their assigned polling place to their homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Worse, voters left confused by Arizona's labyrinthian system often miss out on the opportunity to cast a ballot in their assigned location, where it will be counted. At trial, all but one of the affected witnesses testified that they were never informed that they were voting OOP and that their ballot would not be counted. And the one witness who was given this crucial information was nonetheless unable to vote; he could not make it to his assigned location before the polls closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   There is no question that Arizona's practice of discarding OOP ballots is also a practice of disproportionately discarding ballots cast by minority voters. The district court recognized as much.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"466\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"467\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4, *34. Indeed, although rates of OOP voting decreased in the last election, the disparity between white and minority voters remains constant. In the 2016 general election, Hispanic, African American, and Native American voters were twice as likely as white voters to vote OOP.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"468\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"469\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Race and ethnicity intersect with the socioeconomic conditions that drive up OOP voting. It is frequently more difficult for minority voters to locate and vote in their assigned polling locations. As the district court noted, \"OOP voting is concentrated in relatively dense precincts that are disproportionately populated with renters and those who move frequently. These groups, in turn, are disproportionately composed of minorities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"470\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"471\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Moreover, minority voters are far likelier to face significant barriers in traveling to the polls, barriers that compound the difficulty faced by the voter who is informed that she is in the wrong location and therefore needs to travel to a different precinct.

For example, it failed to recognize that Arizona was the last state in the nation to join the Children's Health Insurance Program, which may explain, in part, why forty-six states have better health insurance coverage for children. Similarly, it ignored evidence that Arizona's public schools are drastically underfunded; in fact, in 2016 Arizona ranked 50th among the states and the District of Columbia in per pupil spending on public elementary and secondary education.

And, as I\n   discuss below, there is significant specific evidence of the legislature's disregard for minority needs in the legislative history leading to the passage of H.B. 2023. The district court failed to consider important facts and overstated the significance of one minor item of evidence. It clearly erred in finding that this factor does not support DNC.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

In its analysis of this factor, the district court erroneously misstated the inquiry as whether the precinct-based system-rather than the practice of wholly discarding OOP votes-is justified. Finding the precinct-based system well-supported, the district court determined only that \"Arizona's policy to not count OOP ballots is one mechanism by which it strictly enforces this system to ensure that precinct-based counties maximize the system's benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Reagan\n   </em>\n   , --- F.Supp.3d at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"582\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *39.

For political and socioeconomic reasons, H.B. 2023 is far likelier to affect African American, Hispanic, and Native American Arizonan voters than white voters.

For example, one individual who worked in several ballot collection groups testified that \"the overwhelming majority\" of voters with whom he worked were Hispanic or African American. Another stated that the \"vast majority of the ballot pickups\" done by the Maricopa County Democratic Party are in \"[m]ajority-minority districts.\" Democratic State Senator Martin Quezada described requests for ballot collection, testifying that \"[t]he large majority of those requests came from the lower income and the neighborhoods that were a larger percentage Latino than others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   No one had a clear statistical analysis of the disparity. Nor could anyone, as the state would be the only entity in a position to collect such evidence, and it has not done so. However, one ballot collector testified as to what she termed a \"case study\" showing the extent of the disparity. In 2010, she and her fellow organizers collected \"somewhere south of 50 ballots\" in one particular district. The area was redistricted before the next election to add a heavily Hispanic neighborhood, Sunnyslope, and in 2012, the organization \"pulled in hundreds of ballots, vast majority from that Sunnyslope area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Not only is there no evidence in the record of any significant reliance on ballot collection by white voters, but the evidence is also replete with evidence explaining why a disparity is natural. For example, in rural Somerton and San Luis, both of which are over 95% Hispanic, voters lack home mail service and are unlikely to have access to reliable transportation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"740\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"741\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *32.

And residents of sovereign nations often must travel 45 minutes to 2 hours\n   just to get to a mailbox. In the district court's words, \"for many Native Americans living in rural locations, especially on reservations, voting is an activity that requires the active assistance of friends and neighbors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"745\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   In contrast, none of the evidence discussed by the district court suggested that there was no disparate burden or that any such disparity was minor.

Moreover, the district court's analysis ignores that the VRA exists to protect minority groups-those groups least likely to have their voices heard. Thus, the precise number of affected voters is not particularly helpful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Because it misstated the legal requirements for establishing a disparity, the district court clearly erred in concluding that DNC failed to meet their burden. I would hold that H.B. 2023 imposes a disparate burden on members of protected classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   As detailed earlier, within my application of the \u00a7 2 results test to the OOP policy, the Senate Factors demonstrate the existence of social and historical conditions of discrimination in Arizona. Those determinations have equal force here, and I will not belabor the point by repeating my analysis here. Instead, I will focus on the ways in which H.B. 2023 is directly connected to those conditions of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   For example, one of the Senate Factors considers the state's history of racial discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"748\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p35\">\n    478 U.S. at 36-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"749\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p35\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Not only does Arizona have a history of official discrimination, as I have discussed, but the history of H.B. 2023-passed after one provision was rejected under \u00a7 5 of the VRA and after the people of Arizona demonstrated concern with another-powerfully links the statute to that history. Similarly, as to racially polarized voting patterns, as the district court noted, one of the most vocal proponents for criminalizing ballot collection, Senator Shooter, did so in part because he was facing a close election in which Hispanic voters were highly unlikely to vote for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   Perhaps most significantly, there is direct evidence of racial appeals being made in the context of this very issue.\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"750\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p35\">\n    478 U.S. at 36-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"751\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p35\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If a basic registration requirement imposes a burden on voters-and it does-it will still be upheld if that burden is justified-and it is.
