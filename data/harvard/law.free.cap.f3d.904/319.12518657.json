We will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Glass pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine hydrochloride in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). At Glass's sentencing hearing, the District Court applied a career-offender enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The enhancement was based on two prior state convictions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20780-113\">\n    35 Pa.

Despite the enhancement, the District Court applied a downward variance. The District Court based the variance primarily on the observation that the pre-sentence investigation report (\"PSR\") overstated the seriousness of Glass's criminal past. The District Court also justified varying downward by citing Glass's significant family responsibilities, his drug addiction, and his relatively young age. The District Court ultimately imposed a prison term of 132 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Glass filed a timely notice of appeal, challenging the career-offender enhancement. We appointed appellate counsel. In July 2017, this Court denied appointed counsel's motion to withdraw under\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), recognizing that Glass had raised two non-frivolous arguments concerning the use of his state court convictions as predicates for a sentencing enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines' career criminal provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court then appointed new appellate counsel and ordered the parties to brief the merits of the appeal.

Glass argues he preserved his challenge to the career-offender enhancement, which would trigger\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review. Alternatively, he claims he did not waive his challenge and, at the very least, plain error review should apply. On the other hand, the government contends that Glass either waived or forfeited his challenge, permitting us to disregard his argument or review it for plain error, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While it is true that Glass made several arguments regarding his criminal history to the District Court, Glass failed to challenge the inclusion of his convictions as predicate offenses for career-offender purposes prior to appeal. Even Glass's first appellate counsel acknowledged that trial counsel had conceded the issue and thus, plain error review should apply. In light of Glass's trial counsel's repeated concessions that Glass was a career offender, we think it appropriate to review the imposition of the career-offender enhancement for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We have yet to determine whether or in what circumstances state statutes that criminalize offers to sell constitute \"controlled substance offenses\" under the Guidelines. Increasingly, however, our sister Circuits have held state statutes expressly criminalizing a mere \"offer\" do not.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Section 780-113(a)(30) prohibits \"the manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance ... or knowingly creating, delivering or possessing with intent to deliver, a counterfeit controlled substance.\" It does not mention offers to sell drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Glass argues, however, that a mere offer to sell drugs is impliedly included in \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) because Pennsylvania law goes on to define \"deliver\" as \"the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer from one person to another of a controlled substance ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20780-102\">\n    35 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 780-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, Glass omits that the federal counterpart to this statute, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), also defines the \"delivery\" of a controlled substance to mean \"the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer of a controlled substance,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8), and the Guidelines' application note too states that the term \"controlled substance offense\" applies not only to a statute that bars distribution of controlled substances, but also to \"the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and\n   <em>\n    attempting to commit such offenses\n   </em>\n   .\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n.1 (emphasis added). As Glass does not dispute that \"attempt\" under Pennsylvania law has the same meaning as \"attempt\" in the CSA and the Guidelines, his argument, if accepted, would prove self-defeating, for if \u00a7 780-102(b) sweeps in mere offers to sell, then by his logic, so does\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, making the\n   state offense broad, but no broader then the federal one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, we note that at least one other provision contained in \u00a7 780-113 expressly prohibits offers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20780-113\">\n    35 Pa.

This language-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"offering for sale\"-is conspicuously absent from \u00a7 780-113(a)(30). Obviously, the Pennsylvania legislature knew how to criminalize offers; it simply chose not to in \u00a7 780-113(a)(30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Third, the parties have failed to uncover any authority, such as state judicial decisions or pattern jury instructions, suggesting Pennsylvania would prosecute a mere offer to sell under \u00a7 780-113(a)(30).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    549 U.S. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    127 S.Ct. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (\"[T]o find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition ... requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   And fourth, contrary to Glass's argument, we are not convinced Pennsylvania's definition of \"deliver\" is sufficiently similar to the Texas definition at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hinkle\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Conley\n   </em>\n   such that a similar outcome is warranted. Under the Texas Health and Safety Code, \"deliver\" means: \"to transfer, actually or constructively, to another a controlled substance, counterfeit substance, or drug paraphernalia, regardless of whether there is an agency relationship.\n   <em>\n    The term includes offering to sell a controlled substance\n   </em>\n   , counterfeit substance, or drug paraphernalia.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20481.002\">\n    Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8) (emphasis added). The Texas Code expressly reaches offers, whereas Pennsylvania's definition fails to include similar language. If anything, the Pennsylvania definition of \"deliver\" is more similar to the definition of \"deliver\" under Illinois law, which the Seventh Circuit concluded did not encompass offers to sell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Redden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264479\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/374/#p375\">\n    875 F.3d at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The definition ... tells us that 'deliver' and 'delivery' mean an 'actual, constructive or attempted transfer' .... Any conduct meeting the state's definition of 'delivery' comes within \u00a7 4B1.2(b) because 'transfer' is just another word for distribute or dispense.\"). Accordingly, we are confident concluding that \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) is not broader than the Guidelines' definition of a \"controlled substance offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We note that this conclusion is consistent with our prior holdings regarding \u00a7 730-113(a)(30) outside the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 context. We have already held that conviction under \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) for cocaine-based offenses is not overbroad in the context of the ACCA's definition of \"serious drug offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Additionally, we have held that conviction under \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) for a cocaine-based offense is \"analogous to the federal felony of possession with intent to distribute ... prohibited by [ 21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 841(a)(1) of the Controlled Substances Act,\" and is therefore an \"aggravated felony\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n   <em>\n    Avila v.

Because the record shows that Glass possessed two such predicate offenses-(1) a 2001 conviction, CP-22-CR-2630-2001, for manufacturing, delivering, or possessing marijuana in Dauphin County; and (2) a 2004 conviction, CP-31-CR-461-2004, for manufacturing, delivering, or possessing cocaine in Huntingdon County-we find no error in the District Court's decision to apply the enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court's judgment entered on June 13, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Under\n    <em>\n     Anders\n    </em>\n    , \"if counsel finds his [client's] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n     386 U.S. at 744\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n     87 S.Ct. 1396\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The parties agree that, with some exceptions not relevant here, cases concerning overbreadth of a state criminal statute in the context of the ACCA also apply to the career-offender context.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    In pointing out this flaw in the logic of Glass's argument, we are not suggesting that \"attempted transfer\" in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (8) includes offers or solicitations other than those that meet the requirements for \"attempt\" under the CSA.

Glass also argues that the latter conviction is not a \"controlled substance offense\" because it was for simple possession. We need not consider this argument because the record shows Glass possessed a third \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) conviction, CP-31-CR-461-2004, which qualifies as a predicate offense under today's decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
