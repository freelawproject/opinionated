And, of course,\n   <em>\n    Valdivia-Flores\n   </em>\n   took the same approach. In fact, the government has itself suggested that the panel look to federal criminal law to define\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   portions of the \"serious drug offense\" statute here at issue. So we need not, and do not, avert our eyes from federal accomplice liability when defining the scope of the ACCA's generic accomplice liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, if we were to look to other sources as well to supply a generic aiding and abetting definition for \"serious drug offenses,\" we would reach the same result as did\n   <em>\n    Valdivia-Flores\n   </em>\n   when considering only federal law. Like the federal definition incorporated in\n   <em>\n    Valdivia-Flores\n   </em>\n   , general principles of accomplice liability establish that \"[a] person is an 'accomplice' of another in committing a crime if, with the\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime,\" he commits certain acts; \"a person's ... knowledge that a crime is being committed or is about to be committed, without more, does not make him an accomplice.\" 1 Wharton's Criminal Law \u00a7 38 (15th ed.) (emphasis added). The Model Penal Code is similar: \"A person is an accomplice ... if ... with the\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he\" commits certain acts. \u00a7 2.06(3) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Federal law also comports with most other state definitions of accomplice liability. Franklin's brief calculates, with supporting documentation, that \"Washington is one of at most five jurisdictions that requires only a mens rea of knowledge for accomplice liability.\" The government has not disputed this summary nor provided any conflicting information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   So, if we\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   look outside federal law to define generic aiding and abetting liability for purposes of the ACCA, we reach the same result as under\n   <em>\n    Valdivia-Flores\n   </em>\n   's narrower, federal-law-centered, approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The government's second argument as to why the Washington accomplice liability standard is not a categorical match for the INA's \"illicit trafficking,\" but is for the ACCA's \"serious drug offense,\" is that, if we look to the text of the ACCA's \"serious drug offense\" definition, we'll discover that we need not incorporate accomplice liabilities\n   into our categorical approach at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The government makes two textual arguments, one with vast implications for application of the categorical approach to a wide range of statutes, and one somewhat narrower. Most broadly, the government suggests that, because the ACCA defines a \"serious drug offense\" as \"an offense\n   <em>\n    under State law,\n   </em>\n   involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(A) (emphasis added), we need not define a generic crime\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the government maintains, we simply look to see if the state law includes the words \"manufacturing, distributing, or possessing,\" and, if so, we are finished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To apply this expansive version of the government's theory would be to toss out all but the name of the categorical approach. At its core, the categorical approach is the comparison of the defendant's crime of conviction to a generic version of that crime-that is, a version that contains all of the ingredients Congress has identified, to which we give content using our full panoply of statutory interpretation resources. By so doing-\"[b]y focusing on the legal question of what a conviction\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   established[-]the categorical approach ordinarily works to promote efficiency, fairness, and predictability.\"\n   <em>\n    Mellouli v.

The government's words-only approach to inclusion of state laws in federal recidivism statutes is therefore dead on arrival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The government's less ambitious textual argument starts from the observation that, under the ACCA, a \"serious drug offense\" can be either an offense defined under federal law, or, as relevant here, \"an offense under State law\n   <em>\n    involving\n   </em>\n   manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Focusing on the state law prong's use of the word \"involving,\" the government notes that the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Valdivia-Flores\n   </em>\n   does not use the term \"involving,\" and argues that that word here obviates any need for comparison to generic aiding and abetting\n   liability. Instead, the government maintains, the elements of Franklin's state crime need only be examined to determine whether they \"relate to or connect with\" any act included as a \"serious drug offense\" (again, manufacturing, distributing, or possessing). On this understanding, according to the government, no inquiry is needed into whether the aiding and abetting version of the state crime categorically matches the generic crime of aiding and abetting the enumerated drug offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This attempt to escape the result reached in\n   <em>\n    Valdivia-Flores\n   </em>\n   also does not work. We begin by observing that, as a linguistic matter, \"involving\" does not equate to \"relating to or connecting with.\" \"Relating to\" is a \"broad\" and \"indeterminate\" term,\n   <em>\n    Mellouli\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 1990, that means that one thing \"stands in some relation, bears upon, or is associated with\" another,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A conviction under Washington's accomplice liability statute renders its drug trafficking law broader than generic federal drug trafficking laws under the INA and, as we hold now, under the ACCA. Washington's drug trafficking law is thus not categorically a \"serious drug offense\" under the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because Franklin's three convictions under Washington law could not constitute \"serious drug offenses,\" he was not subject to the ACCA's fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).
