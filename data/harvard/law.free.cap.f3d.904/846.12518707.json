This appeal raises an important question of Washington law: whether and when obesity qualifies as an \"impairment\" under the WLAD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2049.60.040\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 49.60.040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because there is no controlling precedent on this question, and the answer to the question is determinative of this appeal, we respectfully certify it to the Washington Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BNSF extended Taylor an offer of employment as an electronic technician, conditioned on his completing a medical history questionnaire and undergoing a physical exam. BNSF's medical examiner determined Taylor met the physical qualifications for the position but referred him to the company's chief medical officer because he weighed 256 pounds at a height of 5-feet, 6-inches, yielding a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 41.3. A BMI over 40 is considered \"severely\" or \"morbidly\" obese, and BNSF treats a BMI over 40 as a \"trigger\" for further screening in the employment process. BNSF advised Taylor, in pertinent part: \"The BNSF Medical Officer is unable to determine medical qualification for Electronic Technician position due to significant health and safety risks associated with extreme obesity (Body Mass Index near or above 40).\" BNSF offered to reconsider Taylor's medical qualification if he undertook further - and costly - medical testing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   If you choose to supply this information, we can evaluate your condition again, but please note that simply providing these reports does not guarantee qualification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   If you choose not to obtain this information at this time, your case can be reconsidered if you lose at least 10% of your weight (26 pounds) and maintain that weight for at least 6 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Taylor indicated he lacked the ability to pay for the testing, BNSF did not offer financial aid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Taylor filed this action against BNSF in Washington state court, asserting a single claim of disability discrimination under the WLAD. He alleged BNSF denied him employment because it perceived him as disabled due to obesity. After BNSF removed the action to federal court based on diversity of citizenship, the district court granted summary judgment to BNSF, and Taylor appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To prevail under the WLAD, Taylor must establish both that (1) obesity constitutes a disability under the WLAD and (2) BNSF's withdrawal of its employment offer on account of his failure to pay for additional medical testing constitutes actionable discrimination under the WLAD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to the second question, we recently held in\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

As a general matter, the WLAD is\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   as broad as the ADA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Even though almost all of the WLAD's prohibitions predate Title VII's, the ADA's, and the [Age Discrimination in Employment Act]'s, Washington courts still look to federal case law interpreting those statutes to guide our interpretation of the WLAD. Federal cases are not binding on this court, which is \"free to adopt those theories and rationale which best further the purposes and mandates of our state statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Grimwood v. Univ. of Puget Sound, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1182902\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/110/355/#p361\">\n    110 Wash. 2d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361-62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=753%20P.2d%20517\">\n    753 P.2d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Where this court has departed from federal antidiscrimination statute precedent, however, it has almost always ruled that the WLAD provides greater employee protections than its federal counterparts do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Kumar v. Gate Gourmet Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242321\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/180/481/\">\n    180 Wash.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=325%20P.3d%20193\">\n    325 P.3d 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197-98 (2014) (footnotes\n   omitted). Thus, for purposes of our analysis, we assume that, as under the ADA, an employer discriminates in violation of the WLAD when it withdraws a conditional offer of employment based on a prospective employee's failure to pay for medical testing that the employer has required solely because of the prospective employee's perceived disability or impairment. We need not certify that question to the Washington Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As to the first question, this court has not yet addressed whether or when obesity qualifies as a disability or impairment under the ADA and, as we discuss below, other jurisdictions are divided on that question. Furthermore, even if we were to decide that the ADA treats obesity as a disability in only limited circumstances, Washington law may well provide broader coverage. As noted, where the Washington Supreme Court \"has departed from federal antidiscrimination statute precedent, ... it has almost always ruled that the WLAD provides greater employee protections than its federal counterparts do.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=325%20P.3d%20193\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because the ADA's coverage of obesity is an open question in this circuit and, in any event, Washington law may be broader, we conclude it is appropriate to certify this important question of Washington law to the Washington Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In sum, we have concluded that the outcome of this appeal turns on whether obesity constitutes an \"impairment\" and thus a \"disability\" under Washington law. In light of the importance of the issue and the absence of controlling legal authority, we now certify that question to the Washington Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Statutory Text\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The WLAD makes it an \"unfair practice\" for an employer to refuse to hire an applicant because of \"the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical\n   <em>\n    disability\n   </em>\n   \" unless \"the particular disability prevents the proper performance of the particular worker involved.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2049.60.180\">\n    Wash.

He contends, however, that obesity constitutes an \"impairment\" because it is a \"condition,\" and the word \"physiological\" modifies only \"disorder\" within the text of the WLAD. He notes as well that the WLAD \"includes\" but does not \"limit\" its definition of impairment to the disorders and conditions enumerated in \u00a7 49.60.040(7)(c). BNSF argues the word \"physiological\" modifies both \"disorder\" and \"condition,\" and, consequently, that Taylor's perceived\n   obesity does not qualify as an impairment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The ADA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Washington Supreme Court also may wish to consider the treatment of obesity under the ADA. As noted, Washington courts treat federal interpretations of the ADA as instructive, but not binding, in interpreting the WLAD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kumar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=325%20P.3d%20193\">\n    325 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   197-98 ;\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Here, the parties disagree over whether federal cases deciding the obesity issue under the ADA are correctly decided; to what extent those cases remain good law after Congress amended the ADA in 2008; and, even if coverage of obesity under the ADA is limited, whether distinctions in the text and history of the WLAD show that it protects a broader range of impairments than its federal counterpart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Text of the ADA and its Governing Regulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The ADA defines \"disability\" as a \"physical or mental impairment,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(A), and a regulation issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines \"impairment\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (1) Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as [an enumerated list]; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (2) Any mental or psychological disorder, such as an intellectual disability (formerly termed \"mental retardation\"), organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201630.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This definition is similar to the WLAD definition but is narrower in two potentially significant respects. First, unlike the WLAD, the ADA regulation does not include a comma after \"disorder\" and before \"or condition.\" Thus, from a purely textual standpoint, the ADA regulation may apply only to \"physiological\" conditions, whereas WLAD appears to apply to conditions irrespective of physiological cause. The ADA, however, included that comma before 2009, and that pre-2009 definition served as the model for the WLAD definition. The EEOC eliminated the comma in 2009, after Congress liberalized the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, whereas the ADA regulation's definition of impairment appears to be exhaustive, the WLAD makes clear that its definition of impairment is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   exhaustive. It states explicitly that Washington's definition of impairment \"includes,\n   <em>\n    but is not limited to\n   </em>\n   ,\" the disorders and conditions enumerated in \u00a7 49.60.040(7)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The definition of the term \"impairment\" does not include\n   <em>\n    physical characteristics such as\n   </em>\n   eye color, hair color, left-handedness, or height,\n   <em>\n    weight\n   </em>\n   , or muscle tone\n   <em>\n    that are within \"normal\" range and are not the result of a physiological disorder\n   </em>\n   .

EEOC Br. at 5-6. The EEOC has not defined \"normal\" range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The EEOC's position is consistent with a compliance manual it withdrew in 2012.
