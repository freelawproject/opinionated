The bankruptcy court held that they did not and were therefore not entitled to discharge a debt arising out of a state-court judgment for fraud and misrepresentation; the district court agreed. So do we, albeit on somewhat different grounds than those relied upon by the bankruptcy and district courts, and we therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hyun Um and Thomas Price (\"Debtors\") co-founded several real-estate management companies. They filed separate petitions in 2010 seeking reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; the petitions were later consolidated. The bankruptcy court eventually approved the Trustee's First Amended Disclosure Statement (\"Disclosure Statement\") and First Amended Plan of Reorganization (\"the Plan\"), which provided for the sale of all of the Debtors' nonexempt individual assets and those of their jointly-owned business entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before the Chapter 11 filings, Spokane Rock, LLC had obtained a state-court judgment against the Debtors for fraud and misrepresentation. Spokane Rock filed an adversary complaint in bankruptcy court, alleging that its claims arising out of the judgment were nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) because the Debtors had failed to provide it with notice of the bankruptcy proceedings and had fraudulently concealed Spokane Rock's\n   claim. After the adversary complaint was dismissed as untimely, Spokane Rock filed a second complaint seeking to deny a discharge, this time invoking\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to Spokane Rock and denied a discharge of the Spokane Rock debt.\n   <em>\n    Spokane Rock I, LLC v.

They conceded that they would not have been entitled to a discharge of the Spokane Rock debt had they sought relief under Chapter 7, and that \u00a7 1141(d)(3)(C) was therefore satisfied. But the Debtors argued that the other two requirements for denying a discharge under \u00a7 1141(d)(3) were not met, because (a) the Chapter 11 plan did not call for liquidation of all or substantially all of the property of the estate, and (b) they continued to engage in business after consummation of the plan: Um by finding employment with Radiance Capital Financial, LLC, and Price by finding employment with the Plan Administrator, who was liquidating the Debtors' assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's summary judgment.

The bankruptcy and district courts correctly rejected that argument. The Plan is explicitly termed \"a liquidation Plan,\" under which the Administrator \"shall be solely responsible for ... liquidating or otherwise reducing the Estate's Assets to Cash.\" Bankr. Op.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206684504\">\n    2015 WL 6684504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

But, as the bankruptcy court correctly observed, the Plan expressly notes that these membership interests will be worthless after consummation of the Plan, because all of the assets of the LLCs will have been sold to third parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Debtors provided no evidence to rebut the Trustee's conclusion that the membership interests will be worthless after the confirmation of the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nor does the Trustee's management of the assets of the subsidiary LLCs pending their sale render the Plan anything other than a liquidation. As the bankruptcy court aptly noted, this feature is in \"the very nature of a complex chapter 11 liquidation,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5, which the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel has observed is designed to allow the debtor \"the ability to plan for an orderly divestiture of the assets over time,\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Internal Revenue Serv. v.

Reading \u00a7 1141(d)(3)(B) to include mere employment would create severe dislocations in the broader statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As the Debtors concede, had they filed for protection under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) would have barred the discharge of the fraud judgment obtained by Spokane Rock. Interpreting \u00a7 1141(d)(3)(B) to allow a liquidating Chapter 11 debtor to obtain a discharge for debts incurred by fraud simply by accepting employment after plan consummation would effectively vitiate \u00a7 727(a). Knowing that any debts incurred through fraud would be discharged if they obtained any type of employment after plan consummation, debtors who intended to liquidate their assets would always choose Chapter 11 over Chapter 7. Put differently, a Chapter 7 debtor would be significantly disadvantaged relative to an identically situated Chapter 11 debtor. The former would continue to be responsible for fraudulently incurred debts after liquidating the property of the estate and accepting employment, while the latter would not. Therefore, whatever the precise boundaries of the phrase \"engages in business\" in \u00a7 1141(d)(3)(B) may be, it cannot be interpreted to include mere employment in an enterprise owned and operated by others without creating anomalies in the Bankruptcy Code as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kathleen K.
