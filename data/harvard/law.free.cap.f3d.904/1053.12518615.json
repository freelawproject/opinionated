In 2015, California amended the prevailing wage laws to include delivery drivers of ready-mix concrete.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201720.9\">\n    Cal.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"IBT\") moved to intervene on the side of the State to defend the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court denied IBT's motion to intervene and granted the State's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' FAAAA preemption claim. However, the district court granted Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion on the equal protection claim, concluding that \u00a7 1720.9 did not pass muster under the rational basis test. The court reasoned that there were no legally relevant differences between ready-mix drivers and other delivery drivers; therefore, the State did not have any legitimate justification for singling out the ready-mix suppliers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We conclude that the district court wrongly disregarded as irrelevant certain differences between ready-mix drivers and other drivers that the legislature could have relied on in extending the prevailing wage law. We thus reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and order the court to enter judgment on behalf of Defendants. Likewise, we hold that IBT had a significantly protectable interest at stake in the case and we reverse the district court's denial of IBT's motion for leave to intervene. On the FAAAA preemption question, we affirm the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Relations Apr. 10, 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 10, 2015, Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., signed AB 219, which amended California's prevailing wage law by adding Labor Code \u00a7 1720.9. It provides that \"public works\" include \"the hauling and delivery of ready-mixed concrete to carry out a public works contract\" regardless of who employs the driver or whether the driver is delivering from a dedicated batch plant.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201720.9\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 1720.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, all ready-mix drivers delivering to public works must be paid prevailing wages. Before adopting the final bill, the California Legislature considered a version of AB 219 that would have required payment of prevailing wages to asphalt delivery drivers as well, but ultimately limited the expansion to ready-mix concrete drivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ready-mix concrete is defined as \"concrete that is manufactured in a factory or a batching plant, according to a set recipe, and then delivered in a liquefied state by mixer truck for immediate incorporation into a project.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201720.9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1720.9(b). Its ingredients are prepared and mixed at a concrete plant. Production of concrete is time-sensitive because concrete begins to set quickly after water is added. Ready-mix is delivered in specialized trucks with a rotating tank.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Drivers of ready-mix trucks control the amount of water added to the rotating tank and the speed at which the tank spins, meaning that they can alter the nature of the concrete.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   By contrast, even though asphalt delivery may also be time-sensitive, drivers transport asphalt in dump trucks, rather than mixing trucks, and drivers cannot alter the asphalt once it is in the truck. For certain projects, such as paving roads, asphalt and ready-mix are interchangeable, for others, such as building walls and other structural supports, the materials are not substitutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 30, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Director and the Labor Commissioner of the State of California (collectively, the \"State\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint alleged that \u00a7 1720.9 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, or alternatively, is preempted by the FAAAA, and sought injunctive and declaratory relief. Before the State answered the complaint, IBT moved for leave to intervene, either as of right or permissively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) &amp; (b). On August 22, 2016, Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction on their equal protection claim. Before the court ruled on Plaintiffs' motion for injunctive relief, the State moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Subsequently, in September, the district court denied IBT's motion to intervene, reasoning that: (1) the union could not intervene by right because it did not have a significantly protectable interest in the case; and (2) that the union could not permissively intervene because it would cause a delay and the State could protect any interests IBT may have. IBT appealed the denial of its motion to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 18, 2016, the district court granted Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on the equal protection claim, finding that \u00a7 1720.9 was not likely to survive rational basis review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In December,\n   the district court granted the State's motion to dismiss Allied Concrete's FAAAA claim, but denied the motion as to the equal protection claim. Allied Concrete appealed the dismissal of its FAAAA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Thereafter, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment and requested that the temporary injunction be made permanent. The district court, holding that \u00a7 1720.9 violated the Equal Protection Clause, permanently enjoined the statute's application and enforcement. First, the district court defined the classification in \u00a7 1720.9 as treating \"ready-mixed concrete drivers differently than other materials drivers.\" And, although the district court credited the State's evidence as to the differences between ready-mix drivers and drivers of other materials, it concluded - without explanation - that those differences were immaterial because \"all that matters for inclusion in the [prevailing wage law] is whether or not drivers are hauling and delivering construction materials to public works sites.\" Thus, the district court concluded that \"in all respects\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   to the [prevailing wage law], ready-mixed concrete drivers and other materials drivers are similarly situated.\" Recognizing that the State's interests may be legitimate, the district court nevertheless struck down the statute because the classification was \"arbitrary\" and not rationally related to any of the interests. The State appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   grants of summary judgment and dismissals.\n   <em>\n    First Resort, Inc. v.

In extending the prevailing wage law to benefit ready-mix drivers, the legislature could have rationally decided\n   that the delivery of ready-mix to a public work is part of the \"flow of construction\" and should be compensated as such. Not only would this protect the ready-mix drivers, but if the legislature believed that the ready-mix drivers were actually more integrated in construction, the payment of prevailing wages could increase efficiency in public works projects by attracting higher-skilled workers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Specifically, the legislature could have concluded that the ready-mix drivers are more integrated into the flow of construction because they bring a perishable commodity to a construction site, and, in certain instances, need to incorporate it immediately. During legislative hearings on the bill, an IBT representative testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   These workers are part of the construction process. That's what's different and unique about this from any other material coming to the job site. You can ... it's not dumping a load of lumber or a bag of nails or whatever and leaving. They bring this commodity-which is perishable-and [it] has to be incorporated immediately and the driver participates in the incorporation process with the workers. They are part of it. They move the truck. They operate levers and equipment that moves the concrete and the rate of flow in conjunction with the construction workers. They are integral to the process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At least some of the legislators were impressed by this perceived difference from other materials. As one legislator stated: \"I will be supporting the bill today. I do get the distinction between the product we're talking about and delivering in effect, dumping a delivery of pipes or paint or steel. This is a different commodity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The conclusion that ready-mix drivers are more integral to the public works projects than other drivers because of the material's properties and the driver's tasks is rational on its face. Therefore, it is up to Plaintiffs to negate this justification as inconceivable. Plaintiffs attempt this through three arguments. They first argue that the delivery of ready-mix is not any different than that of other materials. For example, one contractor stated that \"[f]rom [his] perspective as a contractor, there is no meaningful difference between the delivery of ready-mixed concrete ... and the delivery of any other construction material .... Approximately 95% of the time, all of the [ready-mix] goes into a single pump that [his] employees than [sic] use to place the concrete.\" While this argument raises a factual dispute with the testimony from IBT's witness, quoted above, it does not significantly weigh against the legislature conceivably concluding that ready-mix drivers are more important to the construction process based on the properties of the materials, the uniqueness of the trucks, and the driver's responsibilities upon arrival. The legislature, where there is no suspect class at issue, has wide leeway to consider different, and potentially competing, facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190150\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/673/#p681\">\n    566 U.S. at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190150\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/673/#p681\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he Constitution does not require the [government] to draw the perfect line nor even to draw a line superior to some other line it might have drawn. It requires only that the line actually drawn be a rational line.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs argue that the legislature could not rationally conclude that ready-mix drivers were more integrated into the flow of construction than other drivers because the Director had previously found that the drivers were not always entitled to prevailing wages under the pre- \u00a7 1720.9 test. In\n   <em>\n    A&amp;A Ready Mix Concrete\n   </em>\n   , the Director concluded that ready-mix drivers delivering the material, but not performing on-site construction work, were not part of the flow of construction. Plaintiffs argue that this administrative\n   ruling undercuts any factual basis for the legislature to have decided otherwise. This argument fails for several reasons. First and foremost, the legislature is not bound to accept the findings of an administrative agency. Legislatures frequently change laws in response to administrative (or judicial) decisions with which they do not agree. As such, this decision of the agency is of little relevance to our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that extending the prevailing wage to all ready-mix drivers is overbroad because not all ready-mix drivers are sufficiently integral to the flow of construction. For example, Plaintiffs contend that not all drivers incorporate the ready-mix, and that even if they do, this would not necessarily support higher wages for the drive time. Again, Plaintiffs question where the legislature drew the line. But, for the reasons stated above, the legislature could have rationally concluded that ready-mix drivers were more integral to public works than other drivers and that the drive time - when the driver controls the rate of rotation and the amount of water in the drum - is part of the construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ensure Superior Projects\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, another goal of the prevailing wage law is to \"benefit the public through the superior efficiency of well-paid employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Lusardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20837\">\n    4 Cal.Rptr.2d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=824%20P.2d%20643\">\n    824 P.2d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State offers that the legislature may have decided that the unique aspects of a ready-mix driver's job, and the nature of ready-mix as a material for structural projects such as buildings, bridges, and dams (as opposed to roads), make the quality of ready-mix drivers more important to public works projects than other drivers. This argument rests on two premises that Plaintiffs challenge: (1) that ready-mix drivers have unique responsibilities that are more important to the success of a public works project; and (2) that ready-mix is more often used in \"structural\" projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As to the first premise, there are clear differences between ready-mix drivers and other materials drivers relevant to the equal protection analysis. Ready-mix drivers use specialized trucks, with a rotating mixing drum, whereas asphalt drivers use dump trucks. Ready-mix drivers can change the consistency of their load by adding water to the mixture or altering the speed of rotation of the drum. Further, ready-mix drivers require more training than asphalt drivers and must carry a different driver's license endorsement than asphalt drivers. It is conceivable that the legislature could have rationally believed these facts, determined that ready-mix drivers need more skills than other drivers, and concluded that prevailing wages would attract higher-quality workers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that there is no meaningful difference between the delivery of ready-mix and other materials. For example, some contractors declare that ready-mix and asphalt drivers both merely drop the material where the contractors' employees tell the driver to dump it. Plaintiffs further argue that both ready-mix and asphalt have a limited duration in which they must be delivered. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that even though the ready-mix driver has the ability to add water to the mixture, he or she does not have\n   <em>\n    discretion\n   </em>\n   to do so. Instead, the drivers simply follow instructions from somebody else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Nonetheless, the different licensing requirements and the ability of ready-mix drivers to control the cement in their trucks are rational grounds for distinguishing between them and other drivers. Further, even if ready-mix drivers do not have discretion to add water to the mixture, or change the speed of the rotating drum, they still must control these variables during the drive, which is not true for drivers\n   of typical dump trucks. Carefully following important instructions is itself a valuable skill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As to the second premise, although it is true that many projects could interchange the materials depending on cost, there is evidence that ready-mix is used for structural support, such as walls or footings, more often than other materials. By contrast, asphalt cannot be used as a structural material, and is most often used for paving. It is easy to imagine a legislator concluding that a failed structure, such as a dam or bridge, is worse than a poorly-paved road. Therefore, the legislature could have rationally concluded that ready-mix is more important to sensitive public works and that the drivers must be more skilled to ensure the integrity of the material they deliver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Again, Plaintiffs cannot negate this justification. Aside from arguing that ready-mix drivers are not any different than other drivers, Plaintiffs also contend that concerns about structural projects do not survive constitutional scrutiny because not all public works are structural projects. But this argument cannot carry the day under rational basis review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355778\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/312/#p320\">\n    509 U.S. at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355778\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/312/#p320\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[C]ourts are compelled under rational-basis review to accept a legislature's generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

True, bare economic protectionism is not a valid justification for discriminatory treatment, but the interest in protecting union workers from underbidding conceivably is about ensuring a certain standard of worker - and avoiding a race to the bottom - rather than granting favors to politically important actors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O.G.

An IBT representative estimates that 95% of ready-mix drivers in the San Francisco area are working under collective bargaining agreements (\"CBAs\"), whereas \"IBT has only one or two [CBAs] with contractors who are also commercial suppliers covering asphalt delivery in California.\" If unionized ready-mix drivers were underbid by a non-union supplier, 95% of drivers in San Francisco would be ineligible for the job. Therefore, it seems reasonable that the legislature could have rationally believed that underbidding in the ready-mix market is more harmful and that \u00a7 1720.9 would further the interest in preventing underbidding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that underbidding by non-union drivers may be a problem, regardless of the material carried, and that the state has not provided any evidence that the disparity between union and non-union rates is greater for ready-mix drivers\n   than other drivers. These arguments miss the mark. Just because underbidding may be an issue for drivers of other materials does not mean that the legislature could not have rationally concluded that the problem was more acute for ready-mix drivers due to their higher unionization rates.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Merrifield\n   </em>\n   , there is no suggestion that classifying ready-mix drivers as distinct from other drivers actually contradicts the purposes of the prevailing wage law. Similarly, there is no specific evidence like the cut-off dates in\n   <em>\n    Fowler Packing\n   </em>\n   that clearly suggests improper favoritism. Plus, the burden on Plaintiffs here to come forward with evidence that negates every conceivable basis for the law is much higher than that of the\n   <em>\n    Fowler Packing\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs opposing a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs emphasize the fact that asphalt was dropped from an earlier version of \u00a7 1720.9 as a sign that the law's only justification is to protect ready-mix suppliers' competitors. Without more, the fact that the legislature once considered including asphalt in the legislation is not evidence of improper motive. In fact, considering asphalt, but then removing it after holding hearings, could just as easily bolster the conclusion that after reviewing the facts, the legislature reached an informed judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have not negated every conceivable justification for \u00a7 1720.9, we conclude that the statute passes the rational basis test and does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

During oral argument, we raised the issue of whether IBT's appeal would be moot if we reversed the district court on the equal protection claim. IBT argued that its appeal would not be moot because Plaintiffs could still move for rehearing en banc or petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We are not aware of any decision from our Circuit that addresses whether a potential petition for rehearing or certiorari keeps a case alive for the purposes of appealing a motion to intervene.

We affirmed the district court's grant of IBT's motion to intervene, reasoning that: (1) IBT's motion was timely; (2) IBT's members had a \" 'significant interest' in receiving the prevailing wage for their services as opposed to a substandard wage\"; (3) \"IBT's members' right to receive the prevailing wage\" would have been impaired had plaintiffs prevailed; and (4) IBT demonstrated that the State's representation of its interests may have been inadequate \"because the employment interests of IBT's members were potentially more narrow and parochial than the interests of the public at large.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713416\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/1184/#p1189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713416\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/1184/#p1189\">\n    at 1189-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The district court attempted to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   by emphasizing that we used the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   the prevailing wage\" in\n   <em>\n    Mendonca.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713416\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/1184/#p1189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713416\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/1184/#p1189\">\n    at 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). By emphasizing the word \"receive,\" the district court assumed that the IBT members in\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   would not have been paid the prevailing wage if the statute were struck down. Here, on the other hand, the district court relied on the fact that many IBT members already received the prevailing wage pursuant to CBAs - regardless of the prevailing wage law. In other words, the district court concluded that the IBT members \"would merely lose \u00a7 1720.9 as a\n   <em>\n    statutory backstop\n   </em>\n   to their [CBAs].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   is not susceptible to the district court's narrow reading. Moreover, we are not convinced that the distinction between\n   <em>\n    receiving\n   </em>\n   a prevailing wage pursuant to statute and maintaining the statutory\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to receive a wage is a meaningful one for purposes of assessing standing to intervene. For one,\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   makes no mention of distinguishing IBT members by whether they actually received the prevailing wage or not, and there is no discussion about whether certain IBT members were already paid the prevailing wage under CBAs. It is entirely possible that the members at issue in\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   were subject to CBAs. For another, the district court just as easily could have emphasized the word \"right\" in the statement \"[if plaintiffs] prevailed, it would have clearly impaired IBT's members'\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to receive the prevailing wage\" and come to the opposite conclusion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713416\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/1184/#p1189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713416\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/1184/#p1189\">\n    at 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any event, we do not see a significant difference either way, even if the\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   intervenors were not subject to CBAs. For example, receiving a prevailing wage in the absence of a CBA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   might technically be different than receiving it pursuant to a contract, but for the purposes of a significantly protectable interest, we think they are indistinguishable. Even if all of IBT's members are subject to CBAs\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   that pay them the prevailing wage, a statutory right to that wage is still important and not at all speculative. CBAs are not permanent, and re-negotiating about wages from a statutory floor is certainly a much better bargaining position than starting from scratch. Maintaining the statutory floor is a significant, protectable interest for IBT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Likewise,\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   guides us on the other three elements of intervention by right. First, there is no dispute that IBT's motion was timely. Next, because IBT has an interest in the right to a prevailing wage, the district court invalidating the law clearly impaired that interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713416\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/1184/#p1189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, finally, IBT's interests are potentially more narrow than the public's at large, and the State's representation of those interests \"\n   <em>\n    may have been\n   </em>\n   inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713416\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/1184/#p1189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As such, we see no reason to depart from\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   and therefore conclude that the district court erred in denying IBT's motion to intervene as a matter of right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    3.
