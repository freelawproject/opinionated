The County finances its transit operations in part by selling advertising space on the exterior of buses. Although many municipalities restrict advertising to commercial publicity, King County accepts all ads that do not contain specified categories of prohibited content. This case requires us to consider three of those categories: false statements, disparaging material, and content that may disrupt the transit system. Plaintiffs American Freedom Defense Initiative, Pamela Geller, and Robert Spencer submitted an ad concerning global terrorism that contained, in the County's view, all three types of prohibited content. Plaintiffs then submitted a revised, factually accurate ad, which the County rejected\n   under the remaining two categories. Plaintiffs brought this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that the County unconstitutionally refused to display their ads. The district court granted summary judgment to the County, and Plaintiffs timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Reviewing de novo,\n   <em>\n    Dutta v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

The County permissibly rejected the factually inaccurate ad because the First Amendment does not require the County to display patently false content in a nonpublic forum. But the County's rejection of the revised ad does not withstand scrutiny. Applying\n   <em>\n    Matal v.

The ad eventually drew the attention of a few members of the public. Metro received two letters from community leaders expressing concern that the ads would lead to more hate crimes, a letter from a member of Congress along the same lines, and two complaints from Metro-area residents who worried that the ads were \"incendiary\" and \"inflammatory.\" Metro began a process of reevaluating its approval but, before the reevaluation concluded, the State Department voluntarily retracted the ad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   About a month later, Plaintiffs submitted their own ad, modeled on the State Department's placard:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Metro rejected Plaintiffs' ad, concluding that it failed to comply with three substantive\n   criteria of Metro's transit advertising policy. In Metro's view, the ad made false statements; it contained demeaning or disparaging content; and it foreseeably would harm or disrupt the transit system. Metro's advertising policy prohibits all three categories of content (and eight additional categories not at issue here).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs then filed this action, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that Metro's rejection of the ad violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court denied Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, and Plaintiffs appealed.

But we have little difficulty drawing the line here. Metro accepts ads on a wide range of subject matters, including terrorism, but denies access to Plaintiffs and anyone else if the proposed ad offends. We cannot conclude that the appropriate limitation on subject matter is \"offensive speech\" any more than we could conclude that an appropriate limitation on subject matter is \"pro-life speech\" or \"pro-choice speech.\" All of those limitations exclude speech solely on the basis of viewpoint-an impermissible restriction in a nonpublic forum (as in other contexts).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wandering Dago, Inc. v.

But unlike viewpoint-neutral restrictions on advocacy and litigation, a disparagement restriction is itself viewpoint discriminatory on its face, under\n   <em>\n    Matal\n   </em>\n   , even if the restriction also can be considered a limitation on the means of expressing an underlying viewpoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In sum, Metro's disparagement clause discriminates, on its face, on the basis of viewpoint. The disparagement clause therefore cannot serve as a constitutionally valid basis for rejecting Plaintiffs' revised ad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore turn to Metro's alternative reason to reject the revised ad: feared disruption to the transit system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Disruption Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The disruption clause in Metro's transit advertising policy states that Metro will reject any ad that is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Harmful or Disruptive to Transit System\n   </em>\n   . Advertising that contains material that is so objectionable as to be reasonably foreseeable that it will result in harm to, disruption of or interference with the transportation system. For purposes of determining whether an advertisement contains such material, the County will determine whether a reasonably prudent person, knowledgeable of the County's ridership and using prevailing community standards, would believe that the material is so objectionable that it is reasonably foreseeable that it will result in harm to, disruption of or interference with the transportation system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We previously upheld, as constitutionally valid on its face, an earlier version of the disruption clause.\n   <em>\n    SeaMAC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076420\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/489/#p498\">\n    781 F.3d at 499-503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Metro made some minor changes to the clause after we decided\n   <em>\n    SeaMAC\n   </em>\n   , none affects the clause's facial constitutionality. As explained below, the present version of the disruption clause, like the earlier one, survives facial scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The clause is reasonable in light of the forum's purpose because \"[a]ny speech that will foreseeably result in harm to, disruption of, or interference with the transportation system is, by definition, incompatible with the buses' intended purpose\": \"safe and reliable public transportation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076420\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/489/#p498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076420\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/489/#p498\">\n    at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, the disruption clause \"[o]n its face ... is viewpoint neutral: It excludes all ads-whatever their viewpoint-that may foreseeably result in harm to, disruption of, or interference with the transportation system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 501-02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We emphasize that\n   <em>\n    Matal\n   </em>\n   does not affect the facial constitutionality of the disruption clause. Although\n   <em>\n    Matal\n   </em>\n   instructs\n   that Metro may not discriminate solely on the basis of viewpoint, the disruption clause discriminates on the permissible, viewpoint-neutral, and objective criterion of disruption to the transit system. That is, whether or not an ad is offensive (under a \"reasonably prudent person\" standard or otherwise), Metro may reject an ad if harm to the transit system is reasonably foreseeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Metro's rejection, however, must be borne out by the record: \"We must independently review the record, without deference to the threat assessment made by County officials, to determine whether it shows that the asserted risks were real.\"\n   <em>\n    SeaMAC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076420\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/489/#p498\">\n    781 F.3d at 500-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Here, Metro submitted an expert's report describing the invidious nature of ads that depict only persons of a certain race or ethnicity as terrorists. Such ads may perpetuate harmful stereotypes and may upset riders which, in turn, may cause a decrease in ridership. Metro has concluded that, accordingly, it is reasonably foreseeable that Plaintiffs' ad will harm the transit system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Determining whether it is \"reasonably foreseeable\" that the transit system will be harmed necessarily requires some level of speculation, and Metro's analysis has some foundation. Here, though, we have an unusual opportunity to test Metro's hypothesis. Metro approved a very similar ad-the State Department's own \"Faces of Global Terrorism\" ad-which actually ran for a period of nearly three weeks. During that time, Metro received a small number of complaints and expressions of concern, but Metro's transit system did not experience\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   harm, disruption, or interference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Metro's concerns about Plaintiffs' ad apply equally to the State Department's ad, and Metro has not explained why it fears harm to the transit system from Plaintiffs' ad when no harm at all resulted from displaying the State Department's ad. Applying the disruption standard without deference to Metro's assessment, we cannot conclude that a reasonably prudent person would reasonably foresee harm to the transit system from Plaintiffs' ad. Accordingly, we hold that Metro's rejection of Plaintiffs' revised ad on the ground of disruption to the transit system was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because neither of Metro's reasons for rejecting Plaintiffs' revised ad withstands First Amendment scrutiny, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to the County and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment for Plaintiffs on this claim. We stress that the First Amendment does not require Metro to tolerate harm to the transit system. If the situation changes such that Metro reasonably fears harm, then it may reject, or cancel its approval of, Plaintiffs' ad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part and REMANDED with instructions.\n   </strong>\n   The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In August 2013, the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington hosted a meeting at which community members expressed concern that the State Department's now-retracted ad \"left viewers with the false impression that the look of terrorism is exclusive to people of Middle Eastern and Asian descent and that people of Middle Eastern or South Asian descent should be feared and that the particular use of imagery in the ads promoted stereotyping.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In their amended complaint, as in the original complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that Metro's rejection also violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.
