The district court granted DLC's motion for summary judgment, holding that DLC qualifies as \"an employer engaged in the business of operating taxicabs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On appeal, Munoz-Gonzalez argues that the district court misinterpreted the word \"taxicab.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Having consulted dictionaries, the FLSA and other contemporaneously-enacted statutes, and related legal usage, we conclude that DLC is \"an employer engaged in the business of operating taxicabs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Three factors guide our understanding of what a \"taxicab\" is-namely, that it is: (1) a chauffeured passenger vehicle; (2) available for hire by individual members of the general public; (3) that has no fixed schedule, fixed route, or fixed termini. There is no genuine dispute that DLC's cars, vans, and SUVs meet this description, and so we conclude that DLC's drivers are \"employed by an employer engaged in the business of operating taxicabs,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 213(b)(17). We therefore AFFIRM the judgment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   DLC runs a chauffeured car service in New York's Westchester County. Though one company, DLC operates under two names: DLC Ground Transportation Services and LSW Chauffeured Transportation\n   (\"LSW\"). The latter charges higher fares and uses more expensive cars, the former is the source of most of DLC's business, and both share the same staff, dispatchers, drivers, and management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DLC's fleet consists mostly of five-person cars, but it also has some SUVs, luxury vans, and mini-coaches. DLC's vehicles are not metered, nor do they have \"Taxi\" or \"Vacancy\" signs on their roofs. DLC's drivers must dress professionally in a black suit, white shirt, company tie, black shoes, and black socks. They may not choose their own jobs or pick up passengers who hail them from the street; DLC's central dispatch, which passengers call to arrange for pickup, assigns drivers all their jobs. Drivers take the passengers wherever they want to go, generally relying on in-car navigation systems for directions unless the customer directs the driver to take a different route. Most trips are local (less than seventy miles), but passengers may book longer trips within the tristate area. Passengers often prepay their fares before trips begin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the time at issue in this case, most of DLC's work came from trips originating at the Westchester County Airport, where it operated a taxi stand. Its contract with the Airport required it to list itself as an Airport Transportation Service and a Limousine Service in the NYNEX Yellow Pages. The second largest source of DLC's work came from passengers calling DLC's dispatcher to request pickup. DLC also received small portions of its business (less than 5% total) from contracts with:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) a local hotel that allowed DLC to keep a counter in its lobby to serve the hotel's guests, in exchange for DLC paying the hotel a commission for these rides; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) PepsiCo to provide transportation to and from its offices as requested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Finally, for some of its repeat customers, DLC would instruct its drivers to charge certain fixed rates, treat the passengers as \"VIP[s],\" and keep bottled water and newspapers in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the period relevant here, many of DLC's drivers worked more than forty hours every week, but DLC did not pay them overtime compensation. In 2003, a former driver sued DLC for overtime compensation under the FLSA. DLC responded that it did not have to pay the driver overtime because, as \"an employer engaged in the business of operating taxicabs,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(17), its drivers were exempt from the FLSA's overtime requirements. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York agreed and dismissed the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cariani v. D.L.C. Limousine Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9014869\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/363/637/#p645\">\n    363 F.Supp.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645, 649 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). Since\n   <em>\n    Cariani\n   </em>\n   , DLC has renamed its upscale car service to its current name, LSW, entered into its contracts with the local hotel and PepsiCo, and increased the size of its LSW fleet to as many as twenty-five cars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 2, 2015, lead Plaintiff-Appellant Munoz-Gonzalez sued DLC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. He and approximately twenty other named plaintiffs wish to represent a class of former DLC drivers who, like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Cariani\n   </em>\n   , are seeking to recover overtime compensation under the FLSA. On July 12, 2017, the district court granted summary judgment to DLC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Munoz-Gonzalez v. D.L.C. Limousine Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-9368 (JPO),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202973980\">\n    2017 WL 2973980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9 (S.D.N.Y. July 12, 2017) (Oetken,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The FLSA does not define the word \"taxicabs,\" but the Department of Labor's Field Operations Handbook (2016 ed.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\"Handbook\") lists criteria to help assess whether car services qualify for the taxicab exemption. Applying the Handbook's criteria, the district court concluded that even though DLC had some \"recurrent contracts\" during the relevant period with a local hotel and PepsiCo, DLC's drivers did not drive along \"fixed routes\" and DLC served primarily local needs, which, on balance, demonstrated that it operated as a taxicab company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5. Munoz-Gonzalez argued that DLC is an \"airport limousine service,\" which the Handbook distinguishes from a taxicab company, because most of its business comes from trips from the Westchester County Airport. The court disagreed, reasoning that DLC receives so much of its business from airport trips only because Westchester County has little need for taxicabs beyond shuttling passengers to and from transportation hubs. Finally, Munoz-Gonzalez contended that DLC is not a taxicab company because it assigns its drivers their jobs, advertises itself as a limousine service, and charges higher fees than ordinary taxicab companies. The district court concluded that these factors carry little weight because the Handbook does not list them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court entered final judgment on August 2, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the district court's grant of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramos v.

Section 13(b) of the FLSA exempts certain categories of employees from overtime but not minimum wage. This case concerns \u00a7 13(b)(17), the \"taxicab exemption,\" which exempts from the overtime requirement \"any driver employed by an employer engaged in the business of operating taxicabs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 213(b)(17).

The legal issue before us, accordingly, is whether DLC is \"engaged in the business of operating taxicabs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This Court has never interpreted the taxicab exemption before. Both Munoz-Gonzalez's\n   and DLC's briefs focus extensively on how the Department of Labor defines the taxicab exemption in its Handbook. But they have skipped a crucial step. \"In statutory construction, we begin with the language of the statute. If the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent-as is the case here-the inquiry ceases.\"\n   <em>\n    Kingdomware Techs., Inc. v.

We nevertheless address each of Munoz-Gonzalez's arguments in turn and conclude that none of them are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, Munoz-Gonzalez contends that DLC is not a taxicab company because it has contracts for recurrent transportation with PepsiCo and a local hotel, as well as accounts with various repeat customers. This means, he maintains, that DLC does not operate \"without ... contracts for recurrent transportation\" and thus does not qualify for the taxicab exemption. Handbook \u00a7 24h01. We disagree. Contracts like DLC's with the local hotel have long been common in the taxicab industry.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Hodges,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 19 (observing that the Waldorf Astoria earned $30,000 annually from this practice in the 1910s). Moreover, we disagree that a taxicab loses its essence if it enters into a few corporate contracts of the magnitude of those at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To be sure, a company that received virtually all its business from recurrent contracts and corporate clients might not be \"available for hire by individual members of the general public\" under our three-part definition.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McKinney v. Med Grp. Transp. LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4312376\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/988/993/#p1002\">\n    988 F.Supp.2d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1002 (E.D. Wis. 2013) (concluding that a car service was not a taxicab company because it received \"ninety-five to ninety-eight percent of its business through these types of contracts\"). But DLC's so-called \"recurrent contracts\" during the relevant period constituted a negligible amount-less than 5%-of DLC's business. What matters is that DLC's cars were available for hire by individual members of the general public, and there is no genuine dispute that they were. We therefore disagree with Munoz-Gonzalez's contention that \"a business's possession of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   contracts for recurrent transportation ... disqualif[ies]\" its drivers from the taxicab exemption. Pls.-Appellants Br. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, Munoz-Gonzalez argues that DLC does not serve the \"predominantly local transportation needs of the community\" because passengers sometimes travel long distances within the tristate area. Handbook \u00a7 24h01. But there is no genuine dispute that DLC's trips rarely exceed seventy miles, and we do not take the Handbook to mean that a taxicab never travels longer distances. In any event, Munoz-Gonzalez's argument here is self-defeating, at least in this geographical area, because drivers who predominantly travel across state lines would also be exempt from the FLSA's overtime requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (exempting, via reference to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031502\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , any driver of a \"motor carrier\" that transports passengers across state lines,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031502\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13501);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Handbook \u00a7 24h05 (\"If for any reason, taxicab drivers are not exempt ... under section 13(b)(17), the possible application of section 13(b)(1) should not be overlooked.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, Munoz-Gonzalez argues that DLC is not \"engaged in the business of operating taxicabs\" because it really runs \"an airport limousine service.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Handbook\n   \u00a7 24h03(a)(4). This is so, in his view, because DLC's contract with the Westchester Airport requires it to list itself in the NYNEX Yellow Pages as an Airport Transportation Service and Limousine Service, up to 91% of DLC's business comes from trips leaving the Westchester County Airport, and passengers often pre-pay their fare. But Munoz-Gonzalez has misinterpreted the term \"airport limousine service.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although certain upscale luxury cars are commonly referred to as \"limousines,\" a secondary definition for the word \"limousine\" is a vehicle \"used to carry passengers\n   <em>\n    on a regular route\n   </em>\n   , as between an airport and a downtown area.\"\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   1016 (4th ed. 2000) (emphasis added). This is almost certainly what the Handbook means by \"airport limousine service.\" After using the term \"airport limousine service,\" the Handbook references back to an earlier section that describes \"buses/shuttle services/limousines carrying interstate passengers and their baggage\n   <em>\n    to and from\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    transportation terminals\n   </em>\n   .\" Handbook \u00a7 24c04 (emphasis added). And just three years after the taxicab exemption was enacted, the Fourth Circuit distinguished \"taxicabs\" from \"airport limousines\" because the latter have \"fixed routes\" while the former do not.\n   <em>\n    Tobin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492472\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/198/249/#p252\">\n    198 F.2d at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, if \"airport limousine service\" referred to cars available for hire by the public that frequently travel to or from an airport, it would be impossible to distinguish taxicabs from \"airport limousines,\" as the Handbook itself notes that taxicabs \"may [have] stands at ... transportation terminals,\" including airports. Handbook \u00a7 24h01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Accordingly, the Handbook uses the term \"airport limousine service\" to refer to shuttles that drive on a regular route between an airport and another location. The Handbook lacks the force of law and the term \"airport limousine service\" does not appear in the FLSA. But even setting these problems aside, DLC is not an airport limousine service for the same reasons that it\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a taxicab company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, departing from both the text of the FLSA and the Handbook, Munoz-Gonzalez argues that DLC is not a taxicab company because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (1) it controls its drivers' work;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (2) its cars do not look like taxicabs; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (3) it advertises itself as a luxury car company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As these factors are neither among those highlighted in our earlier analysis nor are they featured in the Handbook, we consider them of limited importance. But because some other courts have found these factors relevant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   we explain below why, even setting aside the FLSA's text, the taxicab exemption\n   <em>\n    should not\n   </em>\n   turn on these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   First, the simple fact that DLC's dispatcher controls its drivers' assignments - and thus that customers cannot hail DLC cars from the street-does not cut against its being a taxicab company. Taxicabs have not always cruised for passengers,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Hodges,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 72, and control over drivers bears on whether the drivers are independent contractors or employees, not the nature of DLC's business,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 2 (1958). What is more, DLC requires its drivers to take assignments from a central dispatcher because municipalities in Westchester County prohibit taxicab drivers from picking up people from the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Second, DLC's cars should not fail to qualify as \"taxicabs\" simply because they lack \"Taxi\" or \"Vacancy\" signs and taximeters, or because DLC's drivers must dress professionally in black suits, white shirts, and ties. The appearance of the car and dress of the driver do not weigh heavily in our consideration. Both go more to the marketing of the business than the core operation of the business itself. Taxicabs have come a long way since the \"hackney carriage\" of old, and no reasonable legislator would have wanted the scope of the taxicab exemption to turn on a car's aesthetics or its driver's couture.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Hodges,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 8-9 (noting that one of New York City's first taxicab companies required its drivers to wear \"a uniform designed to emulate a West Point cadet's\"). In short, no one ordering a \"taxicab\" would think twice if one of DLC's chauffeured cars arrived to pick her up.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mohamad v. Palestinian Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189485\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/449/#p454\">\n    566 U.S. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 454,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189485\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/449/#p454\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189485\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/449/#p454\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (interpreting a word's plain meaning with reference to how people \"use the word in everyday parlance\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, although DLC does indeed advertise some of its services in the Yellow Pages as luxury car transportation (or \"Limousine Services\") rather than taxicab transportation, we do not believe that this should matter either. A taxicab is a taxicab is a taxicab; how a company\n   <em>\n    markets\n   </em>\n   its services or products does not change what it\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   for purposes of the FLSA. The factors we have noted above provide the more appropriate focus for assessing the applicability of the taxicab exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Because we are reviewing this case on appeal from a grant of summary judgment to DLC, the facts outlined below are either undisputed or viewed in the light most favorable to Munoz-Gonzalez.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Raspardo v.

And the\n    <em>\n     Oxford English Dictionary\n    </em>\n    , cited by Munoz-Gonzalez, defines it as \"[a] cab for public hire, fitted with a taximeter;\n    <em>\n     esp.\n    </em>\n    an automobile or motor-cab so furnished.\" 17\n    <em>\n     The Oxford English Dictionary\n    </em>\n    680 (2d ed. 1989). We conclude, however, that\n    <em>\n     Webster's\n    </em>\n    definition hits closest to the mark.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan Garner,\n    <em>\n     Reading Law\n    </em>\n    70 (2012) (\"Most common English words have a number of dictionary definitions ....

We are loath to conclude that a taxicab loses its essence if the driver removes the taximeter, or that legislators would (or did) hinge FLSA overtime liability on the presence or absence of such a meter.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Pettus v.
