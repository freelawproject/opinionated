Capitation means an amount is paid per person.\n    <em>\n     Capitation\n    </em>\n    , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Under Medicare Advantage's capitation system, private health insurance organizations provide Medicare benefits in exchange for a fixed monthly fee per person enrolled in the program-regardless of actual healthcare usage. These organizations pocket for themselves or pay out to their enrollees' providers the difference between their capitation revenue and their enrollees' medical expenses, creating an incentive for the organizations to rein in costs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Patricia A.

(\"MedXM\"). MedXM employs physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants to conduct in-home health assessments of Medicare beneficiaries. Silingo alleges that from 2010 to 2014, MedXM contracted with the defendant Medicare Advantage organizations to provide up-to-date diagnosis codes and medical documentation for enrollees who otherwise may not have had an eligible medical encounter during a calendar year.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    In August 2013, Silingo filed an initial complaint against MedXM and the defendant Medicare Advantage organizations under the False Claims Act. In May 2014, Silingo filed her first amended complaint. The United States then declined to intervene, and in January 2015 Silingo filed a second amended complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The crux of the complaint is that the defendant Medicare Advantage organizations retained MedXM to fraudulently increase, or at least maintain, their capitation payments for enrollees whose risk scores were set to expire and revert to the unadjusted Medicare beneficiary average.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    First, Silingo claims that MedXM used inappropriate software so that it could edit health records to exaggerate medical diagnoses. Silingo alleges that MedXM's in-home health assessment reports were prepared in Microsoft Word templates that are not \"protected against modification,\" and were signed by merely typing in the medical examiner's name, which is not an acceptable electronic signature.\n    <em>\n     Medicare Program Integrity Manual\n    </em>\n    , ch. 3, \u00a7 3.3.2.4. Once in the hands of MedXM's coders, these reports were allegedly modified to delete information showing little risk and insert new information to support diagnoses with higher risk scores. According to Silingo, MedXM then saved these reports as PDF files and submitted them to Medicare Advantage organizations as support for inflated risk adjustment data. Silingo asserts that all of MedXM's health assessment reports violated CMS's requirements for electronic medical records, and that more than half of them had been tampered with in this manner.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Next, Silingo claims that MedXM's fleet of mostly nurse practitioners and physician assistants were not legally authorized to make conclusive medical diagnoses, so their examinations could not support the risk adjustment data that was submitted. Before 2012, MedXM allegedly contracted directly with these healthcare providers without ensuring that they practiced under the supervision of licensed physicians. From 2012 to 2014, MedXM allegedly had contract physicians fraudulently sign standard care agreements with these non-physician providers without properly supervising their work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Silingo also claims MedXM systematically fabricated complex diagnoses that its\n    medical examiners could not have possibly confirmed during an in-home assessment. The complaint identifies a variety of ailments-such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease-that allegedly cannot be diagnosed without a spirometry test, biopsy, follow-up blood test, or other invasive procedure that MedXM's examiners were unequipped and unauthorized to perform in a person's home. Instead, Silingo alleges, MedXM's medical examiners and coders simply recycled prior diagnoses and medical histories in the updated health assessment reports.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Further, Silingo claims that MedXM regularly produced diagnostic information that was not the result of face-to-face medical encounters. By her estimation, in-home health assessments took about 45 minutes plus travel time and could be performed only within an 11-hour window, so MedXM's medical examiners realistically could not perform more than 13 in-home health assessments per day. But Silingo alleges that many examiners consistently reported more than 15 assessments per day, with some reporting as many as 25. Silingo contends that these examiners boosted their assessment numbers by sometimes submitting identical vital statistics (age, weight, sex, and so on) for hundreds of enrollees, and only \"correcting\" these suspicious data entries when requested by Medicare Advantage organizations, by collecting information over the phone or having MedXM's coders forge new data.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    A company offering in-home health assessment services has no intrinsic reason to overstate its findings. Rather, as Silingo alleges, MedXM went to the trouble of editing and forging medical records to provide its clients with more lucrative diagnosis codes-earning the Medicare Advantage organizations higher than warranted capitation payments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Silingo contends that the defendant Medicare Advantage organizations made false claims for payment by submitting MedXM's risk adjustment data to CMS for several years, either with actual knowledge that the data were invalid or with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance as to their validity. In doing so, the organizations allegedly violated the certification requirements of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20422.504\">\n     42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.504\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (l)(2), which is an express condition of payment.

Broadly speaking, if a fraudulent scheme resembles a chain conspiracy, then a complaint must separately identify which defendant was responsible for what distinct part of the plan. By contrast, if a fraudulent scheme resembles a wheel conspiracy, then any parallel actions of the \"spokes\" can be addressed by collective allegations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Applying Swoben here in light of these related principles, we observe that Silingo has pleaded a wheel conspiracy-like fraud in which MedXM was the \"hub\" and the defendant Medicare Advantage organizations were the \"spokes.\" Each of the defendant organizations allegedly had separate contracts with MedXM, and each of them allegedly passed on MedXM's inflated diagnosis information in the same way. These organizations thus miss the mark when they implore us to consider that they are \"unrelated, dissimilar defendants with no relevant business connections to one another and that [they] differ in size, geography, and member populations.\" Because the Medicare Advantage organizations are largely \"alleged to have engaged in precisely the same conduct,\" there was no reason (and no way) for Silingo to differentiate among those allegations that are common to the group.\n    <em>\n     Swoben\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277918\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/1161/#p1169\">\n     848 F.3d at 1184\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The complaint details a variety of ways in which the defendant organizations knew or showed reckless disregard or deliberate indifference of the alleged fact that MedXM's risk adjustment data were invalid.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    For one thing, Silingo claims that every health assessment report contained a typewritten signature only, violating the requirements for medical records underlying risk adjustment data.\n    <em>\n     See Medicare Program Integrity Manual\n    </em>\n    , ch. 3, \u00a7 3.3.2.4 (describing requirements for handwritten and electronic signatures);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Policy and Technical Changes,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2019%2C678\">\n     75 Fed. Reg. at 19,742\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Medical records with missing signatures or credentials are scored as errors under [risk adjustment data validation] audit procedures.\"). Similarly, Silingo contends that these errant signatures should have tipped off the defendant organizations that MedXM was editing its examiners' unsecured reports.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    For another, Silingo alleges that other parts of MedXM's health assessment reports provided additional reasons for suspicion. According to the complaint, MedXM's frequent use of nurse practitioners and physician assistants as examiners was a \"serious red flag\" because these practitioners are commonly known to be limited by law in their ability to make diagnoses. MedXM's diagnosis codes themselves could have revealed the fraud because, as Silingo alleges, many complex diagnoses cannot be confirmed during brief and non-invasive in-home assessments. And Silingo claims that duplicative patient data were sometimes sent to the defendant organizations before being \"corrected,\" which would suggest that something was amiss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Taking all reasonable inferences in Silingo's favor,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Iqbal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     556 U.S. at 678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1937\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , there are still further grounds for concluding that the allegations of the defendant organizations' knowledge, reckless disregard, or deliberate ignorance of the fraud is plausible. Even without the concrete signs detailed above, one would expect that a sophisticated company would notice when its contractor's work is too good to be true. MedXM was allegedly obtaining worse-than-average diagnostic information from enrollees who did not otherwise visit a healthcare provider during a calendar year, and thus would not seem to be in such dire health. The defendant organizations' materials show that the use of in-home assessments is controversial, with CMS repeatedly expressing interest in forbidding their use on the ground that they \"contribute[ ] to increased risk scores and differences in coding patterns\" between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    And all of these organizations had an incentive to\n    pass along fraudulent data because, by overstating diagnoses, they could yield more revenue and profit under the capitated payment system-and it was not certain that they would get caught. That may not have been what was going on here, but the third amended complaint certainly states a plausible claim for knowingly participating in fraud, even as to the well-respected companies who are defending here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    It is no defense that Silingo's core allegations against the defendant Medicare Advantage organizations are all alike. If a group pleading against similarly situated defendants can satisfy Rule 9(b), then it can also satisfy the lesser notice pleading standard of Rule 8.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Swoben\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277918\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/1161/#p1169\">\n     848 F.3d at 1184\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Silingo simply claims that all of the defendant organizations were equally put on notice by the warning signs that allegedly infected MedXM's health assessment reports. These allegations, if true, give rise to the reasonable inference that the defendant organizations knowingly submitted false claims and used false records, or else acted with reckless disregard or deliberate indifference of the falsity of these claims and records.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Corinthian Colleges\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3829163\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/984/#p991\">\n     655 F.3d at 996\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because each Medicare Advantage organization must certify the validity of its data \"based on best knowledge, information, and belief,\" these same allegations also support Silingo's express false certification claim.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20422.504\">\n     42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.504\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (l)(2) ;\n    <em>\n     Swoben\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277918\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/1161/#p1169\">\n     848 F.3d at 1169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <strong>\n     VI\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Silingo also appeals the dismissal of her second amended complaint's count for a reverse false claim. But she did not defend this claim in response to the motions to dismiss, so she may not revive it on appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carvalho v. Equifax Info.
