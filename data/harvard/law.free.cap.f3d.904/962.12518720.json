While that motion was pending, the Supreme Court issued its 2015 decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Randolph moved to supplement his \u00a7 2255 motion to add a claim that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   invalidated his sentence. The district court granted that motion to supplement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court denied Randolph's \u00a7 2255 motion in 2016. It ruled that his\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claims were procedurally defaulted because he had not appealed his sentence. Randolph moved the court to reconsider its order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion, noting that the Supreme Court had recently made the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   rule retroactive in\n   <em>\n    Welch v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 578 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), but the court denied the motion to reconsider because it only rehashed previous arguments. Randolph did not appeal the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   That same year, Randolph filed a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   application with this Court for a certificate authorizing him to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. His application indicated that he sought to challenge his sentence again based on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . We authorized him to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion raising his proposed\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim. We did so because we concluded that Randolph had made a prima facie showing that his claim met the criteria of \u00a7 2255(h)(2), although we did note that it was unclear whether the sentencing court had relied on the ACCA's residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With the assistance of counsel, Randolph filed his second \u00a7 2255 motion. In it he argued that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ruled out his prior convictions as ACCA predicates. He also argued that his\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim was not\n   procedurally defaulted, and in the alternative, that default was excusable because the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim was not available to him during his first \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction because the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim had already been raised, briefed, and rejected in his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, and as a result, it was not based on \"a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2). This is Randolph's appeal of that dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   the dismissal of a habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Bradley v. Pryor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11394035\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/1287/#p1289\">\n    305 F.3d 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1289 (11th Cir. 2002). Once we have authorized a movant to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court has jurisdiction to determine for itself if the motion relies on \"a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2). If the motion meets those requirements, the district court has jurisdiction to decide whether any relief is due under the motion; if the motion does not meet the \u00a7 2255(h) requirements, the court lacks jurisdiction to decide whether the motion has any merit. The district court determined that Randolph did not meet those requirements because the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim was available, and in fact had been raised, briefed, and decided in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. In that first motion, as well as this second one, Randolph contended that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   invalidated his enhanced sentence because the sentencing court had relied on the residual clause in treating his prior conviction for third degree burglary as a predicate violent felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court was correct to dismiss Randolph's second motion because the claim it presented had also been presented in the first motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (\"A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.\");\n   <em>\n    In re Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928116\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1273/#p1275\">\n    830 F.3d 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1275-76 (11th Cir. 2016) (holding that \u00a7 2244(b)(1) bars repetitious \u00a7 2255 motions as well as \u00a7 2254 motions);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5927830\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1295/#p1297\">\n    830 F.3d 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1297 (11th Cir. 2016) (\"[A] prisoner may not file what amounts to a motion for reconsideration under the guise of a separate and purportedly new application when the new application raises the same claim that was raised and rejected in the prior application.\") (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Not only that, but the fact that Randolph had presented the claim in the first motion necessarily means it was available to him then, which rules out it being \"previously unavailable,\" a requirement under \u00a7 2255(h)(2). He argues that his\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim was not available for purposes of \u00a7 2255(h)(2) until the Supreme Court announced that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was retroactive in\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   . That argument conflates availability and retroactivity, which violates the rule against surplusage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowe v. SEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512342\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/181/\">\n    472 U.S. 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207 n.53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512342\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/181/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2572 n.53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512342\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/181/\">\n    86 L.Ed.2d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) (\"[W]e must give effect to every word that Congress used in the statute.\").\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   made\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   retroactive, but the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   rule was available from the time\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was decided, as the fact that Randolph raised a claim based on it shows. It violates common sense and ordinary English usage to say that an argument was not available at the time one made the argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunn v. Singletary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11639571\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/440/#p442\">\n    168 F.3d 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 442 (11th Cir. 1999) (\"[T]he ... inquiry as to whether a petition is second or successive must focus on the substance of the prior proceedings-on\n   what actually happened.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336436\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/113/181/#p183\">\n    113 F.3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 183 (11th Cir. 1997) (\"The pragmatic approach we have adopted properly recognizes that the liberal amendment policy applicable to habeas petitions may make claims based upon new rules of constitutional law 'available' to the petitioner during a prior habeas action, even when the claim would not have been available at the inception of that prior action.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Randolph also argues that\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   , \"by declaring\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claims to be retroactive, whitewashed any procedural default that may have come before.\" That argument goes to what the district court should have done with an issue it decided in the first motion, and what it could do with that issue if it had jurisdiction to decide the second motion. But the correctness of the denial of a first motion does not count in deciding whether the court has jurisdiction to decide claims and defenses that would arise from the second motion. What counts is whether the second motion relies on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactively applicable by the Supreme Court that was unavailable at the time of the first motion. This second \u00a7 2255 motion does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, we reject Randolph's argument that the district court owed some deference to our order authorizing him to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion. When we issue an order authorizing a habeas petitioner to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, \"the district court is to decide the \u00a7 2255(h) issues fresh, or in the legal vernacular,\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    In re Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5926652\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1268/#p1271\">\n    830 F.3d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1271 (11th Cir. 2016) (alterations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Moss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870085\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/1301/#p1303\">\n    703 F.3d 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1303 (11th Cir. 2013) (holding that the district court must decide\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   whether a habeas application satisfies \u00a7 2255(h) );\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.
