Joshua testified that, a few days prior to the murders, he ran into Miles at the Save-Way, and Miles told Joshua that Issa had paid him to kill someone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1164-65 (Page ID #9730-31). Miles asked Joshua if he wanted to help, but Joshua declined the offer and did not believe Miles was serious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Joshua told Bonnie about Miles's statement, she did not think Miles would actually kill anyone because Miles talked \"about doing a lot of things and never did it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1126 (Page ID #9692). Then, according to Joshua, around 5:00 p.m. on November 22, Miles called Joshua and told him that he had killed Maher and Ziad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1167 (Page ID #9733). Miles informed Joshua that Miles had placed the rifle in a plastic bag and had put it in the Willises' backyard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, according to the Willises' testimony, Miles went to the Willises' home and described the murders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1094-97, 1168-69 (Page ID #9660-63, 9734-35). The Willises testified that Miles told the Willises that Issa was going to give Miles $2000 for killing Maher.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1106 (Page ID #9672). At Issa's trial, the Willises described Miles's statements to them about how the murders occurred; for instance, Bonnie stated that Miles said that he got the rifle, which was hidden behind some crates that were behind a dumpster at the Save-Way, and then waited for Maher to come back to the store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1106-07 (Page ID #9672-73). Bonnie then testified that Miles told the Willises that, when Miles saw Maher with Ziad, Miles demanded money from them, and they placed money on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1107-08 (Page ID #9673-74). Miles told the Willises that as he was bending to pick up the money, however, the rifle went off and shattered Maher's beverage bottle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Bonnie, Miles said that he shot each brother several times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bonnie then testified that Miles stated that Miles ran to the Willises' home and put the rifle in their yard; Miles then might have met Issa at a nearby parking lot, and Issa perhaps then drove Miles home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1103-04 (Page ID #9669-70). The Willises also testified at Issa's trial that, while Miles told this story, they thought that Miles was bragging.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1032, 1174-75 (Page ID #9598, 9740-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Joshua also testified at Issa's trial that, several days later, Joshua ran into Issa at the Save-Way, and Issa asked Joshua \"Does anybody know?\" and Joshua said \"No, not that I know of.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1183 (Page ID #9749). During this discussion, Joshua told Issa that Issa needed to get the rifle from the Willises' backyard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1171 (Page ID #9737). Issa replied that he would talk to Miles and that Miles would get the rifle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Joshua noticed that the bag was still in his yard, he confronted Issa again at the Save-Way.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1172 (Page ID #9738). Bonnie also testified that she told Issa he needed to get the rifle from their yard, and during this conversation, Issa asked Bonnie to tell Miles to not go near the store because police were investigating.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1099, 1133-32 (Page ID #9665).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Renee Hayes (\"Hayes\"), another Save-Way employee, also testified at Issa's trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 836 (Page ID #9401). Hayes testified that she thought that she observed Linda and Issa exchange $2000 on November 25, but she was not certain and did not pay close attention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 847, 857 (Page ID #9412, 9422). Hayes also testified, however, that all employees would help count and package money.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 846 (Page ID #9411). Furthermore, Hayes did not hear Linda or Issa make statements regarding a murder, but she did hear them discuss making a deposit for the store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 853-54 (Page ID #9418-19). According to Hayes, the money was deposited into the store's checking account on November 25.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 853 (Page ID #9418).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Additionally, Dwayne Howard, Hayes's husband, testified, and he stated that he saw a rifle at Issa's apartment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 861, 864-66 (Page ID #9427, 9430-32). Howard then identified during Issa's trial the rifle that he saw in Issa's apartment as the murder weapon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 866 (Page ID #9432). Also, according to Howard, Issa told Howard \"Don't be telling people [sic] no lies [sic] and stuff like that, seen him with a gun [sic].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 869 (Page ID #9435). On the other hand, Howard also stated that he does not know anything about guns and that he would not be able to identify the murder weapon if there were two identical rifles in front of him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 872, 875 (Page ID #9438, 9441).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Souhail Gammoh (\"Gammoh\"), another Save-Way employee, also testified that, on the night of the murders, Issa gave him a ride home from work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 887 (Page ID #9453). When Issa dropped Gammoh off between 1:14 and 1:20 a.m., Issa told Gammoh that he might pick Gammoh up later to go to a bar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 890 (Page ID #9456). Issa eventually did return around twenty-five or thirty-five minutes later, but Gammoh based this time range on the amount of beer that he had consumed from the time that Issa dropped off Gammoh and then returned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 894 (Page ID #9460).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Gammoh then testified that, at the crime scene, Gammoh told an officer that he and Issa closed the store, dropped off Issa's mom, and then went to the bar; he did not mention to the officer, however, that Issa was not with Gammoh all night.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 903-04 (Page ID #9469-70). When Gammoh\n   saw Issa later, Issa told Gammoh that the \"[n]ext time they ask [Gammoh], tell them that [they] were together.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 906 (Page ID #9472). Gammoh also testified that he observed Issa take a white trash bag out of Issa's trunk, but Gammoh did not know whether the trash bag was short-and-square or long-and-thin shaped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 916-17 (Page ID #9482-83). Additionally, Gammoh thought that he saw a rifle in Issa's apartment two weeks before the murders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 919 (Page ID #9485).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When an officer testified at Issa's trial, he stated that the police knew that the murder weapon used 7.62-caliber ammunition. R. 229-2 (App., Trial Tr. at 764-65) (Page ID #9329-30). The police then found one round of 7.62-caliber ammunition in Issa's apartment, but they did not find a weapon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 765 (Page ID #9330). A firearms examiner also testified that the round from Issa's apartment was from a different manufacturer than the discharged cartridge casings found next to the murder weapon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 777-78 (Page ID #9342-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on this evidence, on September 2, 1998, the jury convicted Issa of aggravated murder with a death penalty specification because the offense was committed for hire, so the penalty phase of the trial began. R. 229-3 (App., Trial Tr. at 1521-22) (Page ID #10089-90). Then on September 10, 1998, the jury recommend the death penalty, and the trial court sentenced Issa to death on October 16, 1998.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1642, 1647, 1651 (Page ID #10210, 10215, 10219).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Unlike the declarants in\n   <em>\n    Lilly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Madrigal\n   </em>\n   , Miles was not talking to police as a suspect when he made the out-of-court statement.

In fact, by stating that appellant had hired him to kill Maher, Miles was admitting a capital crime,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , murder for hire.

Miles, in fact, had lived at the Willises' home for a period of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1087 (Page ID #9653). That Miles made the statements about the murders at the Willises' home points towards trustworthiness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1142 (Page ID #9708). Additionally, by making these statements to friends, Miles did not have a reason to shift blame to Issa. Miles also made these statements voluntarily, and he did not make these statements in response to leading questions. Therefore, several facts suggest trustworthiness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A deeper examination of the circumstances surrounding Miles's statements, nonetheless, suggests that they are not trustworthy.

The prosecution, for instance, emphasized in its closing that it wanted the jury \"to look at ... Bonnie and Josh's statements because that's where you get the statements of Andre Miles, that's where you find Andre Miles did the shooting.\" R. 229-3 (App., Trial Tr. at 1445) (Page ID #10013). Additionally, at the end of closing argument, the prosecution stated that the Willises \"provided details to the police that the police didn't have. Think of that. They are\n   <em>\n    the cornerstone\n   </em>\n   of this investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1448-49 (Page ID #10016-17) (emphasis added). Thus, Miles's out-of-court statements were central to the prosecution's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Second, Miles's statements are the only direct evidence implicating Issa in a murder for hire. Hayes, for example, stated that she possibly observed Linda and Issa exchange $2,000, but she also stated that employees regularly helped count and package money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 846-48 (Page ID #9411-13). She also said that money was deposited into the store's checking account on November 25, 1997.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 853 (Page ID #9418). However, Howard and Gammoh each testified that he believed that he saw a rifle in Issa's apartment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 864-66, 919 (Page ID #9430-32, 9485). Gammoh's testimony also suggests that Issa might have had time to assist Miles because Issa dropped Gammoh off between 1:14 a.m. and 1:20 a.m. on the night of the murders and then picked Gammoh up about twenty-five or thirty-five minutes later-Gammoh came up with the calculation of this amount of time because that is how long it took him to finish his beer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 890, 894 (Page ID #9456, 9460). According to Gammoh's testimony, the next day, Issa told Gammoh that the \"[n]ext time [the police] ask [Gammoh], tell them that [Issa and Gammoh] were together, you know.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 906 (Page ID #9472).

Regarding the rifle, an officer testified that the police found one round of 7.62-caliber ammunition in Issa's apartment, but this was from a different manufacturer than the cartridges next to the murder weapon. R. 229-2 (App., Trial Tr. at 765, 777-78) (Page ID #9330, 9342-43). Joshua also stated in court, regarding the rifle in the Willises' backyard, that Issa told Joshua \"[o]kay. I'll talk to Andre and if Andre don't come and get it, I will.\" R. 229-3 (App., Trial Tr. at 1171) (Page ID #9737). Bonnie similarly testified that Issa asked Bonnie to tell Miles to not go to the Save-Way because the police were investigating.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1099 (Page ID #9665). In reviewing this remaining evidence, however, we cannot conclude that Miles's inadmissible statements did not have \"a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict,\" so the error was not harmless.\n   <em>\n    Brecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6235767\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/619/#p623\">\n    507 U.S. at 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6235767\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/619/#p623\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kotteakos v.

The state then presented the same theory at Issa's trial that it relied on at Linda's: Linda hired Issa to kill her husband, and Issa hired Miles to be the triggerman. Linda Khriss was available to testify at Issa's trial-and in fact sat in the courtroom throughout much of his trial. Yet trial counsel failed to call her. Issa therefore did not benefit from the testimony she gave at her own trial. The failure of Issa's counsel to have Linda testify to disprove Issa's involvement in the murder constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Sixth Amendment guarantees to a criminal defendant \"the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" U.S. Const. amend.

The Ohio court does not explain the content of the so-called \"damaging\" testimony given by Linda at her trial. The record in this case reflects only the testimony of an acquitted codefendant who testified in her own defense, denying any plan to kill her husband, as well as explicitly denying that she hired Issa to kill her husband. The Ohio court's speculation about the possibility of Linda's testimony being \"damaging\" is insufficient to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Towns v.

Even if something in the testimony could be perceived as negative, it was far outweighed by the fact that Linda's testimony disproved the entirety of the state's case and exonerated Issa.
