(\"Northstar\") against Schwab Investments, Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., and the trustees of the Schwab Trust (collectively, \"defendants\"). We conclude that SLUSA precludes all of Northstar's claims, and that the district court therefore correctly dismissed them. The district court erred, however, in dismissing the claims with prejudice. We therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Northstar is a registered investment advisory and financial planning firm that manages accounts on behalf of investors. During the relevant time period, Northstar traded through Charles Schwab's Institutional Advisor Platform, where it purchased shares in the Schwab Total Bond Market Fund (\"Fund\") for its clients. The Schwab Trust (\"Trust\") is a Massachusetts Business Trust having assets held by a group of trustees (\"Trustees\") who manage and supervise the Fund's operations for the benefit of its shareholders, the Trust's beneficiaries. Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (\"Schwab Advisor\"), an investment advisory firm affiliated with the Trust, has acted as the manager of, and investment advisor to, the Trust in accordance with a June 1994 Investment Advisory Agreement (\"IAA\"). The Schwab Advisor oversees the day-to-day operations of the Fund, including selection of investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Northstar's core allegations have remained the same across its five complaints. In a July 1997 Proxy Statement (\"1997 Proxy Statement\"), the Trustees sought a shareholder vote on two proposals relevant to this appeal. Proposal No. 2 would amend the Fund's fundamental investment objective to track the investment results of the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index (\"Index\"). Proposal No. 3 would change the Fund's \"fundamental investment\n   policies and investment restrictions\" regarding the concentration of investments to incorporate the SEC's interpretation of \"concentration\" from the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"ICA\"), which was and is 25% of the available assets in a fund. A majority of Fund shareholders voted to approve the proposals. As a result, the Trust was obligated to \"seek to track\" the Index and to invest no more than 25% of the Fund's total assets in any one industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From August 1997 through August 2007-which Northstar refers to as the \"Pre-Breach period\"-the Fund's investments performed in a manner substantially consistent with the Index. During this period, the Fund continuously offered its shares to the public pursuant to annual prospectuses, which affirmed to potential and current shareholders that the Trust was following the fundamental investment objectives set forth in the 1997 Proxy Statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   From August 2007 until February 2009-which Northstar refers to as the \"Breach period\"-the Trust continued to represent in Fund prospectuses and other public filings that the Fund would be managed conservatively and passively, and would be invested in the same securities as the Index, pursuant to its fundamental investment objective. In or about September 2007, however, the Trust caused the Fund to deviate from its fundamental investment policies by investing in collateralized mortgage obligations that were not part of the Index, and by concentrating more than 25% of the Fund's total assets in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The Fund deviated from its fundamental investment policies until about the end of February 2009. Fund shareholders suffered financial injury due to the Fund's deviation, as the Fund underperformed the Index during this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This case has a lengthy procedural history that includes the dismissal of successive amended complaints for failures to state claims. In June 2015, Northstar filed its Fourth Amended Complaint. In that complaint, Northstar asserted claims on behalf of Fund shareholders who purchased shares during the Breach period (\"Breach class\"), as well as those who purchased shares during the Pre-Breach period but held them during the Breach period (\"Pre-Breach class\"). The complaint alleges fourteen causes of action: seven pertaining to the Pre-Breach class, and seven pertaining to the Breach class. With respect to each class, Northstar alleged breach of fiduciary duties against both the Trust and the Trustees; breach of fiduciary duty against the Schwab Advisor; aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against the Trustees and the Schwab Advisor; breach of contract as third-party beneficiary to the IAA against the Schwab Advisor; breach of contract against the Trust; and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing against the Schwab Advisor and the Trustees. Northstar alleged that its claims, if barred by SLUSA, are nonetheless preserved by the \"Delaware carve-out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Northstar Fin.

In particular, the court granted the motion to dismiss, with prejudice, Northstar's claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, concluding that SLUSA barred those claims and that they did not fall within the Delaware carve-out.

In order to avoid PSLRA's heightened pleading requirements for class-action securities lawsuits, plaintiffs began asserting what were essentially federal securities law claims as state law causes of action in state courts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p82\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Congress sought to end this practice by enacting SLUSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   SLUSA bars a plaintiff class from bringing (1) a covered class action (2) based on state law claims (3) alleging that the defendants made a misrepresentation or omission or employed any manipulative or deceptive device (4) in connection with the purchase or sale of (5) a covered security.\n   <em>\n    Freeman Invs., L.P. v.

Here, the only element at issue is whether the plaintiff class alleged that the defendants made a misrepresentation or omission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Several basic principles about SLUSA govern our analysis of Northstar's claims. First, the Supreme Court has made clear that SLUSA's requirement that fraudulent statements be made in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security must be construed broadly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dabit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p82\">\n    547 U.S. at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p82\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The presumption that Congress envisioned a broad construction follows not only from ordinary principles of statutory construction but also from the particular concerns that culminated in SLUSA's enactment. A narrow reading of the statute would undercut the effectiveness of the 1995 Reform Act and thus run contrary to SLUSA's stated purpose, viz., \"to prevent certain State private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives\" of the 1995 Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=633%20N.E.2d%20424\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, Pub.

L. 73-291,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%20881\">\n    48 Stat. 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1934) (codified, as amended, at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ), may be asserted when the seller fails to advise purchasers of subsequent facts that affect those shares, and the shares are held in the face of the omission,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dabit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p82\">\n    547 U.S. at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p82\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In concluding that SLUSA pre-empts state-law holder class-action claims of the kind alleged in Dabit's complaint, we do not lose sight of the general 'presum[ption] that Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action.' \" (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Medtronic, Inc. v.

We must determine whether: (1) the complaint's description of a defendant's conduct involves conduct specified in SLUSA, and (2) the alleged conduct will be part of the proofs in support of the state law cause of action. While a defendant's conduct need not be an element of the state cause of action, the conduct still must be a fact on which the proof of that state cause of action depends.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We now apply this legal framework to Northstar's claims. Northstar divides its\n   claims into those made on behalf of the Pre-Breach class and those made on behalf of the Breach class. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that both sets of claims are barred by SLUSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Pre-Breach class claims depend on allegations of misrepresentations or omissions, and are therefore barred by SLUSA. Those claims are predicated on a 1997 Proxy Statement that Northstar alleged promised that the Trustees and Schwab Advisor would employ a particular investment strategy. Northstar alleged that the Trustees and Schwab Advisor deviated from that strategy in the 2007-2009 time period, during which they issued prospectuses reaffirming the 1997 investment objectives but made investments that were inconsistent with those objectives in material ways. Northstar therefore did not simply plead a garden-variety breach of contract claim. To the contrary, Northstar made clear that it intends to prove the alleged breach of contract by describing what the defendants did during the Breach Period, and alleging that the defendants acted without informing investors-either existing shareholders or new ones-of their actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Northstar expressly pled, in all of its complaints, that investors were not told about the deviation from the investment policy. As to the Pre-Breach class members, Northstar additionally pled that those investors were induced to hold their shares in reliance on inaccurate information, and suffered losses thereby. Northstar asserts that the Pre-Breach class members held their shares in reliance on the repetition of statements first made in the 1997 Proxy Statement, when they were no longer true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Northstar, in fact, pled that the terms of the contract between the parties were disclosed and reiterated in subsequent prospectuses. Northstar's complaint therefore makes clear that it is this conduct to which it will point to prove its breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims. It is Northstar itself that has chosen to tie the Pre-Breach class claims to the actions the defendants undertook during the 2007-2009 Breach Period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The misrepresentations and omissions during the Breach Period are not extraneous to the contract claims-i.e., they are not wholly irrelevant or unconnected activities as the word \"extraneous\" is commonly understood. They are, instead, at the heart of the\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   of those claims. They are the only material proofs to which Northstar points to establish that a breach occurred. The Fourth Amended Complaint, thus, reaches activities of the defendants that are actionable under the securities laws, making them barred by SLUSA, regardless of the label placed on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Hampton v. Pacific Investment Management Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406740\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/705/558/\">\n    705 F. App'x 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2017), is instructive. There, although the plaintiff argued that its allegations asserted violations of contractual and fiduciary duties, \"the complaint unmistakably describe[d] PIMCO Funds telling its investors it would do one thing-limit its exposure to certain risky assets-while it was in fact,\n   <em>\n    at the same time\n   </em>\n   , doing another-betting big on those same assets.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406740\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/705/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406740\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/705/558/\">\n    at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hampton argued that, because the prospectus statement committing the Fund to a certain investment policy was not false at the time it was made, Hampton did not need to establish a falsehood to prove its claims. The\n   panel disagreed, noting that, like here, the statement was made multiple times, including after it allegedly had ceased to be true. Based on this conclusion, the panel found the holder claims barred by SLUSA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406740\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/705/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406740\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/705/558/\">\n    at 560-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The facts here parallel those before this court in\n   <em>\n    Hampton\n   </em>\n   . The defendants are accused of promising, and continuing to promise, one thing-that they would follow the stated investment objectives-while in fact doing another-deviating from those objectives across multiple prospectuses and failing to disclose that fact to the original investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The dissent views SLUSA preemption more narrowly, stating that a state law claim is not barred by SLUSA unless \"a misrepresentation is an essential fact on which the original claim depends.\" Diss. 837. As described above, however, the law does not require us to undertake an analysis with only the elements of the state law cause of action in mind. Such an analysis would limit our consideration to a pleading's satisfaction of the bare elements of the state law claim. Under the dissent's approach, if we found that a complaint alleged the elements of a state law claim, our analysis would end regardless of the complaint's other allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This conclusion is inconsistent with SLUSA. Indeed, various circuits, including this one, have rejected such an approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fleming v.

The claims are no less tied to the defendants' misstatements and omissions during the Breach Period than are the Breach Class claims\n   themselves, described in greater detail below. We therefore conclude that the Pre-Breach class claims are barred by SLUSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Breach class's claims similarly depend on allegations of misrepresentations or omissions and are barred by SLUSA. At the time that the Breach class members purchased their securities, the defendants were already breaching any contractual obligations and related duties owed to the class. Had the defendants not made any misrepresentations or omissions with respect to these breaches-that is, had the breaches been disclosed-the Breach class would not be able to maintain its state law claims. As a general rule, when a contracting party has knowledge of a breach by the other party and nonetheless accepts some performance of the contract, he or she has waived the breach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 63:9 (4th ed.). If the Breach class members had knowledge of the breach at the time that they purchased their securities, they would not be able to maintain claims for breach against the defendants. Allegations of misrepresentations or omissions are thus factual predicates to their thirteenth claim (for breach of contract), to their twelfth claim (for relief as a third-party beneficiary of the IAA), and to their fourteenth claim (for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Breach class's fiduciary duty claims fare no better. To prevail on a breach of fiduciary duty claim under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must establish, among other things, that a fiduciary duty exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Had the defendants made no misrepresentations during the Breach period-i.e., had they disclosed to the Breach class that the Fund was no longer abiding by its fundamental investment objectives-there would have been no grounds for the Breach class to repose trust in the defendants' judgment and advice. The fiduciary duty claims thus implicitly depend on allegations of misrepresentations or omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because the Breach class claims depend on a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact, these claims are barred by SLUSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Delaware carve-out does not save either the Pre-Breach or Breach class claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The carve-out provides, in relevant part, that class actions that would otherwise be barred by SLUSA are not subject to dismissal if (1) they are \"based upon the statutory or common law of the State in which the issuer is ... organized,\" and (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   they constitute \"permissible actions\" defined by the statute. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77p(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With the exception of its third-party beneficiary claims, which arise under the IAA and are governed by California law, all of Northstar's claims are based on the statutory and common law of Massachusetts, the state in which the Schwab Trust is organized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remaining question is whether the claims constitute permissible actions under the statute.

In particular, the wrongdoing Northstar alleges in this action is the defendants' failure to follow, during the Breach Period, the fundamental investment practices shareholders approved in the 1997 vote; the injury that Northstar alleges derives only from the holding of shares based on the defendants' alleged omissions during that Breach Period. The plain language of the statute requires that the communications \"concern[ ]\n   <em>\n    decisions\n   </em>\n   ... with respect to voting ... securities[.]\" Northstar does not allege that the false disclosures and material omissions, made during the Breach Period, concern any vote. Northstar admits, both in its briefing and in the final amended complaint, that the only vote with respect to this action was the 1997 vote on the 1997 Proxy Statement-there was no vote during the Breach Period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Breach class claims are also not \"permissible actions\" under the statute, because they likewise do not involve any communication that \"concerns decisions of those equity holders with respect to voting their shares.\" The Breach class claims that are subject to SLUSA are based on misrepresentations that occurred between 2007 and 2009. The only vote that occurred with respect to these securities occurred in 1997. The misrepresentations that underlie the Breach class claims were thus not made to shareholders in advance of, or to influence, any vote. Those communications therefore do not \"concern[ ]\" any \"decisions\" of shareholders with respect to voting their securities. The carve-out does not save Northstar's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of all of Northstar's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The district court erred, however, in dismissing Northstar's claims with prejudice.

Therefore, the Pre-Breach claims are not barred by SLUSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Pre-Breach class claims are all, in effect, versions of a state-law breach of contract claim. The majority opinion states that misrepresentations and omissions during the Breach Period are \"at the heart of the\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   \" of the Pre-Breach class claims, and that \"[t]hey are the only material proofs to which Northstar points to establish that a breach occurred.\" Opinion at 831.

Opinion at 832.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   I respectfully disagree. The complaint states a claim for breach of contract that can be proven true with no reference to a misrepresentation or omission. The Pre-Breach class had a contract with the defendants through the 1997 Proxy Statement, and the defendants breached that contract. The district court itself, describing the facts alleged in the complaint, made clear that plaintiffs could prove the breach without proving a misrepresentation or omission:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Northstar alleges that Defendants deviated from the Fund's investment objective to track the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (the \"Lehman Index\") in two ways. First, Northstar alleges that, starting around August 31, 2007, the Fund began investing in high risk non-U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\") that were not part of the Lehman Index and that were substantially more risky than the U.S. agency securities and other instruments that comprised the Lehman Index. Second, Northstar alleges that, beginning around August 31, 2007, the Fund deviated from the Fund's investment objectives (which prohibited investing more than 25% of the Fund's assets in any one industry, unless such concentration was necessary to track the Lehman Index) by investing more than 25% of the Fund's assets in U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities and CMOs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Northstar Fin.

The Pre-Breach class did not need to prove a misrepresentation or omission in order to prevail on its breach of contract claim. That claim-and the Pre-Breach class's other similar claims-are not barred by SLUSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Northstar's complaint may contain extraneous references to misrepresentations, but such references do not bring the complaint within SLUSA's ambit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaSala\n   </em>\n   , 519 F.3d at 141. (\"While it may be unwise ... to set out extraneous allegations of misrepresentations in a complaint, the inclusion of such extraneous allegations does not operate to require that the complaint must be dismissed under SLUSA.\"). SLUSA does not bar claims for which a plaintiff class may need to allege a misrepresentation in order to respond to a hypothetical affirmative defense. SLUSA only prohibits a claim when a misrepresentation is an essential fact on which the original claim depends. The Pre-Breach class can prove its claims without proving any misrepresentation or omission of material fact. That such facts may be present in the complaint, or that they could arise during the course of litigation, is not enough to bar the claims under SLUSA. Under the majority's approach, any ordinary state law breach of contract claim would be preempted by SLUSA if the breaching party failed to disclose its breach (which would be the usual case) because the failure to disclose could be characterized as a misrepresentation or omission. This interpretation stretches SLUSA's application to a degree not intended by Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    There is an existing circuit split on SLUSA's application.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Samuel Wolff,\n    <em>\n     Securities Litigation Update--Part 2: Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act\n    </em>\n    , 35 No. 1 Sec. and Fed.
