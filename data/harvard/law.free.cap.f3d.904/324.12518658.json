In addition to requiring that a defendant's initial sentence be \"based on\" a subsequently lowered range, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) requires that a Guidelines amendment cited in support of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion \"have the effect of lowering the defendant's applicable guideline range.\" USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (requiring all sentence reductions to be \"consistent with applicable policy statements,\" including USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) ). Rivera-Cruz acknowledged that the 240-month statutory maximum supplanted his initial Guidelines range both before and after Amendment 782. He nevertheless argued that, in light of his five-level downward departure, Amendment 782 effectively reduced his offense level from 31 to 29, which \"ha[d] the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range,\" \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B), from 188-235 months' imprisonment to 151-188 months. And because the District Court used his otherwise applicable-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , pre-maximum-Guidelines range of 324-405 months' imprisonment as a baseline for its downward departure, he argued, his sentence was \"based on\" a range lowered by the Sentencing Commission as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

That distinction is immaterial for purposes of the present inquiry, however. Using parallel language, the Guidelines call for a defendant's initial sentencing range to be replaced with the statutory maximum in the same way a range is replaced by a statutory minimum. In both cases, USSG \u00a7 1B1.1(a)(8) instructs courts to apply \u00a7 5G1.1, among other provisions, after calculating an initial range. In turn, \u00a7 5G1.1 provides that \"[w]here the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5G1.1(a), just as it provides in the next paragraph that \"[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5G1.1(b).

He emphasizes that when it departed downward five levels, the District Court explicitly referred to his initial Guidelines calculation, and that once the Court settled on a new range, it sentenced him to the bottom of that range-not the 215-month sentence the Government recommended in its substantial assistance motion. He concedes that if the District Court had instead used his statutory maximum as the starting point for its departure, he would be ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. But he claims \"that's not this case.\" Rivera-Cruz Br. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We do not share Rivera-Cruz's interpretation of the District Court's decisionmaking process. The District Court did return to Rivera-Cruz's initial Guidelines calculation before announcing its sentencing decision. But it did so for a limited purpose: to determine the number of offense levels by which to depart downward. By necessity, that determination began with Rivera-Cruz's initial offense level. But the District Court explained that its decision to express Rivera-Cruz's departure in terms of offense levels-rather than simply departing from the statutory maximum by a certain number of months-was based on this Court's precedent, not a reconsideration of Rivera-Cruz's initial Guidelines range. Indeed, the District Court noted that its downward departure aligned with the Government's recommendation of 215 months' imprisonment, which fell near the midpoint of Rivera-Cruz's new range. The Government's 215-month recommendation, in turn, was based expressly on the 240-month statutory maximum. Rivera-Cruz's initial Guidelines range thus did not figure substantively into the District Court's departure determination. Consequently, the Court's ultimate decision to sentence Rivera-Cruz to 188 months' imprisonment-the bottom of his post-departure range-is equally untethered from his initial Guidelines calculation. In context, therefore, the District Court's reference to Rivera-Cruz's initial Guidelines range did not revive it as \"a relevant part [of] the framework\" governing the sentencing decision.\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612235\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1783/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For these reasons, Rivera-Cruz's sentence was not \"based on\" his initial Guidelines range, and the Sentencing Commission's lowering of that range by Amendment 782 did not make Rivera-Cruz eligible for a sentence reduction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).
