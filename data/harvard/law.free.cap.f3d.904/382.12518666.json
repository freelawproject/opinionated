For the reasons set forth below, we REVERSE the district court's judgment, and RENDER judgment in favor of the City of Brownsville.

The Incident Between Alvarez and Officer Arias at the Jail\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 27, 2005, Alvarez, a then-seventeen year old ninth grade special education\n   student, was arrested by the Brownsville Police Department and taken to a detention center in Brownsville, Texas on suspicion of public intoxication and burglary of a motor vehicle. After being placed in one of the holding cells, Alvarez attempted to use a telephone located in the cell. Initially, Alvarez was able to place a call but the phone eventually stopped working. Alvarez then banged the phone's handset against the phone's switch hook mounted on the wall, and made an obscene gesture towards a camera. Because Alvarez became somewhat disruptive, officers removed Alvarez from his cell and attempted to transfer him to a padded cell to calm down. To move Alvarez to the padded cell, the officers had to walk him across the jail's central lobby booking area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After reaching the booking area, Alvarez engaged in a conversation with a group of officers. Alvarez primarily spoke to Officer Jesus Arias who took the lead in trying to direct Alvarez to the padded cell. As the conversation continued, Alvarez was reluctant to move towards the padded cell and obey Officer Arias's instructions to walk towards the cell. When recalling the conversation with Officer Arias, Alvarez indicated, \"I understand I wasn't compliant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A scuffle between Alvarez and Officer Arias soon ensued. The altercation began when Officer Arias grabbed Alvarez's left arm and maneuvered Alvarez to the ground. Officer Arias then placed Alvarez in a choke hold and eventually a head lock. Officers assisting Officer Arias subdued Alvarez by shackling Alvarez's legs and handcuffing him. Throughout the struggle, Alvarez squirmed and flailed his arms. Alvarez, handcuffed and legs shackled, was then carried and placed in the padded holding cell. All of the events that took place at the jail before, during, and after Alvarez's incident with Officer Arias were captured on video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    2. Investigations Conducted by the Brownsville Police Department\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Brownsville Police Department utilizes separate investigative tracks for internal disciplinary investigations of its officers and alleged crimes committed by detainees at the jail. An internal administrative investigation was conducted to determine if Officer Arias violated the Brownsville Police Department's use of force policy during the altercation with Alvarez. Additionally, a criminal investigation was conducted by the Brownsville Police Department to determine if there was probable cause for recommending that the district attorney's office criminally charge Alvarez for assaulting Officer Arias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Generally, the Brownsville Police Department's internal administrative affairs division does not share information with the criminal investigation division. If information is to be shared between the internal administrative affairs division and the criminal investigation division, Police Chief Carlos Garcia is usually the individual who authorizes the exchange. However, Sergeant David Infante, the jail supervisor who downloaded the videos of the incident for the internal administrative investigation of Officer Arias, stated that \"if something would have been asked of me by the criminal investigation, I would have submitted it.\" Police Chief Garcia further added that Sergeant Infante should have provided the videos of the incident to the criminal investigation division if he knew criminal charges were being brought against Alvarez. Commander Roberto Avitia, also a supervisor of Sergeant Infante, similarly stated that Sergeant Infante should have disclosed the videos to the criminal investigation division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the internal investigation, Sergeant Infante evaluated the videos and Officer Arias's report of the incident. Four different\n   videos were reviewed: (1) a video of Alvarez in the initial holding cell that he was placed in; (2) a video of the officers at the central command post in the detention center before, during, and after the incident; (3) a video of the altercation between Alvarez and Officer Arias that occurred in the lobby booking area; and (4) a video of Alvarez in the padded cell after he was transported. After conducting the investigation, Sergeant Infante came to the conclusion that Officer Arias used proper force and that no further action should be taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Two days after the incident between Alvarez and Officer Arias, on November 29, 2005, Sergeant Infante sent a memorandum to Police Chief Garcia reiterating his recommendation that proper force was used. On December 8, 2005, another supervisor of Sergeant Infante, Commander Ramiro Rodriguez, reviewed Sergeant Infante's report and the video recordings, and submitted a report to Police Chief Garcia recommending closure of the internal administrative investigation since Officer Arias's actions were in compliance with Brownsville Police Department regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Even though the reports and recommendations were stamped as received on December 8, 2005 by Police Chief Garcia's office, Police Chief Garcia did not review the reports. The materials for the internal investigation, including the videos, were never passed on to an internal affairs unit for a formal disciplinary investigation of Officer Arias or to the criminal investigation division of the Brownsville Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The criminal investigation division reviewed the incident after the internal administrative review was conducted. The criminal investigation began on November 27, 2005, with Sergeant Jim Brown preparing and filing an offense report of the incident that occurred between Alvarez and Officer Arias. Sergeant Brown was the patrol supervisor responsible for addressing issues that arose at the jail when the incident occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sergeant Brown's report stated Alvarez allegedly assaulted Officer Arias but did not mention that there were any video recordings of the incident. Criminal investigator Officer Rene Carrejo was subsequently assigned to review Officer Arias's complaint that Alvarez assaulted him by grabbing his throat and his right inner thigh. Officer Carrejo never requested or inquired about the possible existence of a video recording of the incident. Lieutenant Henry Etheridge, the head of the internal affairs division of the Brownsville Police Department at the time of the administrative review, opined that the criminal investigation division did not conduct a proper investigation because it failed to collect all evidence. Lieutenant Etheridge further noted that, \"[i]f I knew that [the criminal investigation division] wasn't conducting proper investigations in regards to collecting that video, by all means, I would have taken corrective action to ... get that video in their hands.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    3. Alvarez's Guilty Plea and Imprisonment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The criminal investigation division subsequently alerted the district attorney's office of the incident and Alvarez was charged with assault on a public servant, a felony offense in Texas. In January 2006, a\n   grand jury returned an indictment charging Alvarez with the assault. During discovery, Alvarez's attorney reviewed the prosecution's case file that did not contain the videos of the incident. In March 2006, Alvarez pled guilty to assault on a public servant. In May 2006, Alvarez was given a suspended sentence of eight years of imprisonment and ten years of community supervision. As a condition of the community supervision, the court imposed \"a term of confinement and treatment in a substance abuse felony punishment facility ... for not less than 90 days or more than 12 months as a condition of probation.\" In November 2006, after Alvarez failed to complete the treatment program, the state revoked the suspension of Alvarez's sentence and remanded Alvarez to prison for the remainder of his eight-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    4. The Uncovering of the Video Recordings of the Incident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Approximately four years after Alvarez began to serve his prison sentence, the videos of Alvarez's incident with Officer Arias surfaced during discovery for an unrelated \u00a7 1983 case. After the discovery of the videos, Alvarez filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in Texas state court, claiming that the Brownsville Police Department had withheld the videos in violation of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   . In October 2010, after the state district court recommended that the writ of habeas corpus be granted and that Alvarez be given a new trial, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that Alvarez was \"actually innocent\" of committing the assault. Alvarez's assault conviction was then set aside and all charges against Alvarez were later dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Several months after being declared \"actually innocent,\" in April 2011, Alvarez sued the City of Brownsville, Officer Arias, and other individuals from the Brownsville Police Department, asserting various claims under \u00a7 1983, which included nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence in violation of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   . In August 2012, the City of Brownsville, Officer Arias, and the other defendants filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that Alvarez's claims should be dismissed. Adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, the district court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to: (1) the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim against the City of Brownsville for nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence; and (2) a fabrication of evidence claim brought against Officer Arias in his individual capacity. The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to all other claims. The fabrication claim against Officer Arias was later dismissed after Alvarez and Officer Arias filed a voluntary stipulation of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In January 2014, Alvarez and the City of Brownsville, as the only remaining parties, filed cross motions for summary judgment addressing whether: (1) a Brownsville Police Department policy of nondisclosure existed; (2) the Brownsville Police Department's failure to disclose the videos constituted a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation; and (3) a Brownsville Police Department policy caused the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation. The district court subsequently granted Alvarez's motion for summary judgment concluding that there was a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation as a matter of law, and Alvarez established \"all substantive elements of a \u00a7 1983 municipal liability claim against the City of Brownsville.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court held a jury trial to determine whether Alvarez was entitled to monetary damages for the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation. Following a two-day jury trial, the jury awarded Alvarez $2,000,000 in compensatory\n   damages. The parties agreed to attorneys' fees of $300,000 and the court entered final judgment in favor of Alvarez for $2,300,000. The City of Brownsville filed post-trial motions, which were denied by the district court. The City of Brownsville timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A panel of this court reversed the $2,300,000 judgment awarded to Alvarez and dismissed Alvarez's action against the City of Brownsville.\n   <em>\n    Alvarez v. City of Brownsville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276311\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/799/#p803\">\n    860 F.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 803 (5th Cir. 2017),\n   <em>\n    reh'g en banc granted\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266170,12266181\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/898/\">\n    874 F.3d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2017). The panel opinion held that by entering a guilty plea Alvarez waived the right to assert the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim foundational to his \u00a7 1983 action. The panel opinion was withdrawn in light of en banc rehearing of this case. After supplemental briefing and oral argument to the en banc court, we reverse the district court and render judgment of dismissal in favor of the City of Brownsville.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Alvarez's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim should have been dismissed as a matter of law on summary judgment because the City of Brownsville should not have been subjected to municipal liability for Alvarez's \u00a7 1983 claim. This court also declines the invitation to disturb its precedent concerning a defendant's constitutional right to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material prior to entering a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Municipal Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Alvarez argues that the City of Brownsville, through its police department, had an unwritten, customary policy of not disclosing exculpatory evidence obtained in the course of internal administrative investigations-a policy that caused Alvarez's constitutional violation. Alternatively, Alvarez asserts that making Police Chief Garcia the sole decision-maker related to the sharing of information from internal administrative matters created the high possibility of a constitutional violation. Because of Police Chief Garcia's oversight, Alvarez asserts that the City of Brownsville should be held liable as a municipality. This court is not persuaded by Alvarez's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Summary judgment rulings are subject to de novo review.\n   <em>\n    Aldous v.

While it was established that information from internal administrative investigations is generally not shared, Sergeant Infante, Commander Avitia, Lieutenant Etheridge, and Police Chief Garcia still understood that this policy did not prohibit them from disclosing video recordings. Moreover, if Officer Carrejo requested or inquired about the existence of any videos of the incident, the videos would have been turned over. Because of the understanding throughout the police department that even with the policy that possibly exculpatory evidence such as the videos could be disclosed, it was by no means \"apparent\" that a constitutional violation was a \"highly predictable consequence\" of the general policy of non-disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537775\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/363/#p373\">\n    336 F.3d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put another way, it can not be \"apparent\" that a constitutional violation is a \"highly predictable consequence\" if no impression is created from the policy that the evidence central to the alleged violation has to be withheld. Accordingly, there was no \"deliberate indifference\" shown in implementing this policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537775\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/363/#p373\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11194213\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/219/450/#p461\">\n    219 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   461 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even if this court adopts Alvarez's alternative theory that the \"policy\" was Police Chief Garcia being vested with the sole authority to review the internal administrative investigation reports, there is no showing that this policy was adopted or implemented with deliberate indifference. When advancing this theory, Alvarez lodges two different concepts for how deliberate indifference was shown. First, Alvarez asserts that the policy of allowing Police Chief Garcia to be the sole decision maker relating to the internal investigations was deliberately indifferent because there was no safety net to catch Police Chief Garcia's mistakes. Second, Alvarez avers that Police Chief Garcia implemented this policy with deliberate indifference because he overlooked internal administrative reports, knowing that his error would probably result in the violation of an individual's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Both of Alvarez's arguments are unavailing. Placing the final decision making authority in the hands of one individual, even if it makes an error more likely, does not by itself establish deliberate indifference. \"Deliberate indifference is a degree of culpability beyond mere negligence or even gross negligence; it must amount to an intentional choice, not merely an unintentionally negligent oversight.\"\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041799\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/612/#p617\">\n    577 F.3d at 617-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rhyne v.

No evidence from the record indicates that Police Chief Garcia's actions should be characterized as anything more than negligent oversight. Moreover, Alvarez points to no case from any circuit that premises \u00a7 1983 municipal liability on a policymaker's deliberate indifference to a constitutional right that a circuit court has\n   expressly held does not exist-e.g., the defendant's right to be presented with\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material before entering a guilty plea.

JONES, Circuit Judge, joined by SMITH and HO, Circuit Judges, concurring:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   I am pleased to join Chief Judge Stewart's opinion for the court, with which I fully agree. The genesis of this case is, however, troubling, and worth noting. It is an unsavory vehicle in which to be discussing significant theories of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   How Alvarez\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   obtained his habeas relief in the state appellate court, using his then-attorney Lucio, who later became a co-defendant in a federal RICO and bribery prosecution against then-Cameron County DA Villalobos, is more than suspicious. The state courts were presented a redacted video of the encounter between Alvarez and Officer Arias, which omitted a crucial 30+ seconds leading up to their tussle. In that period of time, it was evident that Alvarez was arguing with and resisting the officers' instructions to move from one cell into another. Unredacted, the video portrays a much more complex picture of events than the \"self defense\" theory propounded by attorney Lucio. Lucio also offered the supporting testimony of Alvarez's former attorney, de la Fuente, an unindicted co-conspirator in the bribery case. In the state habeas court, the DA's office, oddly, never questioned the video, immediately agreed to a new trial, and apparently offered an agreed set of findings and conclusions. That court granted only a new trial. When Lucio appealed to the state appellate court on his \"actual innocence\" theory-which is supportable only if one sees no more than the redacted video-the DA filed no response. After the appellate court remanded, the DA quickly dismissed charges. One may surmise, as Gilbert &amp; Sullivan wrote in\n   <em>\n    Trial by Jury\n   </em>\n   , Alvarez's release \"was managed by a job, and a good job too.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For present purposes, the point is that without having been \"exonerated\" by the state courts, Alvarez could not pursue his very novel Section 1983 claim against the City.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p486\">\n    512 U.S. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 486-87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p486\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2372,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p486\">\n    129 L.Ed.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). Alvarez's damage suit proceeded contemporaneously in federal court with the RICO/bribery charges against the former DA and his attorney cohorts. Indeed, the judge originally assigned to Alvarez's case had to recuse when he became responsible for the criminal case. In the bribery prosecution, Alvarez's habeas case was mentioned indirectly. The City's attorneys attempted repeatedly to challenge the\n   redacted video in Alvarez's civil suit, but the federal court ignored their efforts. Why? I do not understand the district court's unwillingness to explore whether Alvarez's case was founded on doctored evidence. If doctored evidence tainted Alvarez's habeas case, the federal court would have had to consider ethical action against certain attorneys. On the other hand, it would not have had to opine on unusual issues concerning municipal liability and the ramifications of the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Allegations of doctored evidence here may have been misplaced, but surely they were not frivolous. Because factual integrity is the gateway to litigating a claim in court, Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, integrity in the fact-finding process must be maintained vigilantly. No defendant, including the City, should be persecuted by means of litigation with a false foundation. It's unfortunate if that is what happened here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   I urge our colleagues at the district court level to be more attuned to non-frivolous complaints of potentially unethical behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   STEPHEN HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge, joined by JOLLY, JONES, WIENER and OWEN, Circuit Judges, concurring:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Criminal discovery rules and practices vary.

The district court contradicted these established principles when it extended\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   to the plea bargaining stage and treated it not as a right of the accused, but as a requirement defendants cannot waive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   I concur in the reversal of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   If the constitutional theory urged by George Alvarez and his amici had been an open question in this circuit, the district court could have attempted to justify its judgment on either the text or original understanding of the Constitution or on a faithful application of analogous Supreme Court or circuit precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   But that is not this case.

An old\n   legend tells how the King of Siam would bestow sacred white elephants upon his political rivals. As gifts from the king, the elephants could not be rejected. Yet the sacred pachyderms, which could not be sold or used for work, would inevitably eat their owners out of house and home-driving them into bankruptcy, and leaving them far worse off than before they received the \"gift.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Forcing unwaivable \"rights\" upon the accused can have a similar effect. We empower the accused when we allow them to waive their rights. From the defendant's perspective, the way to maximize the value of a right is to give him the option to waive it, just in case (as is often the case) he can exchange it for something else that is even more valuable to him. As the Supreme Court once put it: \"When the administration of the criminal law in the federal courts is hedged about as it is by the Constitutional safeguards for the protection of an accused,\n   <em>\n    to deny him in the exercise of his free choice the right to dispense with some of these safeguards ... is to imprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"303755\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/269/#p276\">\n    317 U.S. at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"303755\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/269/#p276\">\n    63 S.Ct. 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The power to waive trial rights provides the accused with a significant bargaining chip in plea negotiations. Prosecutors lack the resources to take every case to trial. So prosecutors have a natural incentive to offer plea deals with lower penalties than what the accused might receive from a trial. \"Plea bargaining flows from 'the mutuality of advantage' to defendants and prosecutors, each with his own reasons for wanting to avoid trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Bordenkircher v.

Converting the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   right into a prosecutorial requirement would substantially upset this balance, by giving defendants less to offer the prosecution during the negotiations. Prosecutors may be less likely to offer deals at all, if they are forced to expend significant resources regardless of whether the case is pled or proceeds to trial.

Infante and Commander Rodriguez. Infante and Rodriguez then reviewed the report, and the video evidence, and submitted their own individual reports to Chief Garcia. Garcia never reviewed the file, and none of the officers disclosed the videos outside of the IAD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Meanwhile, Officer Carrejo, the criminal investigations division (\"CID\") officer assigned to submit the case file to the District Attorney, obtained the IAD incident reports from the jail. Carrejo then submitted those reports to the District Attorney without conducting additional evidentiary investigation because there was no \"evidence\n   form\" in the records alerting him that relevant evidence existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   According to the majority, these actions were a \"series of interconnected\" errors by the officers involved. With respect, record evidence shows that the officers committed no errors at all under BPD policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   CID investigators are responsible for providing criminal case files to the District Attorney's office. To start that process, they collect documents, such as incident reports, from a \"cubbyhole\" at the jail designated for the CID case prep team. They then conduct evidentiary follow-up as needed, based largely on \"evidence forms\" that fellow officers attach to the files provided to CID. Without an evidence form in the file, CID investigators would be unaware that follow-up is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   BPD has a policy, however, that IAD officers do not proactively disclose evidence, including\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   evidence, to CID investigators. Instead, IAD officers pass all\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   evidence up their chain of command to Chief Garcia, who has sole responsibility to ensure that any\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   evidence is properly disclosed. Because these officers do not disclose evidence, there is no \"evidence form\" generated for the CID case file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Thus, contrary to the majority's view, the officers committed no \"interconnected errors\" in conducting their investigation. The IAD officers faithfully passed the evidence up the chain of command to Chief Garcia without disclosing the evidence to CID. In turn, the CID officer, unaware that relevant evidence existed, conducted no evidentiary follow-up and simply passed the file to the District Attorney's office. This was not error, it was how the system was designed to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Moreover, while the majority characterizes Garcia's failure to review the file as nothing \"more than negligent oversight,\" the record paints a different picture. Indeed, Garcia did not review nine out of thirteen known use of force cases. Even when Garcia did review such files, it may be \"several weeks, even up to a month or more ... after the criminal case had been submitted to the [D]istrict [A]ttorney's office.\" Garcia's failure to review the instant case was entirely in line with BPD practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   I therefore respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusion that Alvarez has not established that the non-disclosure policy was the moving force behind the alleged violation. BPD's policy of not disclosing exculpatory evidence to CID investigators was the direct cause of BPD's failure to disclose the video evidence to the District Attorney and the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Non-disclosure policy implemented with deliberate indifference.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The majority next concludes that BPD could not have implemented the non-disclosure policy with deliberate indifference because there was an \"understanding throughout the police department\" that IAD officers could disclose exculpatory evidence. With respect, that conclusion is not supported by the record evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Though BPD officers did claim that they \"should,\" \"could,\" and \"would\" have disclosed the video evidence to the CID if asked to do so, the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that officers understood that IAD evidence was simply not shared with CID as a matter of policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   For instance, officers were trained to consider IAD and CID as separate investigative tracts that operate independently. As a result, there was a widespread belief among IAD officers that they had no duty to confirm that CID had exculpatory evidence. Instead, IAD officers simply passed evidence up their chain of command without disclosure to, or even consideration of,\n   any parallel CID investigation. That understanding was based on \"in-service training.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In contrast, there is no evidence to support the officers' claims that IAD officers would, could, or should freely disclose evidence to the CID. Quite the opposite is true, as no BPD policy, commanding officer, or training, informed IAD officers that they could, or even should, do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Compounding this problem, BPD provided CID investigators with no training on how to conduct their investigations. Instead, CID officers act purely pursuant to on-the-job experience. For Carrejo, that \"mostly consists of getting ahold of victims or witnesses and get[ting] whatever information is needed for the file.\" Carrejo expects fellow officers to \"book\" relevant evidence in order to generate an \"evidence report,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   so that Carrejo can then \"follow up with that evidence.\" There is no indication in the record that Carrejo received any training, or even instruction, to pursue the robust evidentiary investigation that Brownsville, and the majority, claims he should have done. There is likewise no evidence at all that CID investigators ever asked IAD for evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusion that there was an \"understanding throughout the police department\" that IAD officers could disclose exculpatory evidence. The weight of the evidence states otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   I also disagree with the majority opinion's conclusion that a deliberate indifference theory of municipal liability was not viable because at the time we had not recognized a pre-plea right to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material. The City never made this \"clearly established\" argument in the district court or in our court. By adopting it sua sponte, the court repeats the mistake we recently made in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. Mesa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182853\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/117/\">\n    785 F.3d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2015) (en banc). We held that a border patrol agent was entitled to qualified immunity for shooting a Mexican national because the law was not clearly established that the Fifth Amendment applied to a foreign citizen injured outside the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182853\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/117/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182853\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/117/\">\n    at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court reversed, explaining that the agent did not know at the time of the shooting whether the victim was a U.S. citizen. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605122\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2003/#p2007\">\n    137 S.Ct. 2003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2007,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605122\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2003/#p2007\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The same is true for the similar deliberate indifference inquiry here. When he failed to disclose the exculpatory video, Police Chief Garcia did not know that Alvarez was pleading guilty. Even more than in\n   <em>\n    Mesa\n   </em>\n   , he could not have known as that fact did not yet exist (that is, the plea decision had not yet been made). But Garcia knew that the way to comply with the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   obligation that has long existed for cases that go to trial is to notify the criminal investigations division of exculpatory material in the IA file so it becomes part of the prosecutor's file later disclosed to the defense. There was not one procedure for transferring exculpatory evidence from the IAD side to the investigations side for \"trial\" cases and a separate procedure for \"plea\" cases. Because that transfer of the video to the investigations division did not happen, Garcia was deliberately indifferent to the long recognized\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   right for cases that get tried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   It is true that some caselaw suggests that deliberate indifference liability applies only when the indifference is to a clearly established right. The idea, the same rationale for qualified immunity, is that liability\n   should attach based on an individual's conduct only if there is a knowing violation of constitutional law. That culpability exists here because Garcia was deliberately indifferent to his constitutional obligation to turn over exculpatory evidence for a case that, like any other, could have resulted in a trial with the long recognized\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   right. Once that deliberate indifference to a clear constitutional right is established, it is just a matter of causation to show that the deliberate indifference to ensuring the criminal file contained exculpatory material led to Alvarez's constitutional injury that Judge Costa's opinion recognizes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The defect in the majority opinion on this point can be seen by imagining this same case but with Alvarez having gone to trial on the criminal charge. Under the majority opinion's analysis, Garcia could avoid liability by saying \"well, when I failed to give the video to the criminal investigators, I thought he was probably going to plead. And it is not clearly established that I have to turn over exculpatory evidence when defendants plead.\" That defense should not immunize the City from liability because Garcia did not know how the criminal case would be resolved when he failed to disclose the video to the investigative side. Thus, (1) Garcia was deliberately indifferent to the clear-as-can-be\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   rights that defendants going to trial have, and (2) Garcia's deliberate indifference caused the violation of Alvarez's right to pre-plea\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    3. BPD training policy was constitutionally deficient.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Though the majority does not address Alvarez's claim that Brownsville failed to adequately train its officers on\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   rights, I do so because BPD's training policy, or rather complete lack thereof, is so deficient that it clearly exhibits deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of those that come into contact with BPD officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \"[T]he inadequacy of police training may serve as the basis for \u00a7 1983 liability only where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.\"\n   <em>\n    Canton v.Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    489 U.S. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). \"[I]t may happen that in light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As Chief Garcia acknowledged, it is foreseeable that BPD officers will encounter use of force incidents and, as a result, have to decide what evidence to disclose in their reports. Garcia further acknowledged that officers will choose what evidence to disclose \"based on the type of training they receive.\" Despite this foreseeability, BPD had \"no policy\" of providing training on\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, Chief Garcia could not even state whether any of his officers had\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   touched on\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   at any time.

Looking even more broadly to the Fifth Amendment as a whole, none of its rights apply solely in trials. Protections against self-incrimination, takings, double jeopardy, and being charged without a grand jury indictment guard against arbitrary government action that can occur in a variety of contexts outside of trial. Although Fifth Amendment rights may appear to lack the unifying theme that is evident for the conscience and expression-protecting First Amendment, the trial-focused Sixth and Seventh Amendments (first criminal then civil); or the punishment-focused Eighth, one scholar has noted that most rights in the Fifth Amendment cover the period between the investigative phase addressed in the Fourth Amendment and the trial phase addressed in the Sixth.

The Amendment's focus on pretrial criminal proceedings rather than trials thus further supports requiring the disclosure of exculpatory evidence in the plea hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   So what is the basis for limiting a due process right like\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   to the context of a full-blown trial even though a plea hearing involves its core concern about whether the courts are fulfilling their truth-finding function? The most basic argument against applying\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   to pleas is that by pleading guilty the defendant implicitly waives a right to obtain evidence that might undermine his admission of guilt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put more bluntly, if a defendant is saying he is guilty, isn't that the end of the issue? But the same argument could be made and was for ineffective assistance of counsel claims asserted by those who pleaded guilty. If a defendant admitted guilt, how could he later complain that with better lawyering he might have been acquitted? Indeed, the right to effective assistance of counsel was sometimes framed, as\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   has sometimes been, only as a fair trial right.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

The rise of the plea is seemingly inexorable and there is no reason to believe that a pre-plea\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   rise gets in its way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   There is one other problem with DOJ's concerns about the workability of a pre-plea\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   requirement. From the beginning, the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   right has covered information that might be favorable to a defendant at sentencing. So as the government conceded at oral argument, a plea does not excuse its obligation to disclose any evidence in the prosecution's file that might mitigate the defendant's sentence. This means it is not a matter of whether exculpatory information is produced but when-either before the plea or after the plea but before sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USAM \u00a7 9-5.001(D)(3) (requiring the production of \"[e]xculpatory and impeachment information that casts doubt upon proof of an aggravating factor at sentencing\" when the presentence investigation begins). Because at some point in a federal prosecution \"the government would have to search the files of all members of the prosecution team for potentially exculpatory material,\" DOJ Br. 16, there is little added burden of requiring that production at an earlier point in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   For all these reasons, there is little evidence suggesting that our court's following the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   rule that many other jurisdictions\n   already apply would create any meaningful obstacle to plea bargaining.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But even if it did, query whether a system in which 97% of defendants plead guilty is already placing to great a premium on the need for speedy pleas at the expense of the truth-finding function of the courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BIBAS\n   <em>\n    , Plea Bargaining's Role in Wrongful Convictions\n   </em>\n   , at 157 (critiquing modern plea bargaining because it \"put[s] efficiency ahead of accuracy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   That leaves\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On the benefit side of that equation, it explained that impeachment evidence has value in terms of the \"\n   <em>\n    fairness of a trial\n   </em>\n   \" but not to whether a plea was knowing and intelligent.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 629,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255029\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/622/#p633\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Until trial, for example, a defendant may not know if the government will call the witness who has the credibility problems. The less direct connection of impeachment evidence to the ultimate \"guilt or innocence\" question is reflected in the fact that it took nearly a decade for the Supreme Court to confirm that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   included an obligation to disclose even at trial \"evidence affecting [witness] credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Giglio v.

Production of exculpatory evidence provides a greater safeguard against innocent defendants pleading guilty, both because it informs innocent defendants they have a substantial chance of showing their innocence at trial as opposed to just casting doubt on government witnesses and because prosecutors required to provide such evidence lose the incentive to push for guilty pleas to obscure weak cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huebler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411025\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/128/192/\">\n    275 P.3d at 97-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While the value of impeachment information may depend on innumerable variables that primarily come into play at trial and therefore arguably make it less than critical information in entering a guilty plea, the same cannot be said of exculpatory information, which is special not just in relation to the fairness of a trial but also in relation to whether a guilty plea is valid and accurate.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   That latter point recognizes a serious risk of requiring\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   disclosures only when a case is tried: it incentivizes prosecutors to offer favorable pleas in cases with exculpatory evidence. That is already the type of case in which a prosecutor's desire for a plea agreement is strongest.

Without a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   requirement, there is an additional benefit from pleading out a weak case: the plea prevents the defendant from being able to undo the conviction if he later discovers that the government possessed exculpatory evidence.\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415950\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/50/1448/#p1454\">\n    50 F.3d at 1453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f a defendant may not raise a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim after a guilty plea, prosecutors may be tempted to deliberately withhold exculpatory information as part of an attempt to elicit guilty pleas.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This is on top of the interest prosecutors already have to resolve their weakest cases with a plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The cost side of the\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   balancing inquiry is also less favorable to the government when it comes to exculpatory evidence. The primary problem the Court saw with pre-plea disclosure of\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   evidence was requiring the government to identify the witnesses it would call at a trial that would never happen because of the plea. This interfered with the rules governing disclosure of witnesses, posed risks of revealing the identities of informants and undercover agents, and eliminated some of the time savings that pleas typically bring by avoiding trial prep.\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   , 536 at 631-32. Indeed, prosecutors often do not even learn about credibility problems with witnesses-by running criminal background checks for example-until they have come up with their witness list. In contrast, prosecutors generally are aware of any evidence they possess that suggests a defendant's innocence by the time they enter into plea negotiations if not earlier when they bring charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The final proof that\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   did not decide the question of pre-plea disclosure of exculpatory evidence-and that the result might be different for this category-are the cases that have come after it. Soon after\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit predicted that \"it is highly likely that the Supreme Court would find a violation of the Due Process Clause if prosecutors or other relevant government actors have knowledge of a criminal defendant's factual innocence but fail to disclose such information to a defendant before he enters into a guilty plea.\"\n   <em>\n    McCann v. Mangialardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107654\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/782/#p788\">\n    337 F.3d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 788 (7th Cir. 2003). It recognized that \"\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   indicates a significant distinction between impeachment information and exculpatory evidence of actual innocence,\" though the Seventh Circuit did not ultimately decide the question because there\n   was insufficient evidence that the government suppressed the evidence in that case.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 787. The Tenth Circuit, again noting a critical distinction between exculpatory evidence and the impeachment evidence in\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   , did decide the question in favor of a right of pleading defendants to exculpatory evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

During an interrogation that lasted nine hours, Buffey at first repeatedly denied that he committed the robbery and sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 207. Hours into the questioning, and past 3:00 in the morning, he told the officers he had broken into \"[t]his old lady's house\" but said he could not recall any assault.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . When the officers later told him he should be able to recall more details, Buffey recanted saying \"You really want to know the truth? ... I didn't do it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . He explained that he had only confessed to breaking into the house because an officer was \"breathing down my neck\" and \"I couldn't tell you what went on in there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   After Buffey was charged with the rape, the state forensic lab tested DNA from the victim's rape kit.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 208.

The results exonerated Buffey, and he also learned that the government knew of similar results in 2002 before the court accepted his plea.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Because the state supreme court acknowledged a right to exculpatory evidence even for defendants who pleaded guilty, Buffey did not have to spend the rest of his life in prison.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 221. And a DNA match was finally made to the person who had committed the rape, someone with a history of sexual violence living a few blocks from the victim who was not arrested in 2002 because Buffey had been wrongfully convicted.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   This \"double injustice\"-because it resulted in \"convicting the innocent and freeing the guilty,\" Amicus Br. for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers 13-is not an isolated event.
