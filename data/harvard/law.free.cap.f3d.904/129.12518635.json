At the time, Khalid was a minor and a legal permanent resident of the United States. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania placed Khalid in pretrial juvenile detention following his arrest. Shortly thereafter, in August 2011, Khalid's father became a U.S. citizen, while Khalid was still under the age of eighteen. A month later, Khalid turned eighteen while still in federal pretrial juvenile detention. During Khalid's subsequent removal proceedings, the IJ and the BIA concluded that Khalid's detention had terminated his father's \"physical custody\" over Khalid, and therefore Khalid was not\n   eligible to acquire derivative citizenship under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We disagree and hold that Khalid's temporary physical separation from his father while in federal pretrial juvenile detention did not terminate Khalid's father's \"physical custody\" of Khalid. We construe the term \"physical custody\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by first looking to state law definitions of that term. Those definitions provide some direction and indicate that a parent's physical custody of a child does not cease due to a child's brief, temporary separation from a parent. Second, the statutory context and history of the derivative citizenship statute indicate that the \"physical custody\" requirement ensures that the LPR child has a strong connection to the naturalizing parent and to the United States at the time the child becomes eligible for derivative citizenship. Khalid had those connections. Third, the applicable canons of statutory interpretation also favor construing the term \"physical custody\" so that such custody does not terminate upon a brief, temporary separation from a parent. Finally, the distinctive nature of federal pretrial juvenile detention-which encourages continued family involvement with the child during such detention-further supports the conclusion that Khalid's father retained \"physical custody\" over Khalid for the purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). As a result, Khalid is a U.S. citizen and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must terminate removal proceedings against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner Mohammed Hassan Faizan Khalid entered the United States with his family as an LPR in 2007. He was born in the United Arab Emirates, but as the child of two Pakistani parents, he was a Pakistani citizen. From at least the summer of 2009, when he was 15 years old, until his arrest in July 2011 at age 17, Khalid used the internet to attempt to assist extremists in the United States and abroad. According to the government, Khalid helped with recruitment efforts by translating jihadist videos from Urdu into English, and then posting those videos online. In addition, Khalid assisted a co-defendant who aspired to commit jihad in Europe by attempting to fundraise for that co-defendant and by concealing evidence from the FBI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal agents arrested Khalid on July 6, 2011. At the time he was arrested, Khalid was seventeen years old, had just graduated from high school, and was living at home with his parents in suburban Baltimore. Following his arrest, Khalid was detained at the Berks County Youth Correctional Center (\"Berks\") in Berks County, Pennsylvania. Shortly thereafter, a federal district judge ordered Khalid's continuing detention at that facility pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205034\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 5035, which governs federal pretrial juvenile detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A little over a month after his arrest, on August 17, 2011, Khalid's father became a U.S. citizen. At the time Khalid's father naturalized, Khalid was still detained at Berks. The government transferred Khalid to an adult facility that October, after Khalid turned eighteen years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Khalid cooperated extensively with the government following his arrest. He met with federal investigators over twenty times and testified in grand jury proceedings for two investigations. The government acknowledged that \"Khalid's assistance advanced multiple national security investigations in important ways.\" AR 538.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Khalid pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A, but because of his cooperation, the government requested a downward\n   departure from Khalid's recommended Guidelines sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment. The district court sentenced Khalid to five years' imprisonment, which he has served.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In late 2015, after Khalid served his sentence, the government transferred him to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the DHS commenced removal proceedings against Khalid based upon his conviction. Khalid moved to terminate the removal proceedings on the ground that he is a U.S. citizen by virtue of his father's naturalization,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and, in the alternative, sought deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.17\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IJ denied the motion to terminate in April 2016, concluding that Khalid was not in his father's \"physical custody\" at the time his father naturalized. In September 2016, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision, holding that a \"child must reside with the citizen parent to satisfy the 'physical custody' requirement of [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) ].\" AR 6.

Thus, the history of the derivative citizenship statute supports reading the statute-and the term \"physical custody,\" in particular-to ensure that a child's \"real interests\" are in the United\n   States through a genuine connection between the United States citizen parent and that parent's child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing in either the CCA's text or history suggests that Congress intended to abandon that requirement in enacting the CCA.

Here, there is no dispute that Khalid had such a connection to his United States citizen father at the time Khalid's father naturalized. Khalid had lived at home with his parents since entering the United States. Thus, Khalid's acquisition of derivative citizenship does not violate Congress's demand that the child has a strong connection to the United States to acquire derivative citizenship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The Circumstances of Khalid's Federal Pretrial Juvenile Detention\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We also must conduct an inquiry into the particular custody arrangement at the time the parent naturalizes and the child becomes eligible for citizenship. The BIA made no such inquiry in this matter. Instead, it reached a broad conclusion, declaring that a child must \"actually resid[e]\" with the U.S. citizen parent \"at the time of the [parent's] naturalization or at some time after he becomes a citizen.\" AR 5-6. For the reasons we have already explained, we think this interpretation of the statute incorrect. Furthermore, as we explain below, we think that interpretation at odds with the nature of Khalid's separation from his father in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The nature of federal pretrial juvenile detention supports the view that Khalid satisfied the \"physical custody\" requirement. Congress created the current pretrial detention system for juveniles when it enacted the Juvenile and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (\"JDPA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 93-415, 88 Stat 1109 (1974). As relevant here, the JDPA contains four sections, now codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205033\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 5036. Those sections demonstrate Congress expresses a clear preference for preserving the juvenile's connection to his or her family and the family's continued involvement in the juvenile's life during the period of federal pretrial detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, the JDPA requires federal authorities to immediately notify a child's parents when federal authorities arrest a juvenile.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205033\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Following a juvenile's arrest, the \"juvenile shall be taken before a magistrate judge forthwith.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205033\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At that hearing, if the juvenile has not already been released, \"the magistrate judge\n   <em>\n    shall release\n   </em>\n   the juvenile to his parents, guardian, custodian, or other responsible party\" unless the judge determines that \"the detention of such juvenile is required to secure his timely appearance before the appropriate court or to insure [sic] his safety or that of others.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205033\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5034 (emphasis added)\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   In the event the magistrate judge does order the juvenile detained, then section 5035 mandates that \"[w]henever possible, detention shall be in a foster home or community based facility located in or near [the juvenile's] home community.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205033\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5035.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The structure of the JDPA factors into our conclusion in two significant ways. First, the JDPA expresses a strong preference for continued parental involvement during detention. Congress seems to have desired continued parental care, even during detention, for a juvenile charged with a federal crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205033\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 5033 - 5035.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, as\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   point out, under circumstances like those in Khalid's case, the government's proposed interpretation of\n   \"physical custody\" would leave the question of whether a child derives\n   <em>\n    United States citizenship\n   </em>\n   entirely to the pretrial detention decision of a magistrate or state court judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br. of Amici Curiae Ctr. for Family Representation et al. 7. That approach to deciding a child's \"weighty interest in citizenship\" would make citizenship a status that is \"casually conferred,\" at odds with Congress's detailed scheme for immigration and naturalization.\n   <em>\n    Fedorenko v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716532\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/490/\">\n    449 U.S. 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 520 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716532\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/490/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716532\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/490/\">\n    66 L.Ed.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981) (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

Moreover, the BIA's approach would seem to make the question of citizenship dependent on factors irrelevant to the child's eligibility for citizenship. For example, the JDPA allows a magistrate judge to consider whether a child might appear at his or her next court hearing when ordering detention.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205034\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Many state courts in this Circuit similarly may consider whether a juvenile will appear at future hearings when deciding whether to order a juvenile detained until trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 46b-133(c) ; N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act 320.5(3)(a)(i). Relying on such factors to determine citizenship would likely render the BIA's interpretation irrational.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judulang v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185803,12444735\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/42/\">\n    565 U.S. 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185803,12444735\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/42/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185803,12444735\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/42/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\"[A]gency action must be based on non-arbitrary,\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   factors.\" (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Those concerns lend further support to our conclusion that Khalid's father's \"physical custody\" did not simply end on Khalid's arrest or the detention decision of a judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, we note that we do not deal in this case with a juvenile adjudicated guilty and imprisoned pursuant to a court-ordered sentence at the time the juvenile claims to have acquired citizenship. There may be reason in such situations to determine that a minor is not in a naturalizing parent's physical custody for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romo-Jimenez v.

App'x 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745-46 (9th Cir. 2015) (mem.) (concluding that a petitioner whose parent naturalized after that petitioner was adjudicated guilty of a state crime and imprisoned was not a U.S. citizen, because a juvenile court had committed the petitioner to the legal custody of the California Youth Authority). We need not address those circumstances as they were not present in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, we observe that the BIA's interpretation would produce unintended results. Although Khalid's case arises under his unique circumstances, the BIA's decision would likely produce unfortunate consequences for the citizenship of other LPR children facing different situations. For example, a high school boarding student away at school would not derive citizenship from her parent who naturalized unless she returned home before turning eighteen. Similarly, a student on a semester trip abroad might be denied citizenship under the BIA's interpretation if his parent naturalized while he was abroad and he turned eighteen while on that trip. The BIA's interpretation likely forecloses derivative citizenship under those circumstances, without any inquiry into the particular circumstances of the parent's custody or the law governing the child's separation from the parent. We think that approach at odds with both the statute's language and context and decline to adopt it here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We hold that the brief, temporary separation created by Khalid's pretrial juvenile detention did not prevent Khalid from satisfying the \"physical custody\" requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and that consequently, he obtained derivative citizenship from his father in 2011. As a result, Khalid is a citizen of the United States. Accordingly, we\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the petition for review,\n   <strong>\n    VACATE\n   </strong>\n   the BIA's decision, and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   with instructions to terminate Khalid's removal proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   I concur in the Opinion of the Court, its reasoning, and its result.

The premise for that derivative citizenship was that, during the crucial period between Khalid's father's naturalization and Khalid's eighteenth birthday, Khalid was in his father's physical custody-notwithstanding that he was behind bars on terrorism charges, in the custody of the authorities. So I need to emphasize, consistent with the Opinion, that that result obtained only because the detention was pretrial, brief, and in a juvenile facility where, under federal law, Khalid's citizen father was allowed and encouraged to exercise influence over his son. The holding of this case is surprising enough, and does not lend itself to expansion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    We use \"AR\" as shorthand for the administrative record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    At oral argument, counsel for the government indicated that he had no information indicating that Khalid presents a continuing threat to the United States.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    DHS sought removal to the United Arab Emirates or Pakistan.

While this may be true, \"physical custody\" is a term of art, and the state law definitions we surveyed above make clear that in some contexts, a parent might \"have\" physical custody or a child might be residing \"in\" a parent's physical custody, even if that child is not currently physically present with the parent.
