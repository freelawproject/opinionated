The district court awarded partial summary judgment in favor of the EEOC on the issue of liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180302\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/267/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the second appeal, we affirmed the award of summary judgment to the EEOC and remanded for consideration of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180302\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/267/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties later approved a strategy for the gradual equalization of contribution rates under the plan and entered into a Joint Consent Order Regarding Injunctive Relief, which the district court approved. The order did not resolve claims for monetary relief and expressly indicated that the availability of such relief would be addressed by the court at a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court ultimately denied the EEOC's motion for retroactive monetary relief, in the form of back pay, and closed the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded that it had the discretion under the enforcement provision of the ADEA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20626\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), to wholly deny back pay. Alternatively, the court stated that, even if back pay were a mandatory remedy, the court would deny the relief pursuant to its equitable powers because of the EEOC's years-long delay in bringing the action. The EEOC now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The County argues that the district court properly exercised its discretion under the ADEA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20626\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), in denying the EEOC an award of back pay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the County's view, the ADEA grants courts broad authority \"to grant such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate,\" including the denial of back pay. 29 U.S.C \u00a7 626(b). In contrast, the EEOC points to the incorporation into the ADEA of certain provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which mandate that violators \"shall be liable\" for back pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 626(b). In light of this language, and because back pay is a mandatory, legal remedy under the FLSA, the EEOC urges us to adopt the same interpretation\n   of the ADEA. Accordingly, the EEOC contends that the district court lacked the discretion to decline to award back pay. We agree with the EEOC, and conclude that a retroactive monetary award of back pay under the ADEA is mandatory upon a finding of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We review this issue of statutory interpretation de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
