In cases where a statute describes alternate ways of committing a crime -- only some of which satisfy the definition of a violent felony -- courts may use a modified categorical approach and examine a limited set of documents to determine whether a defendant was necessarily convicted of a violent felony. These materials include charging documents, jury instructions, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies, or \"some comparable judicial record.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Headbird v.

In\n   <em>\n    Boaz I\n   </em>\n   , we applied the modified categorical approach to this statute because it \"defines two separate offenses: threats of death or serious bodily injury and threats to property.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3360938\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/558/800/#p807\">\n    558 F.3d at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that it had applied the modified categorical approach only if a state statute was \"divisible,\" that is, a statute that \"sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    570 U.S. at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , resolving a circuit conflict, the Court held that the modified categorical approach may not be applied if a statute, instead of defining multiple crimes by listing elements in the alternative, merely \"lists alternative means of fulfilling one (or more)\" elements. 136 S.Ct. at 2253. Martin argues that each subsection of \u00a7 5-13-301(a)(1) is both indivisible (precluding use of the modified categorical approach) and overbroad (because it criminalizes threats of physical injury\n   <em>\n    or property damage\n   </em>\n   to another person). Therefore, he argues, an\n   Arkansas first-degree terroristic threatening conviction is not a violent felony under the ACCA's force clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In preparing for oral argument, we discovered that this same argument had been submitted two months earlier to another panel in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Myers\n   </em>\n   , a case arising on direct appeal rather than by a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. To conserve resources and avoid possible inconsistent panel rulings that would require en banc attention, we had this case submitted without argument and awaited the other panel's decision. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517777\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/866/\">\n    896 F.3d 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2018), we concluded that (i)\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   did not address the ACCA's force clause and therefore does not require reconsideration of the otherwise controlling decision in\n   <em>\n    Boaz I\n   </em>\n   that \u00a7 5-13-301(a)(1)(A)\"is divisible, and requires the modified categorical approach,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517777\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/866/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 869 ; (ii) even if the\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   analysis applies, \"this court must look to the record of conviction to determine whether Myers' conviction for terroristic threatening is a crime of violence,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517777\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/866/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 871 ; and (iii) the state court Sentencing Order confirmed that Myers was convicted of a violent felony under the force clause for \"threaten[ing] to kill his girlfriend,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517777\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/866/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On August 29, we denied his petition for rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   that \u00a7 5-13-301(a)(1)(A), the Arkansas first-degree terroristic threatening statute, \"is divisible, and requires the modified categorical approach,\" is controlling on our panel. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , state court documents that may be examined using the modified categorical approach establish that Martin was twice convicted of the ACCA violent felony of threatening to use physical force against another\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   . In one case, the Felony Information charged that Martin \"threatened to cause physical injury to Officer Kevin Brown.\" In the other case, the Felony Information charged that Martin \"threatened to kill [the victim] if she tried to leave him during the time he held her captive.\" Thus, on this record,\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boaz\n   </em>\n   I establish that Martin was properly sentenced under the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Alternatively, we conclude that Martin is not eligible for successive \u00a7 2255 relief. The recent Supreme Court decisions on which he relies --\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   - did not announce \"a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2). First, these decisions are simply the Supreme Court's latest interpretations of the categorical approach the Court has long applied in deciding whether a prior conviction is an ACCA violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"For more than 25 years, we have repeatedly made clear that application of the ACCA involves, and involves only, comparing elements.\");\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    570 U.S. at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Our caselaw explaining the categorical approach and its 'modified' counterpart all but resolves this case.\");\n   <em>\n    Headbird\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088823\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/1092/#p1095\">\n    813 F.3d at 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Supreme Court has not declared either\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   retroactive, as\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was declared retroactive in\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   the Court noted that, on remand, the court of appeals might decide that \"Welch's strong-arm robbery conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the [force] clause of the Act,\n   <em>\n    which would make Welch eligible for a 15-year sentence regardless of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   .\" 136 S.Ct. at 1268 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For these reasons, we affirm the Order of the district court dated May 16, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The Honorable J.
