Fidelitad, Inc. is a value-added reseller of Insitu's drones in Latin America. In this action, Fidelitad claims that Insitu improperly delayed shipment of its orders, wrongfully terminated a purported distributorship agreement, and then moved into the Latin American market, appropriating Fidelitad's prior groundwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Fidelitad filed its original complaint in Washington state court. Insitu removed the action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, invoking\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), which allows removal of civil actions against \"any officer (or any person acting under that officer) of the United States.\" The district court denied Fidelitad's motion to remand and later granted summary judgment to Insitu. We hold that the motion to remand should have been granted. We therefore reverse, with instructions to remand the action to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In late 2009, two Insitu employees, Eric Edsall and Alejandro Pita, assisted the Colombian Air Force after its purchase of two Insitu drones. While in Colombia, Edsall and Pita identified a number of potential non-military applications for the drones (for example, pipeline surveillance and counter-narcotics operations). With Insitu's blessing, Edsall and Pita formed Fidelitad in 2010, to act as a value-added reseller of Insitu's products in Latin America. Although Insitu was supportive\n   of Fidelitad, the two companies never entered into a written contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By October 2010, Fidelitad had made several sales of Insitu drones to the Colombian Air Force and the United States military in Colombia (for end use by the Colombian military). Fidelitad placed orders for the drones with Insitu and obtained export licenses from the federal government. But, Insitu delayed filling the orders, asking Fidelitad first to obtain clarification on various provisions in the export licenses from federal officials. For example, Insitu asked Fidelitad to inquire whether separate licenses were required to export sensors on the drones.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, Insitu suggested to Fidelitad that the United States take title to the drones in this country and export them to Colombia itself, making the export licenses unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fidelitad accepted delivery of one of the drones, but without the disputed sensors. Fidelitad then arranged to transfer the remaining drones it had ordered to the federal government, and the government in turn agreed to transfer title to the Colombian Air Force. After filling these orders, Insitu refused to accept any further orders from Fidelitad. Insitu subsequently made several sales directly to Colombian customers previously solicited by Fidelitad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After removal, the district court denied Fidelitad's motion to remand, and later granted summary judgment to Insitu. Fidelitad timely appealed, and now challenges both the denial of the motion to remand and the summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We have jurisdiction over Fidelitad's appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and review the district court's denial of remand de novo,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corona-Contreras v.
