Stat. \u00a7 111.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., changed many provisions of that State's labor laws. This case deals with a narrow provision of Act 1 that attempts to change the rules for payroll deductions that allow employees to pay union dues through dues-checkoff authorizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A dues-checkoff authorization is a contract between an employer and employee for payroll deductions. These are \"arrangements whereby [employers] would check off from employee wages amounts owed to a labor organization for dues, initiation fees and assessments.\"\n   <em>\n    Felter v. Southern Pacific Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165431\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/326/#p330\">\n    359 U.S. 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 330-31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165431\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/326/#p330\">\n    79 S.Ct. 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165431\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/326/#p330\">\n    3 L.Ed.2d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959). By signing an authorization, the employee directs the employer to deduct union dues or fees routinely from the employee's paycheck and to remit those funds to the applicable union. Many of these authorizations are irrevocable for a specified period-often one year-for reasons of administrative simplicity. See Dkt. 43 at 2 (Elizondo Aff.); see also\n   <em>\n    N.L.R.B. v. Atlanta Printing Specialties and Paper Prods. Union 527\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1105790\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/523/783/#p786\">\n    523 F.2d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 786 (5th Cir. 1975). The union itself is not a party to the authorization, which is effective if and only if the employee wishes. Federal law has long provided, however, that unions can bargain collectively with employers over the standard terms of dues-checkoff authorizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Taft-Hartley Act imposes three limits on dues-checkoff authorizations: the authorization must be (1) individual for each employee, (2) in writing, and (3) irrevocable\n   for no longer than one year. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20186\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (c)(4).

Wisconsin's attempt to short-circuit the collective bargaining process and to impose a different dues-checkoff standard is preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin Act 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before Act 1 was enacted in 2015, Wisconsin law had allowed so-called union security agreements in which unions and employers would agree that employees would be required either to join the union or pay fair-share fees. That changed with Act 1's \"right-to-work\" provisions, which prohibit employers from requiring their employees to pay dues or fees to a union. See\n   <em>\n    International Union of Operating Engineers Local 139 v. Schimel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275933\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/674/#p676\">\n    863 F.3d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676-77 (7th Cir. 2017), excerpting 2015 Wis. Act 1, \u00a7 5, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20111.04\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(a). Act 1 provides in part: \"No person may require, as a condition of obtaining or continuing employment, an individual to ... Pay any dues, fees, assessments, or other charges ... to a labor organization.\" \u00a7 111.04(3)(a)(3). This also meant that Wisconsin employers and unions could no longer enter into an enforceable mandatory union security agreement-a term in a collective bargaining agreement where an employer promises the union that, as a condition of employment, it will require its employees to maintain membership in the union. We held in\n   <em>\n    Schimel\n   </em>\n   that this \"right-to-work\"/mandatory union security agreement portion of Act 1 is not preempted by federal law.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275933\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/674/#p676\">\n    863 F.3d at 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The section of Act 1 challenged in this lawsuit attempts a less dramatic change in labor law. It requires employers to terminate dues-checkoff authorizations within thirty days of receiving written notice from the employee. 2015 Wis. Act 1, \u00a7 9, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20111.06\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(i). This challenged provision reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer individually or in concert with others: ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (i) To deduct labor organization dues or assessments from an employee's earnings, unless the employer has been presented with an individual order therefor, signed by the employee personally, and terminable by the employee giving to the employer at least 30 days' written notice of the termination. This paragraph applies to the extent permitted under federal law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Dispute at the John Deere Plant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This case stems from a complaint filed with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, the State agency that enforces Wisconsin's wage laws. Lisa Aplin, an assembler at a John Deere plant in Wisconsin, signed a dues-checkoff authorization in November 2002. Her authorization instructed John Deere to deduct union dues from her paychecks and to remit them to the International Association of Machinists District 10 and Local Lodge 873, the plaintiffs-appellees here, which we refer to as the Machinists or the union. Aplin's authorization said that it was \"irrevocable for one (1) year or until the termination of the collective bargaining agreement ... whichever occurs sooner.\" It also provided that it would be automatically renewed for successive one-year periods unless the collective bargaining agreement terminated or Aplin gave notice during a fifteen-day annual period. The authorization also provided that it was \"independent of, and not a quid pro quo for, union membership.\" This arrangement remained in effect until 2015. As the State explains, dues-checkoff authorizations like this are a convenient way for employees to pay their union dues or fair-share fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the wake of Act 1, John Deere and the Machinists updated their collective bargaining agreement, but they left in place a term making dues-checkoff authorizations irrevocable for one year. In July 2015, Aplin sent a letter to John Deere and the union invoking Act 1 and requesting the termination of her dues-checkoff authorization. The union responded that her request was untimely and could not be granted unless she renewed it during the annual cancellation period that November.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Aplin then filed a complaint with the State agency claiming that John Deere was violating State wage laws by not honoring within thirty days her attempt to revoke the dues-checkoff authorization. She sought a refund of $65.60 in union dues deducted from her pay after the cancellation would have taken effect. In November 2015, the agency sided with Aplin, finding that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20111.06\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(i) applied and that John Deere had to honor Aplin's cancellation and refund request, or face enforcement action. The company then reimbursed Aplin for the $65.60 deducted from her paycheck. Around the same time, the agency handled another similar dues-checkoff complaint invoking\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20111.06\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(i) and concluded that it \"must enforce the statute in its current form\" unless and until it was found preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    This Federal Lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In February 2016, the Machinists filed this action in the Western District of Wisconsin and moved to enjoin the State from enforcing Act 1's dues-checkoff provision. The union contended that the federal Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, better known as the Taft-Hartley Act, preempted Act 1 on this score. See Pub. L. No. 80-101, \u00a7 302(a), (c)(4),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Stat.%20157\">\n    61 Stat. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20186\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To protect against corruption in the collective bargaining process, the Taft-Hartley Act, as amended, prohibits \"any employer or association of employers\" from giving \"any money or other thing of value\" to \"any labor organization,\" \u00a7 186(a)(2), unless one of a long list of exceptions applies. \u00a7 186(c). The exception relevant here provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The [prohibition] provisions of this section shall not be applicable ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (4) with respect to money deducted from the wages of employees in payment of membership dues in a labor organization:\n   <em>\n    Provided\n   </em>\n   , That the employer has received from each employee, on whose account\n   such deductions are made, a written assignment which shall not be irrevocable for a period of more than one year, or beyond the termination date of the applicable collective agreement, whichever occurs sooner....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00a7 186(c)(4). The union argued that this year-long dues-checkoff exception in federal labor law is incompatible with, and thus preempts, the corresponding thirty-day provision of Wisconsin's Act 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court granted the union's motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined enforcement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20111.06\">\n    Wis.

Because the challenged portion of Act 1 regulates an employee's optional dues-checkoff authorization rather than an employee's obligation to pay dues as a condition of employment, it falls outside the scope of the \u00a7 164(b)\"right-to-work\"/union security agreement exception. We explain in Part II-A that we agree with the district court that the Supreme Court's summary affirmance in\n   <em>\n    Sea Pak\n   </em>\n   controls this case. In Part II-B, we explain why\n   <em>\n    Sea Pak\n   </em>\n   fits comfortably with broader preemption principles of labor law. In Part II-C, we address and reject further arguments by the State for recognizing an exception from those principles here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Sea Pak's Continuing Force\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The procedural history of the\n   <em>\n    Sea Pak\n   </em>\n   decision was a bit unusual, but the district court correctly found that the Supreme Court's summary affirmance in\n   <em>\n    Sea Pak\n   </em>\n   controls here. The Supreme Court has instructed that \"the lower [federal] courts are bound by summary decisions by this Court 'until such time as the Court informs (them) that (they) are not,' \" because \"votes to affirm summarily ... are votes on the merits of a case,\" just like those accompanied by fully reasoned Court opinions.\n   <em>\n    Hicks v.

Any agreement was to be ineffective as to an employee who did not furnish the employer with a written assignment in favor of the labor organization, and any assignment made was to be \"revocable in writing after the expiration of one year....\" This failure to authorize agreements binding employees to submit to the checkoff was deliberate on the part of Congress.

Similarly Congress consciously and deliberately chose to deny carriers and labor organizations authority to reach terms which would restrict the employee's complete freedom to revoke an assignment by a writing directed to the employer after one year.

It had agreed, in light of federal law, to a collective bargaining agreement with the Machinists that incorporated by reference dues-checkoff agreements irrevocable for one year. Because this decision was inconsistent with Wisconsin's thirty-day revocability requirement, John Deere was told that it could be found responsible for committing an unfair labor practice under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   law. But if, after executing the collective bargaining agreement, John Deere had decided to ignore its requirements and to comply with Act 1 instead, it could have been brought before the National Labor Relations Board by the union for committing a\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   unfair labor practice.

Stat. \u00a7 111.06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(i) from preemption. It first argues that preemption analysis should not apply to State dues-checkoff laws because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20186\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4), is only an exception to a criminal prohibition against bribery and corruption. Second, the State argues that Taft-Hartley's preemption exemption for State \"right-to-work\"/mandatory union security agreement laws, \u00a7 164(b), applies not only to the kind of agreements mentioned in its text, but also to State laws regulating the terms of dues-checkoff authorizations. Neither argument finds support in the statute or in the Supreme Court's labor law decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Section 186 's Preemptive Scope\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First, as recounted above, Taft-Hartley's prohibition on employers and their agents giving \"any money or other thing of value\" to unions in \u00a7 186(a) was designed to fight corruption. The exception in \u00a7 186(c)(4) goes further, though. It also sets regulatory terms and conditions for lawful dues-checkoffs: \"\n   <em>\n    Provided\n   </em>\n   , That the employer has received from each employee, on whose account such deductions are made, a written assignment which shall not be irrevocable for a period of more than one year[.]\" This proviso shows a regulatory intent, not just a narrowing of the scope of \u00a7 186(a) 's criminal liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Section 186 is not a generic criminal statute applicable across many different potential contexts, comparable to say, mail or wire fraud. Next to Taft-Hartley's other provisions, the scope, exceptions, and location of \u00a7 186 show that it seeks primarily to regulate the interaction between employers and employee representatives, including some key terms of dues-checkoff authorizations. The fact that some violations of these policies may be felonies, see \u00a7 186(d), reflects the depth of Congress's commitment to these policy choices.

In addition to outlawing compulsory unionism, the law requires that checkoff agreements be terminable upon 30 days' notice to the employer. John Deere employee Lisa Aplin tried to take advantage of the new law by revoking her checkoff agreement, but the union, the International Association of Machinists, was not pleased and refused to accept her revocation. Aplin charged that the union committed an unfair labor practice, and the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development agreed.

Nor does it stand up to any scrutiny under modern general preemption doctrine, which now requires much stronger textual indications of Congressional intent to displace state regulation. I conclude that developments over the last 47 years have eroded the precedential value of\n   <em>\n    SeaPak\n   </em>\n   to such an extent that we no longer are obliged to follow it. Therefore, I would permit Wisconsin to enforce its limitation on checkoff agreements. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Wisconsin's right-to-work law, known as Act 1, went into effect on July 1, 2015. Its main provision abolishes compulsory unionism, declaring that \"[n]o person may require, as a condition of obtaining or continuing employment, an individual to ... [p]ay any dues, fees, assessments, or other charges or expenses of any kind or amount ... to a labor organization\" or \"any 3rd party.\" WIS. STAT. \u00a7 111.04(3)(a) 3 &amp; 4. Further, when an employee chooses to pay dues to a union via a checkoff from the employee's paycheck, such checkoff agreement must be \"terminable by the employee giving to the employer at least 30 days' written notice of the termination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175136\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/132/#p140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 111.06(1)(i). The limitation on checkoff agreements permits employees more flexibility, allowing them to easily stop deductions from their paychecks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Lisa Aplin worked for John Deere. The International Association of Machinists\n   had a collective bargaining agreement with John Deere to represent the employees at Aplin's plant, but Aplin never agreed to join the union. Nevertheless, she was still obligated before the right-to-work law went into effect to pay dues to the union. She had a checkoff agreement to facilitate that payment. But when her obligation to pay ceased on July 1, 2015, she sought to revoke the checkoff agreement as of July 31. The union refused to honor her revocation request because, according to the union, the request didn't comply with the collective bargaining agreement. Aplin filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, and that agency agreed that the union had committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to accept a revocation deemed lawful under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The union sought declaratory and injunctive relief in federal court on the ground that Wisconsin's restriction of checkoff agreements is preempted by federal law.

While management and labor may bargain over the existence and terms of checkoff agreements, neither side adequately represents the freedom of employees to revoke their agreements.

That case was about whether, under the Railway Labor Act's checkoff provision, a union could require an employee to submit his revocation on a particular form furnished by the union.

To be sure, the Supreme Court held that labor and management could not bargain for additional requirements beyond \"a written assignment,\" but it said so because it interpreted the statute as preserving employee freedom. The up-to-one-year provision in Section 302(c)(4) is similar in that it protects employees from certain bargaining decisions. In some ways, that makes these provisions\n   <em>\n    counter-examples\n   </em>\n   for\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   preemption.

Like the revocable-at-will provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    SeaPak\n   </em>\n   , the 30-day irrevocability period now mandated by Wisconsin law does not violate federal law. Federal law makes an employer payment to a union under a checkoff agreement a crime only if such agreement is irrevocable for more than one year. The 30-day Wisconsin period falls within the safe-harbor exception granted by Section 302(c)(4) of the Taft-Hartley Act.

The Court is now much more sensitive to federalism concerns and far less likely to imply preemption from ambiguous statutes or legislative history.

The court, perhaps sensing that\n   <em>\n    SeaPak\n   </em>\n   is on weak ground under general preemption principles, mostly defends it as an early\n   application of labor-specific\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   preemption. But not only was\n   <em>\n    SeaPak\n   </em>\n   not a\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   case,\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to the Wisconsin law as a matter of first impression.

But Section 302 is primarily a prohibition of employer payments to unions, not a regulation of the collective bargaining process. Checkoffs are only permitted in the first instance as an exception to this general rule, and generally because they are convenient.

Even where the union and management bargain for the existence of checkoffs, employees need not take advantage of them. It is hard to see how a voluntary agreement to pay union dues out of one's paycheck would constitute a term of employment at all.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    For these reasons, I would conclude that\n    <em>\n     Garmon\n    </em>\n    preemption is inapplicable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    The text of Section 8 of the NLRA provides no indication that a 30-day period of irrevocability would constitute an unfair labor practice under federal law, so I do not see how the NLRB could possibly sanction any private parties for complying with Wisconsin law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    As I noted above, the Supreme Court has said \"that summary affirmances have considerably less precedential value than an opinion on the merits.\"\n    <em>\n     Socialist Workers Party\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180624\" index=\"427\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/173/#p182\">\n     440 U.S. at 180-81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180624\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/173/#p182\">\n     99 S.Ct. 983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
