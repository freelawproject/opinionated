In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the ICWA by denying Indian parents a meaningful post-deprivation hearing after their children were taken into temporary state custody. The defendant officials are the Secretary of the South Dakota Department of Social Services and the head of Child Protective Services for Pennington County (together, \"the DSS Defendants\"), the State's Attorney for Pennington County, and the presiding judge of the Seventh Judicial Circuit Court of the State of South Dakota, all in their official capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Tribes assert standing under the\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   doctrine, alleging that they seek \"to vindicate rights afforded to their members.\" They claim \"a close affiliation, indeed kinship, with respect to the rights and interests at stake in this litigation.\" They further allege that \"[t]he future and well-being of the Tribes is inextricably linked to the health, welfare, and family integrity of their members.\" The Tribes also seek to vindicate their own rights under the ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The named individual plaintiffs, Pappan and Young, both reside in Pennington County and are members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, respectively. They claim that they \"are not seeking to interfere with, or overturn decisions in, their own cases but rather are seeking to expose and challenge systemic policies, practices, and customs of the Defendants that violate federal law.\" Both Pappan and Young have two children who were previously taken into State custody under allegations of abuse or neglect. The children remained in State custody for months before returning home. According to the complaint, both mothers \"suffered, and watched their children suffer, extreme emotional and psychological trauma as a result of this forced separation.\" Pappan and Young brought their claims on behalf of themselves and \"all other members of federally recognized Indian tribes who reside in Pennington County, South Dakota and who, like the plaintiffs, are parents or custodians of Indian children.\" The district court certified a class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiffs alleged that it was \"[t]he policy, practice, and custom of the Defendants ... to wait at least sixty days (and more often ninety days) before providing parents whose children have been removed from their custody with adequate notice, an opportunity to present evidence on their behalf, an opportunity to contest the allegations, and a written decision based on competent evidence.\" They asserted that the 48-hour hearings did not provide these protections. So they sought declaratory and injunctive relief to ensure that Indian families and Tribes were given \"adequate notice and a meaningful hearing at a meaningful time following the removal of Indian children from their homes by state officials,\" as allegedly required by the Due Process Clause and the ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing, among other things, that the plaintiffs lacked standing under Article III, and that the district court was required to abstain from exercising jurisdiction under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    Younger v. Harris\n   </em>\n   . The district court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thereafter, the district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs on the merits and granted declaratory and injunctive relief. The court ruled that the defendants' practices and policies at the 48-hour hearings violated both \u00a7 1922 of the ICWA and the Due Process Clause. The district court declared that Indian children, parents, custodians, and Tribes\n   have rights at the 48-hour hearings to \"adequate notice,\" to present evidence and subpoena witnesses, to cross-examine DSS witnesses, to receive the assistance of court-appointed counsel if indigent, and to a decision based on the evidence presented at the hearing. Relying on \u00a7 1922, the court declared that the State may continue temporary custody of a child after a 48-hour hearing only if it establishes that temporary custody is \"necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.\" If the State does continue temporary custody, the court ordered that DSS must immediately report to the circuit court when the risk of imminent physical damage or harm subsides, and return the child to a parent or custodian at that time. The district court further declared that \u00a7 1922 does not permit the State to consider emotional damage or harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The declaratory judgment went into some detail on the scope of these rights. For example, the court defined adequate notice to mean that all petitions for temporary custody must include information about the State's burden of proof. As to the right to cross-examination, the court declared that parents, custodians, and Tribes have the right to cross-examine all witnesses \"whose statements form the factual basis for any document submitted to the court for consideration during the 48-hour hearing.\" The court also permanently enjoined the DSS Defendants and the State's Attorney from violating the constitutional and statutory rights declared by the court, and ordered them to comply with the requirements set forth in the declaratory judgment. The court did not order injunctive relief against the presiding judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]n any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There are several threshold jurisdictional issues in this appeal, including Article III standing and\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention.

The plaintiffs seek an order that would dictate a host of procedural requirements for the ongoing state proceedings. The question under the abstention doctrine is not whether the claims have merit such that the exercise of federal jurisdiction would \"support the state's interest\" in affording its residents protection under the law. The issue is whether the federal court should refrain from exercising jurisdiction and allow the claims to be resolved in the state proceedings. A federal court order dictating what procedures must be used in an ongoing state proceeding would \"interfere\" with that proceeding by inhibiting \"the legitimate functioning of the individual state's judicial system.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonner v.
