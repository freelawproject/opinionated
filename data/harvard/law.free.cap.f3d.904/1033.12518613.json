In late 2009, Fikre traveled to Sudan to establish a consumer electronics business in East Africa. In April 2010, while still in Sudan, Fikre was approached by two FBI agents who questioned him about his association with the as-Saber Mosque in Portland and his commercial finances. The agents told Fikre that he had been placed on the No Fly List, which identifies individuals who are prohibited from flying into, out of, or over the United States and Canadian airspace by commercial airlines. The FBI agents offered to remove Fikre from the list if he became a government informant. Fikre refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Fikre's business took him to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in September 2010. As recounted by Fikre, Emirati secret police seized him from the place where he was staying in June 2011 and transported him to an unknown location where he was imprisoned and tortured for 106 days. During this time, Fikre was interrogated about his connection to the as-Saber Mosque and the nature of his financial dealings. One of the interrogators told Fikre that the FBI had requested his detention. Fikre was released in September 2011, but he was unable to board a plane bound for the United States because he remained on the No Fly List. Fikre sought refuge in Sweden. While there, he consulted an attorney and held a press conference denouncing his capture and confinement in the UAE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) allows individuals the opportunity to have the Transportation Security Administration review and, if appropriate, correct their files if it determines that a person has been erroneously placed on a watchlist. As initially implemented in 2007, the government responded to TRIP inquiries without confirming a traveler's inclusion on the No Fly List. Fikre attempted in November 2013 to rectify his situation through TRIP, but the DHS neither confirmed nor denied his placement on the No Fly List in response to this first inquiry; it stated only that \"no changes or corrections [we]re warranted at th[at] time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2015, the DHS modified TRIP to comply with the judgment in\n   <em>\n    Latif v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318385\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/28/1134/\">\n    28 F.Supp.3d 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Or. 2014). The revised TRIP protocol includes additional procedural safeguards that were unavailable at the time Fikre filed his action. Requesters are now apprised of their presence or absence on the No Fly List and the unclassified reasons for their status. Applying the revised procedures, in February 2015 the DHS informed Fikre that he was and would remain on the No Fly List because he had been \"identified as an individual who may be a threat to civil aviation or national security.\" No other reasons were provided for the decision to maintain Fikre on the No Fly List. Fikre was ultimately denied asylum in Sweden, and the Swedish government returned him to the United States in 2015. Fikre avers that these events damaged his reputation by stigmatizing him as a suspected terrorist and so strained his marriage that his wife divorced him while he was stranded outside of the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fikre brought the instant suit against the government raising a variety of common law, statutory, and constitutional claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant here, Fikre alleged that the FBI violated his right to substantive due process by depriving him of his liberty interest in his reputation and international travel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and by conditioning his removal from the No Fly List upon his agreement to become a government informant. Fikre's complaint also maintained that the FBI denied him procedural due process by placing and keeping him on the No Fly List without adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard. Fikre prayed for injunctive and declaratory relief for both due process claims and asked, among other things, for a declaration by the government that he should not have been added to the No Fly List.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Defendants moved to dismiss the operative complaint and, shortly thereafter, notified Fikre that he had been removed from the No Fly List. In a joint status report filed at the district court's direction, Fikre agreed that, to the extent he sought an injunction requiring the Defendants to remove him from the list, that claim was moot. Fikre contended, however, that he remained entitled to other injunctive and declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court subsequently dismissed Fikre's remaining procedural and substantive due process claims in a detailed decision. The court reasoned that the government's removal of Fikre from the No Fly List was \"a sufficiently definite\n   action\" to render his claims moot. In reaching this conclusion, the district court observed that the Defendants had publicly stated that Fikre was no longer on the No Fly List, that more than six months had elapsed since this change in status, and that the record did not indicate a lack of good faith on the government's part. The district court also \"emphasize[d]\" that \"the courthouse doors will be open to [Fikre]\" were he to be reinstated to the No Fly List in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We review \"questions of Article III justiciability, including mootness\" de novo.\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

In the government's view, insofar as Fikre sought to be removed from the No Fly List, that outcome has now been achieved and his former status does not impinge on his existing legal rights. The government argues that there is no longer a live controversy and no effectual relief the court could grant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Fikre begs to differ. According to him, the voluntary cessation doctrine should apply to preclude a finding of mootness, especially because the government has not explained why it added him to the No Fly List in the first place and why, years later, it spontaneously took him off of it. Fikre urges that nothing prevents the government from putting him back on the list and that his claims are therefore not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Article III of the Constitution grants the Judicial Branch authority to adjudicate 'Cases' and 'Controversies.' \"\n   <em>\n    Already, LLC v.

The DHS re-evaluated Fikre's presence on the No Fly List in 2013 and 2015 pursuant to its TRIP procedure and determined that no adjustments to his status were necessary.

Yet it did just that fourteen months later, without explanation or any announced change in policy.

This record suggests that Fikre's removal from the No Fly List was more likely an exercise of discretion than a decision arising from a broad change in agency policy or procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, the government has not assured Fikre that he will not be banned from flying for the same reasons that prompted the government to add him to the list in the first place, nor has it verified the implementation of procedural safeguards conditioning its ability to revise Fikre's status on the receipt of new information. As far as we can tell, the current permission Fikre has to travel by air is \"discretionary,\" and not \"entrenched\" or \"permanent.\"\n   <em>\n    McCormack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230960\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/1017/#p1025\">\n    788 F.3d at 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The notice filed by the government averred only that \"counsel recently was advised by the Terrorist Screening Center that [Fikre] has been removed from the No Fly List.\" Absent an acknowledgment by the government that its investigation revealed Fikre did not belong on the list, and that he will not be returned to the list based on the currently available evidence, Fikre remains, in his own words, \"stigmatiz[ed] ... as a known or suspected terrorist and as an individual who represents a threat of engaging in or conducting a violent act of terrorism and who is operationally capable of doing so.\" Because acquaintances, business associates, and perhaps even family members are likely to persist in shunning or avoiding him despite his renewed ability to travel, it is plain that vindication in this action would have actual and palpable consequences for Fikre.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government suggests in its appellate brief that if Fikre is ever put back on the No Fly List, that determination would \"necessarily be ... predicated on a new and different factual record,\" but the government has not executed a declaration to that effect.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mokdad v.
