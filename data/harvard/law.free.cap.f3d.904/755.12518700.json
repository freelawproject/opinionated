The Railroads assert that \"the linchpin of California's HMTA theory-a claim that 'HMTA expressly permits states to impose fees'-is textually indefensible.\" Appellees' Brief at 33. The Railroads argue that the phrase \"may impose a fee,\" contained in \u00a7 5125(f)(1), does not authorize a state to charge a fee for the transportation of hazardous materials, limited by the phrase \"only if the fee is fair.\" They argue that under \u00a7 5125(f)(1) a state-imposed fee for the transportation of hazardous materials must be authorized by some\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   , unspecified federal law. The Railroads argue that the \"only if\" phrase of \u00a7 5125(f)(1) addresses the fees authorized by that other, unspecified federal law. It is undisputed that there is no other federal law authorizing a State to charge a fee for the interstate transportation of hazardous materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We disagree with the Railroads.

Given the consistent use of the \"may\" but \"only if\" structure throughout the HMTA, we do not believe the language of \u00a7 5125(f)(1) is ambiguous. However, because our concurring colleague believes that the statute in its current form is ambiguous, we will examine the legislative history. That history not only confirms that \u00a7 5125(f)(1) is an affirmative authorization of state-imposed fees related to the transportation of hazardous materials so long as they are \"fair.\" It also confirms that \u00a7 5125(f)(1) was intended to protect such fees from preemption by federal laws, like the ICCTA, that regulate transportation by rail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The HMTUSA, the source of \u00a7 5125(f)(1), was enacted in 1990 as an amendment of the HMTA. It grew out of a variety of proposals to amend the HMTA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 101-499 at 3 (1990) (listing eight bills to amend the HMTA that were before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation when the Committee considered Senate Bill 2936). House Bill 3520, introduced by Representative Thomas Luken, was among these proposals. H. 3520, 101st Cong. (1989). The bill contained a provision virtually identical to the fees provision at issue here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703162\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1211/#p1214\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Representative Luken's bill was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, of which Luken was a member. The Committee then favorably reported on the bill. H.R. Rep. No. 101-444, pt. 1, at 1. The Committee Report described the bill at length, including the provision that eventually became \u00a7 5125(f)(1). The Report tells us two things.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, the Report tells us that the predecessor to \u00a7 5125(f)(1), as originally enacted in 1990, affirmatively authorized a State to charge fees related to the transportation of hazardous materials. The Report explained that the fees \"would provide that a non-Federal governmental entity\n   <em>\n    may levy ... fees\n   </em>\n   , but would require that ... such ...\n   <em>\n    fees be reasonable\n   </em>\n   [.]\" H.R. Rep. No. 101-444, pt. 1, at 49 (emphasis added). The Report \"recognize[d] the critical role State and local governments must play in order to effectuate a comprehensive national hazardous materials program,\" and stated that state \"authority ... should properly extend to being able to fund legitimate activities directly connected with hazardous materials transportation programs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-50. The Report \"emphasize[d]\" that the bill \"make[s] clear that states may adopt\n   <em>\n    and enforce\n   </em>\n   hazardous materials laws, regulations, and other requirements that conform to the bill's requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-54 (emphasis in original). It noted that \"[a] State's ability to enforce such [laws] includes the ability to impose, collect, and utilize ...\n   <em>\n    fees\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, the Report unambiguously stated that a State's authority to charge fees under \u00a7 5125(f)(1) extended to transportation by rail. The bill as a whole was addressed to the transportation of hazardous materials by interstate transportation, including transportation by rail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205104\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (authorizing companies to represent that a \"rail freight car\" contains hazardous material and prohibiting tampering with \"rail freight car[s]\" so designated);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205104\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5105(b), (c) (\"[T]he Secretary shall conduct a study comparing the safety\n   of using trains ... with the safety of using other methods of rail transportation for transporting that waste and fuel....

But the bill and the Report did address preemption. A federal statute with a broad preemption provision, the Federal Railroad Safety Act (\"FRSA\"), was already part of federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020106\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Enacted in 1970, the FRSA had been in effect for twenty-one years.

Rep. No. 101-444, pt. 1, at 53-54 (1990).

That amendment incorporated the fees provision from House Bill 3520 into the Senate Bill. 136 Cong. Rec. 34168, 34181 (1990).

The predecessor to \u00a7 5125(f)(1) was enacted in 1990, and was recodified as \u00a7 5125(f)(1) without substantive change in 1994. The ICCTA was enacted in 1995, a year later. There is nothing in the text of the ICCTA, or in its legislative history, to indicate that Congress intended to restrict or overrule the protection from preemption provided by \u00a7 5125(f)(1). Congress knew that \u00a7 5125(f)(1) provided protection from preemption by federal law, in particular by the Federal Railroad Safety Act. That is, Congress knew that \u00a7 5125(f)(1) permitted States to impose fees related to the transportation of hazardous materials by rail, and to do so despite the FRSA. If Congress intended in the ICCTA to reverse course and no longer to permit States to impose such fees, one would expect Congress to have said so. But Congress said nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2. Fees Must Be \"Fair\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Conceding for the sake of argument that the HMTA authorizes a State to charge a fee for transportation of hazardous materials by rail so long as the fee is \"fair,\" the Railroads argue that the fees authorized by SB 84 are not fair within the meaning of \u00a7 5125(f)(1). They argue that SB 84 is unfair because it imposes a burden on railroads that it does not impose on the trucking industry. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   According to a declaration by an expert employed by the Railroads, \"railroads and trucks transport roughly equivalent amounts of hazardous materials on a ton-mile basis.\" The risks, and associated costs, of hazardous materials spills are substantial for both rail and trucking. SB 84 imposes costs on shippers if they ship hazardous materials by rail but not if they ship such materials by truck, thus favoring\n   the trucking industry at the expense of railroads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Rail accidents are less frequent than trucking accidents, but some rail accidents are catastrophic. As stated by a California Legislative Analyst's Office report released prior to the passage of SB 84, \"a rail accident is potentially of a much larger scale when it does occur.\" For example, the report referred to a 1991 train derailment in Dunsmuir, California that spilled \"19,000 gallons of pesticide into the Sacramento River.\" The spilled pesticide \"killed fish and vegetation along the river for forty miles and caused wide-spread health problems for area residents.\"\n   <em>\n    Union Pacific Rr. Co. v. California Public Utilities Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9094667\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/851/#p856\">\n    346 F.3d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856 (9th Cir. 2003). The railroad settled a federal suit arising out of the spill for $38,000,000. As a further example, an Addendum to a Notice of Emergency Rulemaking issued by the California Governor's Office referred to a \"devastating derailment in Mosier, Oregon\" in 2016. \"[A]n estimated 42,000 gallons of crude oil spilled and rapidly caught fire. The nearby communities, including an elementary school, had to be evacuated. The oil entered the nearby waterway and the full extent of the damage to the environment is not fully known.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Trucking accidents, on the other hand, are more frequent but are smaller in scale. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, from 2010 to 2014 in the United States there were 67,639 \"incidents\" involving transportation of hazardous materials on highways, compared to 3,530 incidents involving transportation by rail. According to the report of the Legislative Analyst, during the period between 2005 and 2015 in California 92% of the costs associated with hazardous materials spills arose out of trucking accidents. Notably, however, that time period does not include the catastrophic 1991 Dunsmuir derailment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Recognizing the danger of transporting hazardous materials by truck, SB 84 provides that equipment purchased using fees collected from rail shippers under SB 84 may be used to respond to spills resulting from trucking accidents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%208574.44\">\n    Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7 8574.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ). However, local governmental entities-rather than the truck owner or operator involved in the spill-must reimburse the state Fund for use of the equipment. Trucks transporting hazardous materials are required to pay a licensing fee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032000.5\">\n    Cal. Veh. Code \u00a7 32000.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but the licensing and renewal fees-$100 and $75, respectively-are trivial in comparison to the per-rail-car fee on hazardous material shipments under SB 84. 13 Cal. Code Regs. \u00a7 1160.4(g)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   California could easily have imposed on railroads and trucking companies equivalent, or roughly equivalent, fees related to the transportation of hazardous materials. Indeed, it did so from 1991 to 1995, under a statute that imposed fees on both railroads and trucking companies. The proceeds were deposited in the Rail Accident Prevention and Response Fund, which was then used to fund local hazardous waste response equipment and training.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207713\">\n    Cal. Pub. Util. Code \u00a7\u00a7 7713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7714.5(e). Prior to the passage of SB 84, the California legislature considered and rejected a plan to finance the Fund in a similar manner, assessing fees against both railroads and trucking companies. Cal. State Assemb. 102, 2015 Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Cal. 2015). Instead of adopting such a plan, the legislature passed SB 84, assessing fees against only railroads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Because the fees authorized by SB 84 favor trucking companies over railroads, they are not \"fair\" and do not come within the protection provided by \u00a7 5125(f)(1). We therefore agree with the\n   Railroads and conclude that SB 84 is preempted by the ICCTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   3. Dissenting View of Our Concurring Colleague\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Our colleague concurs in the result, but dissents from our reasoning. According to our colleague's concurrence, \u00a7 5125(f)(1) is entirely preempted by the ICCTA insofar as it deals with shipment by rail. The concurrence concludes that any state-imposed fee related to the transportation by rail of hazardous materials is invalid, even if it is \"fair.\" The concurrence makes a number of arguments in support of its conclusion. We respectfully disagree with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   First, the concurrence argues that the ICCTA leaves no room for any state regulation of rates. The concurrence states that there has been \"a century of federal laws making regulation of railroad rates the exclusive prerogative of the federal government.\" Conc. Op. at 771. Further, the concurrence cites a decision of the Surface Transportation Board: \"[A]ny state regulation of railroad rates is 'preempted regardless of the context or rationale for the action' because it is 'a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unreasonable interference with interstate commerce.' \" Conc. Op. at 772 (citing\n   <em>\n    CSX Transportation, Inc.-Petition for Declaratory Order\n   </em>\n   , STB Finance Docket No. 34662,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201024490\">\n    2005 WL 1024490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-*3 (S.T.B. May 3, 2005) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The concurrence states the matter too generally. We agree with the concurrence that the preemption provision of the ICCTA is broad. Indeed, we would entirely agree with the concurrence if the question were whether the ICCTA entirely preempts a State from regulating railroad rates when the State's only source of authority is a state law passed under its traditional police powers. But the question here is different. The question is whether a State has been authorized\n   <em>\n    by federal law\n   </em>\n   to charge a fair fee related to the transportation of hazardous materials. In our view, the text of that federal law, \u00a7 5125(f)(1), is clear. The legislative history of \u00a7 5125(f)(1), if we must resort to it, tells us that Congress intended affirmatively to authorize state-imposed fees related to the transportation of hazardous materials so long as they are \"fair.\" Congress gave no indication that in enacting the broad preemption provision of the ICCTA it intended to preempt the fees that it had statutorily authorized only a year before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Similarly, the Surface Transportation Board in\n   <em>\n    CSX Transportation\n   </em>\n   recited broad general principles:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [There are] two broad categories of state and local actions to be preempted regardless of the context or rationale for the action. The first is any form of state or local permitting or preclearance that, by its nature, could be used to deny a railroad the ability to conduct some part of its operations....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Second, there can be no state or local regulation of matters directly regulated by the Board-such as the construction, operation, and abandonment of rail lines; railroad mergers, line acquisitions, and other forms of consolidation; and railroad rates and service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Both types of categorically preempted actions by a state or local body would directly conflict with exclusive federal regulation of railroads.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201024490\">\n    2005 WL 1024490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2-*3 (citations omitted). But the question actually at issue in\n   <em>\n    CSX Transportation\n   </em>\n   was narrow. The question was whether the District of Columbia could ban rail transportation of hazardous materials within a 2.2-mile radius of the United States Capitol Building. The District relied only on its police powers in support of its law. It cited no provision of the HMTA, or of any other federal statute, authorizing it to control railroad\n   routes. Not surprisingly in that circumstance, the STB held that the ban was preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, the concurrence argues that the text of the fee provision, as it was originally enacted in 1990, is unambiguous. It contends that \u00a7 5125(f)(1), as enacted in 1990, forbade States from imposing unfair fees and did not affirmatively authorize States to assess fair fees. According to the concurrence, the 1990 text did nothing more than \"preclude[ ] states from exercising their legislative authority to impose inequitable fees in connection with hazardous materials transportation.\" Conc. Op. at 777. The concurrence argues that because the recodification of \u00a7 5125(f)(1) in 1994 was not intended to work any substantive change, any ambiguity in the current wording of \u00a7 5125(f)(1) must be resolved by looking to the 1990 wording, which, in the view of the concurrence, was unambiguous. There are two problems with this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The initial problem is that if the 1990 and 1994 texts of \u00a7 5125(f)(1) are substantively the same (as the concurrence agrees they are), the 1990 and 1994 wordings are equally authoritative. The 1990 text is ambiguous at best, and the legislative history shows that it was intended to provide affirmative authorization to the States to charge fair fees. The Committee Report for House Bill 3520 explained that the fees provision, as then worded, \"would provide that a non-Federal governmental entity\n   <em>\n    may levy ... fees\n   </em>\n   , but would require that ... such ...\n   <em>\n    fees be reasonable\n   </em>\n   [.]\" H.R. Rep. No. 101-444, pt. 1, at 49 (emphasis added). The further problem is that the 1994 text, when considered\n   <em>\n    in paria materia\n   </em>\n   with syntactically identical provisions in the rest of the 1994 statute, is unambiguous in affirmatively authorizing States to charge fair fees related to the transportation of hazardous materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Third, the concurrence refuses to follow the rule of construction under which we give effect to the particular over the general. The rule directs us to compare the statutory provisions at issue, but the concurrence does not do so. Instead, the concurrence considers the particular issue being litigated rather than the actual statutory provisions: \"Because the only question here is whether the HMTA supercedes ICCTA on the issue of regulating railroad rates, our focus must be on how the two statutes address that particular issue.\" Conc. Op. at 775. The concurrence focuses only on the word \"rates,\" ignoring the other words in the preemption provision of the ICCTA that make clear the generality of the statute. The statutory provision, which the concurrence would have us ignore, is extremely broad, covering \"transportation by rail carriers, and the remedies provided in this part with respect to rates, classifications, rules...., practices, routes, services and facilities of such carriers; ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Section 5125(f)(1), by contrast, is fairly narrow, authorizing only fees for the transportation of hazardous materials, and only fees that are \"fair.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Fourth, the concurrence would read \u00a7 5125(f)(1) into oblivion. The concurrence would read \u00a7 5125(f)(1) to permit the State to assess fees from shippers of hazardous materials by truck, but to forbid the State to assess any fees whatsoever from shippers of such materials by rail. But if it is unfair to charge fees only for shipment by rail, it is equally unfair to charge fees only for shipment by truck. Under the concurrence's interpretation of \u00a7 1525(f)(1) there would be no possibility of a fair fee. In effect, the concurrence would read \u00a7 5125(f)(1) out of the U.S. Code. We do not believe Congress intended \u00a7 5125(f)(1) to suffer such a fate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The concurrence disagrees, based on alternative contentions. The concurrence contends that although the State cannot require a railroad to charge fees and then remit those fees to the State, the State could assess those fees directly from the shippers. The concurrence relies in part on a \"suggestion\" by the Railroads. Conc. Op. at 777 (\"[T]he railroads have suggested that if the state collected a charge from the shippers directly ... the charge would not be subject to STB jurisdiction and would not qualify as a rate.\"). We disagree that the Railroads have made such a suggestion, in the sense of endorsing it. The most that the Railroads have done is point out that we would have a different case if the State were to collect the fee directly, and then to argue strenuously that, however that case might come out, this case is easy because the Railroads cannot be required to collect the fee themselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellees' Brief at 28 (\"\n   <em>\n    If\n   </em>\n   the ICCTA permits a State to impose a hypothetical charge directly on rail shippers, it would be\n   <em>\n    because the STB has no jurisdiction over the direct charge\n   </em>\n   .\") (first emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We are skeptical that the ICCTA would allow the State to do directly what it cannot do indirectly. To allow a State to charge a shipper a fee directly but to forbid it to charge the same fee indirectly would be to choose form over substance. Whether a shipper pays a fee directly to the State or pays the fee to a railroad for remittance to the State, the economic consequence is the same. Under either alternative, the fee is part of the price the shipper pays to transport its hazardous material by rail. As we wrote in\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v. Aerovias De Mexico, S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505010\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/1027/#p1030\">\n    590 F.3d 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1030 (9th Cir. 2010), \" '[I]t is freshman-year economics that higher prices mean lower demand, and that consumers are sensitive to the full price that they must pay, not just the portion of the price that will stay in the seller's coffers.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buck v. Am. Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761832\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/476/29/#p36\">\n    476 F.3d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 36 (1st Cir. 2007) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In the alternative, the concurrence contends that assessing a fee solely against the trucking industry would be fair \"[s]o long as California imposes a fee on truck shipments of hazardous waste that is commensurate with the danger posed by such shipments.\" Conc. Op. at 776. According to the concurrence, charging a fee for all shipments of hazardous materials by truck while charging no fee whatsoever for such shipments by rail would be \"commensurate\" with the dangers posed by the two methods of shipping. It is not true that charging no fee whatsoever to shippers by rail would be \"commensurate\" and therefore \"fair.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As is made clear from the record, shipment by truck and shipment by rail both pose very serious risks. The concurrence relies on the Legislative Analyst's report to suggest that 92% of the costs of spills might properly be allocated to trucks as \"commensurate\" with the risk. Conc. Op. at 776-77. The Analyst's report did state that 92% of the costs associated with hazardous materials spills in California were due to trucking accidents, but the period at issue was 2005 to 2015. The record is clear that railroad accidents, while less frequent than trucking accidents, are often catastrophic when they do occur. Such accidents include the Dunsmuir pesticide spill in California in 1991 (outside the 2005-2015 period considered in the Analyst's report), the oil spill in Mosier, Oregon, in 2016, and several other catastrophic railroad accidents documented in the record. In the case of the Dunsmuir spill, clean up costs and other damages were paid only after the fact and only after suit was brought. As recounted above, the suit was settled for $38,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The concurrence contends that it would be \"commensurate,\" and therefore \"fair,\" to recover clean up costs by two different methods-assessing up-front per-shipment fees from truckers, but requiring after-the-fact litigation for any money paid by railroads. The two methods of payment are based on different theories of liability. An up-front, per-shipment system is a no-fault system. Truckers pay the fee regardless of fault, and the collected fees are used to clean up spills regardless of fault. By contrast, an after-the-fact, litigation-based system is a fault-based system. Railroads would be required to pay for spills only if found at fault for the spill. It would hardly be \"fair\" to subject the trucking industry to no-fault liability while subjecting railroads only to a fault-based liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   C. Dormant Commerce Clause\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because we hold that SB 84 is preempted on statutory grounds, we need not decide whether it is invalid under the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   D. Irreparable Harm, Balance of Equities, and Public Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The district court found that the Railroads would suffer irreparable harm if an injunction did not issue because some shippers would choose to ship hazardous materials by truck, or by other means, in order to avoid paying the fees mandated in SB 84. The district court further found that a weighing of the equities favored the Railroads. It acknowledged that fees collected during the pendency of this lawsuit could fund additional accident preparedness, which could help avert future damage to Californians and to the environment.

It also expressly preempts all state and federal laws that govern railroad rates, and gives the STB exclusive jurisdiction over those rates. By contrast, HMTA generally governs fees relating to hazardous materials transportation of all sorts and does not suggest that it supersedes any federal law. HMTA's vague statements regarding fair fees and hazardous materials transportation \"cannot be allowed to supersede the specific substantive pre-emption provision\" of ICCTA.\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p384\">\n    504 U.S. at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p384\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Moreover, \"[a] party seeking to suggest that two statutes cannot be harmonized, and that one displaces the other, bears the heavy burden of showing 'a clearly expressed congressional intention' that such a result should follow.

Therefore, the presumption is inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The majority also argues that Congress did not intend ICCTA to supersede HMTA with respect to railroad rates because that \"would read \u00a7 5125(f)(1) into oblivion.\" Maj. Op. at 769. This argument is simply false. The STB's exclusive jurisdiction over rates applies only to railroads, not to other means of transporting hazardous materials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (\"[T]he Board has jurisdiction over transportation by rail carrier ....\"). The majority's claim that \"if it is unfair to charge fees only for shipment by rail, it is equally unfair to charge fees only for shipment by truck,\" Maj. Op. at 769, is baseless. Trucks have historically been a significant source of hazardous waste spills in California; as the majority acknowledges, \"during the period between 2005 and 2015 in California 92% of the costs associated with hazardous materials spills arose out of trucking accidents.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maj. Op. at 767. So long as California imposes a fee on truck shipments of hazardous waste that is commensurate with the danger posed by such shipments (rather than including any extra amounts needed to address potential future occurrences of railroad spills), such a fee would not be unfair to truckers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   California can recover the costs of addressing the rare railroad spill through litigation and settlement, as it did in the 1991 Dunsmuir derailment identified by the majority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Moreover, the STB's jurisdiction applies only to \"rates,\" not to fees that are not rates. If, for instance, a state followed the lead of the federal government and required shippers transporting hazardous materials to file a registration statement and pay \"a fee necessary to pay for the costs\" of processing that statement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205108\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), a court could reasonably conclude that such a charge was not part of the price for shipping hazardous materials by rail and therefore was not a rate. Maj. Op. at 761.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Similarly, the STB's jurisdiction applies to rail carriers, or entities \"acting under the auspices of a rail carrier,\" not to noncarriers.\n   <em>\n    See., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Valero Ref.

Accordingly, the railroads have suggested that if the state collected a\n   charge from the shippers directly (instead of requiring the railroads to do so, as in this case) the charge would not be subject to STB jurisdiction and would not qualify as a rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a charge is not a rate, the state may impose it under HMTA so long as it is fair, and ICCTA would have no bearing on these fees. But once a state tries to impose a fee that is actually a railroad rate, it is categorically preempted by ICCTA and falls within the STB's exclusive jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Stated succinctly, the majority offers no plausible basis for its conclusion that some railroad rates are not subject to the STB's exclusive jurisdiction, when federal law dictates that all state and federal regulation of railroad rates is preempted by ICCTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The majority's conclusion that HMTA's fee provision supersedes the STB's exclusive jurisdiction is wrong for another reason: HMTA can be read so that it does not conflict with ICCTA at all. Instead of applying the rules for harmonizing apparently conflicting federal statutes, the majority makes the bare assertion that \"the ICCTA and the HMTA are easily harmonized by reading \u00a7 5125(f)(1) of the HMTA to protect from preemption the fees specifically authorized in that section.\" Maj. Op. at 762. Obviously, this does not harmonize the statutes, it merely chooses HMTA over ICCTA. In other words, the majority purports to harmonize the two federal statutes by ruling that HMTA's fee provision supersedes ICCTA's exclusive regulation of railroad rates, and therefore that states can impose fair fees, even when they conflict with the STB's exclusive jurisdiction. This would require altering ICCTA's language to read that the STB's exclusive jurisdiction over railroad \"rates\" does not cover fair fees imposed on the transportation of hazardous materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   HMTA's fee provision can be given effect without reading it as an authorization or altering its language. When the fee provision was first enacted in 1990, it read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   A State or political subdivision thereof or Indian tribe\n   <em>\n    may not\n   </em>\n   levy any fee in connection with the transportation of hazardous materials\n   <em>\n    that is not equitable\n   </em>\n   and not used for purposes related to the transportation of hazardous materials, including enforcement and the planning, development, and maintenance of a capability for emergency response.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990, Pub.

In support of this latter interpretation, the majority notes that \"[t]he syntactical structure of \u00a7 5125(f)(1) -a person or entity 'may' perform some act 'only if' some criterion is satisfied-is used repeatedly and consistently in the HMTA\" as an authorization. Maj. Op. at 763. But we are not reading this statutory language in isolation; rather, we must read it in light of Congress's statement that the 1994 revisions were not intended to make a substantive change from the original wording-that a state \"may not levy any fee ... that is not equitable.\" Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990, Pub.

Op. at 764-65, 769-70. The majority excerpts language stating that the fee provision of a predecessor bill to HMTA \"would provide that a non-Federal governmental entity\n   <em>\n    may levy ... fees\n   </em>\n   , but would require that ... such ...\n   <em>\n    fees be reasonable\n   </em>\n   [.]\" H.R. Rep.

The context of the report, however, indicates that the legislators understood the proposed bill to be permissive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Nothing in this section of the report suggests that H.R. 3520 granted states authority to impose fees that it did not already have. As noted above, \"state governments do not need [federal] authorization to act,\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fed'n of Indep.Bus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p535\">\n    567 U.S. at 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p535\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and this section of the report focuses on states' lawmaking power,\n   <em>\n    notwithstanding\n   </em>\n   the HMTA. It discusses, for instance, the procedure whereby a state could apply to the federal government for a determination of whether its law was preempted, and disclaims any intent to \"pre-approve State and local requirements before such requirements obtain the force of law.\" H.R. Rep. No. 101-444, pt. 1, at 49. In other words, the report supports the reading that legislators recognized that states retained the power to impose fees, but limited that authority by ensuring any fee is fair.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In short, HMTA does not evince a clear intent to supersede ICCTA. Because we must give effect to both ICCTA and\n   HMTA if possible, and because there is a reading of HMTA that retains its effect of allowing state fees only when fair, we are bound to interpret the provision that way. The majority errs in holding otherwise and creating an unnecessary conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The majority does not provide a single plausible basis for its claim that \u00a7 5125(f) supercedes ICCTA and could save a state law regulating railroad rates from preemption.

As these examples indicate, a federal law's preemption of state regulation of common carriers generally does not extend to state regulation of noncarriers.

But because it provides that a state \"\n    <em>\n     may not\n    </em>\n    levy any fee in connection with the transportation of hazardous materials that is not equitable,\" Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990, Pub.

In\n    <em>\n     Tinicum\n    </em>\n    , the Third Circuit reasoned that similar text in the Anti-Head Tax Act (AHTA) was not an authorization, but a limitation.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062151\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/482/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062151\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/482/\">\n     at 488-89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

To the extent\n    <em>\n     Tinicum\n    </em>\n    bears on the interpretative question presented here, it supports reading HMTA as a limitation rather than an authorization. Like in\n    <em>\n     Tinicum\n    </em>\n    , there is an undisputed meaning of an earlier version of the statute upon which \"we must 'primarily' rely in interpreting the language.\" Maj.

Maj. Op. at 765-66 (discussing H.R. Rep. No. 101-444, pt. 1, at 53-54). This section of the bill was intended to overturn judicial rulings interpreting provisions of the Federal Railroad Safety Act (FRSA) to preclude states from adopting any laws relating to the transportation of hazardous materials based on FRSA's preemption provision.
