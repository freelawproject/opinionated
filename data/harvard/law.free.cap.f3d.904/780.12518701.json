For this reason, the Supreme Court has long held that the Eighth Amendment forbids the application of force by officers against an inmate \"for the very purpose of causing harm,\"\n   <em>\n    Whitley v. Albers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202378\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/312/#p320\">\n    475 U.S. 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320-21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202378\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/312/#p320\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202378\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/312/#p320\">\n    89 L.Ed.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986), without regard to the officers' emotional enjoyment. A correctional officer who slams an unresisting inmate's head into a concrete floor until he bleeds is therefore no less liable for excessive force if he does so dispassionately than if he does so with pleasure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Notwithstanding these well-established principles, the district court instructed the jury that in order for Sean Hoard to prevail on his excessive force claim under the Eighth Amendment, he had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his alleged abuser \"ha[d] or deriv[ed] pleasure from extreme cruelty\" while beating him. This instruction saddled Hoard with the unnecessary and exceedingly difficult burden of proving that the officer was not just cruel, but sadistic as well. Unsurprisingly, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We hold that excessive force under the Eighth Amendment does not require proof that an officer enjoyed or otherwise derived pleasure from his or her use of force. The district court's instructions to the contrary were plainly erroneous. Moreover, these erroneous instructions prejudiced Hoard. Given the circumstances of this case, we conclude that our intervention is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice. We therefore vacate the district court's judgment and remand for a new trial. We also vacate the district court's sua sponte grant of summary judgment to the Defendants on Hoard's deprivation-of-property claim for lack of adequate notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the morning of December 21, 2012, Hoard requested a razor for personal use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time, he was confined to a cell in the Intensive Management Unit (\"IMU\") at the Snake River Correctional Institution, a prison located in eastern Oregon. The IMU is a maximum custody unit reserved for inmates who have previously exhibited violent behavior or who otherwise present serious management concerns. Inmates confined in the IMU are subject to significant restrictions. They are not permitted to keep their razors in their cells and must request them from the correctional officer on duty. They spend 23 hours a day in their cells and may leave only for showers, recreational activity, and medical attention. Before exiting their cells, IMU inmates must be handcuffed through a cuff port. At least two correctional officers are required to escort IMU inmates to their destination at all times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Ortega, the correctional officer on duty that morning, granted Hoard's request and issued him a razor pursuant to IMU policies. The parties dispute whether Officer Ortega provided Hoard with a functioning razor. Regardless, it is undisputed that Hoard smashed the razor into pieces out of frustration, flushing the smaller fragments down the toilet and sweeping the larger ones into the trash can. Unable to retrieve the razor during his return trip to Hoard's cell in the afternoon, Officer Ortega enlisted the assistance of Sergeant Brown and Officer Saldivar to conduct a search of Hoard's cell for the missing razor pieces. The parties agree that Hoard initially complied with the search and submitted to the restraints without difficulty. Hoard was cuffed and left outside his cell, during which time he was \"compliant,\" \"quiet,\" and behaving \"fine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   From this point on, however, the parties' narratives sharply diverge. Hoard testified at trial that while waiting for the other officers to complete their search, he saw Officer Hartman walk towards him with a threatening grin on his face. This was particularly concerning to Hoard, who believed that Officer Hartman bore a grudge against him based on their prior interactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this version of events, Hoard's sense of foreboding proved prescient. He testified that while the other officers were preoccupied with searching his cell, Officer Hartman grabbed him by the collar and started to yank and jerk him around, making it difficult for Hoard to breathe. When Hoard asked Officer Hartman to stop, Officer Hartman allegedly responded that this was what Hoard deserved and threatened that \"this is going to hurt.\" Hoard then called out to Officer Saldivar, who came out of the cell to assess the situation. According to Hoard, Officer Saldivar asked Officer Hartman to loosen his grip on Hoard's collar and to stop provoking Hoard. Satisfied that Officer Hartman was following his instructions, Officer Saldivar turned away and headed back towards the cell to resume his search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Officer Hartman allegedly grabbed Hoard by the back of his head and slammed his face against a steel door. Hoard testified that he lost consciousness and that when he came to a short while later, he felt blood dripping down his face and off his nose. He also realized that his pants and underwear had been pulled down to his ankles, leaving him exposed in front of the officers and other inmates. Hoard testified that although the other three officers were present and watching, none of them offered him any help or explanation for what happened. Hoard curled himself into a fetal position on the ground, but to no avail. Declaring that \"this\" was what Hoard deserved, Officer Hartman allegedly proceeded to slam Hoard's face into the concrete floor, scraping his bleeding cut\n   across the drain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   By this point, Sergeant Brown and Officer Ortega had left the unit to retrieve leg restraints for Hoard. Officer Saldivar remained but did not intervene. Hoard explained at trial that he tried to remain \"limp\" throughout the alleged abuse, because he was scared that any movement on his part would exacerbate the situation and result in the use of additional force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The officers' recollection of the incident presents a different story. In this version of events, Hoard grew increasingly agitated while waiting for the search to finish and began to \"thrash[ ] his head back and forth\" as the other inmates taunted him from inside their cells. Officer Hartman testified that he ordered Hoard to remain calm and then \"placed\" Hoard against the cell door. Officer Saldivar testified that he briefly stepped outside of Hoard's cell to tell Hoard to \"relax,\" but that he returned to the cell after Officer Hartman told him to go back to the search. After overhearing Hoard demand that Officer Hartman let him go, Officer Saldivar moved to assist Officer Hartman with restraining Hoard. Officer Saldivar testified that he grabbed and swept Hoard's legs and that the movement pulled Hoard's pants and underwear down, leaving Hoard exposed. Hoard allegedly then asked the officers, \"Is this all you got?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Officer Hartman testified that together with Officer Saldivar, he \"plac[ed]\" Hoard on the floor and used only \"minimal\" force to restrain Hoard. Officer Hartman also testified that he never saw Hoard's pants pulled down to his ankles and that Hoard never lost consciousness. The officers eventually put leg irons on Hoard's ankles because he was allegedly kicking his legs and thrashing his head back and forth while on the ground. Neither Officer Hartman nor Officer Ortega recalled seeing any injuries on Hoard either during or after the incident, but a body spill response report prepared afterwards described \"blood on [the] floor\" in front of Hoard's cell. The altercation was not video recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hoard was moved to intake, where a nurse cleaned the blood from his face, rinsed his cut, and applied glue and a butterfly bandage to his laceration. A few days after the incident, Hoard attempted suicide by overdosing on pills. He testified that his suicide attempt was fueled in part by the embarrassment and humiliation he felt at having his pants and underwear ripped down in front of the other inmates, some of whom he \"considered predators.\" As for physical injuries, in addition to the cut on his face-which left a scar on his head-Hoard suffered continuous pain on the right side of his face and in particular, his right jaw, for which he was eventually prescribed painkillers. Hoard was also prescribed a mouth guard for the pain and placed on a liquid diet for a short period of time. At Hoard's request, he was moved from a liquid diet to a soft diet, which lasted under a month. The injury did not fully heal: three years later, Hoard testified that he could not fully open his mouth without popping his jaw and that his jaw would hurt if he talked for too long.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the altercation, Captain Robert Real prepared an \"unusual incident report\" based on each of the four officers' memos.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This report, like the officers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   memos, failed to mention the injuries to Hoard's jaw, the officers' use of leg restraints, or the fact that Hoard had been left exposed from the waist down while on the prison floor. Although Captain Real testified at trial that he thought that the use of force had been appropriate and necessary, a preliminary review of the unusual incident report recommended that the incident be investigated under full review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The preliminary review expressed concern that the officers' memos \"lack[ed] detail\" and \"[did] not mention the injury to inmate Hoard.\" The review also included a handwritten note stating that \"[a] camera should have been used to video the event as a planned use of force.\" Contrary to the preliminary review's recommendation, however, no full review ever took place because the Inspector General deemed it unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hoard filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint alleging various constitutional and state law violations against the Defendants on December 9, 2013. The district court granted Hoard's motion to file a first amended complaint, and the Defendants moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because Hoard was unrepresented, the district court-adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation-liberally construed Hoard's complaint as raising four types of claims: a section 1983 claim against Snake River Correctional Institution's superintendent, Mark Nooth, and grievance coordinator, James Taylor, for violating Hoard's Fourteenth Amendment right to due process; a section 1983 excessive force and deliberate indifference claim under the Eighth Amendment against Nooth, Officers Hartman, Ortega, Saldivar, and Sergeant Brown; supplemental state common law claims against all Defendants; and state constitutional claims against Hartman and Taylor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Nooth and Taylor on all claims. With respect to Taylor, the court concluded that although Hoard alleged in his complaint that he had been deprived of his property from December 21, 2012 to January 10, 2013, his failure to detail exactly what property he was deprived of meant that there was no genuine issue of material fact supporting his allegations that he had been deprived of a constitutionally-protected property interest. The district court denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment and qualified immunity on the remaining excessive force and deliberate indifference claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court set the case for trial and appointed pro bono counsel to represent Hoard. The trial lasted two days. At the conclusion of the evidence, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law for Sergeant Brown and Officer Ortega. Hoard's excessive force claim against Officer Hartman and his deliberate indifference claim against Officer Saldivar went to the jury. Pursuant to the parties' jointly proposed jury instructions, the district court instructed the jury that to succeed\n   on his excessive force claim, Hoard had to prove that Officer Hartman \"used excessive and unnecessary force against the plaintiff under all the circumstances,\" that Officer Hartman had \"acted maliciously and sadistically for the purpose of causing harm,\" and that Officer Hartman's acts harmed Hoard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Midway through the jury's deliberations, which ultimately lasted eight hours, four of the jurors sent a signed note asking the district court to \"provide a definition for maliciously and for sadistically as it pertains to this case.\" Inexplicably, counsel for Hoard agreed that the court should respond with the \"ordinary dictionary meaning of the terms 'malicious' and sadistic.' \" The district court therefore responded to the jurors' question with a supplemental instruction explaining that \"[t]he term 'maliciously' in the instructions has its ordinary meaning, which is 'having or showing a desire to cause harm to another.' Likewise, the term 'sadistically' has its ordinary meaning, which in this context means 'having or deriving pleasure from extreme cruelty.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After receiving the supplemental instruction, the jury returned a verdict finding that Hoard had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Officer Hartman used excessive force. Because the jury did not find that Officer Hartman used excessive force, Hoard necessarily failed to prove that Officer Saldivar was deliberately indifferent to the use of excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This, however, did not mark the end of the trial. Following the jury's verdict, the district court asked if any of the jurors had anything they wished to say. In response, one of the jurors expressed to the court his or her discomfort with the \"incomplete\" nature of the officers' reports and remarked that this concern was shared by all of the jurors. The juror was particularly troubled by the fact that some of the reports omitted any mention of Hoard's injuries, which made it \"difficult\" for the juror to believe that the jurors \"had all the information.\" Another juror expressed \"concern[ ] that the situation was not a good one for anybody\" and that there were \"things that need[ed] to be addressed in this kind of ... incarceration situation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nonetheless, in accordance with the verdict, the district court entered judgment in favor of the Defendants. Hoard timely appealed and we appointed pro bono counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We review the district court's supplemental jury instructions for plain error because counsel for Hoard failed to object to the district court's proposed definition for \"sadistically\" at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.B. v.

We may exercise our discretion to correct a district court on plain error review when the following factors are met: (1) the district court erred; (2) the error was obvious or plain; (3) the error affected substantial rights; and (4) the error \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    C.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266546,4266588\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1005/\">\n    769 F.3d at 1018-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Fonseca v.

We may also take into consideration \"the costs of correcting an error, and-in borderline cases-the effect that a verdict may have on nonparties,\" although these considerations are by no means dispositive as to whether we will exercise our discretion to correct forfeited errors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We conclude that the district court's supplemental instructions to the jury were plainly erroneous.

We have therefore concluded that a district court's erroneous instruction adding an unnecessary element to a plaintiff's burden of proof is not harmless when \"it is impossible to determine from the jury's verdict and evidentiary record that the jury would have reached the same result had it been properly instructed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 782-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Here, not only is it impossible to determine that the jury would have reached the same result, there are signs that the jury might very well have returned a different verdict had they received the correct instructions on excessive force. Four of the jurors paused halfway through an eight-hour deliberation to request instructions specifically on the meaning of \"maliciously and sadistically\" acting to cause harm. Rather than instruct the jury that these terms possessed no unique meaning outside of the specific intent to cause harm, the district court informed the jury that they had to find Officer Hartman derived pleasure from extreme cruelty. Following another four hours of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Officers Hartman and Saldivar, but not without considerable difficulty. Post-verdict, one of the jurors expressed to the court his or her concern that the reports prepared by the officers were \"incomplete\" and that the jury therefore did not possess \"all of the information\" before returning a verdict. It is entirely possible that one of the information gaps that so troubled this juror (and potentially others) included the lack of evidence as to whether Officer Hartman derived pleasure from harming Hoard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because the district court's instruction went to the heart of Hoard's excessive force claim and improperly added to his burden of proof, we conclude that Hoard was prejudiced by the district court's erroneous instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Rare is the case where the district court's errors are so grave as to \"seriously impair[ ] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    C.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266546,4266588\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1005/\">\n    769 F.3d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Fonseca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3268969\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/13/#p36\">\n    451 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   36 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teixeira v.
