A number of Birmingham high school students who were sprayed with or exposed to Freeze +P in 2009, 2010, and 2011 filed a civil rights lawsuit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the Birmingham Board of Education; A.C. Roper, the Chief of the BPD; and the SROs who used the spray against them or in their vicinity. Asserting individual and class-based claims, they alleged that the SROs used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment by spraying them and by failing to adequately decontaminate them. They also claimed that the constitutional violations were the result of a policy or custom of the Birmingham Police Department. They requested damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a 12-day bench trial, the district court issued a comprehensive 120-page order on September 30, 2015, with detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.W. v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262044\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/143/1118/\">\n    143 F.Supp.3d 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ala. 2015). As summarized below, the district court granted the students relief on most of their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With respect to the individual claims, the district court found in favor of two students, K.B. and B.J., on their excessive force allegations against the SROs who sprayed them with Freeze +P, and awarded each of them $5,000 in damages. Because those rulings have not been appealed, we do not discuss or address the use of Freeze +P on any of the students except to discuss the availability of class-based declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court also found in favor of six students-G.S., B.D., T.L.P., T.A.P., K.B., and B.J.-and against the SROs who failed to adequately decontaminate them after the use of Freeze +P, and awarded each of them $5,000 in damages. The SROs found liable on the decontamination claims now appeal, arguing that they are entitled to qualified immunity on the students' Fourth Amendment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the class claims, the district court concluded that the Fourth Amendment violations occurred pursuant to a policy or custom of the BPD, and ruled that declaratory and injunctive relief was warranted. Rather than issue a permanent injunction, however, the court ordered the parties to meet and confer to devise a training and procedure plan to improve the policies related to the use of chemical spray in Birmingham schools. In so doing, the court set out a number of \"general practices\" (which we detail later) to guide the parties in their formulation of the plan. The parties complied with the court's order and submitted a proposed plan (with some disagreements) in December of 2015. As of today, the court has not entered a final judgment or permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Chief Roper appeals the rulings on the class claims. He contends that these claims should have been dismissed for lack of standing, that they alternatively fail on the merits, that the district court should have decertified the class, and that the court's mandatory injunction (the \"general practices\" provided to the parties for the formulation of the proposed training and procedure plan) is contrary to the principles of federal-state comity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It has taken us a long time following oral argument to go through the record in this complex case, including the lengthy trial transcript and documentary evidence, to evaluate and analyze the parties' competing arguments. Having completed our review, we commend the district court for its thorough work and analysis in this difficult case. We conclude that the September\n   30 order is final and appealable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   pursuant to our decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court ruled on September 30, 2015, that the plaintiffs, as a class, were entitled to injunctive relief on their spraying and decontamination claims. But it declined to issue an injunction at that time, and directed the parties to \"meet and confer, engage in fruitful discussions and compromise, and develop and jointly submit\" a single training and procedure plan with respect to the use of pepper spray.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 282 at 118. On the issue of spraying, the court stated that the plan had to \"address the current deficiencies and form a template for [SROs'] use of Freeze +P going forward.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118-19. The court also provided a number of \"general practices\" to guide the parties in their drafting of the decontamination aspect of the plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) unless doing so would endanger the student, officer, or bystanders, after an [SRO] sprays a student with Freeze +P and has secured the student, the officer must provide the student with an opportunity to decontaminate with water, either in the form of a shower, washing at a sink, or using an eye wash station; (2) because of the lingering exposure from contaminated clothing, at all times, Chief Roper must maintain at each school where the B.P.D. allows [SROs] to spray students with Freeze +P a sufficient number (as agreed by the parties) of sweat suits in varying sizes, and must allow the student to change out of his or her contaminated clothes; (3) the [SRO] must then place the student in front of a fan; (4) Chief Roper must ensure that [SROs] have available sealable plastic and/or garbage bags that an affected student can use to store her contaminated clothing; and (5) Chief Roper must replace each sweat suit a student uses so that the total number available at the start of each week is always the same as the initial number agreed on by the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119-20. Finally, \"because of Freeze +P's impact on nearby students and to generally educate students about its effects,\" the court also directed the parties to \"jointly draft,\" by the same date, \"a one-page flyer that is to be posted prominently on each high school's central bulletin boards or to be disseminated electronically to each enrolled student that, among other things, outlines the effects of Freeze +P and the suggested methods to use to obtain relief in the event a student is exposed to Freeze +P.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court indicated that it would issue an order and judgment after November 15, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120. The court later extended the deadline to December 15, 2015, which is when the parties submitted their joint plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 295; D.E. 309. The court has not entered a final judgment or issued an injunction. And, as far as we can tell, the record does not show that the parties have drafted or posted the flyer ordered by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Given the lack of a final judgment or permanent injunction, the first question we\n   confront is jurisdictional. Is the district court's order of September 30, 2015, appealable as a \"final\" order under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or as an injunction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ?

The court also ruled that class-based injunctive relief was warranted as to the students' spraying and decontamination claims. Although it declined to issue permanent injunctive relief, the court ordered the parties to meet, confer, and submit a proposed training and procedure plan that would remedy the constitutional problems identified in its order. Significantly, the court listed a series of \"general practices\" (quoted earlier) to guide the parties in formulating the decontamination aspect of the plan. For example, the SROs have to provide each student they spray \"with an opportunity to decontaminate with water, either in the form of a shower, washing at a sink, or using an eye wash station.\" D.E. 282 at 119.

For a couple of reasons, however, we do not believe that\n   <em>\n    Danley\n   </em>\n   provided fair and clear notice to the SROs that their decontamination efforts (or lack thereof) violated the students' Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The first reason is legal in nature.\n   <em>\n    Danley\n   </em>\n   did not set out the minimum decontamination procedures that the Constitution requires an officer to pursue or provide for all persons in custody (including those in a school setting) after the use of chemical spray.

King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911971,12458997\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/452/\">\n    563 U.S. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911971,12458997\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/452/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911971,12458997\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/452/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), the students here, beyond alleging that the SROs' decontamination efforts were constitutionally lacking, have not attempted to explain why the additional steps that they want taken are a Fourth Amendment requirement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellees' Br. at 46 (referring only to the \"right to be free from the excessive force of [an officer's] fail[ure] to decontaminate\"). And, as we explain below, the record developed at trial shows that the paramedics who examined the students chose not to administer any treatment and in two cases told the students not to wash with water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The second reason why\n   <em>\n    Danley\n   </em>\n   does not provide adequate notice is more factual than legal. The students here, after being sprayed with Freeze +P, felt like their faces, eyes, and noses were burning, and they experienced trouble breathing.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.E. 282 at 31-32. But, as the students recognize,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellees' Br. at 43, what happened to Mr. Danley is more severe than what they experienced after being subjected to Freeze +P, and the conduct of the SROs here is different than what the officers in\n   <em>\n    Danley\n   </em>\n   were alleged to have done. On this record, those differences matter for purposes of qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hadley v. Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048307\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/1324/#p1332\">\n    526 F.3d 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1332 (11th Cir. 2008) (\"For a right to be 'clearly established,' previous case law must have developed it in a concrete factual context so as to make it obvious to a reasonable government actor that his actions violate federal law.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Starting with SRO Nevitt and T.L.P., the Freeze +P hit T.L.P. in the mouth and caused her to cough, but did not affect her eyes, her nose, or her breathing. SRO Nevitt took T.L.P. to the assistant principal's office, which had air conditioning, and called the paramedics. At the office T.L.P. was not in pain,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.E. 304 at 161, and when they arrived, the paramedics asked her a few questions but did not provide any treatment. SRO Nevitt then transported T.L.P. to family court. Given the limited impact of Freeze +P on T.L.P., her lack of pain at the office, and the paramedics' decision not to provide treatment, SRO Nevitt would not have been placed on notice by\n   <em>\n    Danley\n   </em>\n   that his conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As for the remaining SROs, we agree with the district court that they did not give the students an opportunity to wash or shower-as indicated (or at the very least suggested) by Aerko International's safety data sheet and as permitted by the BPD's rules and regulations-and did not provide them with clothes that were uncontaminated. And, like the district court, we are troubled by the fact that some of these SROs (SRO Smith/K.B., SRO Henderson/B.D., SRO Benson/B.J.) drove the students away from school with the windows of their police cars rolled up, thereby denying them an additional source of air which could have helped speed up the decontamination process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Nevertheless, we conclude that SROs Clark, Henderson, Smith, Benson and Tarrant are entitled to qualified immunity. First, as we understand the record, the students were exposed to fresh air or air conditioning in an office or in the school building after the spraying.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 282 at 8 &amp; D.E. 296 at 148 (G.S.); D.E. 282 at 13 (B.D.); D.E. 296 at 110 (K.B.); D.E. 298 at 184 (T.A.P.); D.E. 282 at 20 (B.J.). Second, the students were seen shortly afterwards by paramedics. In each and every case, these independent medical professionals who evaluated the students chose not to provide them with any treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 282 at 8 (G.S.), 13 (B.D.), 16 (K.B.), 22 (T.A.P.); D.E. 305 at 156 (B.J.). Indeed, in a couple of cases, the paramedics told the students that putting water on their faces would make their burning symptoms worse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 282 at 8 (G.S.), 16-17 (K.B.). On this record, the SROs were entitled to rely, at least in part, on the independent medical judgment of the paramedics, and their failure to use all of the decontamination options listed in Aerko International's materials and/or in the BPD's training materials did not make any Fourth Amendment violation apparent.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Threadgill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11247584\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/1254/#p1259\">\n    221 F.3d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1259 (11th Cir. 2000) (explaining, in a Fourteenth Amendment case involving the alleged denial of medical care to a pretrial detainee, that \"failure to follow procedures does not, by itself, rise to the level of deliberate indifference because doing so is at most a form of negligence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The district court, we think, understandably determined that the SROs did not engage in best practices, and that they could have done more for the students in their decontamination efforts. But assuming\n   that their failure to go further violated the Fourth Amendment, the rights of the students to be decontaminated to the degree demanded were not clearly established under the circumstances presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Alternatively, the students argue that the SROs' conduct was \"so far beyond the hazy border between excessive and acceptable force\" that they had to have known that they were violating the Constitution even in the absence of \"fact-specific case law.\"\n   <em>\n    Vinyard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306147\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/311/1340/#p1350\">\n    311 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1355 &amp; n.18. Although we empathize with the students, two of whom vomited after being sprayed with Freeze +P, we are not persuaded by their argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The students' complaint is that the SROs did not do enough to decontaminate them. Again, we agree with them, and with the district court, that the SROs did not do all that they could have done. They did not, for example, provide the students with access to water to wash or shower. But it is not fair to characterize the SROs' conduct as the complete failure to take any decontamination action at all. The SROs provided the students with some fresh air or air conditioning following the use of Freeze +P, and the students were seen by paramedics who chose not to administer treatment (and who on two occasions told the students not to put water on their faces). For purposes of qualified immunity, it is not insignificant that the methods used by the SROs-passage of time, exposure to fresh air, and evaluation by paramedics-were at least partially consistent with their training and, at least to some degree, with the instructions provided by Aerko International, the manufacturer of Freeze +P. Again, assuming that the SROs fell short of the Fourth Amendment minimum, they were not faced with an \"obvious clarity\" scenario.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Recognizing that cases from other lower federal courts cannot create clearly established law for qualified immunity purposes, we note, as well, that the other chemical spray cases we have found-mostly in the prisoner/denial of medical care context-have arisen in different factual scenarios and do not set out definitive or minimum constitutional standards for the decontamination of those who suffer from exposure. So, even if we could look outside the Eleventh Circuit and the Alabama Supreme Court, the published case law would not have provided the SROs with \"obvious clarity\" about the purported unconstitutionality of their conduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Iko v.

At the time of trial the eight high schools in Birmingham served approximately 7,000 to 8,000 students a year, and there were a total of only 16 SROs stationed in all eight high schools.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 298 at 160-61; D.E. 299 at 186; D.E. 303 at 221. The use-of-force reports and other evidence indicated that from 2006 to 2014 SROs used chemical spray approximately 110 times, impacting roughly 199 students, out of an estimated total of 70,676 students enrolled during that eight-year timespan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 282 at 31; DE 298 at 160-61. So during that eight-year period the spray was deployed an average of only 1.7 times a year at each school. One of the students' experts testified that a Birmingham student has a 0.4%, or 4 out of a 1000, chance of being intentionally sprayed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 298 at 160-61.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Allegations of intentional chemical spraying that also constitutes excessive force were even more rare. In the eight years from 2006 to 2014, there were only 16 complaints alleging that spraying had constituted excessive force because it was an improper use of Freeze +P.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 83-5 at 9. The record is silent about exactly how many of those actually involved-instead of only were claimed to involve-the improper use of Freeze +P. If we use as a barometer the 11 times that SROs sprayed students with Freeze +P solely for verbal non-compliance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.E. 282 at 115, then out of the 70,676 students there is only a .016%, or 1.6 out of 10,000, chance of being unconstitutionally sprayed. And the probability of being unconstitutionally sprayed may even be smaller than that. Of the six instances that were litigated at trial, the district court concluded that excessive force was used in only two of them: one against K.B. and the other against B.J. (who was not a plaintiff for the class claims).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 282 at 2, 4, 58. Two students out of 70,676 would mean that there is only a .003%, or 3 out of 100,000, chance of being unconstitutionally sprayed. Either way, those miniscule probabilities mean that the likelihood of future injury is far too speculative to support standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We do not suggest that Freeze +P will never be used against a student in an unconstitutional way by any SRO in the future, and we do not minimize the discomfort or pain (however temporary) suffered by students who are sprayed. The record, though, does not show that the probability of future instances of unconstitutional spraying is sufficient to provide standing to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    31 Foster Children\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9132484\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/1255/\">\n    329 F.3d at 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   illustrates, future injury that depends on either the random or unauthorized acts of a third party is too speculative to satisfy standing requirements.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The district court concluded that standing for injunctive relief existed in part due to the involuntary nature of the students' position.

The probability that a student will be decontaminated (properly or improperly) hinges\n   on the likelihood of being sprayed or exposed to the spray; if a student is not sprayed or otherwise exposed to the spray, then there will be no need for decontamination. The record indicates that a total of 70,676 students were enrolled in the eight Birmingham high schools during the eight-year time span between 2006 and 2014. And out of those 70,676 students, 1,250 of them were exposed to the spray-intentionally or unintentionally-during that time period. Even if we assume that every one of those 1,250 students was improperly decontaminated-unlikely as that seems-there is still only a 1.77% chance (1,250 \u00f7 70,676) that a given student would be exposed to spray and improperly decontaminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   A 1.77% chance is not enough under\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   . To state the same thing from a different direction, a 1.77% chance of being improperly decontaminated means there is a 98.23% chance of not being improperly decontaminated (because not sprayed at all).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the odds of being improperly decontaminated depend not only on the acts of the misbehaving students that lead to the spraying, but on the intentional acts of the SROs (spraying students and then improperly decontaminating them). And because the 1.77% figure also encompasses students who are inadvertently exposed to the spray when an officer intentionally sprays another student, it also depends to some extent on the random act of being in the vicinity of a misbehaving student who is the target of the spraying. \"As\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   illustrates, future injury that depends on either the random or unauthorized acts of a third party is too speculative to satisfy standing requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    31 Foster Children\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9132484\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/1255/\">\n    329 F.3d at 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Our dissenting colleague contends that we are improperly framing the standing inquiry as a quantitative one rather than a qualitative one, and that if we properly framed it as qualitative one the 1.77% figure is somehow not unlikely enough to defeat K.B.'s standing argument.

And we also know that SROs will continue to use Freeze +P on students, which means that SROs will necessarily have to engage in decontamination efforts that will presumably be dictated by the BPD's protocol. It is therefore inevitable that, absent an injunction, SROs will continue to decontaminate students in an allegedly unconstitutional manner. The inadequate and allegedly unconstitutional decontamination protocol is akin to an unconstitutional policy that requires police officers to apply a chokehold to all citizens that they encounter.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles v.

I am not convinced. Although tempting, it is unsound to reduce the \"substantial likelihood\" requirement for seeking injunctive relief to a purely quantitative (i.e., mathematical) analysis.

But regardless of how a student has behaved, or whether an SRO has properly\n   chosen to spray a student, decontamination of some kind will be necessary after Freeze +P is used, and SROs will resort to and follow the BPD's allegedly unconstitutional protocol.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/\">\n    461 U.S. at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a plaintiff could seek an injunction against police misconduct where the government \"ordered or authorized police officers\" to enforce an unconstitutional policy);\n   <em>\n    Kenny v.
