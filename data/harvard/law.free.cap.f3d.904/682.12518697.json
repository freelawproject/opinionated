Before his 2016 conviction for unlawful re-entry, Defendant had previously been ordered removed in 2008, based on a prior conviction for California domestic violence battery,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20243\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1), in an\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   proceeding. The government contends that Defendant lost his status as a legal permanent resident as a result of the 2008 removal. Defendant was again removed in 2011 in an expedited removal proceeding. For the reasons stated below, we hold that both the 2008 and 2011 removal orders were fundamentally unfair, and that neither can serve as a predicate removal for purposes of \u00a7 1326.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant argues that both his 2008 and 2011 removal orders were unlawful, and that there is no predicate offense for a conviction under \u00a7 1326.

To succeed in a collateral attack, a defendant must show exhaustion, deprivation of judicial review, and that the entry of the removal order was fundamentally unfair.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ochoa was ordered removed in absentia in 2008, but did not receive notice of either his in absentia removal hearing or of his ability to file a motion to reopen such proceedings. He has therefore satisfied the exhaustion and deprivation of judicial review requirements. At the time of Defendant's 2008 hearing before the immigration judge, our circuit precedent had established that California battery was not a categorical crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    Ortega-Mendez v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3086799\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1010/#p1017\">\n    450 F.3d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1017 (9th Cir. 2006). It was error to remove Defendant for a crime of domestic violence under Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 237(a)(2)(E)(i) based on his California\n   battery conviction. The 2008\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   removal cannot properly serve as a predicate for a conviction for illegal re-entry.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-23\">\n   The 2011 removal order also cannot serve as a predicate for unlawful re-entry. An alien who had been removed through expedited removal proceedings automatically satisfies the requirements for exhaustion and deprivation of judicial review.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292325\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1195/#p1202\">\n    771 F.3d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1202 (9th Cir. 2014). In the context of reinstatements of prior erroneous removal orders, we have held that \"limiting review to the procedural requirements for reinstatement without regard to the soundness of the underlying removal proceeding implicates due process concerns by effectively foreclosing all opportunity for 'meaningful' review of the underlying removal,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Arias-Ordonez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220101\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/972/#p980\">\n    597 F.3d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 980 (9th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-24\">\n   The 2011 removal at issue here was an expedited proceeding, not a reinstatement, but the same due process concerns apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Kwong Hai Chew v.

The 2008 removal order was legally erroneous, Defendant did not have a meaningful opportunity to contest the order, and he was not told of available avenues for relief. These due process defects in the erroneous 2008 removal proceeding infect the 2011 removal. A person should not be stripped of the important legal entitlements that come with lawful permanent resident status through a legally erroneous decision that he or she had no meaningful opportunity to contest. Among those protections is that lawful permanent residents cannot be removed on an expedited basis.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20235.3\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(ii). This means that the 2011 expedited removal order was also fundamentally unfair because it violated the process due to lawful permanent residents.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-25\">\n   The government cites footnote 3 in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Aguilera-Rios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055068\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/1105/\">\n    754 F.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2014) to support its conclusion that even an invalid removal order is a final order that strips a person of the legal protections afforded to lawful permanent residents.\n   <em>\n    Aguilera-Rios\n   </em>\n   did not address the issue here-whether an erroneous\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   removal order strips a person of those protections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-26\">\n   The government contends that even if Defendant should have been treated as a lawful permanent resident in 2011, he was not prejudiced because he was an aggravated felon, who could have been removed anyway, and who would have been denied discretionary relief, including withdrawal of his application for admission. We reject the government's contention for a fundamental reason. Because Defendant retained the protections afforded to lawful permanent residents, he was not removable as charged in the 2011 proceedings-he was removed for presenting invalid entry documents. But if he was still a lawful permanent resident, then his entry documents were not invalid. And even if the\n   government might have been able to remove him on other grounds through a formal removal proceeding, his removal on illegitimate grounds is enough to show prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    United States v. Camacho-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3089087\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/928/#p930\">\n    450 F.3d 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 930 (9th Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is commonplace in the law that unconstitutional actions by the government will have some reasonable consequence for further proceedings that viewed in isolation otherwise conform to procedural requirements. That is why as a defense to a \u00a7 1326 prosecution for illegal re-entry, a person charged with that crime is entitled to make a collateral attack with a premise that the prior removal was invalid because it was fundamentally unfair and offended due process.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The important legal protections of lawful permanent resident status do not hang on the whims of government officials, they stand on the much more secure footing of lawful due process.
