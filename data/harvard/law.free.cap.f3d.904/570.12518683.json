Czech argued on direct appeal that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the felony murder instruction that was submitted to the jury in conjunction with a general verdict. The Illinois Appellate Court determined that the felony murder instruction violated Illinois law, but concluded the error was harmless. The Supreme Court of Illinois declined further review. After an unsuccessful motion for post-conviction relief on other grounds, Czech sought federal collateral relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court denied relief, reasoning that, although the conviction violated clearly established federal law, the error did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the jury's verdict. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 24, 1999, fourteen-year-old Alonzo Zuniga was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting in Chicago by members of the Maniac Latin Disciples (MLD) directed at the Latin Kings, a rival gang. By all accounts, Zuniga was an innocent bystander not affiliated with either gang. In the course of their investigation, Chicago police quickly learned that the shooter was thirteen-year-old Marquis Falls. Though too young to be a full member of the MLD, Falls was considered a \"pee-wee\" member and had been assigned the task of holding a .357 revolver for the gang. The driver of the car was eighteen-year-old MLD member Roberto Mejia. Other occupants included Mejia's girlfriend, fifteen-year-old Nancy Malaves, and Czech, who was then twenty years old and also a member of the MLD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on evidence that he had planned the \"drive-by\" and directed Falls to shoot at the rival gang members, Czech was charged with first-degree murder and aggravated discharge of a firearm on the theory that he was legally responsible for Falls' actions. At trial, the court instructed the jury on four ways in which it could find Czech guilty of first-degree murder. One of the options, felony murder, required that the victim be killed during the commission of another felony, in this case, the crime of aggravated discharge of a firearm. The jury returned a general verdict, finding Czech guilty of first-degree murder and aggravated discharge of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the meantime, after Czech was convicted but before his appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    People v. Morgan\n   </em>\n   that aggravated discharge of a firearm could not serve as the predicate felony of a felony murder conviction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"259041\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/197/404/\">\n    197 Ill.2d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20Ill.%20Dec.%20405\">\n    259 Ill.Dec. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=758%20N.E.2d%20813\">\n    758 N.E.2d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court noted that if every death caused by the aggravated discharge of a firearm could be charged as felony murder, \"[t]he result could be to effectively eliminate the second degree murder statute and also to eliminate the need for the State to prove an intentional or knowing killing in most murder cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=758%20N.E.2d%20813\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20Ill.%20Dec.%20405\">\n    259 Ill.Dec. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=758%20N.E.2d%20813\">\n    758 N.E.2d at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). To avoid this result, the Court concluded that \"where the acts constituting [the underlying felony] arise from and are inherent in the act of murder itself, those acts cannot serve as predicate felonies for a charge of felony murder.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In other words, the aggravated discharge of a firearm could not serve as the underlying felony in a felony murder conviction if it did not have an independent felonious purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On direct appeal, Czech argued that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to object to the jury instruction on felony murder. Czech claimed that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could find him guilty of first-degree murder based on a felony murder theory in light of\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   . The Illinois Court of Appeals agreed that the instruction was improper under Illinois law because the acts establishing the crime of aggravated discharge of a firearm arose from and are inherent in the act of murder. It nevertheless found the error to be harmless, explaining that under Illinois law the court must presume that the jury convicted Czech of the most serious crime charged, intentional or knowing murder. The court also concluded that \"[b]ased on the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt in the record, it is not reasonably likely that, but for this error, the decision reached would have been different.\" Supplemental Appendix (SA) 19-20. Because the error was harmless, the court concluded Czech's ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Czech then filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for habeas corpus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , challenging his murder conviction. As relevant here, Czech argued that the inclusion of the felony murder instruction violated his due process rights. The district court appointed counsel and found that the general verdict conviction violated clearly established federal law because it contained an improper method of conviction. The court nevertheless concluded that Czech was not entitled to relief. It reasoned that the error did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the jury because the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming. The district court thereupon denied Czech's petition in its entirety but granted Czech a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the inclusion of the improper felony murder instruction resulted in harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review the district court's denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

Pursuant to the statute, habeas relief cannot be granted for persons in custody pursuant to a judgment of a state court unless the adjudication of the claim: \"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this case, Czech contends that, because the felony murder instruction was invalid as a matter of state law, its inclusion in the general verdict returned by the jury violated his right to due process. The issue, then, is whether a jury instruction that departs from state law necessarily violates the Constitution. We have been down this road before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Falconer v.

Reddick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5550970\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/123/184/\">\n    123 Ill.2d 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Ill.%20Dec.%201\">\n    122 Ill.Dec. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20N.E.2d%20141\">\n    526 N.E.2d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). In\n   <em>\n    Reddick\n   </em>\n   , the Illinois Supreme Court held that, under Illinois law, it was \"grave error\" for a court to give murder and voluntary manslaughter instructions without warning the jury that to return a verdict of murder, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the \"manslaughter defenses\" are without merit. In considering Falconer's petition for federal habeas relief, this court found the jury instruction error redressable under the Constitution as a violation of the defendant's due process right. We explained that when the Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions for murder and voluntary manslaughter were given together, the jury may have been left with the false impression that it could convict the petitioner of murder even if she possessed a mitigating mental state described in the voluntary manslaughter instruction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1807255\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/905/1129/\">\n    905 F.2d at 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Explicit misdirection on this scale,\" we held, \"violates the constitutional guarantee of due process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1807255\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/905/1129/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1807255\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/905/1129/\">\n    at 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gilmore v.

The trial court's order denying that motion was finally affirmed by the Appellate Court on March 26, 2013, and again the Illinois Supreme Court denied review.

Falls estimated that he fired five shots, and as they sped away, Czech was shouting \"D love, King Killer, stuff like that.\" SA 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Malaves, who was fifteen-years-old at the time of the shooting, corroborated much of Falls' account. Malaves testified that Mejia, who was her boyfriend at the time, planned to take her to a movie that evening with Czech and his girlfriend. The plan changed, however, when they picked up Czech in Mejia's car. Upon entering the car, Czech told Mejia they were going to \"cruise by the Kings.\" SA 70. But first, Czech told Mejia they had to pick up Falls. After they picked up Falls, Mejia was directed to the alley where Falls retrieved the gun. When Falls got back into the car, Czech directed Mejia to drive to Monticello and Drake, where the Kings were gathered. Malaves testified that as they drove by the Kings, Czech rolled down his window, made King gang signs and yelled \"King love,\" in an apparent attempt to lull them into a false sense of security. SA 73-77. They then went around the block and Malaves climbed into the back seat and changed places with Falls. As they approached the gathering of Kings again, Czech told Malaves to cover her ears because she was about to hear a loud noise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Malaves testified that she ducked down on the floor and heard gunshots and Czech screaming \"King Killer\" and \"Maniac love.\" SA 79-80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although Czech argues that Malaves' testimony does not fully support Falls' account, we find no significant inconsistencies from our review of the transcript. Malaves was unable to recount all of what Czech said to Falls while they drove to where the shooting occurred, but she explained that this was in part because she was not paying attention and also because Czech and Falls were in the back seat and the car radio was playing loudly. SA 105-06. What she did recount supports the conclusion that it was Czech's idea to drive by where the Kings were gathered, Czech knew Falls was going to shoot before the shots were fired, and Czech approved of Falls' actions. Further support was provided by the Chicago Police detective who interviewed Czech and testified that Czech admitted that he told Mejia to drive to the Kings' territory but first had him pick up Falls who retrieved the gun. SA 225-27. According to the detective, Czech also admitted that he shouted \"D Killer\" and \"King Love\" when they drove past the Kings gathering the first time, and then told Falls to switch seats with Malaves before they drove past the Kings the second time because the rear windows did not roll down all the way. He also admitted he told Malaves to cover her ears and keep her head down before Falls fired the gun out the window. Although Czech was less forthcoming in his videotaped interview, the earlier version recounted by the detective provided strong support for Falls' and Malaves' testimony. Viewing the record as a whole, there was ample evidence that Czech directed Falls to shoot at the Kings and intended or, at a minimum, knew there was a strong probability of death or great bodily harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Czech nevertheless argues that the inclusion of the felony murder instruction had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury's verdict because the prosecution emphasized the instruction as part of its theory of the case. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Jensen v. Clements\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341160\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/892/\">\n    800 F.3d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2015), Czech argues that the fact that the prosecution emphasized the felony murder instruction in its closing requires the conclusion that the error was prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   involved a letter written by the defendant's wife before her death accusing him of her murder. There was no dispute that the admission of the letter at trial violated the defendant's confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment. The sole issue before us was whether the admission of the letter was prejudicial. In holding that it was, we noted that the \"letter from the grave\" had played a key role in the case from the outset, the prosecution had emphasized in its closing, and the evidence was \"all circumstantial and subject to more than one interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341160\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/892/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341160\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/892/\">\n    at 905-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We thus concluded that the admission of the letter had a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, we are not dealing with a powerful piece of incriminating evidence that formed the centerpiece of the prosecution's case, but one of four separate theories of liability. We do not agree that the prosecution's primary theory at trial was that Czech was guilty of first-degree murder under the felony murder instruction or that the instruction was the center of the prosecution's case as the letter was in\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   . The prosecution predominately urged the jury to convict on a theory of knowing or intentional murder. After analyzing how the State had met the elements of this theory, the prosecution explained that felony murder was a final option the jury could consider if the jury was \"inclined to give [Czech] the benefit of any conceivable doubt.\" SA 317. The mere fact that the\n   prosecution offered felony murder as a fallback argument does not mean the evidence establishing guilt under the alternative theories was lacking. In any event, under\n   <em>\n    Brecht\n   </em>\n   , it is the strength of the evidence as a whole, and not the closing argument of the prosecution, that determines whether the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   From our review of the evidence as a whole, we conclude that a properly instructed jury would have arrived at the same verdict. We cannot say that the inclusion of the felony murder theory in the general verdict \"had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict\" or resulted in actual prejudice to Czech.\n   <em>\n    Brecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6235767\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/619/#p623\">\n    507 U.S. at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6235767\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/619/#p623\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We thus conclude that the error, assuming it was of constitutional magnitude, was harmless. The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
