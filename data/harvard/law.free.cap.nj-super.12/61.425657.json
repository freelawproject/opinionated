A..D.</author>\n<p id=\"AHU\">The appellant, an attorney and counsellor-at-law, was summarily convicted of a contempt which in substance amounted to subornation of perjury in a divorce suit. Concededly there was perjury; but did Elsie Zimmerman, the petitioner, herself concoct it, or did her solicitor, the appellant?</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">In August, 1948, appellant filed the petition for divorce, alleging desertion. The action, which wras not contested, came on for hearing October 31, 1949, when Mrs. Zimmerman and a witness named Merrick testified. The following day, another witness, Thomas Rady, testified. An order of dismissal was entered November 4. The petition for divorce gave Mrs. Zimmerman\u2019s address as 40 Harding Road, in the Borough of Glen Rock, Bergen County. It alleged that she had been a <em>bona fide </em>resident of New Jersey when the cause of action arose and for more than two years next preceding the commencement of the action. She testified that she had lived at the Colgate place on Blue Mill Road, Morristown, until June, 1948, when she moved to Glen Rock. Merrick testified that he resided on Blue Mill Road at the time of the hearing and had lived there since 1941, except for two years wdien he was in military service; that Mrs. Zimmerman was his nearest neighbor when she lived there. Actually, Mrs. Zimmerman dwelt at Morristown onty until 1943 when she moved to Long Island, where she has lived ever since. She never lived at Glen Rock. Merrick has never lived in New Jersey; he had been acquainted with Mrs. Zimmerman only since she moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>to Long Island. Sucli was the fraudulent attempt to bring Mrs. Zimmerman\u2019s suit within the jurisdiction of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"Acg\">In March, 1950, Mrs. Zimmerman, Merrick and Eady were accused of contempt of court consisting of perjury. The first two pleaded guilty, while Eady was tried and convicted. Mrs. Zimmerman then accused her solicitor, the appellant, of inventing the falsehoods which she and Merrick uttered, and the proceeding against appellant was thereupon instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The contempt charge was tried before an advisory master, the same one who heard the divorce case, and thus is presented the first ground urged for reversal, namely, that the advisory master was without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">As Vice-Chancellor Berry pointed out in the <em>Caruba </em>case, 139 N. <em>J. Eq. </em>404, at 421 <em>(Ch. </em>1947); affirmed, 140 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>563 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947), a master, acting within the scope of the reference to him, is for all practical purpose the court itself. He added that the special master in the suit then under discussion, \u201ccould not, of course, have summarily committed the defendant for his confessed perjury, but only because such action was outside the reference which limited his power and there was no general reference under which he could act.\u201d There was, however, a general reference to advisory masters of applications to punish for contempt for disobedience of orders in matrimonial causes and to punish for criminal contempt. <em>Chancery Hule </em>128(e). By virtue of this rule, which was first promulgated in 1933 and broadened in 1936, advisory masters heard criminal contempt charges which grew out of matrimonial causes and advised the Chancellor what order or decree should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The Constitution adopted by the people in 1947, directed that the advisory masters who had been appointed to hear matrimonial proceedings, shall \u201ccontinue so to do as Advisory Masters to the Chancery Division of the Superior Court, unless otherwise provided by law.\u201d <em>Art. XI, </em>\u00a7 4, <em>par. </em>6. 'Following this constitutional provision, our present <em>Rule </em>3 :87 \u2014 4 requires matrimonial actions to be heard by a judge of the Chancery Division or by an advisory master assigned thereto. Counsel for appellant points out that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Constitution and the Rule direct only that the advisory masters hear matrimonial matters and are silent on the subject of contempt. Of course, a criminal contempt prosecution is separate from the cause in which the contempt is committed. The parties may be \u2014 and in the present instance are \u2014 different. A criminal contempt is a public wrong; it is a misdemeanor. <em>Staley v. So. Jersey Really Co., </em>83 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>300 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1914). It may be prosecuted on indictment like other crimes. <em>In re Kerrigan, </em>33 <em>N. J. L. </em>344 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1869). When prosecuted in a summary manner in the court against which the contumacious conduct was directed, it was formerly considered that the matter must be entitled as a separate cause. <em>Passaic Athenia Bus Co. v. Consolidated Bus Lines, </em>100 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>185 <em>(Ch. </em>1926); <em>Dorrian v. Davis, </em>105 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>147 <em>(Ch. </em>1929). But the original cause and the criminal one are generally intertwined. Indeed, the contemptuous acts may be such that they may be dealt with either as a criminal or a civil contempt. <em>Beatty v. Wunschel, </em>122 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>286 <em>(Ch. </em>1937). Our present rules provide that a contempt, whether criminal or civil, \u201cshall be prosecuted in the action in which it occurs.\u201d <em>Rule </em>3 :80 \u2014 2. In our opinion, the prosecution for contempt is a part of the matrimonial cause in which the contempt is committed, within the meaning of <em>Art. XI, </em>\u00a7 4, <em>par. </em>6 of the Constitution and <em>Rule </em>3:8 7 \u2014 4, although in most other aspects the two are independent actions. The advisory master to whom is assigned a matrimonial cause, has the same jurisdiction and authority in contempt matters that advisoiy masters were accustomed to exercise prior to September 15, 1948, that is, he may conduct the trial and advise the order or judgment that ought to be made in a criminal contempt which occurs in the matrimonial action, except as prohibited by paragraphs (d) and (e) of <em>Rule </em>3:80 \u2014 2. And the order or judgment so advised becomes the order of the Superior Court when signed by a judge of the court. That was the procedure followed in the present instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">It is next urged that there was error in the admission of evidence. Mrs. Zimmerman and Merrick each made a state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>meat under oath, or affidavit, in the county jail on March 15, 1950. The order to show cause which initiated the contempt proceeding was supported by these affidavits and a copy o\u00ed them Avas served on appellant with the show cause order. When the contempt Avas tried, the Zimmerman woman and Merrick testified for the State. In the course of cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel asked the prosecutor for the original sworn statements, received the documents, and used them on the cross-examination. At the conclusion of the examination of these witnesses, the State offered the statements in evidence and they were received over the objection of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The State seeks to sustain the receipt of the statements on the ground that they were produced upon appellant\u2019s demand, and that in the course of the cross-examination parts of the statements were put before the court for the purpose of contradicting these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">It has been considered to be the rule that if a party call on his adversary for the production of a paper and examine it, he cannot object to its being put in evidence if it be in any way material to the issues. \u201cThe reason for this rule is that it would give an unconscionable advantage to a party to enable him to pry into the affairs of his adversary without, at the same time, subjecting him to the risk of making whatever he inspects evidence for both parties.\u201d <em>Ellison v. Cruser, </em>40 <em>N. J. L. </em>444 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1878); <em>Decker v. Smith, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>630 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1915). Eor cases from other states, see 151 <em>A. L. R., Annotation, </em>at 1006. Eor vigorous criticism of the rule, see <em>Wigmore on </em>Evidence, \u00a7 2125. The spirit of our new court rules relating to discovery seems to run counter to the old practice outlined in the cases we have cited, so much so that Are would hesitate to say whether or not those cases state Avliat is still the laAV. The affidavits or statements in question Avhieh A\\rero in question and answer form were, as Are haA'e mentioned, the foundation for the proceeding against the appellant. They were papers in the case in the same sense as are the affidavits which form the basis for an order for an interlocutory injunction. A cop3f had been served on appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>lant at the outset. All he called for was the signed originals. He did not pry into the State\u2019s case. The rule on which counsel for the State first relies is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"> It is also a rule of the law of evidence that when an oral or written statement of a witness is used on cross-examination for the purpose of contradicting the witness, and in this manner parts of the statement are put in evidence, then the remainder of the statement which concerns the same subject and which is explanatory of the part used in the cross-examination, becomes evidential. <em>Wigmore </em>\u2014 Evidence, \u00a7 2113. The rule which has been followed in New Jersey is probably broader than indicated above, so that all of the statement upon the same subject is admissible, whether or not it is explanatory of the part used in the cross-examination. <em>State v. Cohen, </em>97 <em>N. J. L. 5 (Sup. Ct. </em>1921). And when the statement is written, practical considerations generally permit the whole document to be put in. <em>Iverson v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>280 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1940). The trial court necessarily has considerable leeway or discretion in a matter of this sort. In the present instance, appellant did not suggest that any particular parts of the statements were not properly admissible, but objected to the statements <em>in loto. </em>We find no error or .impropriety in their admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We need hardly add that such statements or <em>ex parte </em>affidavits, are not evidential of any of the happenings mentioned therein. They could properly be used only to enable the court to determine whether taken as a whole they contradicted the testimony of the affiants, given in court in the proceeding against appellant, or otherwise weakened the credibility of such testimony. <em>Afronti v. U. S., </em>145 <em>F. </em>2d 3 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The last reason for reversal presented by appellant is that the evidence does not warrant conviction. And this requires brief consideration of the nature and scope of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">A conviction of criminal contempt is not reviewable by an appellate tribunal in the absence of statute, except for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Seastream v. N. J. Exhibition Co., </em>72 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>377 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1907). The Legislature in 1884 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>passed an enactment, later embodied in <em>B. 8. 2 </em>:lo \u2014 3 to 6, giving an appeal to a person found guilty of contempt by a law court inferior to the Supreme Court. Section <em>2 </em>:15 \u2014 3 declared that the conviction should be reviewable \u201cboth upon the law and the facts,\u201d while section <em>2 </em>:15-5 required that \u201cthe facts shall be inquired into and ascertained\u201d upon the appeal \u201cby depositions or otherwise as the court shall direct, and the court shall give such judgment in the premises as it shall deem to be lawful and just under all the circumstances of the case, which judgment shall be enforced as the court shall order.\u201d Two years ago the Legislature revised the statute, made it applicable to a summary conviction by the Law or Chancery Division, a County Court or any inferior court. The direction that the facts should be ascertained \u201cby depositions or otherwise as the court shall direct,\u201d was deleted but the other provisions quoted above were retained unchanged. <em>P. L. </em>1948, c. 333, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and <em>2. </em>The appeal under the 1884 statute was a trial <em>de novo </em>upon evidence presented in the higher court. <em>Attorney General v. Verdon, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>494 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1917). Under the present statute, we think the review is still a trial <em>de novo, </em>but the omission of the requirement for an inquiry \u201cby depositions or otherwise,\u201d indicates a legislative intention that the facts shall be determined by a review of the evidence already taken, at least where the accused had a full opportunity to present his side of the case, and a stenographic transcript is available. Our function is not merely to affirm or to reverse and remand for a new trial, but to find the appellant guilty or not guilty, and if we find him guilty, to impose such punishment as the law permits and seems to' us just. This extraordinary review is given doubtless because in the court of first instance the same judicial officer directs the contempt proceeding to be initiated, appoints the prosecutor, tries the facts, imposes the penalty and may also be unconsciously influenced by the circumstance that he presides over the court against which the alleged contempt was aimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We start with the presumption that appellant is innocent, and we must acquit him unless a carefuly study of the evidence produces in our minds \u201can abiding conviction to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>moral certainty of the truth of the charge.\u201d <em>In re United Hatters, </em>110 N. <em>J. Eq. 42 (E. &amp; A. </em>1931); <em>State v. Linker, </em>94 <em>N. J. L. </em>411 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Each of the witnesses for the State had either pleaded guilty or been convicted of a contempt which was in substance willful perjury. While they were not thereby disqualified from testifying against appellant <em>(State v. Wendel, </em>96 N. J. <em>L. </em>495 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1921)), the weight to be given their testimony was seriously impaired. Put against that the obvious interest that appellant had in denying the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">When Mrs. Zimmerman, in August, 1948, first called on appellant at his law office, she had no previous acquaintance with him and was not introduced by a third person. She consulted a New Jersey attorney because she was aware that adultery was the only basis for a divorce in New York, while in New Jersey a divorce could be obtained for desertion. She knew that in order to get a divorce, the law required her to be a resident of the state in which she sued. Yet the first time she called upon appellant, she says she frankly told him that she lived in Bellerose, Long Island, and \u201cHe said you have to be a resident, but he would take care of it. * * * He\u2019d give me an address.\u201d So he drew the petition for divorce and inserted in it the statement that she resided at 40 Harding Road in the Borough of Glen Rock and County of Bergen. She testified that he \u201cgave me Glen Rock. I don\u2019t know where Glen Rock is to this day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Merrick had been acquainted with Mrs. Zimmerman four or five years, and had called on her at her home on Long Island. She asked him to testify in her behalf. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any more idea of what I was going to testify to except that I was going to be a witness. * * * All I knew was Mrs. Zimmerman had required witnesses.\u201d So she took him to appellant\u2019s office where appellant gave him his instructions. But Merrick\u2019s testimony is so incoherent, and the passages in his testimony which inculpate appellant are so at variance with the sworn statement made by him in jail, that very little weight, if any, can be given to his evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Although Kady was a witness for the State, his testimony supported the defense. At least it shows that appellant did not teaeli him what liis evidence in the divorce case should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Appellant testified in full denial of tbe charge. On the record before ns, he had a very good reputation before the present accusation was brought against him. He has been a member of the bar since 1918, and has served as recorder and as city attorney of the municipality in which he has resided all his life. What was Ms interest in the matter that such a man should concoct perjury and jeopardize everything that ho must hold dear ? He was paid a retainer of $100 at the outset, another $100 just before the hearing, and expected a final $150 at the completion of the divorce ease. The money seems an inadequate motive. But assuming for the moment that appellant procured the perjured testimony, he must have anticipated, after Ms years at the bar and extensive practice in divorce matters, that there would bo some questioning of Mrs. Zimmerman and Merrick by the court. Vet he gave them no preparation for even the simplest questions. And it taxes our credulity to believe that appellant, the first time ho saw Mrs. Zimmerman, when he knew nothing of her, told her unreservedly that he would participate actively in her fraudulent design. \u201cHe\u2019d give me an address.\u201d If appellant is a knave, he is still more a fool.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">We realize the weaknesses in appellant\u2019s case, such as the odd fact that during the 15-months\u2019 period Mrs. Zimmerman\u2019s case was ponding, he never communicated with her by mail; the curious tone of the letter he wrote her immediately after the hearing; the puzzle of the color of the ink with which she signed sundry papers. Yet, after a full consideration of these circumstances and of tbe entire case, we do not find that the evidence establishes the guilt of appellant. We will enter judgment of acquittal. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
