The Circuit Court for Howard County affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. We defer to the Board\u2019s expertise and discretion, as did the court below, and affirm the denial of Stidwell\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">On her April 2000 application for certification to practice massage therapy, Stidwell supplied biographical information, her professional training history, and a list of references. Pursuant to question \u201cd\u201d on the form, she also admitted to having been convicted on January 8, 1999, of solicitation for prostitution in Washington D.C. <em>See </em>D.C.Code (2001) \u00a7 22-2701.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The Board examined Stidwell\u2019s application, in line with subtitle 3 of the Maryland Code (1981, 2000 Repl.Vol.), Health Occupations Article. In particular, section 3-5A-09(a)(4) allows the Board to deny an application from one who has been \u201cconvicted of or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or to a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d On June 12, 2000, the Board informed Stidwell that it had denied her application because solicitation was a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Three months later, on September 8, 2000, the Board amended its decision of denial to include Stidwell\u2019s violation of section 3-5A-05(b)(l), which states that, to qualify for certification, the applicant must be \u201cof good moral character.\u201d Thus, the Board provided an alternative, though similar, ground for denial that evaded the common law expression \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Stidwell appeared for a hearing before the Board, to no avail. She then petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Howard County, which affirmed the conclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the Board that solicitation was a crime of moral turpitude, but did not address the alternative ground upon which Stidwell\u2019s application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The Board falls within the purview of the Administrative Procedure Act, which subjects its decisions to the substantial evidence standard of review. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl. Vol.), State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-222. That means we will uphold the Board\u2019s factual conclusions if \u201ca reasoning mind reasonably could have reached\u201d them. <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 68, 729 A.2d 376 (1999) (citations omitted). We also afford \u201ca degree of deference\u201d to the Board\u2019s legal conclusions, upon the premise that \u201cthe expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 729 A.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Given our deferential review, it seems to us the Board reasonably concluded that the fresh conviction belied a \u201cgood moral character.\u201d That conclusion rendered Stidwell unqualified for certification, pursuant to section 3-5A-05(b)(l), and, accordingly, the Board denied her application. We recognize that the Board added the \u201cgood moral character\u201d ground for dismissal after the \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude\u201d ground, but Stidwell has not alleged, nor do we find, that that fact is fatal to the Board\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Having upheld the Board\u2019s decision on the \u201cgood moral character\u201d criteria, we nevertheless tackle the heady question of whether solicitation is indeed a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See McNeil v. State, </em>356 Md. 396, 423-25, 739 A.2d 80 (1999) (Raker, J., concurring) (commenting on prostitution\u2019s complex history and sociology). The parties devote much of their briefs to the subject of moral turpitude, and we believe it worthwhile to emphasize that the phrase is chamaeleon-like, adopting different shades of meaning in different legal contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The expression \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d developed at common law. <em>See Matthews v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 282, 295-97, 511 A.2d 548 (1986) (discussing early definitions of moral turpitude). The tautological phrase describes a category of offenses, known as infamous crimes, that precluded their perpetrators from testifying. <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 362-63, 535 A.2d 445 (1988); <em>Bd. of Dental Exam\u2019rs v. Lazzell, </em>172 Md. 314, 320, 191 A. 240 (1937). Thus, \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d itself does not refer to any distinct set of crimes. <em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 363, 535 A.2d 445. The infamous crimes, however, were treason, felony, perjury, forgery, and other <em>crimen falsi </em>offenses, \u201cwhich impressed upon their perpetrator such a moral taint that to permit [the perpetrator] to testify in legal proceedings would injuriously affect the public administration of justice.\u201d <em>Garitee v. Bond, </em>102 Md. 379, 383, 62 A. 631 (1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In 1864, Maryland abrogated, by statute, the disqualification rule for convicts of infamous crimes, while simultaneously providing for the impeachment of such persons with the admission of their convictions at trial. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>340 Md. 705, 712, 668 A.2d 8 (1995); <em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 359, 535 A.2d 445. For more than one hundred years, Maryland continued to treat infamous crimes differently from other offenses for purposes of impeachment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is not to say, however, that only infamous crimes, as understood at common law, were used to attack credibility. Rather, non-infamous crimes, i.e., \u201clesser crimes,\u201d became tools of impeachment at the court\u2019s discretion, depending on whether they \u201creflectfed] on one\u2019s tendency to be truthful,\u201d were recent enough to be relevant, and were more probative than prejudicial. <em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 363, 535 A.2d 445; <em>Carter v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 686, 692, 566 A.2d 131 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>In <em>Carter, </em>80 Md.App. at 693, 566 A.2d 131, this Court held that a conviction for the non-infamous crime of drug manufacturing touched upon the witness\u2019s veracity and was admissible for impeachment. On the other hand, in <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 713-14, 436 A.2d 906 (1981), the non-infamous crime of indecent exposure was held not to correlate with truthfulness, so as to permit its introduction for impeachment. Likewise, in <em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 365, 535 A.2d 445, the use of non-infamous crimes of solicitation and prostitution were precluded for impeachment purposes. <em>See also Matthews v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 282, 300, 511 A.2d 548 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Stidwell would benefit if our analysis ended with these criminal cases, particularly <em>Prout </em>and <em>Matthews. </em>Her conviction, however, surfaced in the field of administrative law, where \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d has evolved from its common law trappings into an even more fluid descriptive tool. Indeed, while Maryland\u2019s administrative and regulatory statutes repeatedly use the phrase \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d that use is variable and inconsistent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our review of theses statutory provisions reveals that, whereas for trials, the expression \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d speaks primarily to truthfulness, for the business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>professional licensing and public appointments, the expression strikes the broader chord of public confidence in the administration of government. That is, a person who has credibility to testify may not have the public\u2019s confidence to practice certain professions or to serve on a governmental board.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The best examples of this interplay are <em>Lazzell, </em>172 Md. 314, 191 A. 240, and <em>Ricketts, </em>291 Md. 701, 436 A.2d 906. In <em>Lazzell, </em>the Court of Appeals upheld an administrative board\u2019s decision to revoke a dentist\u2019s license after he acquired a series of convictions for indecent exposure. The Court reviewed various applications of \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d in the civil context, and concluded that the dentist\u2019s conduct met the standard of turpitude, being \u201cbase, vile, and shameful.\u201d <em>Lazzell, </em>at 321, 191 A. 240. Fifty years later, in <em>Ricketts, </em>the Court did not repeat that conclusion while reviewing the same offense in the context of a criminal trial. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">The first and most fundamental distinction we note between <em>Lazzell </em>and the case at bar is that the Court in <em>Lazzell </em>was assessing the propriety of a licensing board\u2019s determinations whereas here we are concerned with the cross-examination of a defendant in a criminal trial. In <em>Lazzell </em>the question was whether a dentist had violated the ethical standards of his profession. In the case <em>sub judice </em>the question is whether the conviction was relevant to an assessment of credibility of a criminal defendant. Therefore, the light under which the conviction is examined, as well as the effect it would produce on the examiners is drastically different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-7\"><em>Ricketts, </em>291 Md. at 712, 436 A.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Accordingly, the holdings of <em>Prout </em>and <em>Matthews </em>offer Stidwell little refuge. She may be qualified to give testimony, or to be certified in another profession, but in the particularly intimate setting of a massage parlor, her prurient offense casts an unsavory, even menacing, shadow.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-5\">. Since 1992, with the advent of Maryland Rule 1-502, now Rule 5-609, evidence of either an infamous crime or a lesser crime can be admitted only upon a court\u2019s determination that its probative value outweighs \"the danger of unfair prejudice.\" <em>See Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 619 A.2d 105 (1993) (discussing the change in law from <em>Prout </em>to Maryland Rule 1-502).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">.
