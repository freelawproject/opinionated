Quarles convicted Robert Davis, appellant, of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. The State\u2019s evidence, seized from appellant\u2019s residence during the execution of a search warrant issued by the Honorable Kathleen M. Sweeney of the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City, was sufficient to prove him guilty of that offense. Appellant does not argue to the contrary. He does argue, however, that the State\u2019s evidence was acquired in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to protection from unreasonable searches, and he presents a single question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">Whether the trial court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress all evidence during the execution of the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant issued in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cno\u201d to this question and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Prior to trial, appellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence on the grounds that (1) the no-knock provision in the search warrant was invalid,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) the search warrant lacked probable cause. Judge Quarles denied that motion in an oral opinion that included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvY\">Okay. Pending ... are the motions of the defendants for suppression of evidence. The motion is based on the contention that the warrant executed in this case lacked probable cause, and that the entry to effect that warrant was unconstitutional because it was a no-knock entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">The warrant was issued on February 4 of the year 2000 by a district court judge. The warrant itself contains a section detailing the experience of the affiants, Police Officer Christopher O\u2019Ree and Police Officer Jonathan Brickas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>And the warrant, as I said, contains their experience, which includes several hundred arrests for narcotics violation, in excess of seventy warrants done, and further details training in undercover and uniform capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The warrant recites the information received from a confidential source relating to marijuana sales in the 5100 block of Park Heights Avenue. The source details knowledge of persons known to it as \u201cMeatball\u201d and \u201cBiggie\u201d who are, respectively, defendants Robert Davis and Damont Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">It is alleged in the warrant that they maintained an apartment at 4011 Boreman Avenue on the second floor, where they stored marijuana. And it is also alleged that a black two-door Nissan Sentra is used for the transport of such marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The police, in the affidavit, recite their knowledge of the 5100 Block of Park Heights Avenue as an area known to them and others for its high level of marijuana sales. The officers recite their observations of the defendants in the 5100 block of Park Heights Avenue. The defendant\u2019s admission that they had operated a black Nissan Sentra, which the affiants also observed in the driveway of the\u2014 observed the defendants drive away in the Nissan.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The confidential source also provided information with respect to the interior of the Boreman Avenue address, which information was verified by the affiants. The confidential informant, who is discussed in the affidavit\u2014the information relating to the reliability of that informant is detailed. And that reliability includes the seizure of substantial amounts of narcotics and firearms and cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The affiants, relying on their experience and training, state their belief that they are likely to encounter firearms in the Boreman Avenue address and request permission for a no-knock entry, which permission was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">A probable cause involves the determination of sufficient facts to show an interconnectedness between a crime, a criminal act, and a location. The warrant sufficiently de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>scribes the connection between the defendants and the location and the allegations of marijuana dealing, and thus meets the rudiments of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Somewhat more vexing is the consideration whether the warrant itself provides say a sufficient basis for a no-knock entry. The cases, which have been discussed by the defense, and reviewed by the Court, largely involve situations in which law enforcement officers were confronted with situations which post entry were determined either to rise to level of exigency permitting no-knock entry or failed to meet that standard, and thus requires suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">No cases were found in which the issue presented was, in this context, in which there was pre-raid approval for a no-knock entry on a set of facts which essentially recite the officer\u2019s general and specific experience in law enforcement, from which they extrapolate the need, as they see it, for a no-knock entry. It is, of course, well-settled in search and seizure law that the issuing judge is permitted to rely upon the experience of law enforcement officers and the conclusions which reasonably flow from that experience in making the probable cause determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">I see no reason to depart from that pattern when the examination is not the presence or absence of probable cause, but is instead the existence of exigencies meriting a no-knock entry. It is, in any event, a close question for the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">However, crediting the affiants\u2019 experience which involves hundreds of narcotics arrest, extensive training, and considerable experience in narcotics law enforcement, I cannot conclude that their conclusion with respect to the likeliness of firearms on the property is an irrational one.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Accordingly, I find that the agents, the police officers, acted appropriately in reliance upon the no-knock authority given by the warrant and conclude that the motion to suppress be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Appellant preserved the suppression issue for our review by proceeding on an \u201cagreed statement of facts\u201d dictated into the record by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Standard for Issuing a \u201cNo-Knock\u201d Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Appellant first contends that Judge Quarles failed to apply the proper standard of review to Judge Sweeney\u2019s issuance of the search warrant at issue in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree. From our review of <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 117 S.Ct 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997), we are persuaded that, when the suppression hearing court reviews the issuing judge\u2019s decision to include a no-knock entry provision in the search warrant, the suppression hearing court should uphold that provision as long as the warrant application provided the issuing judge with a substantial basis for concluding that there existed a reasonable suspicion that, under the circumstances in which the warrant was to be executed, the knock and announce requirement would be dangerous to the executing officers or would result in the destruction of the items described in the search warrant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>In <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that, when determining whether to suppress evidence seized by law enforcement officers who executed a search warrant without announcing their authority and purpose,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">... in each case, it is the duty of a court confronted with the question to determine whether the facts and circumstances of the particular entry justified dispensing with the knock- and-announce requirement. In order to justify a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry, the police must have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence. This standard\u2014as opposed to a probable cause requirement\u2014 strikes the appropriate balance between the legitimate law enforcement concerns at issue in the execution of search warrants and the individual privacy interests affected by no-knock entries. This showing is not high, but the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>should be required to make it whenever the reasonableness of a no-knock entry is challenged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><em>Richards, </em>520 U.S. at 394-95, 117 S.Ct. 1416 (1997) (citations omitted). In <em>Richards, </em>although the law enforcement officers did not have no-knock authorization in the search warrant, they proceeded to enter without knocking and announcing based upon observations that they made when they arrived on the scene of the premises to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Subsequent to <em>Richards, </em>this Court has considered two cases in which we were asked to order suppression of evidence seized as a result of no-knock entries: <em>Wynn v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 133, 699 A.2d 512 (1997), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>351 Md. 307, 718 A.2d 588 (1998) and <em>Lee v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 79, 774 A.2d 1183, <em>cert. granted, </em>366 Md. 246, 783 A.2d 221 (2001). In each of those cases, the search warrant did not include a no-knock provision, and the suppression hearing court accepted the testimony of the law enforcement officers who explained why they believed it was necessary to serve the warrant without announcing their purpose and authority. In each case, we applied <em>Richards, </em>affirming the judgment in <em>Wynn, </em>and reversing the judgment in <em>Lee </em>on the ground that \u201c[t]he record is bare of any evidence of exigent circumstances that could possibly eliminate the constitutional necessity to knock and announce.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>139 Md.App. at 91, 774 A.2d 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In <em>Dashiell v. State, </em>143 Md.App. 134, 792 A.2d 1185, No. 1182, September Term, 2001 (2002), we rejected the contention that officers serving a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant had no right to conduct a pre-search pat-down of the persons on the premises when the warrant was served. Although that case did not involve a challenge to the \u201cno-knock\u201d provision in the search warrant, Judge James Eyler explained that \u201cthe nature of drug trafficking\u201d compounded \u201cthe degree of danger present at [the scene of the search],\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">Persons associated with the drug business are prone to 'carrying weapons. <em>See Ybarra [v. Illinois], </em>444 U.S. [85] at 106[, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238] (Rehnquist J., dissenting) (\u201c[F]irearms are as much \u2018tools of the trade\u2019 as are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>most commonly recognized articles of narcotic paraphernalia\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Oates, </em>560 F.2d 45, 62 (C.A.2 1977)); <em>Whiting v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 404, 417, 725 A.2d 623 (1999) (nexus between drugs and guns); <em>Banks v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 582, 591, 581 A.2d 439 (1990) (\u201c[0]ne who is involved in distribution of narcotics, it is thought, <em>a faction, </em>would be more prone to possess, and/or use, firearms, or other weapons, than a person not so involved.\u201d). The connection of guns and drugs exposes officers to greater risks when confronting suspects who deal drugs. <em>See [Michigan v.] Summers, 452 </em>U.S. [692] at 702[, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340] (even where \u201cno special danger to the police [was] suggested by the evidence in this record, the execution of a warrant to search for narcotics is the kind of transaction that may give rise to sudden violence.... The risk of harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.\u201d); <em>People v. Broadie, </em>37 N.Y.2d 100, 112, 371 N.Y.S.2d 471, 332 N.E.2d 338 (N.Y.1975) (\u201cBecause of their illegal occupation, however, drug traffickers do often commit crimes of violence against law enforcement officers\u201d). In the application for the search warrant, affiants stated they were keenly aware through their training and experience \u201cthat individuals in the distribution of controlled dangerous substances ... carry all types of weapons which puts the officers in danger during the execution of search and seizure warrants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">143 Md.App. at 134, 792 A.2d at 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Due to the preference that searches be conducted pursuant to warrants issued by judicial officers, officers who obtain a search warrant have the benefit of (1) the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, (2) a more deferential standard of review by the suppression hearing court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the presumption that the affidavit does establish probable cause for the search. <em>Herbert v. State, </em>136 Md.App. 458, 485-494, 766 A.2d 190 (2001). This preference should be equally applicable to \u201cno-knock\u201d warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">If at the time he or she is applying for a search warrant, a law enforcement officer believes that the circumstances under which the warrant will be executed justify dispensing with the knock and announce requirement, the officer should seek no-knock authorization from the warrant issuing judge. If the judge is satisfied that the request for a no-knock entry is reasonable, the judge should include in the warrant a mandate that, in substantially the following form,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">Good cause being shown therefor, the executing law enforcement officers are authorized to enter the premises to be searched without giving notice of their authority and purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Moreover, when they apply for no-knock authorization in a search warrant, law enforcement officers do not have to include in the affidavit the kind of search scene case-specific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>particularized circumstances of exigency that they would have to establish during the suppression hearing if they did not have a no-knock provision in the warrant and made the no-knock entry determination on their own.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In the case at bar, the affidavit at issue included the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">Based on information provided from an extremely reliable confidential source of the detailed information on \u201cMeatball\u201d and Damont Adams marijuana sales and storage in 4011 Boarman Ave. The corroborated information of the source. Your Affiant believes that \u201cMeatball\u201d and Damont Adams are storing large amounts of marijuana in 4011 Boarman Ave. Your Affiant prays of the issuance of a search and seizure warrant for the address of 4011 Boarman Ave., the vehicle known as a two door Nissan Sentra tag # FXF894, a black male known as \u201cMeatball\u201d and Damont Adams for violations of the Maryland C.D.S. laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">The prior experience of Your Affiant indicates that narcotic/drug dealers/users have, carry and use Firearms to protect their operations. This protection is both from the Police and other drug dealers/users who may try to seize the drugs or moneys gained from the operation. These Firearms include handguns, rifles and shotguns. These weapons allow the drug dealer/user to operate freely and openly, also enabling them to retaliate against anyone they fell [sic] threatened by. The possession of these weapons is an extension of the narcotic operation and/or conspiracy being conducted. Due to the nature of the evidence your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Affiant is seeking to seize in this investigation, specifically Article 27 Section 275-302 of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Your Affiant must gain entry quickly and safely into the dwelling. If entry is stalled or delayed the controlled dangerous substance can easily and quickly be destroyed. Therefore, Your Affiant will attempt to gain entry by the rush or No-Knock forced entry. This will enable the Entry Team to recover the evidence intact and provide members of the entry team with a margin of safety from weapons, which may be on the scene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The affidavit also stated that large amounts of drugs had been seized as a result of information supplied by the source, that several people resided in the dwelling, and that co-defendant Adams had several previous arrests for drug violations. We therefore hold that (1) Judge Sweeney had a substantial basis for concluding that the affidavit established reasonable suspicion to believe that the executing officers needed to gain entry without knocking and announcing, and (2) Judge Quarles applied the correct standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Good Faith Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Assuming arguendo that the affidavit did not establish the need for a no-knock provision in the search warrant, we are persuaded that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies to the entry in this case. Thus far, Maryland courts have only applied the good faith exception to search warrants later deemed to be invalid as lacking probable cause. We are persuaded, however, that the good faith exception is equally applicable to no-knock provisions in search warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Under the good faith exception, \u201cevidence seized under a warrant subsequently determined to be invalid may be admissible if the executing officers acted in objective good faith with reasonable reliance on the warrant.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 467, 701 A.2d 675. \u201cThe exclusionary rule was designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.\u201d <em>West v. State, </em>137 Md. App. 314, 351, 768 A.2d 150, <em>cert. denied, </em>364 Md. 536, 774 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>A.2d 409 (2001)(quoting <em>Connelly v. State, </em>322 Md. 719, 728, 589 A.2d 958 (1991)). The Court of Appeals in <em>McDonald </em>further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">The Supreme Court in <em>Leon </em>did not suggest that evidence obtained under an invalid warrant is always admissible, but cautioned that \u201csuppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant should be ordered only on a case-by-case basis and only in those unusual cases in which exclusion will further the purposes of the exclusionary rule.\u201d The Court held that \u201cin the absence of an allegation that the magistrate abandoned his detached and neutral role, suppression is appropriate only if the officers were dishonest or reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">347 Md. at 468, 701 A.2d 675 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">There are four situations in which the good faith exception does not apply, and the exclusionary rule remains the appropriate remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">(1) if the magistrate, in issuing a warrant, \u201cwas misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for a reckless disregard of the truth,\u201d or (2) \u201cin cases where the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his judicial role ... [so that] no reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant,\u201d or (3) in cases in which an officer would not \u201cmanifest objective good faith in relying on a warrant based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable,\u201d or (4) in cases where \u201ca warrant may be so facially deficient\u2014i.e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized\u2014that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume [the warrant] to be valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 468-469, 701 A.2d 675 [citations omitted].</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Appellant argues that this is a case in which the affiant-officers simply could not have an objective, good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>reliance on the no-knock authorization because no reasonable law enforcement officer would reasonably believe that the information in the affidavit justified excusing the knock and announce requirement. From our review of the affidavit at issue, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Other courts have applied the good faith exception to cases involving the issuing of a no-knock search warrant. <em>See United State v. Tisdale, </em>195 F.3d 70 (2nd Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>999 F.2d 182 (7th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Moland, </em>996 F.2d 259 (10th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>956 F.2d 843 (8th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>164 F.Supp.2d 119 (D.Mass.2001); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>2000 U.S. Dist. Lexis 7997 (D. Maine 2000); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>69 F.Supp.2d 518 (S.D.N.Y.1999); <em>United States v. Tavarez, </em>995 F.Supp. 443 (S.D.N.Y.1998); <em>State v. Van Beek, </em>591 N.W.2d 112 (N.D.1999); <em>State v. Eason, </em>245 Wis.2d 206, 629 N.W.2d 625 (2001). We agree with those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Application of the good faith exception to a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant is entirely consistent with our holdings in <em>Dashiell v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Herbert v. State, supra. </em>Thus, even if we had concluded that Judge Sweeney should not have authorized a no-knock entry in this case, we would not reverse appellant\u2019s conviction. Suppressing evidence under these circumstances would not serve the purpose of the exclusionary rule, which is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish police for the errors of judges and magistrates. When the police officers follow the proper course of conduct by seeking a no-knock search warrant, the good faith exception applies. Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\">. Although the warrant itself did not expressly provide for a no-knock entry, we accept the parties\u2019 agreement that a no-knock provision was included in the warrant because the warrant \u2018\u2018incorporated by reference\u201d the affidavit presented in support of the warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-5\">. The prosecutor provided Judge Quarles with the following agreed upon facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">During the month of February 2000, Officers O\u2019Ree and Brickas of the Northwestern District Drug Enforcement Unit conducted an investigation into Robert Davis, also known as \"Meatball,\u201d and Damont Adams, also known as \"Biggie,\u201d selling marijuana in the 5100 block of Park Heights Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">Information received resulted in the Honorable Judge Sweeney issuing a search and seizure warrant for the black male known as \"Meatball,\u201d Damont Adams, and a black Nissan Sentra, tag number FXF 894, and the address of 4011 Boreman Avenue. The warrant was signed on February 4, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">On February 5, 2000, at approximately 7:40 a.m., armed with a warrant, Officers O\u2019Ree, Brickas, Hyde, Lane, German, Geddes, and Sergeant Oxier, executed the warrant.

Dispensing with the search scene case-specific particularized circumstances of exigency for law enforcement officers seeking no-knock authorization from a judicial officer serves the public interest. It is more beneficial for law enforcement officers to seek no-knock authorization in a search warrant, rather than make their own independent on-the-scene determination of whether to enter without knocking and announcing. If law enforcement officers had to make an identical showing of exigency regardless of whether they received no-knock authorization in the search warrant, there would be no incentive to seek judicial authorization prior to entering without knocking and announcing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
