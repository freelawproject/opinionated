Eight and a half years later, on June 19, 2000, appellant filed a Petition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis (the \u201cPetition\u201d), claiming that his guilty plea was constitutionally defective because, for several reasons, it was not made knowingly and voluntarily. Further, appellant claims that, as a result of his \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d plea, he suffered adverse collateral consequences. In particular, he complains that after he pleaded guilty in the underlying case, he was deemed a repeat offender in a subsequent, unrelated matter, as a result of the conviction at issue here. Consequently, Pitt received an enhanced sentence for the subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Following a hearing on the Petition on March 9, 2001, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County denied the requested relief. Pitt timely noted this appeal and presents a single issue for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">Did the circuit court err when it found that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily, thereby denying appellant\u2019s Petition for Writ of Error Coram No-bis?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">The facts of this case are largely undisputed. As we noted, appellant alleged in the Petition that his guilty plea of January 20, 1992, was not made knowingly and voluntarily. At the time of his guilty plea, appellant was twenty-one years old. During the guilty plea proceedings, the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Pursuant to discussions we have had with Your Honor in chambers, with the State, etc., at this time Mr. Pitt will withdraw his previously entered plea of not guilty to Count Number Two in this indictment, which charges him with <em>possession with intent to distribute cocaine, </em>and enter a plea of guilty to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>In this particular case, Your Honor, it is that <em>after the presentence report is completed and sentencing is set that Mr. Pitt face a 20 year suspended sentence, </em>all except one year, a period of active probation, five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">All other charges in this indictment will be nol-prossed at sentencing....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">[THE COURT]: Do you understand the nature of these charges against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">[THE COURT]: And the factual basis for the plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: If this matter had gone to trial, the State would have proven that on October 23, 1990, at approximately 11:50 p.m., Officer Mammano of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department received information from a confidential source stating the defendant would be in the area of 3400 Branch Avenue, Temple Hills, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, <em>delivering a quantity of cocaine.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">On that day and that given time, the defendant did in fact arrive in that area, and officers observed the description that the confidential source gave. A search revealed the defendant to be in possession of a quantity of crack-cocaine. That substance was field tested, and it did test positive for cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">[THE COURT]: Is that the evidence against your client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Essentially, yes, Your Honor. In fact, the observations were that <em>apparently he had passed a bag to another defendant, </em>and then when the officers came out and the bag was recovered, that bag did have cocaine. Other than that, there was no indication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>[THE COURT]: Mr. Pitt, were you listening as the prosecutor told the Court about the evidence in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">[THE APPELLANT]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">[THE COURT]: Do you agree if your case went to trial that is how the State\u2019s witnesses would testify, what they would say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">[THE APPELLANT]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">[THE COURT]: <em>Has your attorney explained to you the legal definition of possession vnth intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">[APPELLANT]: <em>Yes, ma\u2019am.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">[THE COURT]: And have you talked to [defense counsel] about your case in general?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-13\">[THE COURT]: The Court is satisfied that the guilty plea is knowledgeably, voluntarily and intelligently made, and we will accept it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">Thereafter, the circuit court sentenced appellant to a suspended term of twenty years, and placed him on five years of probation. In 1997, appellant was prosecuted in federal court for an unrelated offense. Following his federal conviction, appellant was sentenced as a repeat offender to an enhanced penalty of twice the mandatory minimum. That sentence prompted appellant\u2019s Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-16\">The court held an evidentiary hearing on the Petition, at which appellant\u2019s attorney argued that Pitt\u2019s guilty plea was involuntary because \u201cthe elements of the crime were never set forth, ... the court never set forth the maximum penalties for the crime.\u201d In addition, Pitt\u2019s lawyer asserted that there was \u201can insufficient factual predicate\u201d for the offense. Although appellant\u2019s attorney conceded that there is no requirement in Maryland obligating the court to distinguish a felony from a misdemeanor at the time a guilty plea is offered, he com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>plained that the crime was \u201cnever defined as a crime versus a misdemeanor.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">The following testimony of appellant was adduced at the hearing on the Petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Can you tell the court what happened that day when you came to court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">[APPELLANT]: Well, basically, I came to court, and when I came to court, he [appellant\u2019s defense attorney] told me to take a plea. If I took a plea there was going to be no jail time. So, you know, I just took the plea, like he told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: What did you plead guilty to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">[APPELLANT]: Possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Why did you think it was possession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">[APPELLANT]: Because that is what he told me it was. He said it was possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And what did you think possession meant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">[APPELLANT]: Just basically, simple possession. At the time I didn\u2019t really know anything but simple possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did you come to learn something different later about what you pleaded guilty to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">[APPELLANT]: Now? Yes. Now, down the line I learned when they used it against me later on that it was a felony instead of what I thought was just simple possession, was a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So what I need to know is what, exactly, to the best of your recollection, did [defense counsel] tell you about the nature of the charge to which you were pleading guilty? If you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>[APPELLANT]: Basically, he didn\u2019t explain really nothing about the nature of the charge. All he explained was just the facts. Just the facts of what had happened, and he said I would be pleading guilty, and there would be no jail time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did at any time [defense counsel] sit you down and tell you what possession with intent to distribute meant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">[APPELLANT]: No. He never told me that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALb\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I am talking about now prior to January 20th, or on January 20,1992?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqS\">[APPELLANT]: No, he never.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">During cross-examination, appellant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC8\">[PROSECUTOR]: At the bottom of the same page, line 24, the court says\u2014starting on line 21, the court says, \u201cMr. Pitt, were you listening as the prosecutor told the court about the evidence in this case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">You say, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">So were you telling the truth at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF-\">[APPELLANT]: That was a long time ago. If the transcript says that, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: So you knew at the time that this plea was entered that the State expected to prove that you had a quantity of cocaine that you were delivering, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">[APPELLANT]: I mean, basically, on that case right there, I was never\u2014the other two defendants, both of their charges were dismissed, and they in actuality had the drugs, and I didn\u2019t think it was anything but possession for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">[PROSECUTOR]: As to when you heard the word \u201cdelivering\u201d here, that didn\u2019t mean anything to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ\">[APPELLANT]: It didn\u2019t stick with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJ\">[PROSECUTOR]: Now, on page six of this transcript, the court says, \u201cHas your attorney explained to you the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>definition of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance?\u201d You replied, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">Now, were you are [sic] telling the truth at that time, Mr. Pitt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">[APPELLANT]: I didn\u2019t know what possession with intent to distribute means until a later time, when they used this against me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Is the answer no, that he didn\u2019t explain this to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">[APPELLANT]: He didn\u2019t explain to me that I was pleading to a felony, and I was pleading to possession with intent to distribute was a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did he explain to you the legal definition of possession with intent to distribute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">[APPELLANT]: No, he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: So what you said to the court here wasn\u2019t true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">[APPELLANT]: I was going on what my attorney said to me; \u201cSay yes to everything, and you will get no jail time,\u201d and that is what I was doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: No further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-13\">[THE COURT]: Mr. Pitt, if I am not mistaken, but assuming you didn\u2019t have any prior record, the guideline sentence would be six months to three years, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It would have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-14\">[THE COURT]: So he got a sentence substantially below the guidelines?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">The court concluded that appellant\u2019s plea was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, and denied appellant\u2019s request for relief. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-17\">Basically, the complaint is that the plea was not freely, voluntarily, and intelligently made, because Mr. Pitt was not aware that it was a felony to be in the possession with intent to distribute. The penalties for the crime were not told on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the record, that the factual basis for the plea was insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">He took the plea, he got burned by the consequences of taking this plea when he got in trouble again, and in hindsight, if he knew it was a felony, he certainly wouldn\u2019t have done it. I can\u2019t look at the hindsight. I have to look at the transcript, I have to give great deference to [the trial court\u2019s] findings in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">I find there is a sufficient factual basis. It said this is a plea of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and [the] use of [the] words \u201cto deliver\u201d is used on page five, and on page six [the trial judge] asked, \u201cHas your attorney explained to you the elements of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">And the defendant answers, \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">And I think now I cannot believe [appellant] when he says that at that time he did not realize that he was pleading guilty to possession with intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">Well, clearly it matters in the federal system if something is a felony or not. That is not something that we ordinarily mention in the course of taking a plea in Maryland. \u201cDo you understand this is a felony?\u201d \u201cDo you understand this is a misdemeanor?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">* * <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">Additionally, possession with intent to distribute, while it carries a 20 year maximum, if you had no prior record in this court, the minimum sentence was six months to three years, and I think the fact that this sentence was such a fabulous deal, to me, makes it even more voluntary. He saw a good deal. He was caught with the cocaine, and he took it, and now there are collateral consequences, and that is a shame, but I see nothing involuntary about this plea. I think there is a factual basis for the plea, and I am going to deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Pitt contends that his guilty plea to the offense of possession with intent to distribute was not made knowingly and voluntarily, and therefore the circuit court improperly denied his request for coram nobis relief. In particular, Pitt alleges that there was no factual predicate to support his conviction for possession with intent to distribute, he did not understand that he was pleading guilty to a felony offense, he was not advised of the maximum penalty for the offense, and he suffered adverse collateral consequences as a result of the State conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We begin our analysis with a review of the writ of error coram nobis. A coram nobis proceeding is an independent civil action. <em>Skok v. State, </em>361 Md. 52, 65, 760 A.2d 647 (2000); <em>Ruby v. State, </em>353 Md. 100, 107, 724 A.2d 673 (1999); <em>State v. Hicks, </em>139 Md.App. 1, 6, 773 A.2d 1056 (2001). In <em>Keane v. State, </em>164 Md. 685, 166 A. 410 (1933), the Court of Appeals explained the nature of the writ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201cThe writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is an old common-law writ recognized in this state. Its functions differ from an ordinary writ of error in that the latter raises questions of law, while it deals only with facts, which, if known at the time the judgment was rendered, would have prohibited its rendition. It is also unlike a -writ of error, as it is addressed to the court which rendered the judgment, while a writ of error is addressed to some other and superior court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 691, 166 A. 410 (citation omitted); <em>see Ruby, </em>353 Md. at 105, 724 A.2d 673; <em>Johnson v. State, </em>215 Md. 333, 336, 138 A.2d 372 (1958); <em>Miles v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 381, 387, 785 A.2d 841 (2001); <em>Jones v. State, </em>114 Md.App. 471, 475, 691 A.2d 229, <em>cert. denied, </em>346 Md. 27, 694 A.2d 950, <em>cert. denied, 522 </em>U.S. 917, 118 S.Ct. 304, 139 L.Ed.2d 234 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">As the Court recognized in <em>Keane, </em>164 Md. at 691-92, 166 A. 410, the writ of error coram nobis \u201clies to obtain relief from such errors of fact as the infancy, death, or coverture of the defendant, in cases where those defenses, if known at the time, would have prevented a judgment, but which through no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>fault of the defendant were not known when the judgment was entered.\u201d Further, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">Such facts would rarely affect the proceedings in a criminal prosecution; consequently the writ is less frequently available in such cases than in civil cases, and there is less uniformity in the decisions as to what errors of fact will justify its use in criminal prosecutions. But it has been generally held that, where the writ is available, it lies to reverse a judgment obtained by fraud, coercion, or duress, as where a plea of guilty was procured by force, violence, or intimidation, or where at the time of the trial the defendant was insane, when such facts were unknown to the court when the judgment was entered, or where the accused was prevented by fraud, force, or fear from presenting defensive facts which could have been used at his trial, when such facts were not known to the court when the judgment was entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">On the other hand, coram nobis cannot be used to correct an issue of fact that has been adjudicated, even if it was wrongly determined. <em>See Johns v. State, </em>216 Md. 218, 221, 140 A.2d 56 (1958); <em>Johnson, </em>215 Md. at 336, 138 A.2d 372; <em>Madison v. State, </em>205 Md. 425, 432, 109 A.2d 96 (1954); <em>Bernard v. State, </em>193 Md. 1, 3\u20144, 65 A.2d 297 (1949); <em>Hawks v. State, </em>162 Md. 30, 31, 157 A. 900 (1932). As coram nobis is \u201can attack on the judgment itself,\u201d the writ does not lie \u201cto contradict or put in issue any fact\u201d that was previously \u201cadjudicated in the action.\u201d <em>Keane, </em>164 Md. at 690, 166 A. 410. The Court explained in <em>Jackson v. State, </em>218 Md. 25, 145 A.2d 234 (1958), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u201cthe remedy is not broad enough to reach every case in which there has been an erroneous or unjust judgment, on the sole ground that no other remedy exists, but it must be confined to cases in which the supposed error inheres in facts not actually in issue under the pleadings at the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>and unknown to the court when the judgment was entered, but which, if known would have prevented the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag\"><em>Id. </em>at 27-28, 145 A.2d 234 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The parameters of coram nobis were recently explicated in <em>Skok, </em>361 Md. 52, 760 A.2d 647. There, the appellant was a U.S. permanent resident who served a few days in jail in connection with his guilty plea and his plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>as to two drug possession offenses. Despite the relatively minor nature of the offenses, Skok subsequently faced deportation proceedings because the convictions constituted immigration violations. Consequently, Skok filed, <em>inter alia, </em>a coram nobis petition, seeking to vacate his 1994 judgments of conviction. He argued, in relevant part, that his pleas were defective because the circuit court failed to comply with the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-242(c) and (d). In particular, he claimed that the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">violated Rule 4-242(c) because the court did not require that the facts supporting the plea be read in open court in the defendant\u2019s presence, did not expressly find on the record that the factual basis supported a finding of guilty, did not advise Skok of the possible consequences of his plea, and did not properly advise Skok of his right to a jury trial. Skok claimed that the Circuit Court, in accepting his nolo contendere plea in October 1994, violated Rule 4-242(d) because there was no examination of Skok in open court for a determination that the plea was made voluntarily, with an understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. Skok also contended that due process principles were violated because both pleas were involuntary, that they were not knowingly and intelligently made, and that there was no valid waiver of his rights, including his right to jury trials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 760 A.2d 647. The circuit court denied Skok\u2019s request for coram nobis relief; the Court of Appeals reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The Court of Appeals acknowledged that \u201cthe scope of the issues which could be raised in a traditional coram nobis proceeding\u201d is \u201cnarrow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 760 A.2d 647. Of particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>lar interest here, the Court also made clear that, traditionally, \u201cone of the issues which could be raised [in a coram nobis proceeding] was the voluntariness of a plea in a criminal case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained, 361 Md. at 80-81, 760 A.2d 647:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">[T]he courts have consistently held that the scope of a coram nobis proceeding encompasses issues concerning the voluntariness of a guilty or nolo contendere plea, and whether the record shows that such plea was understandingly and voluntarily made under the principles of <em>Boykin v. Alabama, supra, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">Moreover, the courts have regularly held that violations of rules similar to Maryland Rule 4-242, which are designed to insure that guilty and nolo contendere pleas are voluntary, constitute a basis for coram nobis relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In the <em>Skok </em>Court\u2019s view, \u201csound public policy\u201d warranted a \u201csomewhat broader scope of coram nobis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 760 A.2d 647. The Court noted intervening changes in immigration law and the enactment of recidivist statutes, with attendant collateral consequences, as a basis to broaden coram nobis relief. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78, 760 A.2d 647. It reasoned: \u201c \u2018[T]he present-day scope of coram nobis is broad enough to encompass not only errors of fact that affect the validity or regularity of legal proceedings, but also legal errors of a constitutional or fundamental proportion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75, 760 A.2d 647 (citation omitted). The Court said, at 361 Md. at 78, 760 A.2d 647:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">In light of these serious collateral consequences, there should be a remedy for a convicted person who is not incarcerated and not on parole or probation, who is suddenly faced with a significant collateral consequence of his or her conviction, and who can legitimately challenge the conviction on constitutional or fundamental grounds. Such person should be able to file a motion for coram nobis relief regardless of whether the alleged infirmity in the conviction is considered an error of fact or an error of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The Court in <em>Skok </em>recognized that a plea taken in violation of constitutional principles or in violation of Rule 4-242(c) and (d) may fail \u201cto ascertain from the accused the requisite answers, information or facts permitting the court to determine that a guilty plea ... is voluntary.\u201d That would result in \u201can erroneous factual gap, relating to a voluntariness matter which is not adjudicated by the court on a complete factual record.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 760 A.2d 647. It cautioned, however, that important limitations apply to coram nobis when it serves as a basis to challenge criminal convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 760 A.2d 647. First, the challenge must be of a \u201cconstitutional, jurisdictional or fundamental character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 760 A.2d 647. Second, the petitioner must face \u201csignificant collateral consequences from the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 760 A.2d 647. Moreover, because a presumption of regularity attaches to the criminal case, the burden of proof is on the coram nobis petitioner. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 760 A.2d 647. But, coram nobis is not available when another remedy is applicable under statutory or common law. <em>Id. </em>at 80, 760 A.2d 647. Further, the principles of waiver apply to coram nobis actions. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 760 A.2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Significantly, the issues regarding the validity of Skok\u2019s plea were not litigated, although Skok faced \u201csubstantial collateral consequences from his two convictions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 82, 760 A.2d 647, and he lacked any other remedy. Therefore, the Court determined that he was entitled to a hearing on his petition seeking coram nobis relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Whether a defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary is a matter determined in the first instance by the court that accepted the plea. <em>See Jones, </em>114 Md.App. at 479, 691 A.2d 229 (concluding that \u201cthe ability of appellant to understand and voluntarily enter a guilty plea was a fact issue that was decided by the [guilty plea] court\u201d in that case). Before the trial court may accept a guilty plea, it must determine on the record that the defendant understands the nature of the charges and the consequences of the plea, that the plea is a voluntary one, and that a factual basis supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the plea. <em>Metheny v. State, </em>359 Md. 576, 602, 755 A.2d 1088 (2000); <em>Lovell v. State, </em>347 Md. 623, 635, 702 A.2d 261 (1997); <em>Parren v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 645, 647, 599 A.2d 828 (1991); <em>State v. Thornton, </em>73 Md.App. 247, 250, 533 A.2d 951 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>312 Md. 127, 538 A.2d 778 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Maryland Rule 4-242(c) is aimed at assuring that a guilty plea is made knowingly and voluntarily. The rule provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">(c) Plea of Guilty.\u2014The court may accept a plea of guilty only after it determines, upon an examination of the defendant on the record in open court conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof, that (1) the defendant is pleading voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea; and (2) there is a factual basis for the plea. The court may accept the plea of guilty even though the defendant does not admit guilt. Upon refusal to accept a plea of guilty, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Rule 4-242(c) has been interpreted to include that the defendant must be made aware of the maximum sentence he can receive when pleading guilty. <em>See Moore v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 524, 526-27, 531 A.2d 1026 (1987). A criminal defendant is afforded the protections outlined above because \u201ca plea of guilty is \u2018a grave and solemn act\u2019 to be accepted only with care and discernment.\u201d 1 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice <em>&amp; </em>Procedure, R. 11 (2d ed.1982) (quoting <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970)). As the Supreme Court has said, \u201c[a] plea of guilty is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts; it is itself a conviction; nothing remains but to give judgment and determine punishment.\u201d <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); <em>see Sutton v. State, </em>289 Md. 359, 364, 424 A.2d 755 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The transcript of the guilty plea proceeding in the case <em>sub judice </em>unequivocally establishes that appellant knew he was not merely pleading guilty to simple possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>cocaine. Appellant was expressly informed that the charge at issue was possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Moreover, the statement of facts showed that appellant was found <em>\u201cdelivering </em>a quantity of cocaine.\u201d Thereafter, appellant\u2019s own trial attorney added that appellant \u201chad passed a bag\u201d to someone else. Further, appellant expressly acknowledged that his lawyer had advised him of the definition of possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In addition, the record contains a clear reference to the statutory maximum period of incarceration that appellant faced, although it was not characterized as the statutory maximum. Appellant\u2019s defense counsel said that, \u201c[i]n this particular case, Your Honor, ... after the presentence report is completed and sentencing is set ... Mr. Pitt facets] a 20-year suspended sentence, all except one year, a period of active probation, five years.\u201d We are satisfied that, in the context of this case, this statement was sufficient to put appellant on notice of the maximum sentence. As the court below suggested, appellant fully realized that his exposure to incarceration was substantial, which undoubtedly influenced him to accept the plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We are also satisfied that coram nobis relief does not lie merely because Pitt was not advised at the guilty plea proceedings of the serious consequences that he could suffer if he were later found to be a repeat offender. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The concept of enhanced penalties for repeat offenders was already established by the time Pitt pleaded guilty in 1992; Maryland\u2019s recidivist statute has been in place since 1977. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 264, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994). But, the failure of a court to advise a defendant of a recidivist statute does not automatically render a defendant\u2019s plea constitutionally invalid. Maryland Rule 4-242(e) provides, in part, that \u201comission of advice concerning the collateral consequences of a plea does not itself mandate that the plea be declared invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Although the recent case of <em>Booze v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 402, 780 A.2d 479 (2001), does not concern coram nobis relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>it is nonetheless instructive. There, the defendant challenged the denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence in a drug case. He claimed that he received an illegal enhanced sentence under Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c), as a subsequent offender, because he had not been advised in 1994, when he pleaded guilty to the predicate offense, that a subsequent conviction would result in a mandatory minimum sentence. We disagreed, concluding that the trial court had no duty to advise the defendant explicitly at a guilty plea proceeding of the consequence of enhanced penalties in the event of a subsequent conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 780 A.2d 479; <em>see Moore, </em>72 Md.App. at 526, 531 A.2d 1026. In reaching that result, we reasoned that the \u201cenhanced penalty is not a direct consequence of the plea itself, but rather a consequence of the person\u2019s future conduct.\u201d <em>Booze, </em>140 Md.App. at 411, 780 A.2d 479. Further, we said that \u201cthe prior conviction itself should constitute adequate warning....\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also relied on <em>Yoswick v. State, </em>347 Md. 228, 700 A.2d 251 (1997), in which the Court of Appeals determined that \u201cdue process does not require \u2018that a defendant be advised of the indirect or collateral consequences of a guilty plea, even if the consequences are foreseeable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240, 700 A.2d 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Here, the collateral consequence, the enhanced federal sentence, stemmed from unrelated conduct of appellant that occurred after he pleaded guilty in 1992, and obviously could not have been known to the court when appellant\u2019s plea was taken. Moreover, at the guilty plea proceedings in 1992, the court was not required to inform appellant of possible enhanced penalties if, in the future, he should again be found in violation of the criminal law. Indeed, the court could not be expected to predict appellant\u2019s future behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Based on all of the foregoing, we conclude that the record does not support the reasons Pitt assigns for his coram nobis request. To the contrary, appellant\u2019s guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.
