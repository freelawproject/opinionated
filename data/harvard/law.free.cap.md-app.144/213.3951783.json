One of the children she cared for was appellants\u2019 son, Stacy Rae Stinger.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>While caring for Stacy on June 7, 1999, when he was two- and-a-half-years old, Epley drove him in her 1994 Dodge Caravan from her residence to another residence, where she was to perform cleaning services. Stacy went inside with Epley, but when he began to get tired, she brought him back outside to the van. The outside temperature exceeded 90 degrees Fahrenheit. She strapped Stacy in his car seat and left him there unattended with only the front windows slightly open. Epley went back inside the house to finish cleaning. Stacy was subsequently overcome by the heat and died of hyperthermia. Allstate does not dispute that Epley\u2019s negligence caused Stacy\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">At the time of Stacy\u2019s death, Epley had two insurance policies with Allstate, an automobile liability policy and a policy entitled \u201cAllstate Renter\u2019s Policy.\u201d Her renter\u2019s policy contained a family day care coverage endorsement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">On April 5, 2000, appellants filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Epley for wrongful death. On July 14, 2000, Allstate filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County the declaratory judgment action that is the subject of this appeal. Allstate sought a declaration from the court that, under the terms of the renter\u2019s policy, \u201c[a]ll claims arising from the death of Stacy Rae Stinger are excluded from coverage [under the renter\u2019s insurance policy], and Allstate has no liability to defend or indemnify Brenda Ann Epley for any claims arising from the contract for insurance.\u201d On April 25, 2001, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Allstate, ruling that the motor vehicle exclusions contained in Epley\u2019s renter\u2019s policy were effective and not contrary to the public policy of the State as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>expressed in Md.Code (1997, 2000 Supp.), \u00a7 19-202 of the Insurance Article (\u201cIns.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Appellants filed a motion to alter or amend judgment, which was denied on June 27, 2001. Appellants timely appealed both the grant of summary judgment in favor of Allstate and the denial of their motion to alter or amend judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\"><em>A </em>summary judgment motion is not a substitute for trial. Rather it is used to dispose of cases when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is whether the trial judge was legally correct in his or her rulings. In granting a motion for summary judgment, the trial judge may not resolve factual disputes, but instead is limited to ruling on matters of law.... If any inferences may be drawn from the well-plead facts, the trial court must construe those inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. The existence of a dispute as to some non-material fact will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment, but if there is evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find for the non-moving party or material facts in dispute, the grant of summary judgment is improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\"><em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 178, 757 A.2d 118 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Although granting summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action is \u201c \u2018the exception rather than the rule[,]\u2019 \u201d it is available in such cases. <em>Utica Mutual Ins.

Because the material facts in this case were essentially undisputed, we decide only whether the circuit court\u2019s ruling was legally correct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred when it ruled that Ins. \u00a7 19-202 does not invalidate exclusions in homeowner\u2019s or renter\u2019s policies that contain a home day care endorsement. Appellants argue that insurance coverage is mandated by Ins. \u00a7 19-202, <em>infra, </em>and, consequently, only exclusions expressly allowed by the General Assembly can be included in such policies. Appellants also argue that the trial court erred when it interpreted Ins. \u00a7 19-202 in conjunction with Ins. \u00a7 19-106, <em>infra, </em>ultimately finding that they are mutually exclusive. Allstate contends that \u00a7 19-202 is not directly applicable because Epley was covered by a renter\u2019s, not a homeowner\u2019s, liability policy. It also argues that insurance is not compulsory for day care providers and that exclusions are allowable. Allstate urges us to affirm the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Ins. \u00a7\u00a7 19-106 and 19-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Coverage and Exclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The Family Liability Protection section of Epley\u2019s renter\u2019s policy provides that Allstate</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">will pay damages which an insured person becomes legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury or property damage arising from an occurrence <footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> to which this policy applies, and is covered by this part of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">We may investigate or settle any claim or suit for covered damages against an insured person.

One of the clauses provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">We do not cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">a) the negligent supervision by an insured person of any person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">b) any liability statutorily imposed on any insured person arising from the ownership, maintenance, use, occupancy, renting, loaning, entrusting, loading or unloading of any aircraft, watercraft, motor vehicle or trailer which is not covered under Section II<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark> of this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The second clause, which is contained in Section II, entitled \u201cFamily Liability and Guest Medical Protection,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">We do not cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, occupancy, renting, loaning, entrusting, loading or unloading of any motor vehicle or trailer.

Consequently, we review the rules of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">The principles of statutory construction are not novel. \u201cEvery quest to discover and give effect to the objectives of the legislature begins with the text of the statute.\u201d <em>Huffman v. State, </em>356 Md. 622, 628, 741 A.2d 1088, 1091 (1999). If the legislature\u2019s intentions are evident from the text of the statute, our inquiry normally will cease and the plain meaning of the statute will govern. <em>See id. See also Martin v. Beverage Capital Corp., </em>353 Md. 388, 399, 726 A.2d 728, 733 (1999); <em>Philip Elec. North America v. Wright, </em>348 Md. 209, 216-17, 703 A.2d 150, 153 (1997); <em>Schuman, Kane, Felts &amp; Everngam v. Aluisi, </em>341 Md. 115, 119, 668 A.2d 929, 931 (1995). We bear in mind, however, that the plain-meaning rule is elastic, rather than cast in stone. <em>See Kaczorowski v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987). If persuasive evidence exists outside the plain text of the statute, we do not turn a blind eye to it. <em>See Kaczorowski </em>309 Md. at 514, 525 A.2d 628. We often look to the legislative history, an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute, and other sources for a more complete understanding of what the General Assembly intended when it enacted particular legislation. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993). In so doing, \u201c[w]e may also consider the particular problem or problems the legislature was addressing, and the objectives it sought to attain.\u201d <em>Sinai Hosp. of Baltimore v. Department of Employment and Training, </em>309 Md. 28, 40, 522 A.2d 382, 388 (1987). This enables us to put the statute in controversy in its proper context and thereby avoid unreasonable or illogical results that defy common sense. <em>See Huffman, </em>356 Md. at 628, 741 A.2d at 1091; <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v.

In addition, property insurance for the contents of apartments and other personal residences, whether owned by the occupants or not, is available under homeowners policies (often referred to as \u201crenters\u201d insurance). Special variations of \u201chomeowners\u201d or \u201crenters\u201d insurance are also commonly available to provide protection for hybrid forms of residential ownership, such as the condominium, the co-operative, and the homeowners association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">Property insurance for personal residences is usually sold in a \u201cpackage\u201d policy together with some kind of liability coverage. As a result, the variety of liability insurance usually referred to as \u201chomeowners\u201d is purchased as an adjunct to property insurance by both owners and renters.

To exclude renter\u2019s policies from the statute would be to create two classes of day care providers: homeowners who are presented the opportunity to purchase insurance coverage and renters who are not given the opportunity to purchase insurance. In light of the overall statutory scheme, this result would seem to us illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Indeed, we find Allstate\u2019s argument that Ins. \u00a7 19-202 does not cover renter\u2019s policies to be somewhat disingenuous in light of the fact that they offered and sold to Epley\u2014and, presumably, to other insureds\u2014a policy containing a family day care endorsement entitled \u201cHome Day Care Coverage Endorsement\u2014Maryland\u201d that closely tracks Ins. \u00a7 19-202. If Allstate believed that Ins. \u00a7 19-202 was not meant to cover family day care providers who rent, rather than own, their homes, would it offer renters such policies when apparently such coverage was not readily available prior to the legislation? Although renter\u2019s policies are not expressly referred to in Ins. \u00a7 19-202, we hold that the statute is fairly read to include such policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Mandatory Insurance Coverage and Public Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Appellants argue that \u201cwhere the legislature has mandated insurance coverage, the Courts will not create or permit exclusions that are not specifically set out in the statute.\u201d Appellees argue that Ins. \u00a7 19-202 does not mandate insurance coverage. The trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">The defendants cite to an extensive number of cases regarding compulsory insurance, and seek to raise the public policy issue through that analogy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The plaintiff, on the other hand, claims that there is no public policy involved because this provision is not a compulsory insurance provision under the existing case law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">The Court\u2019s view is that this provision of Section 19-202 does not create compulsory insurance of the nature that is apparent in the case law cited by the defendants, or traditionally appearing in the statute regarding motor vehicle insurance as an example.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">However, it is the Court\u2019s view that it is compulsory in the sense that it is compulsory on the insurance company to provide this kind of coverage, and to offer this kind of coverage to an insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">The insured doesn\u2019t have to take it, but the insurance company is mandated by the statute to offer it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">So in that sense it is compulsory on the insurance company, and in that sense it is\u2014does create an issue of public policy regarding the scope and language of the policy that is offered by the insurance company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">As appellants point out, we have previously recognized that, [w]here the legislature has mandated insurance coverage, this Court will not create exclusions that are not specifically set out in the statute. <em>Enterprise Leasing Co.

The plain language of the statute does not require home day care providers to purchase the insurance or insurers to include coverage in any policy that it might issue. It merely requires insurance companies to offer such insurance. Ins. \u00a7 19-202 (\u201c[a]n insurer ... shall offer to provide to a policyholder ... coverage of at least $300,000 for liability\u201d (emphasis supplied)). It is silent as to exclusions. This language is substantially different than the language of Ins. \u00a7 19-504, which requires that any motor vehicle liability policy \u201cissued, sold, or delivered in the State shall provide\u201d a minimum amount of liability coverage, or of Ins. \u00a7 19-509, which requires \u201ceach motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued\u201d to contain uninsured motorist coverage. The General Assembly has sought to assure the availability of insurance, but the choice to purchase remains with the day care provider. Ins. \u00a7 19-202, as written, is not a compulsory liability insurance statute and a motor vehicle exclusion is not precluded by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>This \u201cplain language\u201d interpretation that the General Assembly intended only to require insurers to offer family day care coverage is supported by the legislative history. The discussion at the hearings concerned the lack of availability of insurance for family day care homes. There was no mention at all of requiring the day care providers to buy insurance. Senate Finance Committee Minutes. The only specifics of the statute were that at least $800,000 of coverage had to be offered to designated family day care providers. Moreover, as Allstate argues, there are no provisions in either the Family Law Article or COMAR 07.04.01.01 <em>et seq., </em>which pertain to the licensing of family day care providers, that require the purchase of such insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Appellants also argue that the trial court erred by reading Ins. \u00a7\u00a7 19-106 and 19-202 in combination with each other. We disagree. Indeed, one of the cardinal rules of statutory construction is to interpret statutes in accordance with the statutory scheme as a whole. <em>Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 252, 753 A.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As noted, Ins. \u00a7\u00a7 19-106 and 19-202 were originally drafted as two parts to the same statute, Art. 48A, \u00a7 481D. If Art. 48A, \u00a7 481D(a), now Ins. \u00a7 19-202, was meant to cover all liability for injury related to day care services, no matter where the injury occurred, there would have been no reason for the legislature to enact the automobile insurance provisions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When interpreting a statute, we are not to render any part of the law surplusage, and we are to avoid unreasonable or illogical results. <em>Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 252, 753 A.2d 501. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Failure to read \u00a7\u00a7 19-106 and 19-202 in conjunction with each other would do just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The two statutory provisions suggest the recognition of the inherent differences between homeowner\u2019s and automobile liability policies. As Allstate noted at oral argument, automobile liability policies are designed to cover an entirely different set of risks than are homeowner\u2019s policies, and many homeowner\u2019s policies contain automobile exclusions because of this difference. Automobile liability polices arose out of the desire to have \u201ca single policy to cover all or most of the risks associated with a specific activity.\u201d Lee L. Russ, COUCH ON INSURANCE, \u00a7 l:48(3d ed.1995) (hereinafter \u201cCouch\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">Automobile insurance may provide protection against a myriad of risks associated with ownership, operation, or travel in an automobile, including traditional risks like liability, property damage, collision, fire, theft, and transportation, and new, mandatory coverage schemes such as uninsured motorist protection and no fault. At one time, the term \u201cautomobile insurance,\u201d when used without qualification, was generally understood to mean liability insurance, but the justification for that presumption should be seriously questioned under modern practice in which a growing number of coverages are mandatory, and several other types of coverage are as pervasive as liability insurance. Still, in keeping with the fact that automobile liability insurance is mandatory in most places, automobile liability polices are commonly considered at least slightly different than many other types of liability insurance. It is, for example, considered that these policies are in many ways as much for the protection of the general travelling public as they are for the insureds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Couch at \u00a7 1:50 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Automobile insurance is required in Maryland, but as of now, it is not mandatory that family home day care providers be insured. <em>See Lewis, </em>368 Md. at 46-47, 792 A.2d at 273-74. The law does require, however, that insurers permit family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>day care providers to extend their auto policies to cover day care activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Based on the argument that Ins. \u00a7 19-202 mandates family day care liability insurance, appellants argue that the motor vehicle exclusions in Epley\u2019s Allstate policy are void because of public policy. Appellants are concerned that, by allowing insurance companies to include exclusions in family day care endorsements without restraint, those companies might write so many exclusions as to make the coverage worthless. They provide a number of possible scenarios unrelated to the specifics of this case concerning exclusions that might be added to policies by insurers that would ultimately negate liability. Because we have rejected the foundation for that argument, we do not address the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d presented in its support.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Whether insurance encompassing all family day care activities should be mandatory, in light of the risk to both the family home daycare provider and to the parents and children who utilize such services, is an inherently complex question. Its resolution involves the balancing of cost and risk in providing safe but affordable day care to meet the needs of working parents and their children. Such public policy issues are better addressed by the legislature than by the courts in the microcosm of one tragic and sympathetic case.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Applicability of the Provisions of Ins. \u00a7 19-106</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Appellants contend that, because Ins. \u00a7 19-106 applies to injuries arising out of the provision of day care services only while the child is a \u201cpassenger\u201d in the vehicle, there is a gap in coverage that the homeowner\u2019s policy should be read to cover.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This is because, according to appellants, Stacy was not a \u201cpassenger\u201d in Epley\u2019s minivan. Whereas they seek a broad read of Ins. \u00a7 19-202, they propose a narrow read of Ins. \u00a7 19-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Appellants raised this issue in their motion to alter or amend judgment and for leave to submit additional evidence, suggesting for the first time that there was a question of material fact to be resolved. The question was whether the van was \u201cmerely the location of, rather than the mechanism for the tragic death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Previously, in their wrongful death complaint, appellants alleged, in paragraphs 5-7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">5. On or about June 7, 1999, while still in the care and custody of the defendant, Stacy Rae Stinger, a minor, sustained fatal injuries after he was strapped in a safety seat and was left unattended for several hours with the windows up in the defendant Epley\u2019s 1994 Dodge Caravan minivan when the outside daytime temperature exceeded ninety (90 F) degrees Fahrenheit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">6. As a child daycare operator the defendant had a duty to use reasonable care to provide a safe environment for the minor child, to watch the minor child so that he did not injure himself and to be vigilant so that other individuals did not cause injury to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">7. By failing to use such reasonable care and by leaving the minor, Stacy Rae Stinger, unattended and strapped in a safety seat inside her minivan with the windows up on a hot summer day for several hours, thereby causing the injuries which resulted in the child\u2019s death, Defendant Epley carelessly and negligently breached the duties she owed to minor, Stacy Rae Stinger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The \u201cstatement of material facts not in dispute,\u201d provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">On June 7,1999, Epley put Stacy Rae Stinger in her 1994 Dodge Caravan minivan and drove him to another residence where she had been hired to perform cleaning services. Epley initially brought the child inside the house with her, but when he began to get tired, she put him back in her minivan, notwithstanding the outside daytime temperature exceeded ninety degrees Fahrenheit (90 F). Epley left him there, unattended and strapped in a safety seat with the windows up, for several hours. The boy was subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>overcome by heat prostration (hyperthermia), resulting in his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The Medical Examiner\u2019s report concluded that Stacy \u201cdied of hyperthermia (heat stroke) after being confined to a motor vehicle in the heat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Because appellants have appealed the court\u2019s denial of their motion to alter or amend judgment, we address this issue in the context of our review of the court\u2019s denial of that motion, for abuse of discretion. <em>Falcinelli v. Cardascia, </em>339 Md. 414, 430, 663 A.2d 1256 (1995); <em>Wormwood v. Batching Sys., </em>124 Md.App. 695, 699, 723 A.2d 568, <em>cert. denied, </em>354 Md. 113, 729 A.2d 405 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We have previously defined the abuse of discretion standard as a \u201c \u2018reasoned decision based on the weighing of various alternatives.\u2019 There is an abuse of discretion <em>\u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court </em>[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Metheny v. State, </em>359 Md. 576, 604, 755 A.2d 1088 (2000) (quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110, 118 (1997) (citations omitted)) (emphasis in Metheny). Accordingly, we limit our inquiry to whether a reasonable person would have denied the motion to alter or amend judgment in light of appellants\u2019 arguments about the construction of the word \u201cpassenger\u201d in Ins. \u00a7 19-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Neither party has provided us with a definition of \u201cpassenger\u201d in either the Code or case law, and our search has not provided one. We note that the Personal Injury Protection statute found at Ins. \u00a7 19-505(a)(2) speaks generally to the term \u201cpassenger:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">[E]aeh insurer that issues, sells, or delivers a motor vehicle liability insurance policy in the State shall provide coverage for the medical, hospital, and disability benefits described in this section for each of the following individuals:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">(2) an individual who is injured in a motor vehicle accident while occupying the insured motor vehicle as a guest or passenger[.] [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Although this provision refers to a \u201cmotor vehicle accident,\u201d it does not require that the vehicle be in motion when the \u201cpassenger\u201d is injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Likewise, the plain meaning of the word does not appear to require that a guest in an automobile is only a \u201cpassenger\u201d when the car is moving. A \u201cpassenger\u201d is defined as \u201ca traveler in a public or private conveyance,\u201d MERRIAM-WEBSTER\u2019S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 847 (10th ed.2000), \u201cwho is not the operator,\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S DESK DICTIONARY 331 (1993). A \u201ctraveler\u201d is \u201cone that goes on a trip or journey.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253. Stacy fits this description, and his status as a passenger in the van was not abrogated merely because the van was not moving. Stacy was transported from Epley\u2019s premises in the van as a result of insured\u2019s activities as a family day care provider. The intent was for Stacy to sleep and when Epley finished cleaning, they would complete the trip by traveling back to Epley\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">At least one other state, in a similar situation, has allowed automobile exclusions to stand in a premises liability policy. In <em>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Chilton-Shelby Mental Health Center, </em>595 So.2d 1375 (Ala.1992), an eighteen-month-old boy was transported in a van to the Center run by defendant. The defendant had contracted with the YWCA to transport children between their homes and the YWCA. Due to an oversight, he was not removed from the van at the YWCA, but instead was driven to the Center and left in the van on a hot summer day. The child ultimately succumbed to hyperthermia. The defendant\u2019s policy<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> excluded injury \u201cdue to the ownership [or] use of: any auto owned [or] operated ... by any protected person.\u201d <em>Chilton-Shelby, </em>595 So.2d at 1376. The Supreme Court of Alabama upheld this exclusion and found that appellant was not liable under the policy because the child\u2019s death \u201cwas due to the ownership or use of the van.\u201d <em>Id., </em>595 So.2d at 1377.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Not only was the issue not raised in a timely manner, the facts surrounding Stacy\u2019s death were not in dispute. From these facts it could be concluded that his death occurred as a result of Epley\u2019s ownership, use, and occupancy of her van. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to alter or amend judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\">.

Section 19-504 states: \"Each motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued, sold, or delivered in the State shall provide the minimum liability coverage specified in Title 17 of the Transportation Article.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b252-6\">. Section 19-509 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">(c) <em>Coverage </em>required.\u2014In addition to any other coverage required by this subtitle, each motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued, sold, or delivered in tire State after July 1, 1975, shall contain coverage for damages, subject to the policy limits, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">(1) the insured is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the uninsured motor vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">(2) a surviving relative of the insured, who is described in \u00a7 3-904 of the Courts Article, is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because the insured died as the result of a motor vehicle accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag2\">Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c) (emphasis supplied). Ins. \u00a7 19\u2014509(f) sets forth exclusions that an insurer may write into a policy.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\">. Although there are potentially gaps in coverage, it is not clear from the legislative history that the General Assembly was, in fact, trying to cover all possibilities. We can say only that there was a perceived problem with access to premises liability insurance for family day care providers because of the business use of the property, and that the General Assembly acted to remedy that situation. As shown by the form policy in this case, the automobile exclusion is a common exclusion in homeowner\u2019s insurance policies. Injuries that are not covered by the family day care provider\u2019s policies might be covered by other forms of insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\">. The language of Ins. \u00a7 19-106 requires insurers to offer automobile coverage for bodily injury occurring \u201cwhile the child is a passenger in [an insured\u2019s] automobile\u201d and arising \u201cout of an insured\u2019s activities as a family day care provider.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\">. It is not clear from the case whether some amount of insurance was mandatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
