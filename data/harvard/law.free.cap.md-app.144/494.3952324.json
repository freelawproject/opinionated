Musick to use the so-called Bangs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> formula in calculating the percentage of his lump sum pension benefit payment to be paid to his former wife, appellee Doris Musick. Mr. Musick presents one question in this appeal. He asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">Whether the [circuit [ejourt erred in ordering a division of Husband\u2019s pension benefits pursuant to the <em>\u201cBangs </em>formula\u201d when the parties agreed that Wife\u2019s interest in the retirement benefits would be based upon their value at the time of the divorce?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Because we reject the underlying premise of appellant\u2019s argument\u2014that the parties agreed that Mrs. Musick\u2019s interest in the pension would be based on the pension\u2019s value at the time of the divorce\u2014we answer the question in the negative and affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Mr. Musick began working for Bell Atlantic<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in March of 1967. Six months later, in September of 1967, the parties were married. Mr. Musick worked for Bell Atlantic throughout the entire marriage and continued to work for the company for 18 months after the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">On October 2, 1996, just prior to entry of the judgment of divorce, the parties entered into a property settlement agreement. That agreement mentioned Mr. Musick\u2019s Bell Atlantic pension and indicated that Mrs. Musick was to \u201creceive fifty percent (50%) of the \u2018marital share\u2019 of said benefits.\u201d The agreement indicated that counsel for Mrs. Musick would prepare \u201cthe necessary [Qualified Domestic Relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Order, or QDRO,]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in order to accomplish that end, and for that purpose this Honorable Court shall continue to retain jurisdiction to amend any Judgment that may be passed, for purposes of accomplishing the intent of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWq\">A judgment of divorce, signed by the trial judge and counsel for both parties, was entered on October 21, 1996. The divorce decree provides that the property settlement agreement \u201cis hereby approved and made a part of and incorporated in this Judgment, but not merged therein, having the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein.\u201d The decree further states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_T\">IT IS ... ORDERED, that this is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order ... and in accordance therewith, the pension plan or program known as Bell Atlantic Savings and Security Plan, ... and all pension plan or benefits to which the Defendant Employee, RAYMOND P. MUSICK, is entitled to as of this date ... [are] to be considered as the pension benefits, which are the subject of this Order. The participant in the pension benefits and plan as hereinabove set forth is RAYMOND P. MUSICK, Defendant.... The alternative payee is the Plaintiff, DORIS MUSICK.... The Plaintiff/altemative payee\u2019s equitable interest in said pension is hereby declared to be fifty percent (50%) of the \u201cmarital share\u201d of said pension benefit, the marital share being that fraction of the benefit whose numerator shall be the number of months of the parties\u2019 marriage during which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>benefits were being accumulated, which number is 348, and whose denominator shall be the total number of months during which benefits were accumulated prior to the time when the payment of such benefits shall commence. The Plaintiff, DORIS MUSICK, shall receive fifty percent (50%) of the aforesaid marital share of any payments made from the pension of the participant ... if, as and when such payments are made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The divorce decree also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that the court retains jurisdiction to amend this Judgment for the purpose of maintaining its qualifications as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order under the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, or any other subsequent legislation ... provided that no such amendment or the right of the Court to so amend will invalidate this Order as \u201cQualified\u201d under the Retirement Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The parties agree that this provision requires them to execute an amended Qualified Domestic Relations Order, to be approved by the court, in order to effectuate their agreement regarding the division of Mr. Musick\u2019s pension as set forth in the divorce decree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They further agree that no such amended QDRO has been executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">At the time of the parties\u2019 divorce on October 21, 1996, the value of Mr. Musick\u2019s pension, if he had elected to retire at that time and to receive a lump sum payment, would have been $55,081.53. Eighteen months later, when Mr. Musick did retire from Bell Atlantic, the amount of the lump sum payment, which Mr. Musick apparently elected to receive, had increased to $254,201.15. The increase was attributable main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ly to Mr. Musick having completed 30 years of service to the company and to fluctuations in the stock market.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">A dispute arose between the parties as to whether Mrs. Musick\u2019s share of the pension was to be based on the value of the pension at the time of the divorce or at the time of Mr. Musick\u2019s retirement. Counsel for Mr. Musick prepared various amended Qualified Domestic Relations Orders, each intended to facilitate payments to Mrs. Musick based on the value of the pension at the time of the divorce. Mrs. Musick refused to sign the amended orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In April of 2000, Mrs. Musick filed a petition for contempt<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by which she asserted that Mr. Musick was failing to cooperate in efforts to resolve the dispute over the pension.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She requested the court\u2019s \u201cassistance in bringing that matter to a conclusion.\u201d Mr. Musick filed a counter-petition for contempt. He alleged that Bell Atlantic would not turn over to him his pension payment because of Mrs. Musick\u2019s \u201cdeliberate refusal to approve a Qualified Domestic Relations Order dividing [the] pension benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">A hearing was held on March 6, 2001. The parties agreed to withdraw their petitions for contempt but requested that the court resolve the dispute concerning the division of Mr. Musick\u2019s pension. The case, as it proceeded, was thus in the nature of a declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After hearing argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ment and testimony, the.court determined that the \u201cagreement and judgment entered into by the parties\u201d unambiguously established that the parties had agreed to divide Mr. Musick\u2019s pension using the <em>Bangs </em>formula. The court issued an order stating, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">that the Plaintiff, DORIS MUSICK, is entitled to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order granting unto her her marital share of the Defendant\u2019s pension plan which he has through Bell Atlantic, with the marital formula to be 50% of a numerator of 348 months of marriage and 373 months as a denominator representing the total number of months during which benefits were accumulated and the Plaintiff, DORIS MUSICK, shall receive the same if, as and when the payments are made....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">As this Court has summarized,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">a settlement agreement is subject to general contract law.... Particular questions must be resolved by looking first to the particular language of the agreement at issue .... If that language is clear as to its meaning, there is no room for construction and it must be presumed that the parties meant what they expressed.... The court may not rewrite terms of the contract or draw a new one when the terms of the disputed contract are clear and unambiguous, merely to avoid hardship or because one party has become dissatisfied with its provisions.... If, however, a reasonably prudent person would consider the contract susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, it will be deemed ambiguous.... In that case, the parties to a written contract will not be allowed to place their own interpretation on what it means or was intended to mean; the test is what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought that it meant.... A contract is not ambiguous merely because the parties thereto cannot agree as to its proper interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Fultz v. Shaffer, </em>111 Md.App. 278, 297-98, 681 A.2d 568 (1996) (citations omitted). <em>See also Painewebber, Inc. v. East, </em>363 Md. 408, 413-15, 768 A.2d 1029 (2001); <em>Goldberg v. Goldberg, </em>290 Md. 204, 212, 428 A.2d 469 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Mr. Musick points out that the property settlement agreement was silent as to the amount of Mrs. Musick\u2019s interest in the pension. He asserts, however, that the judgment of divorce entered on October 21, 1996 expressly limits Mrs. Musick\u2019s interest in his pension to the value of the pension \u201cas of this date.\u201d Mr. Musick misreads the divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The divorce decree indicates that \u201call pension plan[s] or benefits to which the Defendant Employee, RAYMOND P. MUSICK, is entitled to <em>as of this date ... [are] to be considered as the pension benefits, which are the subject of this 'order.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) As the trial court determined, the judgment of divorce did <em>not </em>limit Mrs. Musick\u2019s interest in the pension to the value of the pension as of the date of the divorce. As to the portion of the pension to which Mrs. Musick is entitled, the decree states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">The Plaintiff/alternate payee\u2019s equitable interest in said pension is hereby declared to be fifty percent (50%) of the \u201cmarital share\u201d of said pension benefit, the marital share being that fraction of the benefit whose numerator shall be the number of months of the parties\u2019 marriage during which benefits were being accumulated, which number is 348, and <em>whose denominator shall be the total number of months during which benefits were accumulated prior to the time when the payment of such benefits shall commence. ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoV\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The plain language of the decree establishes that the portion of the pension that Mrs. Musick is to receive is to be calculated by: dividing the number of months that Mr. Musick worked toward accumulating the pension during the marriage by the total number of months that Mr. Musick worked toward accumulating the pension; multiplying the pension by that amount; and dividing the product in two. Clearly, that is what the parties intended when they stated that the \u201cdenomi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>nator shall be the total number of months during which benefits were accumulated prior to the time when the payment of such benefits shall commence.\u201d If the parties had intended for Mrs. Musick\u2019s interest in the pension to be valued as of the date of the divorce, there would have been no need to set forth the above-recited formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Our interpretation of the decree is reinforced by the language in the decree that Mrs. Musick \u201cshall receive fifty percent (50%) of the aforesaid marital share of any payments made from the pension of the participant ... if, as and when such payments are made.\u201d It is well-established that \u201cthe marital portion of the pension under the \u2018as, if and when\u2019 method of computation cannot be calculated until the total number years of employment is known.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Kelly, </em>118 Md.App. 463, 472, 702 A.2d 999 (1997). <em>See also Potts v. Potts, </em>142 Md.App. 448, 475, 790 A.2d 703 (2002). Under Mr. Musick\u2019s interpretation, the marital portion could have been valued on the date of the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">As the trial court acknowledged, the formula agreed to by the parties and set forth in the judgment of divorce is precisely the formula that this Court approved in <em>Bangs v. Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. 350, 356, 475 A.2d 1214 (1984), for determining the marital share of a spouse\u2019s pension.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That is, \u201c[t]he fractional share ... is: one-half of a fraction of which the number of years and months of the marriage ... is the numerator and the total number of years and months of employment credited toward retirement is the denominator.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">It is true, as we recognized in <em>Bangs, </em>that under the formula a non-employee spouse could\u2014and in this case did\u2014 reap the benefit of a post-divorce increase in the value of the pension. <em>See id. </em>at 367, 475 A.2d 1214. It is also true, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>however, that application of the formula could \u201cforce[ ] both parties to share in any loss of value.\u201d <em>Potts, </em>142 Md.App. at 473, 790 A.2d 703. Significantly, an increase in pension benefits could be based, at least in part, on work performed during the marriage. <em>See Kelly, </em>118 Md.App. at 472, 702 A.2d 999. \u201cMoreover, any future adjustments by management might well relate to the length of appellant\u2019s total service, including the period of the marriage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We are somewhat puzzled by the inclusion in the record extract of an amended QDRO which is dated June 17, 1997, prior to Mr. Musick\u2019s retirement, and is signed by the trial judge and the parties. That amended order provides that Mrs. Musick\u2019s share of the pension is to be calculated by multiplying the \u201c[ajccrued benefit up to date of divorce\u201d by 348 months, then dividing that number by 50-percent. We are skeptical that a reasonable payment for Mrs. Musick could be logically reached using that formula, which omits a denominator for the 348 months of employment during the marriage. In any event, although Mr. Musick referenced the June 17, 1997 amended QDRO in his brief, the parties stipulated below that they had not executed an amended QDRO that would effectuate the division of the pension in accordance with the judgment of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\">. <em>See Bangs v. Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. 350, 356, 475 A.2d 1214 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-12\">. When Mr. Musick began working for the company, it was known as C &amp; P Telephone Company. It is currently known as Verizon. Because the company was known as Bell Atlantic throughout most of the relevant period, we shall refer to it as such in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\">. A Qualified Domestic Relations Orders is a domestic relations order that effectuates an exception to the anti-alienation requirements for pensions that are set forth in the federal tax and labor codes. <em>See 29 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)-(m) (anti-alienation and QDRO provisions of federal labor code); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401(a)(13)(B) and 414(p) (anti-alienation and QDRO provisions of Internal Revenue Code). \"An attempt to cause pension plan benefits payable to one party to be paid to an alternate payee ... can succeed only through the mechanism of QDRO.... Absent such a qualified order, not only will the pension plan administrator refuse to implement the court's decision, but ... there is at least a reasonable argument that a non-qualified order may be invalid even as between the parties.\u201d <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 35-36, 566 A.2d 767 (1989) (citations omitted). <em>See also Potts v. Potts, </em>142 Md.App. 448, 454-459, 790 A.2d 703 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\">. That is not to say that the judgment of divorce was not final. As this Court explained in <em>Potts, </em>142 Md.App. at 461, 790 A.2d 703, \"current QDRO practice leads us to conclude that issues encompassed by the QDRO that have not been decided previously, either expressly or by necessary implication in the judgment of absolute divorce, may be appealed independently of the judgment of divorce.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\">. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-105(a)(2) of the Fam. Law Art. (providing that a trial court \"may enforce by power of contempt or as an independent contract not superseded by the divorce decree the provisions of a deed, agreement, or settlement that contain language that the deed, agreement, or settlement is incorporated but not merged into a divorce decree\u201d); Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 1-202(a) of the Cts. &amp; Jud.

Rule 15-206 (setting forth procedures for pursuing constructive civil contempt).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b522-9\">.

As an alternative to applying the <em>Bangs </em>formula, a trial court could value the marital share of a pension by determining the amount of the spouse's contribution to the fund, plus interest, or it could calculate the present value of the retirement benefits when they vest under the plan. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
