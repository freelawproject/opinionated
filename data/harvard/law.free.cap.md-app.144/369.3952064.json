MOYLAN, Jr., Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aaq\">retired, specially assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">Our consideration of this appeal requires us to take a fresh look at the most rudimentary A, B, C\u2019s of the administrative process. What, before an administrative agency, is the difference between the burden of production and the burden of persuasion? To whom is allocated the burden of persuasion? What, if any, basis does an administrative tribunal require to justify its being unpersuaded?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">The appellant, Shirley Angelini, appeals from the denial by the Harford County Board of Appeals, in turn affirmed by Judge Emory A. Plitt, Jr. in the Circuit Court for Harford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>County, of her request that a B3 zoning boundary be extended for an additional one hundred feet. Harford County is the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The appellant, in her capacity as trustee under her late father\u2019s will, owns a parcel of land comprising 47.83 acres located at or near the intersection of Mountain Road (Rte.152) and Belair Road (Rte.l) in Harford County. The property has been in her family\u2019s ownership since the 1940\u2019s and is \u201csplit zoned\u201d into three categories: B-3 General Business District, R-2 Urban Residential District, and AG Agricultural District.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Initially the appellant sought to extend the B-3 zone (most of which was in the parcel comprising 4.73 acres fronting on Belair Road with a narrow strip fronting on Mountain Road) into the R-2 and AG areas behind the B-3 zone. She first requested (1) a 500 foot extension based on the topography adjustment contained in \u00a7 267-10(c) of the Harford County Zoning Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), (2) an area variance to permit the adjusted boundary to be within 300 feet of the parcel\u2019s boundary under \u00a7 267-11 of the Code, and (3) the extension of the B-3 zone by 100 feet under \u00a7 267-10(B) of the Code. During the course of the hearing before the Zoning Examiner, the appellant withdrew the first two requests, leaving only the request that the Board extend the B-3 district by 100 feet pursuant to \u00a7 267-10(B). The denial of that request is the only issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The Zoning Hearing Examiner recommended that the request be approved by the Harford County Council sitting as the Harford County Board of Appeals. The Board heard argument, utilizing the testimony before the Examiner, and in a written opinion denied the requested extension of the B-3 zoning boundary. The circuit court, in an opinion by Judge Plitt, affirmed the action of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The critical issue before us is the Board\u2019s interpretation of a section of the Zoning Code. Our initial focus is on the appropriate standard of appellate review we should bring to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>bear on such an interpretation. When the caselaw discusses the standard of review to be applied to a decision of an administrative agency, it generally distinguishes between 1) the agency\u2019s findings of fact, to which great deference is due under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard; and 2) the agency\u2019s rulings of law, as to which the courts do not hesitate to substitute their judgment for that of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"> The critical agency determination in this case was not a finding of fact. Neither was it a ruling of law in the more common sense, although it was more like the latter than like the former. It was, rather, the agency\u2019s interpretation of a law or regulation with respect to which the agency has a special expertise. When such an interpretation is under review, judicial deference is called for. As Judge Eldridge explained for the Court of Appeals in <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 68-69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cDespite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, <em>a court\u2019s task on review is not to </em>\u201c <em>\u2018 \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency,\u2019\u201d\u201d United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, supra, </em>336 Md. at 576-77, 650 A.2d at 230, quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., supra, </em>283 Md. [505] at 513, 390 A.2d [1119] at 1124 [1978]. <em>Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. </em>Thus, <em>an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Lussier v. Md. Racing Commission, </em>343 Md. 681, 696-697, 684 A.2d 804, 811-812 (1996), and cases there cited; <em>McCullough v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 612, 552 A.2d 881, 886 (1989) (\u2018The interpretation of a statute by those officials charged with administering the statute is ... entitled to weight\u2019). Furthermore, <em>the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected. Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, </em>337 Md. 441, 455, 654 A.2d 449, 456 (1995); <em>Christ [ex rel. Christ] v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>445, 644 A.2d 34, 42 (1994) (legislative delegations of authority to administrative agencies will often include the authority to make \u2018significant discretionary policy determinations\u2019); <em>Bd. of Ed. For Dorchester Co. v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 792, 506 A.2d 625, 634 (1986) (\u2018application of the State Board of Education\u2019s expertise would clearly be desirable before a court attempts to resolve the\u2019 legal issues).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 783 A.2d 169 (2001), the Court of Appeals was faced with the review of precisely the type of interpretation we are reviewing in this case. Judge Cathell explained why deference is the controlling standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG_\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the facts of the case are not in dispute; however, <em>the Board of Appeals\u2019 interpretation and application of the BCZR is in dispute. </em>As stated in <em>Banks, even though the decision of the Board of Appeals was based on the law, its expertise should be taken into consideration and its decision should be afforded appropriate deference </em>in our analysis of whether it was \u201cpremised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 380, quoting from <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">366 Md. at 173, 783 A.2d 169 (emphasis supplied). See also <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Service Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>305 Md. 145, 161-62, 501 A.2d 1307 (1986); <em>Haigley v. Dept. of Health, </em>128 Md.App. 194, 216-17, 736 A.2d 1185 (1999). Accordingly, \u201cthe expertise of the [Harford County Board of Appeals] in its own field [will] be respected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The Code Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Section 267-10 of the Harford County Zoning Code provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\"><em>The Board, </em>upon application therefor, after notice to the owners of the properties affected and public hearing, <em>may render interpretation of the boundaries of a zoning district by:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>B. Extension of a district: <em>permitting the extension of a district </em>if the boundary line of a district divides a parcel held in single ownership on the effective date of this Part 1, provided that such extension does not exceed one hundred (100) feet beyond the boundary line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9b\">(Emphasis supplied). For the Harford County Board of Appeals, that provision of the Zoning Code is daily grist for its mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The Appellant\u2019s Satisfaction Of Her Burden of Production</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The appellant steadfastly asserts that she satisfied her burden of production under \u00a7 267-10B. We agree wholeheartedly. She did. The complete satisfaction of that burden was articulately summarized by the Hearing Examiner in his recommendations to the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">In the instant case, <em>the Appellant has demonstrated the criteria necessary to meet the standards required by 267-10(B) </em>as recited above. The parcel is split-zoned and such split zoning has existed in single ownership at least since the date of enactment of the Zoning Code (September 1, 1982). There was competent and <em>unrebutted evidence </em>that these criteria existed as early as 1957.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">It is, moreover, no mean accomplishment to have satisfied a burden of production. It was enough to have activated the discretion of the Board, thereby permitting the Board, were it so inclined, to grant the extension sought by the appellant. Had the Board, in its discretion, granted the extension and had People\u2019s Counsel ultimately appealed to us from such a grant, People\u2019s Counsel would have little, if any, chance of overturning the Board\u2019s decision. The appellant\u2019s satisfaction of her burden of production would have provided the Board with a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for having exercised its discretion in the appellant\u2019s favor and there would be little point in challenging it.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Conversely, had the appellant failed to satisfy her burden of production, that failure, <em>ipso facto, </em>would have precluded any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ruling in her favor, as a matter of law. Even had the Board of Appeals actually granted the extension and even had the circuit court affirmed the grant, we, on People\u2019s Counsel\u2019s hypothetical appeal, would have reversed the grant as improper because, had the burden of production not been met, the Board\u2019s discretion to make such grants would not even have been activated.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Thus, the appellant\u2019s successful shouldering of the production burden was the indispensable first step in the process. Unfortunately from the appellant\u2019s point of view, the satisfaction of that burden of production was the high watermark of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The Appellant\u2019s Failure to Satisfy Her Burden of Persuasion</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In arguing more broadly that she thereby satisfied her \u201cburden of proof,\u201d the appellant disingenuously blurs the critical and rudimentary distinction between a burden of production and a burden of persuasion. To satisfy the burden of production is not remotely to satisfy the burden of persuasion. To have produced enough of a case to permit the Board to extend the B-3 zoning boundary was not the end of the appellant\u2019s persuasion process, but only its beginning. Until the burden' of production is a successful <em>fait accompli, </em>an effort at persuasion does not even begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In this case, the existing B-3 zoning boundary was the <em>status quo. </em>The appellant undertook to persuade the Board to alter that <em>status quo. </em>It was the appellant who thereby became the proponent of the proposition on the table for debate, and it was the appellant, therefore, to whom was allocated the burden of persuasion. In this case, the Board was simply not persuaded. The requested extension that would have altered the <em>status quo </em>was accordingly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Perhaps disingenuously, the appellant seems to be operating on the assumption that the allocation of the burden of persuasion is turned in the opposite direction. As if we had stepped with Lewis Carroll <em>Through the Looking Glass, </em>everything in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the appellant\u2019s world is in reverse. The Board of Appeals is chided by the appellant for not having been adequately persuaded NOT to grant the extension. The opponents of the extension are chided by the appellant for having failed to produce \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">It is never the case that the Board must be either 1) persuaded by the appellant to act or 2) persuaded by the opponents not to act. What would happen, in so Manichean a world, if the Board were not persuaded by either side? There is only one burden of persuasion, and it points in only one direction. As a tactical matter, of course, neighbors and other interested parties will probably mount a stronger case in opposition if they actually show up and present evidence. In abstract theory, however, they are not required to do so in order to prevail. They are not required to present any evidence at all, let alone substantial evidence. They are not even required to show up in order to prevail. Even if they had a change of heart and endorsed the request for a change, it could still fall of its own weight. The tribunal that needs to be persuaded may always conclude, \u201cWe have heard what the applicant had to say and we have heard nothing to the contrary, but we are still unpersuaded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Generally speaking, property owners are not entitled to zoning changes automatically just because nobody opposes them. In <em>Pollard\u2019s Towing, Inc. v. Berman\u2019s, </em>137 Md.App. 277, 289-90, 768 A.2d 131 (2001), this Court spoke of the diametric difference between persuasion and non-persuasion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">In this case, all that was required was that the Board be <em>not persuaded </em>that there was a need for additional towing services. To the extent its finding was weightier than that, the incremental weight was surplusage. <em>Far less is required to support a merely negative instance of non-persuasion than is required to support an affirmative instance of actually being persuaded of something. </em>In <em>Starke v. Starke, </em>134 Md.App. 663, 761 A.2d 355 (2000), we discussed that distinction between persuasion and non-persuasion:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>[I]t is far easier to sustain as not clearly erroneous the decisional phenomenon of not being persuaded than it is to sustain the very different decisional phenomenon of being persuaded. Actually, <em>to be persuaded of something requires a requisite degree of certainty on the part of the fact finder </em>(the use of a particular burden of persuasion) <em>based on legally adequate evidentiary support </em>(the satisfaction of a particular burden of production by the proponent). There are with reasonable frequency reversible errors in those regards. <em>Mere non-persuasion, on the other hand, requires nothing but a state of honest doubt. It is virtually, albeit perhaps not totally, impossible to find reversible error in that regard.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">When an administrative agency such as the County Board of Appeals takes an affirmative action, there is required the predicate of substantial evidence to support such an action. When, by contrast, the agency is not persuaded to do anything and, as a result, take no action, there is no such predicate required. An honest doubt is all it takes.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The real world and the mirror world are absolute opposites of each other. There is a subtle, but critical, difference between 1) being PERSUADED NOT TO DO something and 2) being NOT PERSUADED TO DO something. The difference is far from trivial. The former requires some measure of persuasion; the latter requires none. The former carries with it a burden of production; the latter does not. The former shifts the allocation of both burdens of proof from the proponent to the opponent. The appellant would hold the Board of Appeals to the former standard. We will hold the Board of Appeals only to the latter standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u201cMay\u201d Means \u201cMay or May Not\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The Board of Appeals concluded that the appellant\u2019s satisfaction of her burden of production, the minimal threshold requirement for a change even to be considered, did not <em>ipso </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>facto </em>create in the appellant an automatic entitlement to such a change.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">That the sole fact that a parcel is split zoned prior to the adoption of the zoning Code in 1982 <em>does not constitute an entitlement </em>to moving the zoning district(s) by up to 100 feet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The appellant nonetheless stubbornly maintains that her satisfaction of her burden of production compelled, rather than merely permitted, the Board to grant her requested extension and rendered its refusal to do so \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The verb \u201cmay,\u201d to the appellant, is not a grant of permission but a command. We cannot sign on to impressing so Prussian a coloration onto that free-spirited and unconstrained auxiliary verb \u201cmay.\u201d The appellant blinds herself to the luminescent volition beaming from both \u00a7 267-10\u2019s key verb and key gerund:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">The Board ... MAY render interpretations ... by ... PERMITTING the extension of a district....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">That is not only volition, it is volition squared.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Sections 1-11A and 1-11C(4) of the Harford County Code, moreover, unambiguously provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">\u00a7 1-11 Definitions and rules of construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">A. In the interpretation and construction of this Code, the following rules of construction and definitions shall be observed unless inconsistent with definitions specifically enumerated in another Article or section or inconsistent with the manifest intent of the Council or the context and usage clearly requires otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">C. Rules of construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">(4) May. <em>The word \u201cmay\u201d is permissive and discretionary.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">In rendering its decision, the Board expressly found that it enjoyed the discretion to act or not to act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>That \u00a7 1-11C(4) of the Code of Harford county provides that the word \u201cmay\u201d is permissive and discretionary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">In interpreting the provisions of the County Code it deals with on a regular basis, the Board is especially entitled to the deference of reviewing courts. In upholding the interpretation made by the Board in that regard, Judge Plitt, showing the appropriate deference, ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">In this case, <em>both the context of the statute and the purpose of the statute as a whole bolster a finding of a permissive constmction. </em>First, the context of \u00a7 267-10(B) states that the Board <em>\u201cmay </em>render interpretation of the boundaries of a zoning district by: <em>permitting </em>the extension of a district.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>The use of the word \u201cmay\u201d with the word \u201cpermitting\u201d shows a legislative purpose to authorize rather than compel. See generally Charles County Supporting Services Employees Local Union 301, </em>48 Md.App. at 344-45, 427 A.2d 1025.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">Second, the purpose of the statute is to allow for interpretation of a zoning map in four (4) ways: (1) by determining the location of a road or lot layout in \u00a7 267-010(A); (2) extension of a district in \u00a7 267-10(B); (3) adjustment for topography in \u00a7 267-10(C); and (4) adjustment for map errors in \u00a7 267-10(D). Each of these four (4) options allows the Board to make minor adjustments or modifications to the zoning map to more accurately reflect real-life conditions. In fact, Mr. McClune, Manager of the Land Use Management Division of the Harford County Department of Planning and Zoning, testified that it was his understanding that \u00a7 267-10 of the Code was enacted to allow for minor adjustments or minor alterations. <em>See </em>Hearing Transcript, vol 3, pages 2-19\u20143-22. Therefore, <em>even though the Petitioner satisfied the two (2) elements required under \u00a7 267-10(B), the Board is not required to grant the request unless they feel that the minor adjustment or modification is warranted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">(Emphasis supplied). The word \u201cmay,\u201d like the month, is a butterfly. Far be it from us to clap it in irons.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Carrying Coals to Newcastle</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Although legally it might have sufficed to say simply, \u201cWe are unpersuaded,\u201d few members of tribunals are content to be such minimalists. As the County Council, sitting as a Board of Appeals, seeks to put forward its best case for 1) the Harford County electorate; 2) reviewing courts, trial and appellate; and 3) the judgment of history, it may deem it expedient to \u201cgild the lily\u201d a bit for public consumption. Putting one\u2019s best foot forward, however, is merely a gratuitous flourish and does not shift the location of the legally significant finish line. Neither -will it shift the focus of our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In this case, the Board of Appeals chose to expand on several of the ways in which the appellant\u2019s case had been less persuasive than it otherwise might have been. One was its failure to state any plan or purpose for the property if the extension were granted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">9. That a review of previous cases which contained applications requesting the moving of a boundary line of a district pursuant to \u00a7 267-10(B) reveals, in each instance, that the applicant also presented a plan and/or purpose for a specific use of the property if the requested moving of the boundary line was granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">10. That the Applicant in this case presented no evidence in support of her request beyond showing that the property was split zoned and was so zoned prior to the adoption of the Zoning Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The second failure in mounting a more effective argument was the omission of any reason why an extension of less than 100 feet would not have sufficed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">11. That the Applicant further, has presented no evidence or justification for a request of moving the boundary line 100 feet rather than some distance less than the maximum allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Those explanations of why the case was not more effective do not in any way constitute, as the appellant now argues, an instance of the Board of Appeals\u2019s usurping the legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>function and creating additional qualifying requirements not mentioned by the controlling statute. This was simply an informal discussion of factors which, when present, may be persuasive but which, when absent, self-evidently cannot be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Board of Appeals also pointed out that the same zoning change sought by the appellant had, in effect, recently been considered by the County Council as part of the comprehensive rezoning process and had been rejected.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">7. That the parcel in question was subject to extensive review by the Harford County Council during the most recently concluded comprehensive rezoning process in 1997 wherein the property owner\u2019s request to rezone the parcel to B3 was denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">That discussion does not represent, as the appellant now argues, a case of the Board\u2019s erroneously considering matters outside the record. In terms of the personal knowledge of the Board members, moreover, the Board of Appeals and the County Council were one and the same. (We are not suggesting that that identity is critical to our appraisal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">A Parthian Dart</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">If any additional factor were needed (it is not) to assist in the statutory construction of \u00a7 267-10B of the Harford County Zoning Code, the axiomatic warning to avoid an \u201cillogical or unreasonable result\u201d would loom large on our horizon. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628 (1987); <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Both the appellees and Judge Plitt pointed out the \u201cillogical and unreasonable\u201d consequences that could readily follow if the appellant\u2019s mechanistic reading of the section were to prevail. Monday\u2019s automatic extension could be followed by a similarly automatic and incremental extension on Tuesday, by yet another on Wednesday, and so on until the expanding B-3 zone had bumped up against the appellant\u2019s property line or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the Pennsylvania state border. Judge Plitt described the bizarre consequences that could flow from such a construction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">If this Court were to find that fulfillment of the two (2) statutory criteria alone required the Board to grant the Petitioner\u2019s request, not only would the legislative purpose be subverted, but <em>an absurd result, inconsistent with common sense, would be the outcome. </em>If the Board did not have the discretion to grant or deny the request, <em>the statute could be used as an end-run to zoning. </em>Essentially, any landowner who meets the two (2) statutory criteria could keep coming back for another 100 foot extension until their property was effectively rezoned as they wished, even if that rezoning ran contrary to a comprehensive rezoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACC\">(Emphasis supplied). The avoidance of such a result would seem to make much sense, but that observation on our part is surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
