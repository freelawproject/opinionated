It is fundamental that statutes imposing additional burdens or infringing upon a man\u2019s property rights, are strictly construed.

It shall be the duty of every railroad company in this State to place and keep that portion of its road-bed and right of way over or across which any public county road may run, in proper condition for the use of the traveling public, and in case of its failure to do so for thirty days after written notice given to the section boss of the section where such work or repairs are needed, by the overseer of such public road, it shall be liable to a penalty of $10 for each and every week such railroad company may fail or neglect to comply with the requirements of this article, recoverable in any court having jurisdiction of the amount involved, in a suit in the name of the county in which the cause of action accrued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In the exercise of its police power the Legislature had the authority to' require railroad companies to make and keep in repair the crossings of public county roads over and upon their railroads and their right-of-way. Railway v. Rowland, 70 Texas, 307; State v. Railway, 45 N. W. Rep., (Neb.) 469; Railway v. Commissioners; 79 Me., 386; Railway v. Deering, 78 Me., 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The law required this railroad company to place and keep in repair that portion of its road and right-of-way embraced in the county highway at the point of intersection, and in the discharge of that and other duties imposed upon it by the law, the railroad company might be compelled to do all of the things for which it claimed damages in this case. But it cannot be held under the statute that the county must compensate the railroad company for doing those things which the law required it to do, although that duty arose out of the fact that the county highway was laid out across the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Counsel for the appellant in this case admits that after the crossing was once constructed the railroad company must keep it in repair. The statute says that the railroad company shall place it in a safe condition and shall keep it in such condition, and this, in the absence of other provisions, necessarily imposes upon it the duty of constructing the crossing in the first instance, as well in those cases where the county road is laid out subsequently to the building of the railroad, as in cases where the county road existed before the railroad was constructed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
