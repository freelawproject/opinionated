Rev. Stats., art. 996, see. 3; Railway v. Langsdale, 88 Texas, 513.

A. Turner, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A56\">The only question presented in this case is: When an attachment is wrongfully issued and levied when does the cause of action arise against the sureties on the attachment bond? It arises the instant the seizure is made. 74 Texas, 121; 64 Texas, 99; 54 Texas, 586. It arises against the sureties at the same time it does against the principal, and they can be sued together with the principal without first judicially ascertaining a breach of the bond on the part of the principal. 46 Texas, 589.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-5\">Commencement of suit against the principal does not arrest the running of limitation in favor of the sureties. 77 Texas, 250. The statute of limitation begins to run from the date when plaintiff could sue. Rev. Stats., 1895, art. 3354; 64 Texas, 90; 85 Texas, 353; 55 Texas, 480. The mere suing out of an attachment gives no cause of action for damages. 62 Texas, 675; 65 Texas, 298; 69 Texas, 603; 79 Texas, 464.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-6\">In our opinion 46 Texas, 589, settles this case. The conditions of a sequestration and an attachment bond are substantially the same. In a supplemental brief, counsel for appellees also cited: Stanley v. Schwalby, 85 Texas, 348; Kaufman v.

Meyer and Co. sued M. Jordan in the County Court of Bowie County on an account for $664.54, and procured the issuance of an attachment and caused it to be levied upon a stock of goods belonging to the defendant. M. Jordan reconvened in the attachment suit for the recovery of damages, upon the ground that the writ was wrongfully sued out. The cause was tried February 3, 1894, resulting in a verdict and judgment in favor of M. Jordan upon his plea in reconvention for damages. The liability of the sureties upon the attachment bond was not adjudicated in the original attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">\u201cFebruary 29, 1896, this suit was instituted upon the attachment bond to recover of the obligors in the attachment bond the damages awarded M. Jordan in the attachment suit on account of the wrongful suing out of the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">\u201cAt the time this suit upon the bond was filed, more than four years had elapsed since the seizure of the goods under the attachment, and two years and six days had elapsed since the trial of the attachment suit and the rendition of the judgment for damages in favor of M. Jordan. The attachment bond was in statutory form.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201cQuestion. Was this suit barred under the statute of limitations of four years at the time of its institution?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQm\">The condition prescribed by statute for an attachment bond is \u201cthat the plaintiff will prosecute his suit to effect, and will pay all such damages and costs as shall be adjudged against him for wrongfully suing out such attachment.\u201d' According to the certificate the suit is to recover for breach of that part of the condition that plaintiff \u201cwill pay,\u201d etc., and to that will our decision be confined. If the attachment was wrongfully sued out a cause of action against the principal and sureties on the bond \u201carose at the very instant the seizure was made.\u201d (Torrey &amp; Co., v. Schneider &amp; Davis, 74 Texas, 116; Weaver v. Ashcroft, 50 Texas, 444; Tompkins v. Toland, 46 Texas, 584.) Since the sureties were not sued within four years from that date the action against them was barred, though the judgment rendered against the principal February 3, 1894, would prevent any bar as to him. (Kaufman v. Wolf, 77 Texas, 255; Rev. Stats., arts. 3356 and 3358.) We therefore answer the question certified in the affirmative as to the sureties and in the negative as to the principal. While the cause of action on the bond accrues at time of the levy the measure of damages would doubtless depend upon what disposition had been made of the attached property at the time of the trial of the action upon the bond. 74 Texas, supra; Rev. Stats., Tit. X, eh. 1.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
