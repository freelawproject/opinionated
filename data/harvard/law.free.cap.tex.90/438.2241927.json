Second. Where the title is vested .by deed complete, the same will not be defeated or controlled by authority given to sell in the habendum clause of a second conveyance of other property, although written on the same paper. Third. The habendum clause will not have the effect to destroy the title which has been conveyed in the body of the deed, and will not be read for the purpose of contradicting the deed, although a part of the deed in which the title is conveyed. Fourth. The habendum clause can only be looked to for the purpose of explaining a deed where it is not explicit, and cannot be made to control or contradict the express language of the conveying part of said deed. Fifth. WTiere a deed conveys title to four separate parties, authority to one to sell that \u201cdeeded to her,\u201d does not show an intention to authorize her to sell that deeded to other parties. Sixth. Power to sell is incident to ownership, and a grantor cannot, after conveying the title, reserve the right to sell or give the right to another, especially where no trust is specified or defined; such a construction would allow the title defeated without any benefit to the vendee or liability upon the trustee. Seventh. The deed by Mitchell and wife to Adams and Wickes shows no intention to convey under a power, and only conveys that deeded to wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-3\">The deed under which appellees claim is a full statutory warranty deed: Rev.

B. Adams and E. D. L. Wickes?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We answer that the deed made by Laura J. \u00e1nd H. A. Mitchell to-Adams &amp; Wickes did not convey to the latter the interest of the appelleesin the land embraced in that deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The intention of H. A. Mitchell in making the deed to Laura J. Mitchell, his wife, and Julia, Ella and Leonora Mitchell, his children, must be ascertained from the language used by him. That instrument embraces two distinct and complete conveyances of different property. It first conveys to Laura J. Mitchell and Julia, Ella and Leonora, specific-property set out and described in the deed, which includes that involved in this suit; and secondly, it conveys to the same parties all of the property that the grantor might be entitled to receive from his father\u2019s estate which had not been delivered to him before the making of that instrument and empowered Laura J. Mitchell to receive and receipt for the \u201csame.\u201d Two distinct powers of sale are embodied in that instrument. The first empowers Laura J. Mitchell to sell all of the property which she might receive from the estate of H. A. Mitchell\u2019s father under that deed; secondly, it empowers her \u201cto sell, convey and dispose of any or all of the property herein deeded to her for her own use and for the use and benefit of said minor children, as she may see proper and fit.\u201d The purpose for which the sale -was authorized to be made was the use and benefit of Laura. J. Mitchell and the children, and the property which was authorized to be sold was all that was \u201cdeeded to her.\u201d The interest of the children Julia, Ella and Leonora was distinctly and clearly deeded to them, and was not deeded to Laura J. Mitchell; therefore she was not by the terms of this power authorized to sell their interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">It is urged in argument that the purpose for which the land was to be sold was the support of the wife and children and that it is not reasonable to suppose that the grantor intended to appropriate to this purpose the share of the wife alone; that was a question for the grantor to determine before he made the deed and not for the court to decide in order to control the construction of the instrument. It appears from the face of this instrument that the grantor intended to subject to the use of the family all of the property which might be received from his father\u2019s estate, and the interest which he conveyed to the wife in the property specifically described, leaving that conveyed to the children for their separate benefit. This may have been a proper disposition of the property under the circumstances. Granting, however, that it was not, and that it would have been more reasonable to have authorized the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>that portion deeded to the children a's well as that deeded to the wife, nevertheless the property belonged to H. A. Mitchell and he had a right to dispose of it according to his own judgment and inclination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
