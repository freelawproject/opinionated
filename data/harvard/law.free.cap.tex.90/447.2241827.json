Ten per cent being the highest legal rate, the appellants were only entitled to recover double the excess over ten per cent per annum, and therefore the judgment of the court was proper. Bank v.

Traders\u2019 National Bank, and we think it should have the same construction as there given to the Act of Congress. Therefore, in answer to the question certified, we hold that \u201cthe party suing is entitled to recover double the whole amount of interest so received.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
