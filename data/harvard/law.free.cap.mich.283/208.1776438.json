The record shows that there were three eyewitnesses to the accident who testified at the trial. All witnesses agree that immediately before the cars collided, each car was on its proper side of the highway. Plaintiff testified that at all times he was driving on the proper side of the highway and at least 18 inches from the center. Leo Walker, a witness riding in the front seat with plaintiff, testified that plaintiff was upon his proper side of the road; that the car did not swerve before the collision; and that plaintiff\u2019s car was a distance of from 12 to 20 inches from the center line of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Defendant testified that as the cars were passing each other, the rear end of plaintiff\u2019s car \u201cslued or skidded\u201d across the center line of the highway and caught the front fender of defendant\u2019s car. Defendant also testified that after the accident he traced the tracks of plaintiff\u2019s car through the slush and found that the marks were over the center of the highway. The evidence as' to the marks in the slush was corroborated by the testimony of Miss Larsen who arrived upon the scene after the accident occurred. However, plaintiff\u2019s witness testified that the road was wet, but with no slush upon the highway as the snow melted as soon- as it reached the pavement. The principal issue involved in this case presents a question of fact. The trial court had the privilege of seeing and hearing the witnesses testify. He found that there \u201cwas no evidence whatever of negligence on the part of the plaintiff\u201d and awarded plaintiff damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Tbe only conclusion tbat can be arrived at from tbe court\u2019s findings is tbat plaintiff was free from contributory negligence; and that the collision occurred by reason of the negligence of defendant. In <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Hey, </em>269 Mich. 491 (37 N. C. C. A. 111), we held that we do not substitute our judgment on questions' of fact unless the evidence clearly preponderates in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">See, also, <em>Paton </em>v. <em>Stealy, </em>272 Mich. 57; <em>Baumgartner </em>v. <em>St. Armour, </em>276 Mich. 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">To say that the alleged negligence of the defendant was not established does violence to the policy of this court as enunciated in <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Hey, supra, </em>and to hold otherwise would be a substitution of our judgment for that of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The judgment is affirmed. Plaintiff may recover costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-8\">Butzel, Bushnell, Potter, and McAllister, JJ., concurred with Sharpe, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b246-9\">Wiest, C.

The evening of January 4, 1936, plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s automobiles approached one another, each on its proper side of the center line of a paved highway but, in passing, there was a collision between the left front of def end-ant\u2019s car and the left rear side of plaintiff\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Plaintiff claims that defendant\u2019s car, after passing the front of his car, turned to the left and caused the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">Defendant claims that, as he passed the front of plaintiff\u2019s car, the rear of that car slued into the pathway of his car, and that caused the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">The issues were tried before the court, and a finding made that defendant was guilty of negligence and there was \u201cno evidence whatever of negligence on the part of plaintiff, and the contact not being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>with the front of plaintiff\u2019s car, bnt with his rear, the court finds for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Presumably the court thought the statute, 1 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 4788, helpful in determining fault. That statute creates a <em>prima facie </em>presumption of negligence where one vehicle overtakes and strikes the rear end of another vehicle proceeding in the same direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In the instance at bar the vehicles were traveling in opposite directions and there was no rear-end collision and no presumption of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The finding of \u201cno evidence whatever of negligence on the part of plaintiff\u201d was not equivalent to an affirmative finding that plaintiff was free from contributory negligence, and leaves that finding subject to the criticism of counsel for defendant that the court entertained the view that the burden was on defendant to make a showing on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The plaintiff had the burden of establishing the alleged negligence of defendant and his own free-' dom from contributory negligence. This is too elementary to require citation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The pavement was narrow, but wide enough to afford clearance of the cars if on the proper sides of the center line.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Defendant claims that it was snowing and there was slush upon the pavement; while plaintiff claims the pavement was only wet from snow melting as it fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Each driver saw the approach of the other and agree that each one was on his proper side of the center line of the pavement when the fronts of the cars came opposite one another. Prom that point they disagreed, plaintiff claiming that his car continued its straight course, and defendant\u2019s car turned into collision with the rear side thereof; while de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>fendant claims that bis car continued in its straight course but the rear of plaintiff\u2019s car slued across the center line of the pavement and into the pathway of his car and caused the collision. The claims of both parties have supporting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Avis Larsen, a school teacher, arrived at the scene of the accident right after the happening thereof and testified that marks in the slush showed that the rear wheels of plaintiff\u2019s car slued across the center line of the pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The trial judge gave little weight to her testimony, because she was acquainted with defendant and, she \u201csaw what she saw under the direction of the defendant,\u201d and her testimony \u201cthat there was slush on the pavement, and car tracks in the slush\u201d was \u201cdirectly denied not only by the plaintiff, but by Mr. Walker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Miss Larsen\u2019s testimony, of course, was not con-. trolling but had bearing upon the issue of the preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Plaintiff, to have recovery, was required to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the collision was occasioned by the negligence of defendant and, upon review, where trial was without a jury, and the point is presented, we must determine whether the judgment is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">In the case at bar the alleged negligence of defendant was not established by a preponderance of the evidence, and the judgment should be reversed, without a new trial, and with costs of both courts to defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-10\">Chandler and North, JJ., concurred with Wiest, C.
