By these contracts plaintiff had agreed to purchase from John Zynda, Sr., trustee, certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>lots in a Macomb county subdivision. Defendants, claiming plaintiff\u2019s suit was barred by statutory limitations, moved to dismiss tbe bill of complaint. This motion was granted and plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The land contracts were entered into April 12, 1926. The total purchase price was $3,450. Approximately one-half was paid prior to December 28, 1927, on which date John Zynda, Sr., died. He left an estate in excess of $350,000. The individual defendants are the legatees each of whom received upwards of $19,000 from the estate. Defendants Anna Zynda and Joseph Zynda were appointed executors and plaintiff paid to these executors the balance of the contract price. The final payment was made October 9, 1929. Plaintiff resided in Massachusetts. After payment in full of the contracts, from time to time he made inquiry and demand, by letter and other means, of the executors for performance of the vendor\u2019s obligations under the land contracts, and he was advised that performance could not be tendered for the reason, among others, that the Zynda estate was in process of administration and that title could not be made until some future date, but that ultimately the contract obligations of the vendor would be performed in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">By the terms of these contracts, upon payment in full, the vendor was to convey by warranty deed a marketable title and provide vendee with an abstract for each lot. The vendor also agreed \u201cto gravel streets and to lay cement sidewalks.\u201d In April, 1936, an abstract of title was tendered to plaintiff\u2019s counsel but it disclosed that the lots were incumbered. On or about September 15, 1936, plaintiff\u2019s counsel was notified that the incumbrance had been removed and that defendants would soon be able to deed the property. About this time plaintiff ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>tained that the streets had not been graveled and the cement walks had not been laid. He informed defendants that he would not accept conveyance of the lots until the agreed improvements were made. Defendants Joseph and John Zynda requested further delay until the return of the widow, Anna Zynda, from Germany. An adjustment not having been accomplished, plaintiff started suit March 10, 1937. Defendants have never conveyed title nor tendered conveyance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The reasons assigned by defendants in support of their motion to dismiss are that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is barred by the six-year statute of limitations (3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13976) and by plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a claim against the estate of John Zynda, Sr., in accordance with statutory requirements. The trial judge sustained defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations, and also on the further grounds that plaintiff did not present his claim against the Zynda estate within two years after the granting of letters testamentary (3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13981) and that he did not file a contingent claim as provided by statute (3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 15708).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">If the trial court was correct in holding that the six-year statute of limitations barred plaintiff\u2019s suit, his holding is decisive of this appeal. However, appellant asserts that the six-year limitation is not applicable because this suit is one \u201cfounded\u201d upon covenant, and therefore comes within the statutory provision which in part reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u201cActions founded upon covenants in deeds * * * may be brought at any time within 10 years from the time * * * when the cause of action accrued on such * * * covenant.\u201d 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13976.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>MM cannot agree with appellant that Ms suit is one which comes witbin tbe abo.ve quoted statutory limitation. His bill is one for <em>rescission </em>of the two contracts. Neither fraud nor mistake is alleged. Instead vendor\u2019s failure to fulfill tbe terms of tbe contracts is alleged as tbe ground for rescission. Sucb failure was known at all times to plaintiff, or at least would bave been known to bim bad be exercised anything like reasonable diligence in ascertaining tbe facts. A bill for rescission of a contract, even though under seal, is not founded upon covenant in sucb contract, <em>i. e., </em>it is not a bill asldng affirmative relief based upon a covenant. Instead tbe rescission here sought is relief of directly tbe opposite character. Tbe prayer in plaintiff\u2019s bill for rescission is that tbe entire contract be abrogated and moneys paid by bim under tbe contract be decreed to be repaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u201cTo rescind a contract is not merely to terminate it, but to abrogate and undo it from tbe beginning; that is, not merely to release tbe parties from further obligation to each other in respect to tbe subject of the contract, but to annul tbe contract and restore tbe parties to tbe relative positions which they would bave occupied if no such contract bad ever been made. Rescission necessarily involves a repudiation of tbe contract and a refusal of tbe moving party to be further bound by it. But this by itself would constitute no more tbab a breach of tbe contract or a refusal of performance, while tbe idea of rescission involves tbe additional and distinguishing element of a restoration of tbe <em>status quo.\u201d </em>1 Black on Rescission and Cancellation (2d Ed.), \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">As contradistinguished from rescission, a suit founded on covenant seeks affirmatively to enforce tbe terms of tbe covenant by way of specific per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>formance or by recovery of damages for a breach of the covenant by one who relies upon the covenant and asserts his rights thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Not only is rescission the opposite of covenant in the character of the relief sought, but of necessity the results which follow the respective actions are opposite or at least distinctly different. Rescission wholly abrogates the contract and restores the parties to a <em>status quo; </em>but covenant perpetuates the contract and affords the moving litigant his rights thereunder. Because of this difference courts have uniformly required a plaintiff in rescission to assert his right to rescind without any unnecessary delay. Otherwise he will be denied the relief. In many cases the right to have rescission has been held to have been lost by laches within a much shorter period than the six-year statute of limitations. It is obvious that a prolonged period of time within which to bring an action for rescission would be quite incompatible with the character of the relief sought. A party asking restoration of the <em>status quo </em>for obvious reasons should be required to move promptly. Equity will not permit one possessed of a right of rescission to delay unduly in the exercise of that right and while so doing speculate on the outcome of the transaction at the risk of his adversary.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u2018 \u2018 The form of action fixes the bar rather than the cause of action. For instance, if plaintiff has a choice between two forms of action, the one brought by bim determines the period of limitation applicable.\u201d 1 Green\u2019s Michigan Practice (Nichols\u2019 3d Ed.), p. 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">To the same effect, see <em>Christy </em>v. <em>Farlin, 49 </em>Mich. 319; <em>Avery, for the use of Aultman, </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>81 Mich. 85; <em>Stringer </em>v. <em>Stevens\u2019 Estate, </em>146 Mich. 181 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(8 L. R. A. [N. S.] 393, 117 Am. St. Rep. 620, 10 Ann. Cas. 337).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">Plaintiff\u2019s canse of action accrued when he paid in full the contract price in October, 1929. But he did not start his suit for rescission until March 10, 1937. The circuit judge was right in dismissing the bill of complaint on the ground that the suit was barred by the six-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">It should be noted that we do not pass upon appellees\u2019 contention that executory land contracts are not \u201cdeeds\u201d in the sense in which that word is used in 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13976, hereinbefore quoted. In part this contention is based upon 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13309, which provides that such executory contracts are not embraced in the term \u201cconveyance\u201d as used in chapter 260, 3 Comp. Laws 1929, under the title of \u201cconveyances of real property.\u201d See 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13278 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We are not in accord with appellant\u2019s contention that notwithstanding rescission is sought in the instant case, plaintiff may (under his prayer for general relief) be granted specific performance. The latter is wholly inconsistent with the former and the right to such relief might depend upon wholly different facts and circumstances. Disposition of the instant case can be made without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s right, if any, to institute suit for specific performance. 1 Black on Rescission and Cancellation (2d Ed.), \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Dismissal by the circuit court of the bill of complaint is affirmed, with costs to appellees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-7\">Wiest, C.
