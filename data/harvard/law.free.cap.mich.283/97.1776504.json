The defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">While defendants admit plaintiff was entitled to a judgment in assumpsit for the above amount against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>defendant Irene G. Kolowich, they assert on this appeal that there was error on the part of the trial judge, who tried the case without a jury, in finding a judgment against both defendants on the ground of the alleged fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">George J. Kolowich was the president of the State Bank of America and owned approximately 65 per cent, of its stock. He and his wife, Irene G. Kolowich, for years had been in a partnership business known as Kolowich &amp; Company which conducted the Merchants <em>&amp; </em>Mechanics Bank of Hamtramck, Michigan. No question is raised as to the, legal status of the so-called partnership between a husband and wife. On October 4,1929, Mrs. Kolowich borrowed $24,000 from the State Bank of America. She executed a collateral form promissory note which was secured by 7,906 shares of Detroit Housing preferred stock and 7,906 shares of Detroit Housing common stock. She gave a renewal note of like character on May 29, 1930. In this renewal note it was recited that the total value of the above mentioned collateral was $103,987, though there is some testimony that this was stated as \u201cbook\u201d value. On the date of the original loan Mrs. Kolowich received a cashier\u2019s check from the State Bank of America for $24,000, and on this same day the check was deposited in the American State Bank to the account of the Merchants &amp; Mechanics Bank. Later (October 24,1929) the board of directors approved a line of credit to Mrs. Kolowich in the amount of $25,000. Previous to making the $24,000 loan she had borrowed from and repaid to the bank large sums. At the time Mrs. Kolowich obtained this loan, Mr. Kolowich had already borrowed from the State Bank of America, of which he was president, in excess of the amount limited by statute. Act No, 66, \u00a7 25, Pub, Acts 1929, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>being 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 11922. It is plaintiff\u2019s theory that this $24,000 loan was secured by Irene G. Kolowich at the behest and for the benefit of her husband, George J. Kolowich, who could not legally secure a further loan for himself from the State Bank of America, and that either Mr. Kolowich or the partnership made up of Mr. Kolowich and Mrs. Kolowich actually received the proceeds of the loan. The loan was not paid at maturity and later the deposited collateral was sold for $9,626. This amount was credited on the note. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants herein concealed the actual nature of the transaction from the directors of the State Bank of America, and that by thus obtaining a loan for the benefit of Mr. Kolowich or for the partnership of which he was a member in excess of the amount he could lawfully borrow from the bank a fraud was perpetrated on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In their brief appellants state:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u201cWe are willing to concede that if the copartnership of George J. Kolowich and Irene G. Kolowich, doing business as the Merchants &amp; Mechanics Bank, had borrowed $24,000 from the State Bank of America, that such a loan would have been illegal and a fraud on the part of the partners, because the partnership note would be charged against Mr. Kolowich\u2019s line of credit. * * <em>* </em>And it is not disputed that George J. Kolowich, on October 4, 1929, had exceeded his line of credit with the bank. It is our contention, however, that the loan of $24,000 to Irene G. Kolowich, was not a loan to the partnership, but was a loan to Irene G. Kolowich personally. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">If this $24,000 loan was merely a loan in the name of Irene G. Kolowich, but in fact was a loan to Mr. Kolowich or the partnership composed of himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>and his wife, it was made in violation of the statutory limitation; and appellants concede its consummation in that event was a fraud upon the bank and its unpaid creditors. There is no testimony that the loan was approved by a two-thirds vote of the bank\u2019s directors, as is required in a loan of this character by the above cited statute. So the controlling issue to be determined is whether this loan was in fact a loan to Irene G. Kolowich personally; or was it a loan to George J. Kolowich or the partnership Kolowich &amp; Company, obtained through a subterfuge whereby the loan on its face appeared to be to Irene G. Kolowich.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\">In support of their claim that this was an individual loan to Mrs. Kolowich, appellants point out that there was nothing on the face of the note which in any way indicated it was a loan to or for the benefit of either Mr. Kolowich or the partnership, that the note was signed by Irene G. Kolowich personally, that the name of George J. Kolowich nowhere appears on the note, and that approximately 5,000 shares of the stock deposited as collateral security was the individual property of Mrs. Kolowich; and other inferences from the testimony of like character are' stressed by appellants. On the other hand, appellee contends that the following facts and circumstances appearing in the record sustain his contention that in truth this loan through subterfuge and deceit was unlawfully obtained for the benefit of the Merchants &amp; Mechanics Bank, owned and operated by the partnership, Kolowich &amp; Company. Immediately upon securing the cashier\u2019s check for $24,000 this item was deposited in the American State Bank for the benefit of and to the account of the Merchants &amp; Mechanics Bank. Mrs. Kolowich did not appear as a witness; and Mr. Kolowich, who was called as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>witness by plaintiff under the statute (3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 14220) and who seemed to be the person who had most knowledge of the details of this transaction, was unable to state what, if any, of the claimed loan to the Merchants <em>&amp; </em>Mechanics Bank was taken by Mrs. Kolowich. A rather searching investigation of the records of the Merchants &amp; Mechanics Bank reveal no trace of such a transaction. Instead the funds obtained from the State Bank of America on the note signed by Irene Gf. Kolowich were immediately turned over for the use and benefit of the Merchants &amp; Mechanics Bank, no part of the loan appearing to have been used by Mrs. Kolowich for her individual benefit. Further, 2,906 units of the stock deposited as collateral to the $24,000 loan were owned jointly by Mr. and Mrs. Kolowich. In addition to this George J. Kolowich conveyed to the bank his interest in certain real property which he owned either individually or jointly with Mrs. Kolowich as collateral security for this and other loans. Mr. Kolowich gave the following testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><em>\u201c Q. Now </em>does that refresh your recollection as to your testimony over there, that it was your claim there that your wife made a loan, made this particular loan of $24,000 for the purpose of loaning it to the M. <em>&amp; </em>M. bank, isn\u2019t that it?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I take it that way, yes, sir. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u2018 \u2018 <em>Q. </em>What were you having your wife borrow the $24,000 then for, if you did not need it?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I could not say. It may have been used for investment. It may have been used for assisting some other corporation that we were interested in. It may have been borrowed to assist the banking company. But I do know <em>we </em>borrowed money and we put up good collateral at that time. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b140-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>If a borrower, after obtaining a bank loan amounting to tbe maximum permitted by law, secures an additional loan tbrougb an irresponsible \u2018 \u2018 dummy, \u2019 \u2019 he would be guilty of fraud. If a loan is made by tbe borrower\u2019s wife, after be bas obtained tbe legal limit from tbe bank, it casts suspicion on the transaction. It is contended that be would not be guilty of fraud if tbe intermediary were a responsible person wbo deposited adequate collateral to secure tbe loan. Even tbougb Mrs. Kolowicb may bave been responsible, and even tbougb tbe collateral deposited may bave been satisfactory, a further obligation rested on Kolowicb. He was dealing with bis own bank, of which be was president, director and owner of over 60 per cent, of tbe stock. Without question tbe proceeds of tbe loan were for Kolowicb\u2019s benefit. Furthermore, be bad an interest in part of tbe collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\">Tbe legislature bas seen fit to permit directors and officers of a bank to borrow from that bank. 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 11922. However, tbe directors and officers of any corporation stand in a fiduciary position and may deal with tbe corporation only in good faith, with all material facts made known to tbe other directors. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Hellner Realty Co., </em>265 Mich. 625. Tbe director bas tbe burden of proving tbe fairness and honesty of bis dealings with tbe corporation. <em>Veeser </em>v. <em>Robinson Hotel Co., </em>275 Mich. 133. These rules should be applied even more stringently to an officer and director of a bank wbo should be concerned with tbe welfare of depositors as well as that of customers and stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">As an officer and director, Kolowicb could not deal with tbe bank, either directly or indirectly, by having Mrs. Kolowicb obtain a loan for bis benefit, without disclosing all of tbe facts to tbe other di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>rectors and appropriate officers and first obtaining their approval and proper corporate action. The law demands the fullest disclosure and fair dealing by a director or officer in his relations with a bank. It further requires an approval by a two-thirds vote of the directors of a loan in excess of 10 per cent, of the capital and surplus. Although he was in a position to know all of the facts and circumstances; Kolowich\u2019s testimony was evasive. He did not disclose the manner in which the loan was handled by the bank. He did not tell whether or not the other officers and directors knew of the intended loan before it was made and had an opportunity to pass on its wisdom. The formal approval of the directors was not obtained until after the loan had been made. There is no showing that an approval by two-thirds of the directors was ever obtained. The conduct of Kolowich in obtaining the funds of the bank falls far short of that required of an officer and director of a bank. From all the circumstances we must conclude that Kolowich fraudulently obtained the funds of the bank and therefore is obliged to repay them; that his unpaid liabilities thus exceeded the statutory limit; and that the tort judgment against him was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The case against Mrs. Kolowich, however, fails for lack of proof. The burden of showing fraud was on plaintiff, but it was not sustained. The loan to Mrs. Kolowich was made October 4, 1929. It was secured by 7,906 shares of preferred and an equal number of shares of common stock of the Detroit Housing Corporation. According to the report of certified public accountants filed with the bank, the book value of the pledged stock on June 30, 1929, was $96,265. No evidence was introduced to show that the book value was not the actual value. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>stock was sold in units of one share of preferred and one share of common stock. Mr. Kolowich testified that he paid as low as $6 per unit and as high as $12.50 for the stock. At the lower price the stock would be worth $47,436 and at the higher one $98,825. The stock was sold by the receiver of the bank on February 20, 1931, for $9,626. This sale took place almost 17 months after the beginning of the depression. Mr. Riopelle, a former director of the State Bank of America, testified that Mrs. Kolowich had made and repaid previous loans from the bank and when the $24,000 credit was extended to her, he felt that the bank was amply protected by the collateral offered and the responsibility of Mrs. Kolowich. The fact that the proceeds of the loan were used to bolster up the credit of a private bank in which Mrs. Kolowich was a partner does not prove any fraud. She had a right to raise money in a legal manner t\u00f3 help her husband. Her credit being good and the security being adequate, Mrs. Kolowich would be liable for conspiracy to defraud only upon a showing that she knew Mr. Kolowich had reached his limit, that he was obtaining these additional funds by improper means, and that she intended to assist him in the fraudulent scheme. The burden was on plaintiff to prove fraud on her part, since she had no fiduciary duty to the bank, but no evidence of Mrs. Kolowich\u2019s knowledge or intentions was introduced. We do not believe that on this record, defendant Mrs. Kolowich should be held liable in tort. The judge made no finding of fraud as a matter of fact, but in denying the motion for a new trial, he stated that he found defendants guilty of fraud as a matter of law. The judgment against Mrs. Kolowich in tort should be reversed. Her attorneys concede that her sole liability would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>be in assumpsit, but a judgment in assumpsit cannot be rendered in the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Tbe declaration is rather crudely drawn and seeks a judgment against John C. Finan, Irene G. Kolowich and George J. Kolowich, by reason of conspiracy, concealment and unlawful acts of each of them. It makes the direct charge that George J. Kolowich, a director and president of the bank, borrowed $24,000 and other sums in excess of the maximum amount that he could legally borrow under Act No. 66, \u00a7 25, Pub. Acts 1929 (3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 11922), by inducing bis wife to obtain a loan from the bank. It also charges Mrs. Kolowich with conspiring with her husband to defraud the bank. While the liability of Kolowich for fraud has been established, the charge of conspiracy to defraud against Mrs. Kolowich has not. The case was dismissed as to defendant Finan.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The judgment against Mr. Kolowich is affirmed, that against Mrs. Kolowich is reversed, and the case remanded to the trial court to enter a judgment of not guilty against Mrs. Kolowich. Plaintiff will'recover his costs from Mr. Kolowich and Mrs. Kolowich will be entitled to costs from plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-7\">Wiest, C. J., and Btjshnell, Sharpe, Potter, Chandler, and North, JJ., concurred. Fead, J., took no part in this decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
