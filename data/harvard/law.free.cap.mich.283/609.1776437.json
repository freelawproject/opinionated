W. Brooks, trustee, his successors and assigns, a strip of land 1,400 feet in length, more or less, varying in width from 35 to 45 feet, lying north of and adjacent to the fence of the north line of the highway and located in the east half of the southwest quarter of section one, in the township of Ypsilanti, Washtenaw county. This deed contained the following provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Said strip of land shall be used for railroad purposes only and ceasing to be used for such purposes shall revert to said parties of the first part, their heirs or assigns. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">In 1916, Dolby and wife, by warranty deed, conveyed to plaintiffs Parke and wife all of the east half of the southwest quarter of section 1, et cetera, excepting a parcel in the southwest corner thereof, containing about 16 rods, and excepting the strip of land deeded to Brooks. The Dolby-Parke deed contained the following.provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">\u201cSaid strip of land is to be used for railroad purposes only, and ceasing to be used for such purposes, shall revert to said second parties, their heirs and assigns. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">We might state here that the record does not contain copies of the deeds in question and we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>confined to quotations in the record, the opinion of the trial judge and briefs of the parties, which are somewhat conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In 1926, Parke and wife conveyed certain lands to Dolby and wife which may or may not be the same as those conveyed in 1916, but the conveyance of 1926 does except a strip of land north of the fence on the north line of the highway \u2014 \u2018 \u2018 extending across the entire front of the land of said parties of the first part on section one, said strip of land being 45 feet in width. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">This deed contained the following provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\u2018\u2018 Said strip of land is to be used for railroad purposes only, and ceasing to be used for said purposes, shall revert to said second parties, their heirs and assigns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">In 1930, Brooks conveyed the strip of land in question to Grover C. Dillman, then State highway commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Plaintiffs Dolby and wife, by bill of complaint filed November 25, 1931, and amended bill filed May 7, 1932, claim that title reverted to themselves by reason of non-use of the strip for railroad purposes and by reason of the terms of the conveyance of 1930. They also claim title by adverse possession and charge that defendants State highway commissioner and Washtenaw county road commissioners and their contractor are interfering with their peaceful possession of the strip. They seek a decree establishing title in themselves, free of the claims of Brooks, his successors and assigns. Just how the remaining plaintiffs, whose names are printed on appellants\u2019 brief, come into the case we are not informed, but, whatever their interests may be, they have not joined in the prosecution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The trial court, by decree entered August 4, 1932, dissolved the temporary injunction previously issued and dismissed plaintiffs \u2019 bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\">While the language nsed in the various conveyances may differ somewhat, reverter clauses in deeds are generally susceptible of classification. Appellants apparently take the position that the provisions before us created a determinable fee or \u201cconditional limitation.\u201d It would be more accurate to describe them as creating a fee subject to divestment by re-entry for breach of condition; in other words, a fee upon condition subsequent. <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>245 Mich. 213; <em>Rhines </em>v. <em>Consumers Power Co., </em>259 Mich. 236; <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Consumers Power Co., </em>265 Mich. 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">In ascertaining the rights of the parties, we will not determine whether Brooks\u2019 or his <em>cestui que trust\u2019s </em>failure to use the strip for railroad purposes between 1912 and 1916 constituted a breach of condition, inasmuch as this point, although presented in the amended bill of complaint and restated by appellants in their statement of questions involved, is not briefed. A mere statement of a position without argument and citation of authority in support thereof is insufficient to present the matter for the consideration of an appellate court. Court Rule No. 67 (1933), and <em>Johns </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Land &amp; Lumber Co., </em>268 Mich. 675. The same observations apply to plaintiffs\u2019 claim of adverse possession which, although mentioned in the amended bill of complaint, is not supported by proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that no attempt was made in the deed of 1916 to assign the right of re-entry to Parke and wife would be correct if the language in this deed had gone no further than to except the strip previously conveyed to Brooks. See <em>Reynolds </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>Gaertner, </em>117 Mich. 532. But grantors did more. They said: \u201csaid strip of land * <em>* </em>* ceasing to be used for said purposes, shall revert to said second parties, their heirs and assigns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">As the deed thus stands in this record, the language constituted an attempt to assign the right of re-entry; and not only did the assignment fail as to Parke and wife but the right was thereby extinguished. <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District, </em>224 Mich. 308; <em>County of Oakland </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>243 Mich. 279; <em>Fractional School District </em>v. <em>Beardslee, </em>248 Mich. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Plaintiffs contend that our holding in the <em>Halpin Case </em>is erroneous and the definition of executory limitation given therein is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Notwithstanding attacks made upon the rule stated in <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District, supra, </em>it has been adhered to in <em>County of Oakland </em>v. <em>Mack, supra, Fractional School District </em>v. <em>Beardslee, supra, </em>and <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Consumers Power Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">This court has not blindly adhered to the doctrine of <em>stare decisis. </em>See <em>Hilt </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>252 Mich. 198, 223 (71 A. L. R. 1238). But the situations in the various \u201crelicted land\u201d cases there discussed were altogether different from those presented in the several \u201creverter\u201d cases, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">In 1931, the legislature of this State abolished the \u201creverter\u201d rule as to subsequent conveyances by the enactment of Act No. 219, Pub. Acts 1931 (Comp. Laws Supp. 1935, \u00a7 12966-2), which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">\u201cThe reversionary interest in lands conveyed on a condition subsequent may be granted, conveyed, transferred or devised by the owner of such interest, and by the subsequent grantees or devisees thereof, either before or after the right of re-entry becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>effective: Provided, That this act shall not affect any such interest created before it takes effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\">This legislative enactment is an adequate solution of the \u201creverter\u201d problem, and little argument can be advanced in support of a \u201cjudicial repeal\u201d of the proviso of the quoted act by overruling the <em>Halpin Case. </em>Certainly far less damage will result from the operation of the proviso of the 1931 statute than from a determination that the <em>Halpin Case </em>was wrong in principle and should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">In <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>City of Sault Ste. Marie, </em>136 Mich. 172, 178, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\u201cBefore this court overrules a decision deliberately <em>made, </em>it should be convinced not merely that the case was wrongly decided, but also that less injury will result from overruling than from following it. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">A recognized rule of property ought not to be overturned without the very best of reasons. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>103 Mich. 102; <em>Pleasant Lake Hills Corp. </em>v. <em>Eppinger, </em>235 Mich. 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Plaintiffs attempted to show that the use of the word \u201csecond\u201d in this conveyance was an error; that the word should have been \u201cfirst.\u201d The opinion of the trial judge omitted consideration of this claim of mutual mistake, and properly so, because it is neither raised nor referred to in the original or amended bill of complaint. Moreover, this claim is not pursued in the briefs and, therefore, must be held to have been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Appellant urges that we construe the language of the deed of 1916 in connection with certain purchase money mortgages from Parke to Dolby, one of which mortgages was executed simultaneously with said deed. They argue that the express exclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>strip from these mortgages shows that Dolby and wife never intended to assign their right of re-entry to Parke and wife. However, an examination of the record indicates that the exclusion of the strip from the mortgages is a recognition of the previous conveyance of the fee title in the same by Dolby to Brooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\">The decree dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 amended bill of complaint is affirmed, with costs to appellees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b652-4\">Btjtzel, Chandler, and North, JJ., concurred with Bushnell, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b652-5\">North, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5E\">(concurring). Since the question was first presented to this conrt it has been the law of this State that an attempt by the possessor of a conditional right of reverter to convey the same before breach of condition does not convey any interest in the realty to the grantee named, because the right before breach cannot be conveyed; and further such an attempt to convey extinguishes the right itself. This is a law of property and should not be changed by the court in the absence of compelling reasons. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>103 Mich. 102. In this jurisdiction the rule was first announced in <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District, </em>224 Mich. 308, and it has been reiterated in each of the following cases: <em>County of Oakland </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>243 Mich. 279; <em>Fractional School District </em>v. <em>Beardslee, </em>248 Mich. 112; <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Consumers Power Co., </em>265 Mich. 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">I cannot assent to the conclusion that the rule as judicially adopted and consistently followed in this State is without support in respectable authorities or in reason. Regardless of the correctness or incorrectness of the statement that such a conditional or contingent right of reverter could not at common law be conveyed by the holder of the right, there can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>be little doubt that sucb was and is tbe understanding of the common law by many of tbe courts of tbis country. In tbe opinion of Mr. Justice Potter in tbis case be has quoted or cited several of tbe courts which bave stated sucb was the common law. See <em>Cloyes </em>v. <em>Beebe, </em>14 Ark. 489; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>91 Ark. 407 (121 S. W. 341, 23 L. R. A. [N. S.] 937); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>89 Va. 675 (17 S. E. 470, 23 L. R. A. 642); <em>Shell Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Hollow </em>(C. C. A.), 70 Fed. (2d) 811. Even after tbe passage of tbe Statute of Henry 8 (32 Henry 8, chap. 34), tbe rule as above stated was adhered to in English courts. See <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>2 Dyer, 126b (73 Eng. Rep. 276), wherein it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">\u201cBut when tbe condition is once annexed to a particular estate, and then by another deed tbe reversion is granted by tbe maker of tbe condition, there tbe condition is gone, <em>causa patet.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Further tbe rule as first above stated is by no means without respectable support in other jurisdictions, some of sucb decisions being of very recent date. <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Siano, </em>\u2014 Mass. \u2014 (11 N. E. [2d] 451); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>City of Saratoga Springs </em>(1933), 146 Misc. 892 (262 N. Y. Supp. 809); <em>Underhill </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>20 Barb. (N. Y.) 455; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Railroad Corp., </em>12 Allen (94 Mass.), 141; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Franklin County, </em>58 Me. 479; <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Wallowa County, </em>76 Ore. 453 (148 Pac. 1140, L. R. A. 1916 F, 303); <em>Board of Education of Humphreys County </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>124 Tenn. 39 (134 S. W. 863); <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Railway Co. </em>(Tex. Civ. App.), 169 S. W. 644. Text writers of repute bave also stated tbe rule as prevailing law. Tiedeman, Real Property (4th Ed.), \u00a7 207; 2 Washburn, Real Property (6th Ed.), \u00a7 959; 2 Reeves, Real Property, p. 1018; 3 Thompson, Real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Property, \u00a7 2083; and 1 Tiffany, Real Property (1st Ed.), \u00a7 75, which we quote:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">\u201cNor can the right to enforce a forfeiture, or, as it is usually called, the. right of re-entry, be, at common law, assigned or transferred by the grantor to a third person before entry for the breach, this being in conformity with the common law rule that \u2018nothing in action, entry, or re-entry can be granted over. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\u201cThese restrictions as to the persons able to take advantage of a breach and the inability to assign the right have been generally recognized in this country, and not only will an attempted assignment of the right of re-entry be void, but it will have the effect of destroying the grantor\u2019s right to enforce the condition, which is thereafter in effect nonexistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">It cannot be said that none of the courts have expressed a reason justifying the adoption of the rule. Regardless of whether the reasons are satisfactory or convincing, it may be noted that in some jurisdictions the rule that the contingent right of reverter is extinguished by an attempt to convey before breach, is based upon a waiver of or an estoppel against the right to claim upon the happening of the contingency after the holder has sought to dispossess himself thereof. <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Wallowa County, supra; Rice </em>v. <em>Railroad Corp., supra. </em>It has also been stated that the forfeiture of the right by the holder\u2019s attempt to convey before breach of condition is in the nature of a penalty imposed in consequence of the party\u2019s attempt to make a conveyance in violation of law. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Railroad Corp., supra. </em>In Tennessee the court has said that the unlawful attempt to convey results in a relinquishment of the right of re-entry and is an election not to exercise the right. <em>Board of Education of Humphreys County </em>v. <em>Baker, supra. </em>Former consideration of the rule by this court has been accompanied by reasons assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>in support thereof. \"VVe have approved of the above quotation from Tiffany on Real Property, and as further reasons in support of the rule have said:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\">\u201cConditions subsequent are not favored by the courts, nor by statute (3 Comp. Laws 1915, \u00a7 11564 [3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 12966]). Frequently the condition survives any substantial or actual benefit to the grantor and his heirs and becomes an onerous burden upon the grantee and his assigns, whose prayer for relief is appealing. This, in some degree, may account for the arbitrary rule that an attempt to convey destroys the right. And the author of a note in 38 A. L. R. 1112 states with ample citation of cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">\u201c \u2018It may also be noted in this connection that, wherever the point has directly arisen, it has been held that the effect of a subsequent conveyance by the grantor of the property, subject to the condition, is to destroy the condition.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\u201cIn a note L. R. A. 1916 F, 311, 312, there is criticism of the rule, but the author says:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">\u201c \u2018All the American courts which have had occasion to pass upon the question have, practically without dissent, decided it in the same way.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">\u201cThe rule is settled in this jurisdiction. <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District, supra.\u201d County of Oakland </em>v. <em>Mack, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Because the law as previously announced by this court is a rule of property and because it has ample support in other jurisdictions, it ought not to be set aside lightly. Especially is this true (even if it be conceded that the rule is not any too well guounded in reason), since comparatively recently the legislature has definitely established the law in this State, making such an interest in land transferable by deed or will. Act No. 219, Pub. Acts 1931 (Comp. Laws Supp. 1935, \u00a712966-2). The importance of not changing the rule of property as judicially adopted in this State is readily revealed by the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>cumstances of the instant case. It is to be presumed that the defendant who purchased the parcel of land involved knew and relied upon the law as it had been plainly and repeatedly announced by this court. As hereinafter pointed out, if the previously judicially announced law is adhered to defendants will prevail in this case; but if we depart from the established law of this State, defendants will be defeated and the purchaser deprived of the acquired property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Justice Pottee states that the conditional interest here in suit may lawfully be conveyed under 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 12955. This, to say the least, is debatable. If, as some courts have held <em>(Wagner </em>v. <em>Wallowa County, supra), </em>a reversionary right contingent on a condition subsequent is nothing more than an unassignable chose in action and is not an interest in land (to the same effect, see Tiedeman, Real Property [4th Ed.], \u00a7 207), the plaintiffs in the instant case cannot benefit by 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 12955, which provides for the conveyance of expectant estates. This is true because the statute is applicable only to expectant estates in real property. This statute is said to have been copied from a like statutory provision in the State of New York. See 1 N. Y. Rev. Stat. 1829, 725, \u00a7 35. The New York court has held that its statute is not applicable to a conditional right of reverter; and that notwithstanding the statute an attempt by the possessor to convey such right prior to the breach of condition extinguishes the right. <em>Underhill </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">If we are to adhere to the rule as announced in the <em>Halpin Case </em>and other decisions of this jurisdiction in accord therewith, what then is the result to be reached in the instant suit? Prom a review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>the record it convincingly appears that Mr. and Mrs. Dolby in 1916 and before there was any breach of the condition which resulted in a reverter, attempted to convey their contingent reversionary rights. Thereby such rights were extinguished, and Brooks, trustee, became vested with an absolute and unconditional fee title to the parcel. By mesne conveyances this title was vested in defendant Dillman, as State highway commissioner. As against defendants, plaintiffs have established no rights under their bill to quiet title in themselves to the parcel in suit. Such was the effect of the holding in the circuit court. I concur with Mr. Justice Bushnell in affirmance, with costs to appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b657-3\">Potter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqrf\">(dissenting). The trial court clearly and concisely stated the facts and the reason for the decree entered dismissing the bill of complaint. His language is adopted, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">\u201cThis is a bill to restrain defendants from selling, assigning, transferring, incumbering, a certain strip of land along the north side of Michigan avenue, or from removing or damaging trees, shrubs, etc., located on said land, and also praying that the court may decree that P. W. Brooks, trustee, and his successors and assigns have no interest in said lands by reason of not having used same for the purpose for which they were granted, and that plaintiffs be decreed to be the owners thereof, freed from all rights of the said Brooks, trustee, his successors or assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">\u201cHorace L. Dolby and Alice A. Dolby, his wife, were the owners of 80 acres of land in the township of Ypsilanti, Washtenaw county, described in paragraph 1 of the bill. This land had a frontage of some 1,400 feet on the north side of Michigan avenue. Dolby and wife by warranty deed, dated Oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>tober 22, 1912, conveyed to F. W. Brooks, trustee, a strip of land lying next north of and adjacent to a fence on the north side of the highway known as Michigan avenue or Chicago road, and extending across the entire front of lands of said parties of the first part on section 1, Ypsilanti township, from the west (east?) line of land owned by Etta Dale on the west, said strip of land being* 35 feet in width throughout 400 feet of its length, measured from the east line thereof, and 45 feet in width through the remaining portion of its length, the entire length of said strip being 1,400 feet more or less. Said strip of land shall be used for highway purposes only, and ceasing to be used for such purposes shall revert to said parties of the first part, their heirs or assigns. As a part and further consideration for this conveyance said second party shall erect a woven wire fence of good quality between the lands of said parties of the first part and the tracks of any railroad which may be constructed upon said right of way, together with suitable crossing and gate at the place designated by first parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\u201cSaid first parties reserve all buildings on said premises provided the same are removed within one year, at his own sole cost and expense, otherwise the same to be and to remain the property of said second party.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">\u201cOn May 26, 1916, by warranty deed, Horace L. Dolby and Alice, his wife, conveyed to Archie B. Parke and Clara E. Parke, his wife, all the land described in paragraph 1 of the bill, excepting the strip of land theretofore deeded by Dolby and wife to Brooks, trustee, \u2018said strip of land is to be used for railroad purposes only, and ceasing to be used for such purposes shall revert to said second parties, their heirs and assigns, said premises conveyed containing 80 acres of land, more or less. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">\u201cThereafter and on July 21,1925, Parke and wife deeded so-called parcel number two to Dolby and wife, and also all that parcel of land lying between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the north line of Michigan avenne and the south line of the Burbank two-acre parcel. Said last parcel is subject to the rights of F. W. Brooks, trustee, or his assigns in said strip of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\">\u201cLater, on July 14, 1926, Parke and wife by warranty deed conveyed to Dolby and wife so-called parcel three, excepting a strip of land lying next north of and adjacent to the fence on the north side of the highway known as Michigan avenue, and extending across the entire front of the lands of said parties of the first part on section 1, the said strip of land being 45 feet in width. Said strip of land is to be used for railroad purposes only, and ceasing to be used for said purposes shall revert to said second party, their heirs and assigns, said premises being a part of the east half of the southwest quarter of section 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">\u201cIt appears therefore that Dolby and wife and Parke and wife, together with one Lincoln, are claiming title to the entire strip extending the entire width of the original Dolby property on the south side thereof and adjoining Michigan avenue to the north. The defendants claim title by successive conveyances through F. W. Brooks, trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\u201cIt is the claim of plaintiffs that the conveyance to Brooks conveyed a base fee subject to being divested on a contingency, and that such a contingency occurred when the property was subsequently deeded to the highway commissioner, which conveyance showed an ultimate abandonment of the strip in controversy for railroad purposes; also that the Dolbys had always excepted the strip in controversy in conveyances from themselves, and that the property reverts to Dolby. It is also claimed that Brooks, trustee, and his assigns did nothing to exercise the right of ownership, that there had been an abandonment of the strip by Brooks and his assigns, and that pursuant to right of ownership Mr. Dolby had paid the 1929 and 1930 taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\u201cThe defendants contend that in the conveyance from the Dolbys to Parke and wife (warranty deed dated May 26, 1916), there was an attempt to convey the strip in controversy, which attempt extinguished any right of reverter in the Dolbys.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\u201cAn examination of this conveyance leads the court to a conclusion in accordance with this theory. While the language used excepted the strip of land lying next north of and adjacent to the fence on the north line of the highway known as Michigan avenue, the remaining language, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\u201c \u2018Said strip of land is to be used for highway (railroad?) purposes only, and ceasing to be used for such purposes shall revert to said second parties, their heirs and assigns, said premises conveyed containing 80 acres of land, more or less,\u2019 makes it appear that it was Dolby\u2019s intent to convey a reverter interest in the event of a breach of a condition subsequent, in other words 80 acres of land, more or less, together with a reverter was intended to be conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\u201cThe deed from Dolby and wife to F. W. Brooks, trustee, was a conveyance in fee of the entire strip, creating a condition subsequent. This conclusion, in the opinion of the court, brings the instant case within the holding of <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District, </em>224 Mich. 308, Avhere the distinction between condition subsequent and conditional limitation is discussed, and which case holds that an attempt on the part of the grantor (Dolbys) to convey a possibility of reverter before the condition is broken extinguishes the right of himself and heirs to re-enter after the condition is broken. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Prom a decree dismissing plaintiffs \u2019 bill, and dissolving the injunction, plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">1.

It is contended that the rule of <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District </em>was the rule of the common law. The common law was brought to this country by the English colonists who settled at Jamestown in 1607. What was brought was not only the common customary law of England, but the law relating to land tenure as modified by English statutes of general operation up to that time, subject to some modifications not here important. <em>Penny </em>v. Little, 3 Scam.

S.) 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">(a) The ordinance of 1787, for the government of the territory northwest of the Ohio river, provided the inhabitants of the territory should always be entitled to judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law. This ordinance was the organic law of the Northwest Territory and of Michigan Territory. <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>2 Mich. 427. It was, with some exceptions, afterward extended by Congress to Mississippi Territory. The common law there referred to was the common law of England. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cawood, </em>2 Stew. (Ala.) 360; <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>28 Ala. 704 (65 Am. Dec. 374). By act of July 14, 1795, the governor and judges of the Northwest Territory enacted that the common law of England and all statutes of the British parliament made in aid of the common law prior to the fourth year of King James 1 (that being the date of the English settlement at Jamestown), of a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>nature, and not local to the king\u2019dom, should be adopted in that territory. After the surrender of the British posts in what is now Michigan by Great Britain to the United States, Michigan came raider the ordinance of 1787 as a part of the Northwest Territory and later as a part of Indiana Territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">(b) Michigan Territory was created and organized in 1805. The governor and judges of Michigan, by act of September 16, 1810, attempted to repeal all French and French-Canadian law in the territory (this had already been done by the ordinance of 1787), repeal all English statutes applicable to Michigan, though the governor and judges had no power of repeal, and their attempted action was ineffective so far as the English statutes included in the common law were adopted by the ordinance of 1787. The power of repeal granted to the governor and judges by the act of congress of May 8, 1792, to repeal (their laws made by them) was an implied exclusion of their right to repeal in cases not enumerated. As to the laws of the Northwest Territory and of Indiana Territory, it is probable the right of repeal existed under the act of congress of May 8, 1792. It was unnecessary to repeal the purported territorial laws enumerated for they had been declared unconstitutional. <em>McGarvin </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(Mich. Terr. 1809), 36 Mich. Pion. &amp; Hist. Soc. Coll. p. 363; <em>In re Colhoun, </em>18 Mich. Law Rev. p. 21; <em>In re Hoffman\u2019s Will, </em>18 Mich. Law Rev. p. 27. The common law, including the English statutes of general application, made the law of the territory by the ordinance of 1787, continued to be the law of Michigan notwithstanding any attempted repeal by any territorial legislative body. <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>Walk.

In <em>Re Lamphere, </em>61 Mich. 105, attention was called to the enactm\u00e9nt of the governor and judg\u2019es on September 16,1810, above mentioned. But this attempted legislation so far as it affected the common law, as modified by English statutes inherent in the term \u201ccommon law\u201d as used in the ordinance of 1787, was plainly invalid. The common law, as adopted by the ordinance of 1787 and made applicable to Michigan, consisted not only of the customary common law of England, but that law as modified by applicable statutes prior to our separation from Great Britain.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\">3. In <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District, </em>the rule announced is that a possibility of reverter is not assignable by the grantor except to the holder of the conditional fee. No grant of it may be legally made to another. It will not pass by any conveyance to any other person. Any attempt to alienate it to any one but the holder of the conditional fee is absolutely void and conveys nothing*. Though the attempted grant of this possibility of reverter to a third person is void, it is in effect fully operative against the grantor in favor of the grantee of the conditional fee. It extinguishes the possibility of reverter and its effect is to convey an absolute fee to the holder of the conditional fee though no conveyance of it has been made to him by the grantor. In effect, the case holds the attempt to grant the possibility of reverter to a third person operates as a grant of the possibility of reverter to the holder of the conditional fee, merges such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>possibility with the conditional fee, extinguishes the possibility of reverter, and converts the conditional fee to a title in fee simple absolute. Justice Bird, in <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District, </em>was not impressed with the rule that an attempt to convey a reverter attached to a condition subsequent extinguishes it; and, in support of what seems to have been his opinion as to this rule, he quoted from a note to <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Wallowa County, </em>76 Ore. 453 (148 Pac. 1140), in L. R. A. 1916 F, 303, 311, where the editor says one \u201cmight wonder by what legerdemain a right, created by solemn compact between grantor and grantee, had been made to vanish into thin air. It would puzzle him to understand how an unsuccessful attempt to convey can have the effect of destroying* the thing that is not conveyed. \u2018How is it,\u2019 he would say, \u2018that what does not pass does not remain?\u2019 His bewilderment would only be increased if he were informed that all the American courts which have had occasion to pass upon the question have, practically without dissent, decided it in the same way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>167 Mass. 332 (57 N. E. 692, 50 L. R. A. 120), holds the possibility of reverter, upon the death of the holder thereof, passes to his heirs or devisees, whereas <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Langford, </em>81 S. C. 282 (62 S. E. 316, 128 Am. St. Rep. 912, 16 Ann. Cas. 91), holds such possibility of reverter does not pass by will because at the moment of death the possibility of reverter passes to the heirs of the grantor in the conditional deed, \u2014 which reason would prevent real estate, or any interest therein, from passing by devise under any circumstances. <em>Upington </em>v. <em>Corrigan, </em>151 N. Y. 143 (45 N. E. 359, 37 L. R. A. 794), quotes from <em>Nicoll </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>12 N. Y. 121, which held that 32 Henry 8, chap. 34, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>which permitted the assignment of a right of entry in case of grants, or leases in fee, reserving rents, and of leases for lives or for years, says:</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\">\u201cThere was a reason for the statutory change in the particular cases mentioned; for in them the grantor had an interest independent of the possibility of reverter. # * But where a fee simple, without a reservation of rents, is granted upon a condition subsequent, as in this case, there is no estate remaining in the grantor. There is simply a <em>possibility of reverter, </em>but that is no estate. There is not even a possibility coupled with an interest, but a bare possibility alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">4. Gray draws a distinction between a right of entry for condition broken and a possibility of reverter. Gray, Buie Against Perpetuities (3d Ed.), \u00a7 31.

No English statute declares such rule. No decision of any English court can be pointed to as the basis of any such conclusion. If we say the reason was that the attempt to alienate that which was inalienable was penalized by its forfeiture, we say that which has no support either in the statute or common law of England. Forfeitures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>are not favored in law, and will not ordinarily be enforced in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\u201cNo good reason is perceived why a right of entry for breach of condition should not be alienable nor why any distinction as to alienability should be drawn between it and the possibility of reverter.\u201d 3 Simes\u2019 Law of Future Interests, \u00a7 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">(b) The only basis that has been pointed out for this assumed rule is the statement in 1 Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone (1648) (7th Ed.), p. 158, and reiterated in 5 Miner\u2019s Abridgment (1741), title Condition, p. 306. It is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\u201cIf one make a feoffment in fee of land upon condition, and after and before the condition broken he doth make an absolute feoffment, or levy a fine of all or part of the land to the feoffee, or any <em>other; </em>by this the condition is gone and discharged for ever, (except such fine is for further assurance).\u201d 1 Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone (7th Ed.), p. 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">No authority is cited to support this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">\u201cWhen condition is once annexed to a particular estate, and after by <em>other deed </em>the reversion is granted by the maker of the condition, now the condition is gone.\u201d 5 Miner\u2019s Abridgment, p. 306, citing <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>2 Dyer, 126b, 127a (73 Eng.

Land holding, not land owning, was the characteristic of feudal land tenure. Plucknett\u2019s History of the Common Law, p. 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The central idea in the conveyance of land titles in the early English common law was seizin. Seizin was possession. 2 Pollock &amp; Maitland\u2019s History of English Law, p. 29; Challis \u2019 Law of Real Property, p. 76. One could not deliver possession to another of what a third person possessed. A right of entry for condition broken could not be conveyed because there could be no livery of seizin. It was inalienable. Seizin was the basis of inheritance. The landowner who had not been in possession had no right which he could leave to his heirs. 3 Select Essays in Anglo-American Legal History, p. 596. One who conveyed real estate to a third person and delivered the possession or seizin thereof vested the grantee with a title good as against everyone except \u201cthose who have better because older title.\u201d 3 Select Essays in Anglo-American Legal History, p. 600.

There could be no valid conveyance because there could be no livery of seizin. Lord Mansfield says:</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><em>\u201cSeisin </em>is a technical term to denote the completion of that investiture, by which the tenant was admitted into the tenure; and without which, no freehold could be constituted or pass.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Horde </em>(1757), 1 Burr. 60, 108 (97 Eng.

(a) If by the common law there could be no assignment of the right of re-entry for condition broken, and the ordinance of 1787 made the common law, as modified by English statutes prior to the settlement of America, the law in force in the Territory of Michigan, and the Constitution of 1835 continued the territorial laws in force not repealed by the Constitution, then by the early law of the State of Michigan there could be no valid conveyance of land by one not in the actual possession of the same. This was the established rule. <em>Bruckner </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>1 Doug. (Mich.) 19; <em>Godfroy </em>v. <em>Disbrow, </em>Walk. Ch.

An executor in possession of land belonging to the heirs of deceased could convey a fee. One could convey a larger estate than he actually had solely because he could make livery of seizin. Life tenants could convey a fee. This common-law rule was ended in Michigan by statute (3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13280), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\u201cA conveyance made by a tenant for life or years, purporting to grant a greater estate than he possessed or could lawfully convey, shall not work a forfeiture of his estate, lout shall pass to the grantee all the estate which such tenant could lawfully convey. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">7. It seems to be established by Glanville and Hale, Fleta and Blackstone, that one could not, at early common law, dispose of real estate by will. Beames\u2019 Glanville\u2019s De Tractibus (Beal\u2019s Ed.), pp. 115, 135, 136, and notes. Wills of real estate were authorized by 32 Henry 8, chap. 1, and 34 &amp; 35 Henry 8, chap. 5. The only reason why the possibility of a right of re-entry or possibility of reverter could not be devised at early common law was that no interest in real estate could be devised at early common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">8. It is conceded even in <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District, </em>that the possibility of reverter retained by the grantor of lands on condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>subsequent, or of tbe right of re-entry for breach of condition broken, was a right pertaining to real estate which descended from the grantor to his heirs, and, by 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13478, it is not necessary one be seized of an interest in real estate in order to devise the same. The statute here in force permits a testator who is \u201centitled to <em>any interest therein descendible to his heirs\u201d </em>to devise and dispose of the same by will. The possibility of a right of re-entry for breach of condition subsequent under the law as it is now established is an interest in real estate which descends to the grantor\u2019s heirs. It is such an interest in real estate as may be devised, and, being an interest in real estate, it may, under 3 Comp.

The explanation is sometimes given that the assignment operates as a contract by the assignor to convey the legal estate or interest when it vests in him, and that equity will specifically enforce such contract by decreeing a conveyance.\u201d 3 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence (3d Ed.), \u00a7 1287, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The grantors herein had an exclusive right to be the beneficiaries of the right to re-enter in case of breach in the future of the condition subsequent in their deed by the grantee therein.

Whether valid or invalid, it was substantially re-enacted by the Revised Statutes of 1838, pt. 3, title 3, chap. 1, which changed the law of 1821 in but two important particulars : first, by providing for a jury of 12, instead of 16, men; and, second, in the re-enactment of section 40 of the statute of 1821 as section 32 of pt. 3, title 3, chap. 1, of the Revised Statutes of 1838 which changed the statute of limitations from 60 to 25 'years.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">By the Revised Statutes of 1846, chap. 108, \u00a7 2, the action of right was abolished and the personal action of ejectment substituted therefor \u201cin the same cases in which a writ of right may now be brought,\u201d and by 3 Comp.

No other changes were made by these statutes in the common-law rule; and the Constitution of 1908 keeps in force \u201cthe common law and the statute laws now in force, not repugnant to this Constitution.\u201d Const. 1908, sched. \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">By 3 &amp; 4 Will. 4, chap. 105, \u00a7 3, it is provided a widow may have dower when her husband shall have been entitled to a right of entry or action in any land, the same as if he had recovered possession. 8 &amp; 9 Yict. chap. 106, \u00a7 6, provides for the conveyance by deed of a right of entry, whether immediate or future, and whether vested or contingent, into or upon any tenements or hereditaments in England.

Yet, in Michigan, where, since English and American occupation, the feudal system has been unknown, and knighthood never flowered, we have been, if the rule of <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District </em>was correct, helplessly \u201chogtied,\u201d \u2014 in a land whose policy holds the free alienation of property to be one of its essential requisites, \u2014 while in England the senseless rule, real or pretended, has long since been discarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">\u201cIn five States it has been held that, if an attempt is made to convey a right of entry for breach of condition which is unaccompanied by any reversion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>interest of the conveyor is thereby forfeited. It is a little difficult to see why this should be so. If the interest is inalienable, why should the owner be penalized for an attempt at alienation which is a nullity? While a few statements are found supporting the position of these American cases in early English texts, there is no English decision to that effect. It is believed that the patent trend toward the alienability of future interests in recent years would probably lead a court in a jurisdiction where the question is still an open one to declare that an attempt at alienation of a right of entry for breach of condition does not forfeit the interest. Certainly, an attempt to alienate a possibility of reverter would not forfeit the interest even in jurisdictions where it is inalienable.\u201d 3 Simes\u2019 Law of Future Interests, \u00a7 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\">10. It is a long way from the medieval rule governing the transfer of folk land by feoffor to feoffee by livery of seizin, the basis of the rule of <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School </em>District, to the rule enforcing contracts transferring\u2019 possibilities of expectant estates; from physical delivery of the land, to transfer of title by conveyances in writing where the record is notice of prior defects in title. The theory that the attempt to assign a right worked a forfeiture, tholigh inconsistent with equity which abhors forfeitures, is as logical, measured by modern conceptions of legal reasoning, as the rule that a life tenant might convey a fee, \u2014 a tortious act could be the foundation of a legal right, \u2014 that rights might have their foundation in wrong, \u2014 that one could convey that which he did not own, \u2014 convey a greater title than he himself possessed. In England, rights and interests in land were later recognized which did not depend on seizin, such as uses, for in <em>Wil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>loughby </em>v. <em>Willoughby, </em>1 Term Rep. (Durn. <em>&amp; </em>East\u2019s) 763, 765 (99 Eng. Rep. 1366), Lord Hardwicke said:</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\u201cEquity always considers who has the right in conscience to the land, and on that ground makes one man a trustee for another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">At early common law, title depended on seizin. There could be no dual title. Now, dual titles are recognized. The vendee in a modern land contract acquires possession, is the beneficial owner of the equitable title, though the legal title is held by the vendor as security for performance by the vendee. An equity of redemption on mortgage foreclosure was once based upon the discretion of the chancellor. It has become a right in property, \u2014 an estate which may be sold, assigned and conveyed. At common law, the trustee of real estate was the owner of the fee. The right to enforce the trust was a personal right. A trustee now holds nominal title only. He may resign, die, be removed or succeeded; or his duties may be performed by the court. The title to real estate conveyed by conditional fee is dual in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The fee here was conveyed for a particular use, and, never having been applied to that use, no absolute title in equity ever vested in t\u00a3e grantee. If we use the medieval conception of real estate titles, the fee vested in the grantee conditionally, subject to reversion for failure to use the land for the purposes for which it was conveyed. That part of the absolute fee not conveyed, the right to terminate the fee of the grantee for breach of condition subsequent, remained in the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The holder of a fee on condition subsequent, \u2014 a conditional fee, \u2014 is in some cases a holder in trust charged with the performance of the condition sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>sequent. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Atterby </em>(Alterly), 3 Chan. Rep. 93 (21 Eng. Rep. 739). This rule has been applied where lands are deeded on condition the grantee support the grantor or some other person. Such conditions are conditions subsequent. In such case \u2014\u201cthe conveyance in question should be declared a trust to secure the performance of these obligations, and, in case of their nonperformance, this trust should end, and the property revert to complainant.\u201d <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>132 Mich. 300; <em>Woolcott </em>v. <em>Woolcott, </em>133 Mich. 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\">Courts of equity may grant or refuse relief on conditions peculiar to themselves, sometimes at variance with the common law. 3 Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence (14th Ed.), \u00a7 1724. Where a grantee obtained title for a nominal consideration for a specific use and the land was not so used and the grantee by his tortious act, in violation of the terms of his deed, conveys in form an absolute fee to his grantee, in violation of the interests of the grantors sought to be protected and subserved by the condition inserted in the deed, what reason is there to forfeit the rights of the grantors or their assigns reserved in the deed? Such forfeiture ought not to be enforced in equity. The grantee for a particular use ought not in equity to be held to have become vested, without conveyance to him and without consideration, with the right to destroy the beneficial interests of the grantors or their assigns sought to be protected by the condition in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The possibility of a reverter in <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District </em>was \u201cto the said party of the first part, their heirs and assigns,\u201d and in the case at bar \u201cto said parties of the first part, their heirs or assigns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The statutes permitting the devise of any interest in property descendible, but for the will, to the heirs of the grantor; permitting\u2019 conveyance of any interest in real estate by deed without any other act or ceremony whatever; abolishing\u2019 the necessity of seizin; and prohibiting the tortious conveyance of interests in land not owned by the grantor, have been cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\u201cLand has been held to include servitudes, easements, rents, and other incorporeal hereditaments, and all rights thereto and interests therein, equitable as well as legal; <em>Oskaloosa Water Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization of City of Oskaloosa, </em>84 Iowa, 407 (51 N.

It was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201cThat a grantor cannot reserve snch a right, will hardly he contended, as in Pennsylvania there is no policy of law which forbids it. The law against maintenance has never been adopted in this State. The reason assigned why a condition in England conld not be assigned, is, because no title could be made to land held by another adversely, as that was against the law, which forbid maintenance. And hence the rule, that none but the grantor, or his heirs, can enter for condition broken. This reason does not apply here, where the grantor expressly reserves the right: 55 Law Library, 2 Crabbe on Real Property, pp. 531, 550, \u00a7\u00a7 2150, 2189, 2190, and the authorities there cited; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>McCord, </em>5 Watts (Pa.), 493 (30 Am.

Y.), 345; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>5 Ser. <em>&amp; </em>R. (Pa.) 375, 385. In the last case, Chief Justice Gribson says, none but the feoffer or his heirs can enter; and the reason why a right of entry cannot be assigned is, that a contrary doctrine would favor maintenance and promote litigation. This is a fair case for the application of the maxim, <em>cessante ratione cessat ipse lex.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\">In <em>Cloyes </em>v. <em>Beebe, </em>and <em>Cloyes </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>14 Ark. 489, it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">\u201cIt is true that, at common law, if a man had in him only the right of possession or property, he could not convey it to another, lest, in the language of the ancient law, \u2018pretended titles might be granted to great men, whereby justice might be trodden down and the weak oppressed.\u2019 But this was for the feudal reason that possession was an indispensable element of alienation, of which the law was so tenacious, even after the statute of uses, that a pretense title itself, would not prevent the seizin of the land from passing from the bargainor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>to the bargainee by virtue of that statute, where he was actually seized, although his title was but pretended. At the same time reversions and vested remainders might he granted, because it was considered that the possession of the particular tenant was the possession of him in reversion or in remainder, and was not adverse. And upon the same principle the better and more recent authorities show that an equitable interest was always <em>assignable; </em>because after the sale, out of which an equitable interest grew, the vendor and those under him, would hold as trustees for the vendee and those under him, and therefore there could be no such adverse possession as to make the title pretended. But every vestige of this feudal doctrine, which thus restrained the alienation of real estate, has been swept off by our statute, which enacts that, \u2018Any person claiming title to any real estate may, notwithstanding there may be an adverse possession thereof, sell and convey Ms interest in the same manner and with like effect as if he was in the actual possession thereof.\u2019 (Digest 1848, chap. 37, p. 265, \u00a7 6.) The next section (Digest 1848, chap. 37, p. 265, \u00a77), declares that. \u2018The term <em>real estate, </em>as used in this act, shall be construed as co-extensive in meaning with \u201clands, tenements and hereditaments\u201d and as embracing chattels real.\u2019 And Sir Edward Coke says, that of these three, \u2018hereditaments\u2019 is by far the largest and most comprehensive expression, because it included not only lands and tenements, but whatever may be inherited, be it corporeal or incorporeal, real, personal or mixed. And thus it appears that, although at common law, there were certain rights to and interests in real estate, that for want of possession, either actual or constructive, could not be alienated to a stranger, although they could be released or devised by will, or would pass to the heir or executor \u2014 as contingencies and mere possibilities \u2014 such is the comprehensiveness of our statute in embracing hereditaments in the term \u2018real es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>tate,\u2019 that that distinction is also annihilated, and therefore, in this State, <em>whatever interest in real estate may be inherited, may be bargained, sold and conveyed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><em>Nutter </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>3 Metc. (60 Ky.) 163, involved the question of reversion under a will. It was contended the court had no power to order a sale of a contingent interest and that the purchasers at such sale could not acquire a valid interest. The Kentucky statute provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">\u201cAny interest in, or claim to, real estate, may be disposed of by deed or will in writing. Any estate may be made to commence <em>in futuro, </em>by deed in like manner as by will, and any <em>estate </em>which would be good as an <em>executory devise </em>or bequest shall be good if created by deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The Kentucky statute was similar to 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13283, above quoted, in that it provided that any interest in real estate might be conveyed though it was in the possession of someone else. It was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\u2018 \u2018 The effect of this enactment is to obviate at once all the difficulties growing out of the distinctions which had been established, by judicial construction, between such estates as were alienable and such as were not. It will not be doubted, we suppose, that under this statute every conceivable interest in, or claim to, real estate, whether present or future, vested or' contingent, and however acquired, may be disposed of by deed or will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">In <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Goddin, </em>13 Gratt. (54 Va.) 587, 599, a similar statute was before the court and it was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\u201cIt is very clear that before the Code took effect, a bargainee of a party not in possession, actual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>constructive, at the time of the execution of the deed, could not maintain ejectment in his own name, at least against the party at that time in the adverse possession of the land. His disability to maintain the action proceeded, not from the act against conveying or tailing pretensed titles, 1 Rev. Code 1819, chap. 103, p. 375, but from the common law, whose maxim it was that nothing in action or entry could be granted over. A -feoffment was void without livery of seizin; and without possession there could be no livery of seizin. 4 Kent Commentaries, 448; 2 Lorn. Dig. 8, 9. The statute of uses, 1 Rev. Code 1819, chap. 99, \u00a7 29, p. 370, did not remove the disability, because it only operated on a possession existing in the bargainor at the time of the execution of the deed, and transferred that possession to the use created or declared in favor of the bargainee. If no possession existed in the bargainor, of course none could be transferred to the bargainee. But the Code has changed the common-law rule by declaring that \u2018 any interest in or claim to real estate may be disposed of by deed or will.\u2019 Rev. Code 1849, chap. 116, \u00a7 5, p. 500. That such a change was contemplated by the revisors, is manifest from their report, p. 602, \u00a7 5, and note \u2021. They recommended the adoption of a section similar to 8 &amp; 9 Viet. chap. 106, \u00a7 6; in which \u2018a right of entry\u2019 is expressly named. Instead of adopting that section, which is complicated in its details, the legislature enacted the provision before quoted. Their object was to use brief and plain terms, which would be at least as extensive in their meaning as the terms used in the statute of Victoria. They could not have used more comprehensive terms than they did. A rigiit of entry is certainly \u2018an interest in or claim to real estate,\u2019 and may therefore \u2018be disposed of by deed or will.\u2019 If it may be so disposed of, the grantee or devisee may bring the action in his own name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>89 Va. 675 (17 S.

It is content to give to plain words their usual and everyday meaning, and the interpretation there placed upon the statute did away forever with the niceties by which the devolution of property had theretofore been embarrassed and hindered, and made capable of disposition by deed or will any interest in or claim to real estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">A similar statute was before the court in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>91 Ark. 407, 418 (121 S. W. 341, 23 L. R. A. [N. S.] 937), where, after reviewing the authorities, it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">\u201cWe think it clear, both upon reason and authority, that where, as in this State, the common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>doctrine of livery of seizin is abolished by a statute authorizing a conveyance of land, whether held in possession or not, a subsequent deed executed by an original grantor on condition is equivalent to reentry, and is effectual for the purpose of declaring a forfeiture and vesting the title in the subsequent grantee. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In this case, it is said, p. 410:</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\u201cThe doctrine of estates upon condition is of feudal origin, of which system the doctrine of title by livery of seizin formed an essential part, on account of the condition of real property at that time, and the only practical method of conveying it. This was then a doctrine of necessity, for in that day no system of registration of conveyances existed. Indeed, lands were not generally conveyed by writings, and the only practical method of giving notice of a change of title was either by actual delivery of possession or by symbolic delivery in sight of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">\u2018 \u2018 At common law, the only method whereby a forfeiture could be effected for breach of condition was by re-entry upon the premises or by a public attempt to re-enter, with a declaration of forfeiture. This, too, grew out of the doctrine of livery of seizin, the reason being that the forfeiture for condition broken must be accomplished by acts of equal dignity and notoriety with those which created the condition, <em>vis., </em>delivery, either actual or symbolic. \u2018As by the old common law a freehold could be created only by the ceremony of livery of seizin, the corresponding ceremony of re-entry was necessary in order to determine it, or, as Coke has it, \u201can estate of freehold cannot begin nor end without ceremony.\u201d \u2019 (1 Jones Law of Real Property in Conveyancing, \u00a7 715.) \u2018The entry, moreover, in the language of the Touchstone, should be \u201can open and notorious act, equivalent to investiture of land by livery of seizin, that notoriety might be given to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>change of title.\u201d It is not necessary, however, that the party entering should declare at the time for what purpose he enters. The act speaks for itself.\u2019 (1 Jones Law of Real Property in Convevancing, \u00a7 716.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\">\u201cIn his recent work on Real Property, Professor Minor (vol. 1, p. 532), says: \u2018It is an established rule of the common law that if the conditional estate be a freehold the mere occurrence of the event which constitutes the violation of the condition does not defeat the estate, because as a freehold can, at common law, only be created by livery of seizin, there is needed a corresponding notoriety in order to determine it. This corresponding notoriety is the re-entry .of the grantor or his heirs. * * * No actual re-entry is necessary to determine an estate for years on condition, \u201cfor, as a term of years may begin without ceremony, so it may end without ceremony.\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">\u201cIt also must be conceded that at common law the right of re-entry for condition broken was not assignable, and could only be exercised by the grantor who created the condition, or by his privies in blood. It could not be exercised by one who was only the grantor\u2019s privy in estate. This under the maxim that, in order to discourage maintenance, \u2018nothing which lies in action, entry or re-entry can be granted.\u2019 The same rule prohibited the conveyance of lands held adversely, or any interest therein. This rule was created under the English statute (32-Henry 8, chap. 9) against selling pretended titles, and Sir Edward Coke states the reason therefor as follows: To prevent \u2018maintenance, suppression of right, and stirring up of suits; and therefore nothing in action, entry or re-entry can be granted over ; for so under color thereof pretended titles might be granted to great men whereby right might be trodden down and the weak oppressed, which the common law forbiddeth. \u2019 Coke on Littleton, p. 214a.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\u201cIn many of the States of the American Union this English statute against the sale of pretended titles to lands not in possession has heen re-enacted, and in a few States the doctrine has been recognized and enforced as a part of the common law. But this court in <em>Lytle </em>v. <em>State, </em>17 Ark. 608, 674, held that \u2018the provisions of these statutes, upon which so much of the law of maintenance and champerty rests for support in the English law, so far from having been re-enacted in this State, have been met here by directly conflicting legislation in the several provisions touching the sale of real estate held in adverse possession; whereby the right of \u201calienation and purchase\u201d of every interest, title and estate therein \u201chas been enlarged almost to an unlimited extent.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Kansas has a statute in all respects substantially like 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13278. This statute came before the court in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>91 Kan. 1, 4 (136 Pac. 953, L. R. A. 1915 A, 671, Ann. Cas. 1917 A, 918), where the validity of a freehold estate in remainder to commence in the future was in question. It was conceded that at common law such an estate could not be created without a grant of a precedent estate to support it. But it was held the common-law rule had been abrogated by statute. It was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\u201cThe words, \u2018conveyances of land,\u2019 mean, of course, the land itself in fee simple absolute. The words, \u2018 any other estate or interest therein, \u2019 include estates of freehold and less than freehold, of inheritance and not of inheritance, absolute and limited, present and future, vested and contingent, and any other kind a grantor may choose to invent, consistent, of course, with public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of the particular estate arose from the necessity under the feudal system of always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>having a tenant to fulfill feudal duties, defend the estate, and represent it so that other claimants might maintain their rights. The only way to pass a freehold estate was by livery of seisin which operated immediately or not at all, and if the freehold became vacant the lord had an immediate right of entry and all limitations of the tenancy came to an end. The result was that in order to create a freehold estate, the enjoyment of which was to be postponed to a future time, it was necessary to support it by a precedent particular estate taken out of the inheritance, and to make livery of seisin to the particular tenant, which by fiction inured to the remainder man or remainder men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\">In <em>Shell Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Hollow </em>(C. C. A.), 70 Fed. (2d) 811, a question analogous to that here involved was before the court. Counsel discussed whether the instrument created a fee simple on condition subsequent with a possibility of reverter, or an estate in determinable fee. It was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">\u201cIt is unnecessary to determine that question because the common-law rule that the possibility of reverter is neither an alienable, assignable, or descendible estate has been abrogated by statute in Kansas. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">\u201cIt is immaterial to a decision of this case whether the deed to the school district conveyed a fee simple estate on condition subsequent or an estate in determinable fee. A discussion of that question would be beside the decisive point. The rights of Ediger, in either event and whatever their nature, could be passed by deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">11. In <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School Dis</em>trict, plaintiff sought to enjoin defendant from selling school buildings on the land and recover the land because' defendant had ceased to use it for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>schoolhouse purposes. Defendant in its answer and in its brief in this court <em>disclaimed any interest in the real estate, </em>but claimed the schoolhouse erected on the land and its equipment belonged to the district and might be removed therefrom. Plaintiff contended there was a distinction between a condition subsequent and a conditional limitation and tried the case upon the theory the schoolhouse was real estate, attached to the soil, and reverted to him. In his brief in this court, plaintiff conceded <em>\u201cthat by the great weight of authority, a possibility of reverter is not under the common law alienable or diver sable.\u201d </em>Appellee in its brief said:</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">\n<em>\u201cIt is conceded by plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his brief that by the great weight of authority a possibility of reverter remaining after a conveyance upon a condition subsequent is not alienable or devisable.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Defendant contended the use of the land was for a specific purpose, for an indefinite period, and amounted merely to a lease of the land so long as used for school purposes and it had a right to remove the building* and equipment therefrom at any time during the continuance of its occupation or within a reasonable time thereafter, relying upon the rule of <em>School District No. 5 of Delhi </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>52 Mich. 314; <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>101 Mich. 300; <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>School District No. 9 of the Township of Hope, </em>139 Mich. 539; <em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>192 Mich. 49; <em>Waverly Park-Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Michigan United Traction Co., </em>197 Mich. 92, to which may now be added the later case of <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Oakland County Gas &amp; Oil Co., </em>277 Mich. 442 (107 A. L. R. 1142).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Though plaintiff\u2019s concession related to the rule of the common law, counsel for defendant, and-the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>court, treated it as a concession as to the present law governing the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\">It will he seen (a) that in <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District, </em>there was apparently a concession of counsel as to the applicable rule and no real contentious litigation of the question; (b) that neither counsel for plaintiff or defendant called the attention of the court to the statutory provisions expressly making reversionary interests in real estate alienable; (c) the court\u2019s attention was not called to the provisions of 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13278, which expressly provides for the conveyance of lands, or of any estate or interest therein, by deed; (d) nor was it insisted that plaintiff\u2019s interest was an expectant estate made alienable by 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 12955, when construed in connection with 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7\u00a7 12929, 12932.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The foregoing is important only as showing the common-law rule, the background against which modern statutes relating to real estate must be construed, and as an alibi for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">12. (a) The basis of the doctrine of <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District </em>was long ago cut away by statutes of the same kind that destroyed it in Pennsylvania, in Kentucky, in Virginia, in Arkansas, in Kansas, and in all other states where such statutes are in force. The statute formerly governing champerty and maintenance has been repealed, and the only statute in force is applicable only to attorneys and counselors. 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13593. 32 Henry 8, chap. 9, is not in force in this State at this time, nor was it in force when <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">(b) Chapter 62 of the Revised Statutes of 1846, entitled: \u201cOf the nature and qualities of estates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>in real property, and the alienation thereof.\u201d (3 Comp.

When chapter 65 of the Revised Statutes of 1846 was under consideration in committee of the whole in the State Senate, March 27, 1846, sections 7 and 8 of chapter 65 of the proposed revision were stricken out and section 7 as subsequently enacted (3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13283), above quoted, inserted in their place. Senate Journal on Revision, p. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The statutes of 1829 of New York, so far as applicable, were adopted in Michigan with the modifications above noted, and the English statutes of 3 &amp; 4 Will. 4, Will. 4 &amp; 1 Viet, and 8 &amp; 9 Viet, above cited were in effect re-enacted in Michigan, though the New York revision preceded the enactment of the English statutes above referred to in point of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">(d) The statutes of this State above cited are so plain as to need no construction. It is established: <em>first, </em>that the grantors owned the premises in controversy in absolute fee simple; <em>second, </em>that they sold and conveyed a conditional fee therein; <em>third, </em>that interest which constituted the difference be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>tween the absolute fee which plaintiffs owned and the conditional fee which they conveyed reserved by grantors was a reversion, \u2014 th\u00e1t is, the residue of the estate left in the grantors after the conveyance of a conditional fee, commencing in possession on the determination of a particular estate granted or devised, an estate in possession being one where the owner has an immediate right to the possession; <em>fourth, </em>this reversion or reversionary right in the premises in question reserved by the grantors was descendible, devisable and alienable in the same manner as estates in possession; <em>fifth, </em>being alienable, by statute such reversion or reversionary interest could be conveyed by deed without any other act or ceremony whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">13. It is contended that to overrule <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District </em>will interfere with vested rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">(a) In <em>Ex Parte Bollman </em>and <em>Ex Parte Swartwout, 4 </em>Cranch (8 U. S.), 75, 103 Mr. Justice Johnson said:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\u201cI am far, very far, from denying the general authority of adjudications. * * * But I deny that a court is precluded from the right, or exempted from the necessity, of examining into the correctness or consistency of its own decisions, or those of any other tribunal. * * * Strange indeed would be the doctrine, that an inadvertency once committed by a court shall ever after impose on it the necessity of persisting in its error. A case that cannot be tested by principle is not <em>law, </em>and in a thousand instances have such cases been declared so by courts of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">In <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>150 U.

W. 469, 3 L. R. A. [N. S.] 837, 5 Ann. Cas. 881).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">\u201cThe doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>like almost every other legal rule, is not without its exceptions. It does not apply to a case where it can be shown that the law has been misunderstood or misapplied, or where the former determination is evidently contrary to reason. The authorities are abundant to show that in such eases it is the duty of courts to re-examine the question. Chancellor Kent, commenting upon the rule of <em>stare decisis, </em>said that more than a thousand cases could then be pointed out, in the English and American reports, which had been overruled, doubted or limited in their application. He added that \u2018it is probable that the records of many of the courts of this country are replete with hasty and crude decisions; and in such cases ought to be examined without fear, and revised without reluctance, rather than to have the character of our law impaired, and the beauty and harmony of the system destroyed by the perpetuity of error.\u2019 (1 Kent\u2019s Commentaries (13th Ed.), 477; Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 153; <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>2 Denio (N.

Courts are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing. When they are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it. Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge; always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature; or, in other words, to the will of the law.\u201d <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Bank of United States, </em>9 Wheat. (22 U. S.) 738, 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">(g) No one has a vested right to rely upon an erroneous opinion in an analogous case <em>(Crigler </em>v. <em>Shepler, </em>79 Kan. 834 [101 Pac. 619, 23 L. R. A. (N. S.) 500]), to be protected in claimed rights based upon palpable wrong, or to be relieved either in law or in equity from his own mistake in law. <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>2 Johns. Ch. (N.

October 22, 1912, plaintiffs conveyed a conditional fee therein by warranty deed upon condition subsequent to Brooks, trustee. The statutes provided plaintiffs could convey any interest in the premises by deed. They retained a reversionary interest in the lands so conveyed. That reversion, or reversionary interest, they could convey by deed. May 26, 1916, plaintiffs conveyed this reversionary interest to Parke and wife. \u2022 Parke and wife had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>right to convey such interest acquired from plaintiffs, to whomsoever they saw fit and they did convey their interest therein by reconveying it to plaintiffs. Such interest is now revested in plaintiffs and plaintiffs\u2019 property rights based upon statutes which have been in force in this State for more than 90 years should be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\">(i) If the rule of <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District </em>is adhered to, not only will plaintiffs\u2019 rights be forfeited, but the statutes applicable to the questions involved, in force in this State since 1846, will be disregarded and overridden and plaintiffs illegally deprived of their property. No one has a vested right to ignore a public statute enacted by the legislature in the exercise of its undoubted power, applicable to transactions into which he enters, which has been in force for more than 90 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">(j) This court ought not to hesitate to pass upon the rights of one who, claiming to have acquired title in good faith to the property in question, obtained it by grant from those who never had the right to convey that which they did not own.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">(k) In deciding the <em>Halpin Case, </em>the court did not consider, at least did not mention, that that decision, made in plain violation of the applicable statutes, imperiled the rights of thousands of people who had rights of property which, if the rule of that decision is good, were by it confiscated and destroyed. Upon a mere balancing- of equities, the rule of <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District </em>should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">(l) This court ought not to disturb, or to deny, plaintiffs \u2019 rights in the property in question, \u2014 rights which were in force in 1912 when plaintiffs conveyed the conditional fee therein to Brooks, trustee,\u2014 rights which were lawfully conveyed by plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>to Parke and wife, \u2014 rights which vested in Parke and wife for a valuable consideration paid by them to plaintiffs for such rights, \u2014 rights which Parke and wife under the statute could reconvey to plaintiffs, \u2014 rights which were vested in plaintiffs at the time this suit was commenced, \u2014 rights which are still vested in plaintiffs, though it is now claimed such rights are divested by the rule in <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District </em>without notice, hearing\u2019, or an opportunity to be heard, \u2014 without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">(m) <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Rural Agricultural School District </em>was decided October 1, 1923. This suit was commenced November 25, 1931, eight years, one month and <em>24 </em>days afterward. The applicable statute of limitations (3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13964, subd. [3]) is 15 years. August 27, 1930, the successors in title to the conditional fee in the strip of land in question conveyed by plaintiffs to Brooks, trustee, conveyed it by Union Guardian Trust Company and Eastern Michigan Properties Corporation to Grover C. Dill-man, State highway commissioner. At that time, the right of reversion was vested in plaintiffs and their right of re-entry into the possession of the premises for the first time accrued against defendants. 3 Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 13966.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">(n) The pretended rights of a rich and powerful State, based solely on tenderness for palpable error, ought not to be given preference over the admitted rights of its citizens, based upon the plain provisions of applicable statutes, in force when such rights accrued and in force now.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Plaintiffs should be entitled to a decree as prayed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b698-8\">Wiest, C.
