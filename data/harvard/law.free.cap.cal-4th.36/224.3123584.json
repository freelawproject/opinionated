J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">It is established that business proprietors such as shopping centers, restaurants, and bars owe a duty to their patrons to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition, and that this duty includes an obligation to undertake \u201creasonable steps to secure common areas against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties that are likely to occur in the absence of such precautionary measures.\u201d <em>(Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Center </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 666, 674 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207] <em>(Ann </em>M.); see also <em>Taylor v. Centennial Bowl, Inc. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 114, 121 [52 Cal.Rptr. 561, 416 P.2d 793] <em>(Taylor), </em>and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We granted review to address a related issue that has divided the Courts of Appeal. In <em>Mata </em>v. <em>Mata </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1121 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 141] <em>(Mata), </em>the appellate court, reversing an order granting summary judgment, held that when a bar proprietor voluntarily employs a guard on its premises, the proprietor has \u201cassumed\u2019 a <em>\u201cduty to protecf\u2019 </em>its patrons from criminal assault \u201cand therefore the issue of foreseeability becomes <em>irrelevant.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 1128, italics added.) In the present case, which similarly concerns a bar at which guards (or \u201cbouncers\u201d) were employed, the appellate court expressly disagreed with <em>Mata, </em>finding no duty owed and reversing a jury verdict for plaintiff, a bar patron who was injured in a criminal attack by another patron and his companions.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">As we shall explain, although we agree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s criticism of the broad language of <em>Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th 1121, quoted <em>ante, </em>we nonetheless disagree with that court\u2019s conclusion that the proprietor in this case could not properly be held liable for the injury to its patron under the circumstances presented here. Accordingly, we conclude that the judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal, reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of plaintiff, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">This case arises out of a criminal assault that took place in the parking lot of defendant Trax Bar &amp; Grill (the bar or defendant) in Turlock, California. The evidence adduced at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment (see 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 359, pp. 408-410, and cases cited), is summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>On weekend nights in 1998, the bar employed two persons variously referred to throughout the trial as \u201csecurity people,\u201d \u201csecurity guards,\u201d or \u201cbouncers.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One guard was stationed on a stool outside the bar, in the bar\u2019s parking lot. The second guard, Jason Nichols, was stationed inside the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The bar manager testified that the guards were large and \u201cgood strong [men]\u201d whom the manager \u201cthought. . . would do a good job.\u201d He explained that he provided the guards with the T-shirts they wore (bearing the words \u201cTrax Security\u201d or \u201cSecurity\u201d on the back) and instructed them to (i) patrol the parking lot outside the bar to ensure that persons did not congregate or consume intoxicating beverages there, (ii) check identifications in order to keep out underage patrons, (iii) count those who entered so that occupancy did not exceed 150 persons, and (iv) not physically intervene in any altercation or attack, but instead telephone \u201c911.\u201d In response to a specific question by plaintiff\u2019s counsel concerning whether the bar \u201chad any responsibility for the safety of [its] customers in the parking lot,\u201d the manager replied, \u201c[t]o a certain point, yeah, to see that they got to their car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The bar manager explained that the local police had recommended the no-physical-intervention policy, but he conceded on recross-examination that the police could take up to 20 minutes to respond. The manager explained that one purpose of the policy was to protect the bar\u2019s own guards, who were not trained in crowd control, from injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The bar manager acknowledged that at times the bar\u2019s guards ignored the no-physical-intervention policy and personally interceded in fights between patrons, and that when the guards did so they were not disciplined for a violation of procedure. Indeed, a former guard at the Trax bar, John White (who left employment at the bar approximately one month prior to the incident here at issue), testified as an expert (on behalf of plaintiff) that the custom and practice of guards at local bars generally, and his own custom at the Trax bar, was to treat the safety of patrons as a \u201ctop priority,\u201d and to actively and physically intervene in attacks (whether inside the bar or in an adjacent parking lot) rather than simply to telephone 911. Finally, White testified that prior to terminating his employment at the Trax bar, he advised the manager that security was inadequate on busy nights.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Plaintiff Michael Wollery Delgado and his wife Dinette Douise Wollery Delgado arrived at the Trax bar approximately 10:00 to 10:30 on a Saturday night in November 1998. Plaintiff, who stood six feet one inch tall and weighed 230 pounds, had consumed two beers earlier in the evening. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>entering the bar, and over the course of the following 60 to 90 minutes, he consumed one more beer. During this time another patron, Jacob Joseph (whom plaintiff did not know), and Joseph\u2019s three or four companions, stared at plaintiff on numerous occasions, and plaintiff stared back at the group. There was no verbal or physical interaction between plaintiff and Joseph or his companions at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Prior to midnight plaintiff had become uncomfortable as a result of the continued staring and decided to leave. Although somewhat inconsistent testimony was presented to the jury concerning the events that immediately ensued leading to plaintiff\u2019s injuries, the jury could have found from the evidence the following: (1) plaintiff\u2019s wife approached Nichols (the interior guard) and expressed concern that \u201cthere was going to be a fight\u201d;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) Nichols himself then observed the hostile stares between plaintiff and Joseph and his companions and concluded that a fight was imminent;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) Nichols determined that, under the circumstances, it would be best to ask plaintiff and his wife to leave, and Nichols made that request;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (4) plaintiff and his wife thereafter left the bar, but Nichols did not escort them to their car in the parking lot;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (5) when plaintiff and his wife began to walk through the parking lot toward their car, which was parked approximately 40 feet from the bar door, the guard who earlier had been posted outside no longer was present, but 12 to 20 men were \u201cstanding\u201d in the parking lot; (6) this situation was contrary to the bar\u2019s policy of dispersing such gatherings; and (7) Joseph and his companions followed plaintiff into the parking lot and accosted him, and the other persons who were in the parking lot joined with Joseph in the assault.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Immediately after the attack, or perhaps during the course of it, the other security guard telephoned 911 to seek police assistance. The police arrested Joseph at the scene, and he subsequently was convicted of felony assault upon a plea of no contest. Plaintiff suffered a fractured skull and a subdural hematoma, was hospitalized for 16 days, and subsequently experienced adverse personality changes as well as chronic headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Plaintiff filed a personal injury suit against Trax Bar and Grill, Southern Pacific Transportation Company (the landlord), and Joseph; plaintiff\u2019s wife sued the same parties for loss of consortium. At the outset of the trial plaintiff\u2019s wife dismissed her suit, and plaintiff dismissed the landlord as a defendant. Thereafter, following opening statements, the parties stipulated that Joseph had been convicted of a felony, had filed for bankruptcy protection, and no longer was a party to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Trial continued against the Trax bar only, on a premises liability theory. The jury was instructed pursuant to BAJI No. 3.11,* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> concerning foreseeability and negligence; BAJI No. 3.13.1,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> concerning the duty to anticipate criminal conduct of a third person; and BAJI No. 8.23,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> concerning the duty of care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>owed by the proprietor of a business.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By a vote of nine to three the jury returned a special verdict finding that (i) defendant was negligent; (ii) defendant\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor causing plaintiff\u2019s injuries; and (iii) defendant was 100 percent at fault. The jury awarded economic damages of $81,391.61 (exactly $20,000 more than the amount of the medical expenses that the parties stipulated were incurred by plaintiff as a result of the physical injuries inflicted in the attack) and nothing for noneconomic damages (that is, nothing for pain and suffering). Judgment was entered accordingly. Defendant moved for a new trial, asserting that it owed no duty to protect plaintiff from assault, and that there was insufficient evidence of breach and causation. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Defendant appealed, contending that because there was no evidence of prior similar criminal assaults either on its premises or in the vicinity, the assault upon plaintiff was unforeseeable as a matter of law, and that as a consequence it owed no duty to provide a security guard and thus could not be held liable for plaintiff\u2019s injuries.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiff responded to this argument by asserting that defendant owed him a duty of care \u201cbecause of the special relationship created by the hiring of security guards,\u201d and that in any event defendant had a duty to protect plaintiff once plaintiff\u2019s wife provided defendant with notice of the \u201cpotential problem prior to its occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">While the appeal was pending, the First District Court of Appeal, Division Four, issued its opinion in <em>Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th 1121. In that case (further described <em>post, </em>at pp. 247-248), a bar proprietor employed a guard, and while the guard was on a break a customer, after being told to leave by the proprietor, walked outside and fired gunshots through the front door of the bar, killing one person and wounding others. (105 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1125-1127.) The patron\u2019s survivors sued the proprietor on a premises liability theory. The Court of Appeal in <em>Mata </em>concluded that the suit should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>not be resolved in favor of the defendant proprietor on summary judgment, but instead should proceed to trial. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1129-1130.) In reaching that determination, the Court of Appeal reasoned that because the proprietor \u201cemployed a security guard . . . , and that guard was on duty\u201d when the criminal assault and murder occurred, \u201c[t]he duty to protect had already been assumed and therefore the issue of foreseeability becomes irrelevant.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1128; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 1129.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The Court of Appeal below, responding to <em>Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th 1121, expressly disagreed with the proposition that merely because a bar proprietor employs guards or implements other similar measures, it thereby \u201cassumes\u201d a duty to protect its patrons while they are on the premises. The Court of Appeal below further disagreed with Mata\u2019s conclusion that such an assumed duty renders the issue of foreseeability \u201cirrelevant.\u201d Instead, the Court of Appeal held that \u201cgenuine foreseeability\u201d of the \u201cparticular criminal conduct\u201d involved\u2014here, an attack by up to five men, followed immediately by an attack by 12 to 20 additional men\u2014was required in order to impose a legal duty of care upon defendant. Proceeding to apply that test, the Court of Appeal concluded that although there was evidence establishing that prior fights had erupted in the Trax bar parking lot, there was no evidence of any previous \u201ccoordinated gang attack\u201d by \u201ca large group of assailants lying in wait in the parking lot.\u201d Having found no evidence of any prior <em>similar </em>criminal incident that would have put defendant on notice that such an occurrence reasonably might be anticipated, the Court of Appeal concluded that the attack upon plaintiff was unforeseeable and that defendant owed no duty to employ guards to protect plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion acknowledged (i) Nichols\u2019s testimony that plaintiff\u2019s wife told Nichols of an impending fight involving her husband, and (ii) Joseph\u2019s testimony to the effect that those who ultimately assisted in the attack upon plaintiff had been, in the lower court\u2019s words, \u201cvisible and loitering in the parking lot as a group, contrary to [defendant\u2019s] acknowledged policy of dispersing such gatherings.\u201d The Court of Appeal, however, dismissed this evidence as \u201cinsufficient to establish a duty on the part of [defendant] to prevent or intervene in\u201d the assault upon plaintiff. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We granted review to address and resolve the conflict in these decisions of the First District and Fifth District Courts of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Although \u201c[a]s a general principle, a \u2018defendant owes a duty of care to all persons who are foreseeably endangered by his conduct, with respect to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>risks which make the conduct unreasonably dangerous\u2019 \u201d <em>(Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 425, 434\u2014435 [131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334] <em>(Tarasoff); </em>see generally Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714; <em>Lugtu v. California Highway Patrol </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 703, 716 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 528, 28 P.3d 249], and authorities cited), it also is well established that, as a general matter, there is no duty to act to protect others from the conduct of third parties. <em>(Tarasoff, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 425, 435; see also <em>Paz v. State of California </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 550, 558 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 703, 994 P.2d 975] <em>(Paz); Williams v. State of California </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 18, 23 [192 Cal.Rptr. 233, 664 P.2d 137] <em>{Williams); </em>Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 314.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But as explained, <em>post, </em>courts have recognized exceptions to the general no-duty-to-protect rule, one of which\u2014the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d doctrine\u2014is dispositive in this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">A defendant may owe an affirmative duty to protect another from the conduct of third parties if he or she has a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the other person. (See 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 858-866, pp. 220-233; 2 Dobbs, The Law of Torts (2001) \u00a7\u00a7 317, 322-332 (Dobbs on Torts).) Courts have found such a special relationship in cases involving the relationship between business proprietors such as shopping centers, restaurants, and bars, and their tenants, patrons, or invitees. Accordingly, in <em>Ann M., </em>we recognized as \u201cwell established\u201d the proposition that a proprietor\u2019s \u201cgeneral duty of maintenance, which is owed to tenants and patrons, . . . include[s] <em>the duty to take reasonable steps to secure common areas against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties that are likely to occur in the absence of such precautionary </em>measures.\u201d <em>(Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, 674, italics added; see also <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken of Cal., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 814, 819, &amp; 823-824 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 756, 927 P2d 1260] <em>(Kentucky Fried Chicken) </em>[proprietor who has reason to believe, from observation or experience, that the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>another endangers an invitee has a duty to take reasonable steps to protect the invitee]; <em>Peterson v. San Francisco Community College Dist. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 799, 806 [205 Cal.Rptr. 842, 685 P.2d 1193] [a special relationship exists between \u201ca possessor of land and members of the public who enter in response to the landowner\u2019s invitation\u201d]; <em>Taylor, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 114, 121 [a business proprietor has a \u201cduty to take affirmative action to control the wrongful acts of third persons which threaten invitees where the [proprietor] has reasonable cause to anticipate such acts and the probability of injury resulting therefrom\u201d; further described <em>post, </em>at p. 241]; Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 344.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">A. <em>The special-relationship-based duty to provide security guards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In a series of cases we have addressed the narrow question of when the scope of a proprietor\u2019s special-relationship-based duty to patrons or invitees properly can be found to include a duty to provide security guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In <em>Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 112 [211 Cal.Rptr. 356, 695 P.2d 653] <em>(Isaacs), </em>we suggested that a proprietor (there, a hospital) might have a duty to provide guards to protect patrons and invitees (in that case, a physician who practiced at the hospital) from criminal attacks by third parties upon the premises, so long as such an attack was reasonably foreseeable \u201cin light of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 126-129.) This formulation left open the possibility that a proprietor might have a duty to provide guards to protect against third party conduct, even in the absence of prior similar conduct putting the proprietor on notice of the need to protect against such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">In <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, we expressly retreated from the open-ended formulation set forth in <em>Isaacs. </em>In <em>Ann M. </em>the plaintiff, an employee who worked at a business located in a shopping center, was raped during business hours by a person who entered her place of employment. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>asserting premises liability against the defendant shopping center, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant\u2019s duty to maintain common areas in a reasonably safe condition included an obligation to provide guards in those areas. On the facts there presented, we concluded that the scope of the proprietor\u2019s duty did not include an obligation to provide such guards, and held that the trial court properly had granted summary judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We began our discussion in <em>Ann M. </em>by noting several basic legal propositions relating to the question of duty. We observed that the existence of a legal duty is a question of law for the court to determine <em>(Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 674), that foreseeability is a \u201ccrucial factor\u201d in determining the existence and scope of a legal duty <em>(id., </em>at p. 676),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that \u201c[fjoreseeability, when analyzed to determine the existence or scope of a duty, is a question of law to be decided by the court\u201d <em>(Ann M., </em>at p. 678). We also acknowledged the \u201cwell established\u201d rule that commercial proprietors (because they generally stand in a special relationship with their tenants, patrons, or invitees) are required to \u201cmaintain land in their possession and control in a reasonably safe condition\u201d and that this general duty includes taking \u201creasonable steps to secure common areas against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties that are likely to occur in the absence of such precautionary measures.\u201d <em>(Ann M., </em>at p. 674, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Explicating the proper approach to foreseeability analysis in relation to a business proprietor\u2019s duty to provide protection for patrons and invitees from third party crime, we stated in <em>Ann M.: </em>\u201c[B]efore and after our decision in <em>Isaacs, </em>we have recognized that the scope of the duty is determined in part by balancing the foreseeability of the harm against the burden of the duty to be imposed. <em>(Isaacs, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 125.) \u2018 \u201c[I]n cases where the burden of preventing future harm is great, a high degree of foreseeability may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>required. [Citation.] On the other hand, in cases where there are strong policy reasons for preventing the harm, or the harm can be prevented by simple means, a lesser degree of foreseeability may be required.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] Or, as one appellate court has accurately explained, duty in such circumstances is determined by a balancing of \u2018foreseeability\u2019 of the criminal acts against the \u2018burdensomeness, vagueness, and efficacy\u2019 of the proposed security measures. <em>(Gomez </em>v. <em>Ticor </em>[(1983)] 145 Cal.App.3d [622,] 631 [193 Cal.Rptr. 600].)\u201d <em>(Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 678-679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Turning to the plaintiff\u2019s specific claim that the proprietor\u2019s duty to reasonably secure the premises against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties included, in the circumstances there presented, a legal obligation to provide guards, we stated in <em>Ann M. </em>that although \u201cthere may be circumstances where the hiring of security guards will be required to satisfy a landowner\u2019s duty of care, such action will rarely, if ever, be found to be a \u2018minimal burden.\u2019 The monetary costs of security guards is not insignificant. Moreover, the obligation to provide patrols adequate to deter criminal conduct is not well defined. \u2018No one really knows why people commit crime, hence no one really knows what is \u201cadequate\u201d deterrence in any given situation.\u2019 [Citation.] Finally, the social costs of imposing a duty on landowners to hire private police forces are also not insignificant. [Citation.] For these reasons, we conclude that <em>a high degree of foreseeability is required in order to find that the scope of a landlord\u2019s duty of care includes the hiring of security guards. </em>We further conclude that the requisite degree of foreseeability rarely, if ever, can be proven in the absence of prior similar incidents of violent crime on the landowner\u2019s premises.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] To hold otherwise would be to impose an unfair burden upon landlords and, in effect, would force landlords to become the insurers of public safety, contrary to well-established policy in this state. [Citations].\u201d <em>(Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, 678-679, italics added.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Thereafter, in <em>Sharon P., supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 1181, we further elaborated upon the principles set forth in <em>Ann M. </em>In <em>Sharon P, </em>the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>assaulted and raped shortly after parting her car in a dimly lighted garage located beneath the building in which she was employed. Although there had been recent robberies in a nearby bank, and assorted other crimes within a 50-block area surrounding the underground parting garage, there was no evidence of the occurrence of crimes similar to the assault upon the plaintiff in or near the parting garage\u2014and indeed, no evidence of any crimes in the parting garage during the previous 10 years. After the plaintiff sued the owners and operators of the parting garage, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>(Sharon P., </em>at pp. 1185-1187.) The Court of Appeal, in a divided opinion, reversed on the basis that commercial underground parking structures are \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d and, notwithstanding the absence of prior similar incidents of assaults in or near the parting garage, a jury should be allowed to determine whether the defendant\u2019s duty to provide reasonable security included an obligation to provide guards or other similar measures. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1187-1188.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We granted review in <em>Sharon P. </em>and ultimately reversed the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in that case. We found the evidence of prior crimes insufficiently similar to the violent assault upon the plaintiff to \u201cestablish a high degree of foreseeability that would justify . . . imposition of ... an obligation\u201d on the defendants\u2019 part \u201cto provide security guards in their garage.\u201d <em>(Sharon P., supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1191; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 1195.) We also rejected, as legally unsupported and contrary to sound public policy, the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that underground parting facilities are, as a matter of law, \u201cinherently dangerous,\u201d and hence that those who own or control them must provide guards. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1191-1195.) Finally, we addressed the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the defendants had an obligation to undertake <em>other, </em>assertedly less burdensome security measures, such as ensuring that the garage was brightly lighted and clean, activating and monitoring previously installed security cameras, and requiring existing personnel to walk periodically through the garage. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1195-1199.) We questioned whether such other measures, in reality, would be significantly less burdensome than the hiring of guards <em>(id., </em>at pp. 1196-1197), and applied the heightened foreseeability test: \u201c[A]bsent any prior similar incidents or other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of violent criminal assaults in that location,[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>we cannot conclude defendants were required to secure the area against such crime.\u201d <em>(Sharon P., </em>at p. 1199.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In summary, as explained in <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, and <em>Sharon P., supra, 21 </em>Cal.4th 1181, only when \u201cheightened\u201d foreseeability of third party criminal activity on the premises exists\u2014shown by prior similar incidents or other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of violent criminal assaults in that location\u2014does the scope of a business proprietor\u2019s special-relationship-based duty <em>include an obligation to provide guards </em>to protect the safety of patrons. <em>(Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 679 &amp; fn. 7; <em>Sharon P., supra, 21 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 1190-1191, 1197-1198.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">B. <em>Other special-relationship-based duties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Even when proprietors such as those described, <em>ante, </em>have no duty under <em>Ann M. </em>and <em>Sharon P. </em>to provide a security guard or undertake other similarly burdensome preventative measures, the proprietor is not necessarily insulated from liability under the special relationship doctrine. A proprietor that has no duty under <em>Ann M. </em>and <em>Sharon P. </em>to hire a security guard or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>undertake other similarly burdensome preventative measures still owes a duty of due care to a patron or invitee by virtue of the special relationship, and there are circumstances (apart from the failure to provide a security guard or undertake other similarly burdensome preventative measures) that may give rise to liability based upon the proprietor\u2019s special relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">For example, it long has been recognized that restaurant proprietors have a special-relationship-based duty to undertake relatively simple measures such as providing \u201cassistance [to] their customers who become ill or need medical attention and that they are liable if they fail to act.\u201d <em>(Breaux v. Gino's, Inc. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 379, 382 [200 Cal.Rptr. 260]; see generally Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 314A.) Similarly, a restaurant or bar proprietor also has a duty to warn patrons of known dangers (see Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 344) and, in circumstances in which a warning alone is insufficient, has a duty to take other reasonable and appropriate measures to protect patrons or invitees from imminent or \u201congoing\u201d criminal conduct. <em>(Kentucky Fried Chicken, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 814, 823.) Such measures may include telephoning the police or 911 for assistance (e.g., <em>Johnston v. Fontana </em>(La.Ct.App. 1997) 610 So.2d 1119, 1121-1122 [duty of bar proprietor]), or protecting patrons or invitees from an imminent and known peril lurking in a parking lot by providing an escort by existing security personnel to a car in that parking lot. <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 114, 121-125 [duty of bar proprietor]; see generally BAJI No. 8.23, quoted <em>ante, </em>at fn. 9, under which the jury in this case was instructed.) Moreover, as especially relevant to the present case, California decisions long have recognized, under the special relationship doctrine, that a proprietor who serves intoxicating drinks to customers for consumption on the premises must \u201cexercis[e] reasonable care to protect his patrons from injury at the hands of fellow guests\u201d <em>{Saatzer v. Smith </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 512, 518 [176 Cal.Rptr. 68] <em>{Saatzer)), </em>and that such a duty \u201c \u2018arises . . . when one or more of the following circumstances exists: (1) A tavern keeper allowed a person on the premises who has a known propensity for fighting; (2) the tavern keeper allowed a person to remain on the premises whose conduct had become obstreperous and aggressive to such a degree the tavern keeper knew or ought to have known he endangered others; (3) the tavern keeper had been warned of danger from an obstreperous patron and failed to take suitable measures for the protection of others; (4) the tavern keeper failed to stop a fight as soon as possible after it started; (5) the tavern keeper failed to provide a staff adequate to police the premises[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>] and (6) the tavern keeper tolerated disorderly conditions [citations].\u2019 \u201d <em>{Saatzer, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.3d at p. 518; see also <em>Slawinski v. Mocettini </em>(1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 192, 196 [31 Cal.Rptr. 613], and authorities cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>Taylor, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 114, illustrates how these principles are applied. In that case the plaintiff, a female bar patron, twice was offensively propositioned by a male patron. Although the plaintiff rebuffed the male patron\u2019s advances, she testified she felt she had no reason to fear him. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 118.) The bar employed a bouncer, who observed and overheard these encounters. Later, as the plaintiff prepared to leave when the bar was closing, the bouncer warned her not to \u201c \u2018go outside because that goofball is out there.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The plaintiff replied that it was late and that she needed to depart for home so she later could go to work. The bouncer then walked the plaintiff to the bar door but did not escort her to her car in the parking lot. Upon arriving at her car in the lot, the plaintiff was attacked by the male bar patron and severely injured. The plaintiff sued the bar, claiming it was negligent in failing to provide her with adequate protection from a known danger of imminent criminal assault. After presentation of the evidence, the trial court issued a directed verdict for the bar. This court reversed, concluding from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s bouncer \u201cmust have been apprised of the potential danger to plaintiff of assault by \u2018the goofball\u2019 that the bouncer\u2019s warning did not adequately apprise the plaintiff of the imminent danger she faced and she had a right to depart from the bar when she elected to do so; and that the bouncer \u201ccould have easily protected her from the danger he apparently anticipated by simply accompanying [the] plaintiff to her car.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 123-124.) Accordingly, we held, it was a question for the jury whether the bouncer\u2019s \u201cmere admonition not to enter the parking lot because \u2018that goofball is out there\u2019 \u201d satisfied the defendant\u2019s special-relationship-based duty to the plaintiff. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We now apply to the case before us the principles discussed above. We shall conclude, contrary to the Court of Appeal below, that defendant owed a duty to plaintiff pursuant to the special relationship doctrine. Prior to doing so, however, we first address a preliminary point advocated by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">A. <em>Is \u201cheightenedforeseeability\u201d always required when a plaintiff seeks to impose a special-relationship-based duty upon a proprietor?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Defendant, supported by an amicus curiae on its behalf, asserts that a showing of heightened foreseeability as defined by <em>Ann M. </em>and its progeny <em>always </em>is required when a plaintiff seeks to impose special-relationship-based liability upon a proprietor related to the criminal conduct of a third party. In support, defendant and amicus curiae rely upon <em>Hassoon v. Shamieh </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1191 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 658] <em>(Hassoon).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>In <em>Hassoon </em>a customer, the plaintiff, was inside a grocery store at night when he and the store\u2019s employee noticed a man\u2014known to be a drug dealer\u2014being beaten on the sidewalk by a group of fellow drug dealers. The store\u2019s employee rescued the victim and brought him inside while the attackers remained outside. Soon thereafter shots were fired into the store, injuring the customer, who subsequently sued the proprietors and the employee, claiming that the proprietors\u2019 employee acted negligently in rescuing the victim and thereby exposing the customer to the ensuing gunshots fired from outside the store. <em>(Hassoon, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1193-1194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Clearly, the facts in <em>Hassoon </em>did not implicate a proprietor\u2019s possible obligation to provide guards or take other similarly burdensome action designed to prevent future crime, but instead concerned only a proprietor\u2019s asserted duty to <em>refrain </em>from rescuing a crime victim in the face of unfolding criminal activity on or near the premises and from thereby putting the customer in danger. Nevertheless, in affirming summary judgment in favor of the defendants on three separate grounds,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Court of Appeal in <em>Hassoon </em>broadly stated as its first ground that \u201cthe absence of proof of prior similar incidents at defendants\u2019 place of business is fatal to a successful damages claim in tort\u201d and \u201cmeans the shooting was not foreseeable.\u201d <em>(Hassoon, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at p. 1195.) In addition, the Court of Appeal asserted that \u201cthe requirement of \u2018prior similar incidents\u2019 is ... a factual precondition to premises liability.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">This aspect of the decision in Hassoon\u2014and the similarly broad position advanced by defendant and amicus curiae on its behalf, as well as by the dissenting opinions in this case\u2014is facially inconsistent with our decisions in <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, and its progeny, all of which, when articulating and applying the heightened foreseeability doctrine, expressly reaffirm the sliding-scale balancing formula articulated prior to and in our decision in <em>Isaacs, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 112, 125, under which we have recognized that, as a general matter, imposition of a high burden requires heightened foreseeability, but a minimal burden may be imposed upon a showing of a lesser degree of foreseeability. (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 237, quoting <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 678-679, which in turn quoted and followed both <em>Isaacs, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 112, 125, and <em>Gomez v. Ticor, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d 622, 631; <em>Sharon P., supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1195 [same]; <em>Wiener, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at pp. 1146-1147 [same; described <em>ante, </em>at fn. 20]; see also <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 814, 819.)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Accordingly, to the extent <em>Hassoon v. Shamieh, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th 1191, 1195, suggests that a showing of heightened foreseeability is required in all premises liability cases\u2014regardless of the extent of the burden sought to be imposed upon the defendant\u2014that aspect of <em>Hassoon </em>is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">B. <em>Special-relationship analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Turning to the application of the special relationship doctrine in the case before us, it is undisputed that defendant, a bar proprietor, stood in a special relationship with plaintiff, its patron and invitee, and hence owed a duty to undertake \u201creasonable steps to secure common areas against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties that [were] likely to occur in the absence of such precautionary measures\u201d <em>(Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, 674) and to take such \u201cappropriate action as is reasonable under the circumstances to protect patrons.\u201d <em>(Kentucky Fried Chicken, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 814, 823; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 819; <em>Taylor, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 114, 121 [proprietor has duty \u201cto take affirmative action to control the wrongful acts of third persons which threaten invitees\u201d] and cases cited; <em>Saatzer, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.3d at p. 518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">To the extent plaintiff\u2019s special-relationship-based claim rests upon an assertion that defendant was legally required to provide a guard or guards or to undertake any similarly burdensome measures, we initially must consider whether defendant was obligated to do so under <em>Ann M. </em>and <em>Sharon P. </em>In this respect, of course, plaintiff was required to demonstrate heightened foreseeability in the form of prior similar criminal incidents <em>(or </em>other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of violent criminal assaults in the bar or its parking lot\u2014see <em>ante, </em>at fn. 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>In considering whether plaintiff made such a showing, we reject the suggestion of the Court of Appeal below that in order to establish heightened foreseeability under <em>Ann M., </em>plaintiff was required to produce evidence not only of prior similar criminal assaults, but of \u201ca coordinated gang attack on an individual patron.\u201d Heightened foreseeability is satisfied by a showing of prior <em>similar </em>criminal incidents (or other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of violent criminal assaults in that location) and does not require a showing of prior <em>nearly identical </em>criminal incidents. (See <em>Claxton v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 327, 339 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 425] [plaintiff victim of a violent and racially motivated crime committed at a gas station established heightened foreseeability by demonstrating that the premises had been the scene of numerous recent violent crimes, although none of those prior crimes was a racially motivated crime].)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Although the record refers to a few prior altercations between patrons, we agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal below that plaintiff produced insufficient evidence of heightened foreseeability in the form of prior similar incidents or other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of a violent criminal assault on defendant\u2019s premises that would have imposed upon defendant an obligation to provide any guard, or additional guards, to protect against third party assaults. But the absence of heightened foreseeability in this case merely signifies that defendant owed no special-relationship-based duty to provide guards or undertake other similarly burdensome preventative measures; it does not signify that defendant owed no <em>other </em>special-relationship-based duty to plaintiff, such as a duty to respond to events unfolding in its presence by undertaking reasonable, relatively simple, and minimally burdensome measures. Indeed, the record clearly establishes the existence of such a minimally burdensome duty here.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">As noted earlier, the trial record contains evidence that defendant\u2019s employee and guard, Nichols, was aware of facts that led him to conclude, at least a few minutes prior to the occurrence of the assault (and prior to plaintiff\u2019s departure from the bar), that a fight was likely to occur between Joseph and his three or four companions and plaintiff, absent some intervention on Nichols\u2019s part. The record also establishes that Nichols formed the opinion that in order to avoid an altercation it was necessary to separate plaintiff from Joseph and his group by removing plaintiff from the bar while simultaneously leaving Joseph and his group inside, and that in order to put that plan into action Nichols approached plaintiff and directed him to depart from the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Having considered the <em>Rowland </em>factors <em>(Rowland v. Christian, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 108, 113, quoted <em>ante, </em>at fn. 15) as they apply to these circumstances, we conclude, first, that under the circumstances it was foreseeable that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>assault would occur absent separation of Joseph and his group from plaintiff. The remaining <em>Rowland </em>factors similarly support a determination that defendant had a special-relationship-based duty to respond to the unfolding events by taking reasonable, relatively simple, and minimally burdensome steps in order to address the imminent danger that Nichols perceived, and, specifically, in order to accomplish the separation that he had determined was necessary. Indeed, defense counsel essentially conceded this general point during oral argument before this court\u2014responding with the words \u201cCertainly. Certainly\u201d to a question whether, in light of the circumstances then known to Nichols, there was \u201csome minimal duty\u201d on the part of defendant.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Such minimally burdensome measures may have included, for example, Nichols attempting to maintain the separation between plaintiff and Joseph\u2019s group that Nichols had determined was called for in order to avoid an imminent assault, by turning his attention to Joseph and his companions in order to dissuade them from following plaintiff (who, at Nichols\u2019s direction, was departing from the bar).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And, in the face of the continuing threat of a five-on-one altercation if Nichols were unable to dissuade Joseph and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>companions from following plaintiff outside, defendant also might have confirmed that the outside guard was at his <em>post </em>in the parking lot and was available, as necessary, to help maintain the desired separation between plaintiff and Joseph and his companions. (See <em>Taylor, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 114, 123-125 [duty of bar proprietor to respond to imminent criminal conduct]; <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 814, 823 [restaurant proprietor has a duty to respond to ongoing conduct by taking \u201csuch appropriate action as is reasonable under the circumstances to protect patrons\u201d]; <em>Saatzer, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.3d 512, 518 [a bar proprietor\u2019s duty to protect patrons \u201c \u2018arises . . . when ... the tavern keeper had been warned of danger from an obstreperous patron and failed to take suitable measures for the protection of others\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">As noted at the outset of this opinion, we granted review in this matter largely in light of the conflict between the Court of Appeal opinion in this case and the earlier Court of Appeal opinion in <em>Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th 1121. To avoid similar conflict and confusion in future cases, we believe it is appropriate at this time to address the <em>Mata </em>decision and to explain why we, like the Court of Appeal, find some of the language and analysis of <em>Mata </em>to be overbroad and potentially misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>In <em>Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th 1121, a bar proprietor posted a guard inside the front door of its bar and armed him with a billy club and a large flashlight. The guard was instructed to monitor the number of patrons who entered the bar so as not to exceed the room\u2019s capacity, to inspect identifications in order to detect and keep out minors, to check customers for weapons, and to eject unruly customers and prevent certain \u201cbanned\u201d customers from entering the bar or remaining on the premises. In addition, the guard was instructed to inform the bar proprietor when he needed to take a break, so that the proprietor could assume the guard\u2019s responsibilities. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 1126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">On the evening in question the guard on duty at the bar asked the proprietor\u2019s brother to assume his post while he took a restroom break. During the guard\u2019s break a customer, who previously had been banned from the bar and yet, earlier that same evening, had returned to and been ejected from the bar, returned yet again to the bar and, after again being told to leave, walked outside and immediately fired gunshots through the front door of the bar, killing one person and wounding others. <em>{Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1125-1127.) The surviving relatives of the patron who was killed and other injured patrons and their relatives sued the proprietor on a premises liability theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Overturning the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the defendant, the Court of Appeal in <em>Mata </em>asserted that <em>\u201cAnn M. </em>is inapposite as to [the proprietor\u2019s liability] because [the proprietor] employed a security guard . . . , and that guard was on duty [when the criminal assault and murder occurred].\u201d <em>{Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at p. 1128.) The court in <em>Mata </em>continued, very broadly: <em>\u201cThe duty to protect had already been assumed </em>and <em>therefore the issue of foreseeability becomes irrelevant.\u201d {Ibid., </em>italics added; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 1129.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Within the context of the special relationship doctrine, this broad language is potentially misleading. Contrary to the suggestion that \u201cthe issue of foreseeability becomes irrelevant\u201d whenever a proprietor has employed a security guard <em>{Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at p. 1128), the foreseeability of the criminal conduct in question remains relevant to the existence and scope of a proprietor\u2019s duty under the special relationship doctrine. For example, foreseeability remains highly relevant in determining the existence and scope of any duty, discussed, <em>ante, </em>to warn of dangers or to take appropriate measures to protect patrons or invitees from <em>ongoing </em>or <em>imminent </em>criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Based upon the language quoted, <em>ante, </em>it also appears that the Court of Appeal\u2019s determination in <em>Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th 1121, that a duty existed in that case, may have been influenced by the appellate court\u2019s understanding of a related but separate doctrine\u2014the negligent undertaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>doctrine. Our cases establish that a volunteer who, having no initial duty to do so, undertakes to provide protective services to another, will be found to have a duty to exercise due care in the performance of that undertaking if one of two conditions is met: either (a) the volunteer\u2019s failure to exercise such care increases the risk of harm to the other person, or (b) the other person reasonably relies upon the volunteer\u2019s undertaking and suffers injury as a result.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Even if the court in <em>Mata </em>may have been influenced by that doctrine, however, the decision\u2019s broad language failed to recognize the important limitations and qualifications of that doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><em>Mata </em>indicated in expansive terms that by hiring a guard a proprietor necessarily assumes a general duty to protect its patrons. We disagree. First, the scope of any duty assumed depends upon the nature of the undertaking. (See <em>Artiglio, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 604, 614\u2014615.) Merely because a supermarket or other similar enterprise \u201cchooses to have a security program\u201d that includes provision of a roving security guard does not signify that the proprietor has assumed a duty to protect invitees from third party violence. <em>(Brown v. Schnuck Markets, Inc. </em>(Mo.Ct.App. 1998) 973 S.W.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>530, 535.) A store that hires a \u201csecurity officer\u201d to guard its interior \u201ccash office\u201d for three hours each day does not assume a duty to protect a customer who is injured in the store\u2019s exterior parking lot by the criminal act of a third party. (See <em>Posecai </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. </em>(La. 1999) 752 So.2d 762, 764, <em>769 &amp; </em>fn. 7.) Second, as noted, <em>ante, </em>a defendant\u2019s undertaking will support the finding of a duty to another only if (a) the defendant\u2019s action increased the risk of harm to another, or (b) the other person reasonably relied upon the undertaking to his or her detriment. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 18, 23; <em>Weissich v. County of Marin, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d 1069, 1077.) The court in <em>Mata </em>did not consider whether the imposition of liability in that case was consistent with these limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Finally, contrary to the implications of <em>Mata's </em>broad language <em>(Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at p. 1128), foreseeability remains a highly relevant factor\u2014 even in cases in which a legal duty is found (and regardless of the doctrine under which it is found). For example, even when a proprietor voluntarily has employed one or more guards and properly is found to owe a duty to patrons, foreseeability remains relevant to the fact finder\u2019s determination of breach and causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We conclude that the Court of Appeal below erred in reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of plaintiff on the ground that defendant owed no duty to plaintiff. Instead, as explained, <em>ante </em>because defendant had actual notice of an impending assault involving Joseph and plaintiff, its special-relationship-based duty included an obligation to take reasonable, relatively simple, and minimally burdensome steps to attempt to avert that danger. Whether there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s determinations of breach of duty and causation are matters, among others, to be addressed by the Court of Appeal on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings to permit that court to address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions as well as the issues concerning damages raised by plaintiff in his cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Trial testimony established that \u201cbouncer\u201d is the common term for a person who provides security services in a bar or other similar establishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Nichols so testified.

After the trial court granted summary judgment for the defendants, the appellate court reversed. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1145.) On review, we concluded that the trial court properly granted summary judgment. We found no evidence of prior similar incidents or other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of violent criminal assaults in that location.

The dissent apparently reasons, however, that because defendant did not and reasonably could not foresee what \u201cactually occurred\u201d\u2014that is, that Joseph and his companions would gain a large number of reinforcements in the parking lot\u2014defendant had no duty even to take the steps necessary to attempt to maintain the separation that Nichols had determined was called for to avoid the more limited group attack that Nichols actually anticipated. But the circumstance that the precise size of the actual gang attack that occurred may not have been reasonably foreseeable does not absolve defendant of the duty to take reasonable steps based upon the nature of the danger that its employee could (and, indeed, did) foresee.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">As noted, <em>ante, </em>the question whether there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s implied findings that defendant breached its duty of care and that such breach was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury is distinct from the issue addressed here\u2014namely, whether defendant owed a duty of care to plaintiff under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\">See <em>Williams, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 18, 23 et seq.

Contributing to the complexity are considerations such as these: (1) the difficulty of predicting when and under what circumstances a criminal might strike; (2) the difficulty of determining whether the business owner should be held civilly liable for the harm caused by the third party\u2019s criminal conduct; (3) the need to avoid imposing a particularly onerous burden on business owners in poor areas where the risk of criminal activity is particularly great, as the owners will pass the burden on to customers who, because of their poverty, are less able to shoulder it; and (4) the concern that imposing too onerous a burden on business owners in poor areas may cause them to close their businesses or relocate to safer and more affluent communities, thus depriving the poor of jobs and essential services.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In this case, as plaintiff Michael Wollery Delgado was leaving defendant\u2019s restaurant, a gang of 10 to 15 men, apparently on a prearranged signal, came out of hiding and brutally attacked him.

Plaintiff did not anticipate any attack, and neither he nor his wife noticed anyone in the parking lot. Just before reaching the car, plaintiff heard someone yell in a foreign language; as he turned around, he saw Joseph. When Joseph got near him, Joseph again yelled in a foreign language, at which point roughly a dozen men instantly surrounded and attacked plaintiff. After getting punched, kicked, and sprayed with pepper spray, plaintiff broke free and ran across the parking lot, through a park, and into the street, where some of the assailants caught up with him and seriously injured him by hitting him with a baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s wife corroborated his version of events. She testified that upon Joseph\u2019s yell, 10 to 15 men came out of nowhere, \u201clike they had been crouched behind cars,\u201d and attacked her husband. She saw her husband break free of the initial assault, run across the parking lot, through the park, and into the street, where he was again attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">According to security guard Nichols, plaintiff\u2019s wife told him inside the restaurant that there was going to be a fight. When he looked over he saw plaintiff and Joseph staring at each other; the staring indicated there was going to be a fight, and he asked plaintiff to leave. As Nichols escorted plaintiff and his companions into the parking lot, one of the men who had been with Joseph came out and asked plaintiff, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d When plaintiff in turn asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?,\u201d four men rushed toward plaintiff. Nichols grabbed the arm of one of the men; at that point some 15 men suddenly appeared from behind cars and a trash dumpster and surrounded plaintiff \u201clike a wolf pack.\u201d In coming to plaintiff\u2019s aid, security guard Nichols was injured. Nichols saw plaintiff break free and run across the parking lot and into the street. The other guard, Juan Navarro, called 911, the emergency telephone number, to report the attack. The police responded within two to three minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Called as a rebuttal witness, plaintiff\u2019s wife denied approaching security guard Nichols in the bar and warning him there was going to be a fight. She also disputed Nichols\u2019s version of events leading up to the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Jacob Joseph testified that, while inside, he and plaintiff stared at each other, that after he went outside to smoke a cigarette plaintiff came out and swore at him and put up his hands as if to fight, that Joseph then yelled out something in Assyrian, whereupon a group of men attacked plaintiff. Joseph said that when he came outside, several men were already \u201c[hjanging out in the parking lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Plaintiff sued defendant, the restaurant, alleging negligence. The jury found for plaintiff and awarded him $81,391.61 in damages. Defendant appealed. While the appeal was pending, the First District Court of Appeal decided <em>Mata </em>v. <em>Mata </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1121 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 141], which involved a negligence action against a business owner based on a third party\u2019s violent criminal act. <em>Mata </em>held that because the owner had employed a security guard who was working at the time of the shooting, the \u201cduty to protect had already been assumed and therefore the issue of foreseeability becomes irrelevant\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1128), rendering it unnecessary for the plaintiff to \u201cprove the proprietor had notice of prior similar acts\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1129). In this case, the Fifth District Court of Appeal reversed the judgment for plaintiff based on lack of a duty, and expressly disagreed with the <em>Mata </em>court\u2019s holding on foreseeability. We granted review to resolve the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>I agree with the majority that the court in <em>Mata v. Mata, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th 1121, erred in saying that in that case foreseeability was irrelevant. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 250.) But I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that defendant here owed plaintiff a duty to anticipate and take precautions against the unforeseeable violent criminal gang assault that led to plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Did defendant business owner owe plaintiff a duty to take advance precautions to protect plaintiff from the vicious and violent gang assault he suffered? The answer is no, because the attack could not have been reasonably foreseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The existence and the scope of a duty owed is a question of law to be decided by the court. <em>(Ann M. </em>v. <em>Pacific Plaza Shopping Center </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 666, 674 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207] <em>(Ann M.).) </em>Whether a duty exists depends on considerations of policy. <em>(Rowland v. Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 112-113 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561].) As a leading treatise has observed, duty \u201cis only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u201d (Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 53, p. 358.) Foreseeability is an important factor in determining the existence of duty. <em>(Ann M., supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 676.) It also plays a crucial role in determining proximate cause. <em>(Ballard v. Uribe </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 564, 572, fn. 6 [224 Cal.Rptr. 664, 715 P.2d 624].) But whereas a jury decides causation, it is the court that determines whether a duty exists. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Here, the issue is one of duty, not causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In tort law, the question of when to impose liability against a business owner for not taking precautions against possible future criminal acts of third parties has been a vexing one. Two basic approaches have evolved, as this court explained in <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pages 677-679. The totality of circumstances test applies general principles of negligence; it takes into account such things as the nature, condition, and location of the premises; it views foreseeability as a question of fact that turns on the evidence. The second approach takes the view that a business owner has no duty in the absence of a prior similar incident on the premises; in other words, it views foreseeability as requiring the occurrence of a prior similar event before a duty to take precautionary measures can be imposed on the business owner. (2 Dobbs, The Law of Torts (2001) \u00a7 324, pp. 877-878.) The discussion that follows sheds some light on how this court has applied those two approaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>In 1985, this court in <em>Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 112 [211 Cal.Rptr. 356, 695 P.2d 653] <em>(Isaacs), </em>held that the existence of a business owner\u2019s duty to anticipate criminal acts of third parties could be established, even if there had not been a prior similar incident, by considering the totality of circumstances, with foreseeability of harm being a question of fact for the jury. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 126, 127, 130; see also <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken of Cal., Inc, v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 814, 823-824 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 756, 927 P.2d 1260].)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Eight years later in <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, this court held that in the absence of a prior similar incident, a business owner had no duty to provide security guards to protect a plaintiff against a criminal assault by a third party. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 679.) In reaching this conclusion, <em>Ann M. </em>revisited the totality of circumstances rule this court had adopted in <em>Isaacs, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 112, noting there was no need in <em>Isaacs </em>to consider the viability of the prior similar incident approach in order to decide the case because the facts there disclosed ample evidence of prior third party criminal assaults. <em>(Ann M., supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 678.) <em>Ann M. </em>also observed that, contrary to the broadly worded suggestion in <em>Isaacs, </em>foreseeability in the context of duty analysis is a question of law for the court, not a question of fact for the jury. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Six years later, in <em>Sharon P. v. Arman, Ltd. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1181 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 35, 989 P.2d 121], we applied the prior similar incident rule of <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, to a business owner\u2019s failure to provide security measures other than hiring guards. We there held that, in the absence of a prior similar incident or other evidence showing a foreseeable risk of a violent criminal assault, the business owner did not owe the plaintiff a duty to deter criminal assaults in its underground garage by keeping the garage brightly lit and clean, or by \u201crequiring] existing personnel to periodically walk through the garage.\u201d <em>(Sharon P., supra, </em>at p. 1196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Most recently, in 2004, we applied the prior similar incident rule to hold that, in the absence of a prior similar incident, the operator of a child care center did not owe a duty to protect against a violent criminal assault by a man intentionally driving a car through a four-foot-high chain link fence onto a playground and into a group of children. <em>(Wiener v. Southcoast Childcare Centers, Inc. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1138, 1150 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 615, 88 P.3d 517].) We noted that \u201cour cases analyze third party criminal acts differently from ordinary negligence, and require us to apply a heightened sense of foreseeability before we can hold a defendant liable for the criminal acts of third parties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1149-1150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Here, in discussing the sudden, unexpected, and vicious gang attack on plaintiff, the Court of Appeal noted that \u201c[n]othing even remotely similar\u201d had ever occurred before on defendant\u2019s premises, and thus the assault on plaintiff could not have been foreseen. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeal relied on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666. Indeed, like the plaintiffs in <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, <em>Sharon P. v. Arman, Ltd., supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 1181, and <em>Wiener v. Southcoast Childcare Centers, Inc., supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 1138, plaintiff here was the victim of a criminal assault by a third party. As the Court of Appeal noted, and as the majority here concedes (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 245), there had been no prior similar attacks at Trax. Although in the past there had been some altercations between patrons, none involved gang fights or gang attacks on patrons. (See <em>Alvarez v. Jacmar Pacific Pizza Corp. </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1212 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 890] [\u201cAbsent foreseeability of the particular criminal conduct, there is no duty to protect plaintiff from that particular type of harm\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The majority here goes far beyond this court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, and its progeny. Anyone reading this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, <em>Sharon P. v. Arman, Ltd., supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 1181, and <em>Wiener v. Southcoast Childcare Centers, Inc., supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 1138, would conclude that (1) the prior similar incident rule applies to premises liability claims against business owners for failing to take precautions against possible <em>future criminal </em>conduct of third parties when the conduct is a criminal assault by a third party, and that (2) as suggested in <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken of Cal., Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pages 823-824, the totality of circumstances rule applies when the business\u2019s owner or employees become aware that criminal conduct is <em>ongoing or imminent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Relying on certain language in <em>Wiener v. Southcoast Childcare Centers, Inc., supra, 32 </em>Cal.4th 1138, the majority announces a different rule in which the existence of a business owner\u2019s duty to prevent harm from third-party criminal acts is determined through a \u201csliding-scale\u201d approach by balancing the degree of foreseeability of harm against the weight of the burden that a particular preventive measure would impose on the business owner. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 243.) Turning to the facts of this case, the majority asserts that the restaurant owner had a duty to take minimally burdensome actions, such as having security guard Nichols try to dissuade Joseph from following plaintiff as he left the restaurant because some sort of criminal assault was foreseeable. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 246.) Thus, instead of focusing on whether what occurred at the restaurant was foreseeable, the majority decides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>here the owner owed a duty to plaintiff because the owner\u2019s employee (the security guard) could have done something different that might have broken the causal chain of events. \u201cWhile causation is an indispensable element of negligence liability, it is neither the only element, nor a substitute for \u2018duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hegyes v. Unjian Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1103, 1134 [286 Cal.Rptr. 85].) Because there are numerous causes of any event that precede its occurrence, it is always possible to point to something that could have been done differently, and the majority\u2019s approach is perilously close to imposing liability that has no limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In this case, whether one applies the prior similar incident approach or the totality of circumstances approach, the result is the same: no liability on the part of the business owner. As I discussed earlier, the Court of Appeal noted the absence of any prior criminal acts similar to the gang assault here in concluding that the vicious attack on plaintiff by a gang of 10 to 15 men who suddenly came out of hiding was not an event that the owner could reasonably have foreseen, thus precluding liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The result is the same under the totality of circumstances approach, which applies general principles of negligence. As noted earlier, foreseeability is a crucial consideration in determining the existence of a duty. <em>(Ann M., supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 678; <em>Issacs, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 123-124.) It is the general character of the event that is required to be foreseeable. <em>(Bigbee </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 49, 57-58 [192 Cal.Rptr. 857, 665 P.2d 947].) Here, the hostile staring by Joseph and the reported statement by plaintiff\u2019s wife that a fight seemed imminent were insufficient to alert defendant business owner to the likelihood that a brutal gang assault on plaintiff by 10 to 15 men would later occur outside the restaurant. Viewing the totality of the circumstances known to the restaurant\u2019s employees, that form of violent criminal conduct was unforeseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The majority faults defendant for failing to \u201caddress the imminent danger\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 246) because security guard Nichols did not try to stop Joseph from leaving the restaurant. But the existence and scope of a business owner\u2019s duty to protect against a threat of future criminal activity, imminent or otherwise, depends on the foreseeability of the sort of criminal conduct that actually occurred. (See <em>Sharon P. v. Arman, Ltd., supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1195 [\u201cdefendants\u2019 duty of care did not include the hiring of security guards for the garage because the bank robberies were not sufficiently similar to the sexual assault crime to establish a high degree of foreseeability\u201d]; <em>Lopez v. McDonald's Corp. </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 495, 510-511 [238 Cal.Rptr. 436] [existence of prior crimes on business premises in high crime area, including two robberies, did not make massacre by armed criminal reasonably foreseeable]; <em>Gregorian v. National Convenience Stores, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 944, 950 [220 Cal.Rptr. 302] [\u201c[w]hile the proprietor of an allnight convenience store may . . . reasonably anticipate that his place of business will be the target of armed robbers, the same cannot be said for a crime resulting from gang violence\u201d].) As I have explained, the vicious group attack that occurred outside the restaurant was not reasonably foreseeable. Once the attack occurred, security guard Navarro did call 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">To summarize: irrespective of whether one follows the prior similar incident approach, the totality of circumstances approach, or some intermediate \u201csliding-scale\u201d approach, the conclusion is the same: the business owner here did not owe a duty to anticipate and protect plaintiff from the violent gang assault that occurred. Providing additional support for this conclusion are various policy considerations, as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Thirty-seven years ago, in <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 108, this court articulated certain policy considerations that determine when one person (the defendant) owes a duty in tort to take an action to protect another person (the plaintiff) from harm. Those considerations are: (1) the foreseeability of the harm to the plaintiff; (2) the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury; (3) the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injury; (4) the policy of preventing future harm; (5) the extent of the burden imposed on the defendant and the consequences to the community in imposing a duty to exercise care, with resulting liability in the event of a breach; and (6) the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">These policy considerations support a conclusion that the business owner here did not owe a duty to prevent plaintiff\u2019s injuries. As demonstrated in part n, above, here the particular harm to plaintiff was not foreseeable. Although it is undisputed that plaintiff was seriously injured in the vicious gang attack, the connection between the conduct of defendant business owner and the harm to plaintiff is highly attenuated, and very little moral blame can be attached to defendant\u2019s conduct, for it was the conduct of the <em>criminals, </em>not that of the business owner, that was primarily responsible, both legally and morally, for plaintiff\u2019s injuries. As to the burden on defendant, it is substantial. In the absence of a prior similar incident or some other indication of a reasonably foreseeable risk of a criminal assault, a business owner can only guess when, where, and how a criminal assault might occur, and what protective measures among an infinite number of possible precautions should be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Particularly significant are the <em>adverse consequences to the community </em>of the duty that the majority recognizes and imposes here. Although no segment of our community is immune from violent crime, it is generally more prevalent in less affluent areas. (See Kaufman, <em>When Crime Pays: Business Landlord\u2019s Duty to Protect Customers from Criminal Acts Committed on the Premises </em>(1990) 31 S.Tex. L.Rev. 89, 107-108, and authorities cited.) In such areas, the cost to businesses of elaborate security measures is likely to be prohibitive. In the absence of a prior similar incident, requiring business owners to anticipate and prevent a wide array of violent criminal conduct, including vicious group assaults like the one that occurred here, is likely to produce two unfortunate consequences in these economically depressed areas. Some businesses may take the elaborate precautions that the majority\u2019s holding requires, and will pass on the added costs to their customers in the form of higher prices (this has been referred to as a \u201ccrime tax\u201d), thereby increasing the costs of goods and services for the people least able to afford the higher prices. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 108; Cabrera, <em>Negligence Liability of Landowners and Occupiers for the Criminal Conduct of Another: On a Clear Day in California One Can Foresee Forever </em>(1987) 23 Cal. Western L.Rev. 165, 188.) Other businesses will simply close their doors, thereby depriving the local community of employment opportunities as well as goods and services. Either way, the effect will be to make life more difficult and costly for the innocent residents of crime-plagued neighborhoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The final policy consideration in determining the existence of a tort duty is the availability, cost, and prevalence of liability insurance. This consideration too weighs against recognizing a duty here. The broader the duty imposed on businesses to anticipate and guard against violent criminal assaults on their customers and others, the more expensive liability insurance is going to be, if it is available at all. Because the duty that the majority imposes requires business owners to anticipate all forms of violent criminal conduct, even when there has been no prior similar incident, insurance coverage for this expanded liability will become more expensive and harder to obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Accordingly, the policy considerations that this court articulated in <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian, supra, 69 </em>Cal.2d 108, support my conclusion that the business owner here should not be held liable for not anticipating the violent criminal gang assault on plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">For all of these reasons, I dissent. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>BROWN, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AiG\">I generally agree with Justice Kennard\u2019s dissenting opinion. The attack on plaintiff Michael Wollery Delagado was not foreseeable. Therefore, defendant Trax Bar &amp; Grill had no duty to protect against third party criminal conduct. (Dis. opn. of Kennard, J., <em>ante, </em>at p. 253.).) However, unlike Justice Kennard, for the reasons set forth in my concurring opinion in <em>Morris </em>v. <em>De La Torre </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 260-279, 280 [30 Ca.Rptr.3d 173, 113 P.3d 1182] (conc. opn. of Brown, J.)), I do not believe our decision in <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken of Cal., Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 814 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 756, 927 P.2d 1260] imposed a duty on business owners based on ongoing criminal conduct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
