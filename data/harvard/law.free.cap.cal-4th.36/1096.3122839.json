In <em>Estate of MacDonald </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 262, 264 [272 Cal.Rptr. 153, 794 P.2d 911] (MacDonald), this court held that a writing satisfies the \u201cexpress declaration\u201d requirement only if it states on its face that a change in the character or ownership of the subject property is being made. <em>MacDonald </em>made clear that this construction of section 852(a) precludes the use of \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d to prove that the writing effected a transmutation. <em>(MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 264.) <em>MacDonald </em>explained that the Legislature, in enacting these requirements and abrogating prior case law, sought to increase certainty and honesty in marital property disputes, and to decrease the burden on the courts in resolving such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">In this dissolution case, Douglas Benson (Husband) claims he conveyed to Diane L. Benson (Wife) his community property interest in their home after she orally promised to waive, in writing, her community property interest in Husband\u2019s retirement accounts. No such writing was ever made. Despite section 852(a) and <em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, the lower courts ruled that Husband\u2019s performance of his part of the bargain, as evidenced by the deed he signed in Wife\u2019s favor, served as an adequate substitute for Wife\u2019s express written statement changing the retirement accounts into Husband\u2019s separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">We disagree. Section 852(a) does not operate like the general statute of frauds (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1624, subd. (a)) (Civil Code section 1624(a)), in which the requirement of a basic writing is subject to an implied exception for \u201cpart performance\u201d of the contract\u2019s terms.  Even assuming Husband\u2019s transfer of the deed constituted part performance of Wife\u2019s promise to transmute the retirement accounts, section 852(a) requires such agreements to be both written and express, and seeks to prevent transmutations under circumstances like those present here. By insisting upon a special writing expressly changing the character of the disputed property, <em>MacDonald </em>all but decided that section 852(a) is not satisfied where no such writing exists at all. Thus, the lower courts erred in accepting Husband\u2019s transmutation claim and in denying Wife a community property interest in his retirement plans. We will reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">The parties married in 1983. They subsequently had two children, and accumulated property together. Separation occurred in 2000. In 2001, Wife petitioned for dissolution of the marriage. At trial, the parties litigated various issues, including the division of property. The record contains the following evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">During the marriage, Husband worked full time as a truck driver for a food wholesale company. Through his employer, he participated in a stock ownership plan, and contributed to a 401(k) retirement plan. Wife worked part time as a nurse at a hospital. She also had a retirement plan through her employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">At the start of the marriage, Wife\u2019s father, Dr. Robert L. Maahs, owned the Santa Barbara house in which the couple lived. Husband and Wife contributed some money each month towards use of the house. However, it appears these payments did not cover the mortgage bill or reflect the fair rental value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">Wife is the beneficiary of an irrevocable trust. Her father is the trustee. During the marriage, and apparently for his own estate planning purposes, Wife\u2019s father gave the couple a 100 percent ownership interest in the Santa Barbara house. This transfer occurred incrementally over several years. At some point during this process, Wife\u2019s father asked the couple to convey the house to the trust. They agreed. Hence, in two transfers occurring in late 1996 and early 1997, the couple signed grant deeds giving the trust a 100 percent ownership interest in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">The parties disputed the circumstances surrounding the transfer of the house to Wife\u2019s trust. Husband offered two different versions of events in the trial court, neither of which matched Wife\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">Initially, Husband maintained that he acquired a community property interest in the house, and that he did not surrender this interest by deeding the property to Wife\u2019s trust. To enforce this claim, Husband successfully moved before trial to join the trustee, Wife\u2019s father, as a party to the dissolution proceeding. However, while trial was under way, Husband settled all claims against the trust for an agreed-upon amount. The court promptly dismissed the trustee from the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-11\">Later, Husband testified that an oral agreement between the parties changed the community character of both the house and his retirement accounts, as follows: In 1996, when the couple signed the first deed in favor of Wife\u2019s trust, Husband agreed to forgo any community interest in the house and Wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>agreed to forgo any community interest in his retirement accounts. Wife said she would sign a writing transforming Husband\u2019s retirement accounts into his separate property. However, no writing was ever made. Husband knew that such a document could easily have been prepared and signed at the same time he deeded the house to Wife\u2019s trust. He did not press the issue because he trusted Wife, and because they had no plans to divorce at the time. Husband admitted at trial that he failed to mention any oral transmutation agreement or to identify the retirement accounts as separate property during discovery and other pretrial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">Wife denied making any promise to waive or change her community interest in Husband\u2019s retirement accounts. She testified that such conversations were limited to the house, and to her father\u2019s request that it be conveyed to the trust. Wife reportedly told Husband that they should repay her father\u2019s generosity by returning the house to him as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Consistent with testimony on both sides, the trial court concluded that Husband relinquished his community interest in the house when he deeded it to Wife\u2019s trust. However, the court also agreed with Husband that Wife relinquished her community interest in his retirement accounts. The court reasoned that section 852(a)\u2019s writing requirement is subject to implied exceptions that traditionally have been applied in other statutory contexts. Under this approach, Husband\u2019s act of deeding the house to the trust constituted \u201cpart performance\u201d of the oral transmutation agreement he described, and permitted its enforcement against Wife. In all other respects, the trial court\u2019s judgment resolved property, support, and child custody issues not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment. The appellate court adopted and applied the reasoning of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">In seeking review, Wife claimed the lower courts erred in finding a valid transmutation of Husband\u2019s retirement accounts under section 852(a), and in denying her a community property interest in those accounts. We now address Wife\u2019s concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-9\">The characterization of property as community or separate determines its division upon dissolution of the marriage. Each spouse owns a one-half interest in all community property. (\u00a7 751.) In general, community property is divided equally in the aggregate when the marriage ends. (\u00a7 2550; see \u00a7\u00a7 2600-2604.) However, separate property is not subject to a similar division, and belongs only to the owner spouse. (\u00a7 752.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>In determining the community or separate nature of property, the statutory scheme starts from the premise that all property acquired during the marriage is community property. (\u00a7 760.) As pertinent here, this general rule, or \u201cpresumption\u201d (\u00a7 802), covers both real property (\u00a7 760) and employee retirement plans. (\u00a7 2610; <em>In re Marriage of Lehman </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 169, 177 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 825, 955 P.2d 451]; <em>In re Marriage of Brown </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 838, 841-842 [126 Cal.Rptr. 633, 544 P.2d 561].) By its own terms, the definition of community property in section 760 applies \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute.\u201d It therefore exempts property defined as separate under other provisions. (E.g., \u00a7\u00a7 770 [property acquired by gift or inheritance], 771 [earnings and accumulations while living separate and apart].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Individuals may alter their property rights under these statutes. (\u00a7 1500.) One set of rules authorizes and regulates contracts made by prospective spouses that take effect upon their marriage. (\u00a7\u00a7 1600-1617.) Critical here is the separate scheme governing transactions between spouses that \u201ctransmute\u201d or change the character of property during an ongoing marriage. (\u00a7\u00a7 850-853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">In particular, section 850 allows contracts or other transfers transmuting the separate property of one spouse to either the separate property of the other spouse or the community property of both spouses. Community property also may become separate property under this section. Consideration may, or may not, be exchanged. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, a companion statute, section 852(a), imposes certain requirements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 852(a) states that a transmutation \u201cis not valid unless made in writing by an express declaration that is made, joined in, consented to, or accepted by the spouse whose interest in the property is adversely affected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">Here, there is no dispute that Husband\u2019s retirement accounts (much like the house the couple received from Wife\u2019s father) were originally community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>property. The reason is that any right to receive retirement benefits represented deferred compensation for work Husband performed during the marriage. (See <em>In re Marriage of Lehman, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 169, 177; <em>In re Marriage of Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 838, 841-842.) However, Husband claims the retirement accounts were transmuted into his separate property under an agreement that, in return, he would deed his community interest in the couple\u2019s home to Wife\u2019s trust. Husband concedes the transmutation of his retirement accounts was never reduced to writing, as contemplated by section 852(a). But he argues that any requirement of such a writing was obviated by his performance of his side of the bargain.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Wife insists, on the other hand, that Husband\u2019s testimony about an unwritten agreement between the spouses could not establish such a transmutation. Section 852(a)\u2019s requirement of an express written transmutation, Wife urges, is absolute, and is not subject to an exception for \u201cpart performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">The language of the statute, both on its face and as judicially construed, supports Wife\u2019s view. (See <em>Droeger v. Friedman, Sloan &amp; Ross </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 26, 38 [283 Cal.Rptr. 584, 812 P.2d 931] [embracing plain meaning of community property statute].) Section 852(a) states that an agreement to change the character of marital property \u201cis not valid unless\u201d it (1) is \u201cin writing,\u201d (2) contains an \u201cexpress declaration\u201d by which the \u201ctransmutation\u201d is made, and (3) is \u201caccepted\u201d in some fashion by the \u201cadversely affected\u201d spouse. This multipronged rule is framed in the negative, as though all intendments weigh against finding compliance in the usual case. In addition, no exception to the requirement of an \u201cexpress\u201d written declaration appears in the statute. Viewed as a whole, these features suggest the Legislature envisioned a standard from which married couples could not freely depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">In <em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, this court identified the kind of writing needed to transmute property by means of an \u201cexpress declaration\u201d under section 852(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As Wife suggests, <em>MacDonald </em>confirms that lawmakers contemplated no exception to the special writing requirement like the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>urged here. (See <em>Phillippe v. Shapell Industries </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1247, 1265 [241 Cal.Rptr. 22, 743 P.2d 1279] [declining to create exception that would effectively nullify statutory rule].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">In <em>MacDonald, </em>Margery and Robert had been married several years when they learned that Margery was terminally ill. They decided to divide their community assets, such as stocks and real property, into separate estates that could be inherited by the children each spouse had from a previous marriage. A short time later, Robert received a large cash disbursement from the community pension plan he acquired during his marriage to Margery. Consistent with the couple\u2019s general estate plan, the pension funds were deposited into IRA accounts opened solely in Robert\u2019s name at three different financial institutions. The designated beneficiary of each account was a revocable living trust that Robert had established in his children\u2019s favor. Both Robert and Margery signed standard form IRA agreements. In doing so, Margery consented to the designation of Robert\u2019s trust as the sole beneficiary of those accounts (the consent paragraphs). <em>(MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, 264-265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">After Margery died, the executor of her estate petitioned the court to establish a community property interest in the IRA accounts. The trial court found that in signing the IRA agreements, Margery intended to transmute her community share of those funds into Robert\u2019s separate property. Concluding that a valid transmutation had occurred, the trial court denied the petition. The Court of Appeal reversed on the ground the consent paragraphs did not satisfy section 852(a). This court granted Robert\u2019s petition for review. The court affirmed the judgment. <em>(MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, 265-266, 273; see <em>id. </em>at p. 273 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.); <em>id. </em>at p. 274 (dis. opn. of Arabian, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\"><em>MacDonald </em>held that notwithstanding evidence that Robert and Margery intended to divide their community property into separate estates, any attempt to change the character of the pension funds failed under section 852(a). The court acknowledged that the consent paragraphs in the IRA agreements satisfied two of the three statutory requirements. Specifically, they were \u201c \u2018in writing,\u2019 \u201d and were \u201c \u2018accepted\u2019 \u201d (i.e., signed) by Margery, the adversely affected spouse. <em>(MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, 267-268.) However, the documents lacked \u201c \u2018an express declaration\u2019 \u201d by which transmutations must be made. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In defining and applying this phrase, <em>MacDonald </em>held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>the IRA documents needed language <em>\u201cexpressly stating </em>that [Margery] was effecting <em>a change in the character or </em>ownership\u201d of community property. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 273, italics added; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 264, 272.) Nothing indicated that she knew \u201cthe legal effect of her signature might be to alter the character or ownership of her interest in the pension funds.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 272-273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\"><em>MacDonald </em>relied heavily upon the legislative history to construe the critical statutory phrase. <em>(McDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, 268-269, 270 &amp; fn. 6.) The court summarized this history, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">In 1984, the Legislature adopted section 852 as recommended by the California Law Revision Commission (Commission). The Commission reported that under California law at the time, spouses could easily transmute marital property, including real estate, without adhering to any rules or formalities. (Recommendation Relating to Marital Property Presumptions and Transmutations (Jan. 1984) 17 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1984) pp. 213-214 (Commission Report).) The Commission Report made clear that in such cases, transmutations could be based on oral statements, implications from conduct, or documents not manifesting a clear intent to transmute property. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 213, fn. 20, citing Reppy, <em>Debt Collection from Married Californians: Problems Caused by Transmutations, Single-Spouse Management, and Invalid Marriage </em>(1981) 18 San Diego L.Rev. 143 [describing objectionable transmutation cases].) According to the Commission, the \u201ceasy transmutation\u201d rule generated extensive litigation and unseemly tactics in dissolution cases. (Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 214.) It encouraged spouses \u201cto transform a passing comment into an \u2018agreement\u2019 or even to commit perjury by manufacturing an oral or implied transmutation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\"><em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, 268, continued: The Commission drafted section 852 to achieve two basic goals. First, the statute\u2019s new requirements would increase certainty as to whether a transmutation had in fact occurred. (Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 224-225.) Second, section 852 would overrule existing case law insofar as it did not require a transmutation to be both written and express. (Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 225.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">Against this backdrop, <em>MacDonald </em>concluded that section 852 blocks efforts to transmute marital property based on evidence\u2014oral, behavioral, or documentary\u2014that is easily manipulated and unreliable. <em>(MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, 269.) Thus, according to <em>MacDonald, </em>the Legislature could not have meant to validate <em>any </em>writing offered to prove a change in the character of property. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Though no particular terminology is required <em>(id. </em>at p. 273), the writing must reflect a transmutation on its face, and must eliminate the need to consider other evidence in divining this intent. <em>(Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>p. 272.) <em>MacDonald </em>observed that this construction of the statute achieves the stated aims of reducing litigation and discouraging perjury. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">Finally, <em>MacDonald </em>acknowledged that section 852 might prevent courts from finding a transmutation in cases where some evidence suggests the spouses meant to change the character of their property, but where they failed to follow the statutory requirements. However, <em>MacDonald </em>attributed any incongruous results to the manner in which lawmakers ultimately chose to balance the competing policy concerns. <em>MacDonald </em>declined to second-guess the legislative decision to sacrifice informality in transmutations in favor of protecting community property and promoting judicial economy. <em>(MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, 273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">The foregoing principles support Wife\u2019s view that no valid transmutation of Husband\u2019s retirement accounts could occur absent her express written consent transforming them into Husband\u2019s separate property. According to <em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, such a transaction necessitates not only a writing, but a special kind of writing, i.e., one in which the adversely affected spouse expresses a clear understanding that the document changes the character or ownership of specific property. It follows from this special writing requirement that section 852(a) cannot be satisfied where there is no writing about the subject property at all, and where a transmutation would have to be inferred from acts surrounding the contract in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">Subsequent decisions adhere closely to <em>MacDonald, </em>and decline to find a valid transmutation absent express written language to that effect. <em>(Estate of Bibb </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 461, 469-470 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 415] [Department of Motor Vehicles printout changed vehicle registration, not ownership]; <em>In re Marriage of Barneson </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 583, 589-594 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 726] [written brokerage instructions changed possession, not ownership, of stock].) Other authorities conclude that under <em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, section 852(a) is not satisfied solely by one spouse\u2019s detrimental reliance upon the other\u2019s oral promise to transmute property. <em>(In re Marriage of Campbell </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1063-1064 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 580] <em>(Campbell) </em>[wife acquired no interest in husband\u2019s home where she spent her money remodeling property after he promised to share title]; Cal. Community Property with Tax Analysis (Matthew Bender, 2004) Transmutation of Property, \u00a7 2.24 [2] [b], pp. 2-50 to 2-51.) A contrary view would threaten to resurrect the \u201ceasy transmutation\u201d rule that the Legislature repudiated when it enacted section 852 20 years ago. (See <em>Estate of Nelson </em>(1964) 224 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>Cal.App.2d 138, 143 [36 Cal.Rptr. 352] [transmutation may be \u201cinferred from all the circumstances,\u201d including acts and oral statements]; <em>Giacomazzi </em>v. <em>Rowe </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 498, 503 [240 P.2d 1020] [transmutation may occur where \u201cone party has performed all that he promises to perform and the other accepts all the benefits\u201d].) As a result, the lack of a writing expressly changing the character of Husband\u2019s retirement accounts seems fatal to finding a transmutation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">Husband responds that nothing in the statute\u2019s history or <em>MacDonald </em>prevents part performance from excusing the special writing that section 852(a) requires. He emphasizes the Law Revision Commission\u2019s 1993 Report on the 1994 Family Code, especially the comment to section 852, which states that \u201cthe ordinary rules and formalities applicable to real property transfers apply also to transmutations of real property between the spouses.\u201d (1994 Fam. Code, 23 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (Nov. 1993) com. on \u00a7 852, p. 159, reprinted at 29C West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code (2004 ed.) foil. \u00a7 852, p. 458 (Commission Comment).) The Commission Comment also cites the statute of frauds in Civil Code section 1624. (29C West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code, <em>supra, </em>at p. 458.) Husband theorizes that this language shows the Legislature wanted section 852(a) to encompass not only the \u201crules and formalities\u201d imposed by the statute of frauds, but also traditional exceptions to those \u201crules and formalities,\u201d such as the one urged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">Preliminarily, the general statute of frauds in Civil Code section 1624(a) was enacted in 1872, and has been expanded over the years to cover various kinds of contracts, most involving real property and commercial matters. The statute requires either a written contract or \u201csome note or memorandum\u201d subscribed by the party to be charged. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Since the statute of frauds primarily serves to prove that a contract exists <em>(Casa Herrera, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beydoun </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 336, 345 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 97, 83 P.3d 497]), the writing need only mention certain \u201cessential\u201d <em>(Franklin v. Hansen </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 570, 574 [30 Cal.Rptr. 530, 381 P.2d 386]) or \u201cmeaningful\u201d terms. <em>(Phillippe </em>v. <em>Shapell Industries, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1247, 1259.) Ambiguities can be resolved by extrinsic evidence <em>(Franklin v. Hansen, supra, </em>59 Cal.2d at p. 574), which serves as a reliable indicator of the parties\u2019 intent in commercial or other arm\u2019s length transactions. (See <em>Casa Herrera, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beydoun, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 345.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">However, where assertion of the statute of frauds would cause unconscionable injury, part performance allows specific enforcement of a contract that lacks the requisite writing. <em>(Earhart v. William Low Co. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 503, 514 [158 Cal.Rptr. 887, 600 P.2d 1344].) The doctrine most commonly applies in actions involving transfers of real property. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1972, subd. (a) [part performance available to enforce agreement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>convey real property absent writing required under \u00a7 1971 of same code]; <em>Paul v. Layne &amp; Bowler Corp. </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 561, 564 [71 P.2d 817]; <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Warner </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 415, 422 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 632]; <em>Trout </em>v. <em>Ogilvie </em>(1919) 41 Cal.App. 167, 174 [182 P. 333].) Yet, part performance also has been used to enforce other contracts that violate the statute of frauds in Civil Code section 1624(a). <em>(Maddox </em>v. <em>Rainoldi </em>(1958) 163 Cal.App.2d 384, 390 [329 P.2d 599]; see Note, <em>Part Performance, Estoppel, and the California Statute of Frauds </em>(1951) 3 Stan. L.Rev. 281, 285-288.) In any event, to constitute part performance, the relevant acts either must \u201cunequivocally refer[]\u201d to the contract <em>(Trout v. Ogilvie, supra, </em>41 Cal.App. at p. 172), or \u201cclearly relate\u201d to its terms. <em>(Sutton v. Warner, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 422, citing <em>Paul v. Layne &amp; Bowler Corp., supra, 9 </em>Cal.2d at p. 564.) Such conduct satisfies the evidentiary function of the statute of frauds by confirming that a bargain was in fact reached. (See <em>Casa Herrera, Inc. v. Beydoun, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 336, 345.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">Here, we see no evidence the Legislature intended to incorporate traditional exceptions to the statute of frauds into section 852. Indeed, the Commission Comment invoked by Husband supports the <em>opposite </em>proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">The 1993 Commission Comment distills the earlier Commission Report. The Commission Report does not mention part performance under the statute of frauds, or indicate that part performance can supplant the express writing dictated by section 852(a). Rather, as discussed in <em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, the Commission Report criticized oral and implied transmutations, and recommended a special writing requirement to reduce confusion and abuse. By alluding to the \u201cordinary rules and formalities\u201d in Civil Code section 1624(a), the Commission Comment merely implies that transmutations no longer entail <em>less </em>formality than transactions subject to the statute of frauds. Nor does the Commission Comment mean that transmutations should be treated the same as transactions subject to the statute of frauds, or that the former is not deserving of greater formality than the latter. Husband cites no legislative history to support his part performance claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>Husband next asks us to follow <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 578 [271 Cal.Rptr. 773] <em>(Hall), </em>which enforced a <em>premarital </em>contract that violated the applicable writing requirement. (See \u00a7 1611 [contract between prospective spouses must be \u201cin writing and signed by both parties\u201d]; Civ. Code, former \u00a7 5311 [same], added by Stats. 1985, ch. 1315, \u00a7 3, p. 4582 and repealed by Stats. 1992, ch. 162, \u00a7 3, p. 464.) Husband claims the policies governing premarital contracts apply equally to postnuptial transmutations, and that the courts should treat these transactions the same in deciding whether and how to enforce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">In <em>Hall, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d 578, the Court of Appeal upheld a judgment enforcing an oral agreement entered between the decedent and his second wife (plaintiff) before they married giving her a life estate in his home. The decedent had prepared an amendment to his estate plan granting such an interest, but he died before the documents could be signed. The Court of Appeal rejected arguments by the representatives and heirs of the estate (i.e., the decedent\u2019s sons from his prior marriage) that the premarital agreement was unenforceable because it lacked the writing required under section 1611 and its predecessor. The court determined that plaintiff partially performed the contract by taking steps before the marriage that \u201cunequivocally referred]\u201d to its terms. (222 Cal.App.3d at p. 586.) In particular, she quit her job and retired early in exchange for the financial security of having an interest in the decedent\u2019s home. In reaching this conclusion, the court characterized section 1611 as an ordinary \u201cstatute of frauds\u201d (222 Cal.App.3d at p. 584) to which \u201ctraditional exceptions\u201d like part performance applied. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 587.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">Whether or not <em>Hall </em>reached a correct result under the statute there at issue, its analysis has no application here. The statutory scheme in <em>Hall </em>seeks to <em>\u201cenhance </em>the enforceability\u201d of agreements entered in contemplation of marriage. <em>(In re Marriage of Bonds </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 1, 23 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 252, 5 P.3d 815] <em>(Bonds); </em>see \u00a7 1600 et seq. [Uniform Premarital Agreement Act].) Despite recent changes linking the voluntariness of premarital contracts to the availability of independent counsel (\u00a7 1615, subd. (c), added by Stats. 2001, ch. 286, \u00a7 2), and despite the noncommercial nature of such contracts <em>(Bonds, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 24-26), prospective spouses negotiate at greater arm\u2019s length than married persons. (See \u00a7 721, subd. (b) (section 721(b)) [spouses share fiduciary relationship]; <em>Bonds, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 27 [persons entering premarital contracts do not share fiduciary relationship]; Glass, <em>Trading Up: Postnuptial Agreements, Fairness, and a Principled </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number><em>New Suitor for California </em>(2004) 92 Cal. L.Rev. 215, 242 [unique emotional concerns can affect contracts between spouses].) Hence, contrary to what Husband assumes, premarital contracts are not construed and enforced under the same standards as interspousal agreements. <em>(Bonds, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 27; <em>In re Marriage of Friedman </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 65, 72 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 412].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">This difference is manifest here. As discussed <em>ante, </em>section 852(a) makes a valid transmutation much more difficult to accomplish than prior law allowed. The transaction requires a written document expressly acknowledging that it changes the character of marital property, and that the adversely affected spouse understands and accepts this result. As made clear in <em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, 264, 272, \u201cextrinsic evidence,\u201d such as inferences drawn from oral statements and conduct, is not a rehable substitute for the express writing that the statute demands. Similar circumstances were not present in <em>Hall, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d 578. Thus, we do not apply its analysis in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">Finally, Husband suggests that strict enforcement of section 852(a), as construed in <em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, is unnecessary because the \u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d requires spouses to act with \u201cthe highest good faith and fair dealing\u201d in their transactions with each other. (\u00a7 721(b).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Husband observes that <em>MacDonald </em>did not consider the effect of the quoted language on transmutations, because that language did not appear in the statutory scheme until after <em>MacDonald </em>was decided. (See Civ. Code, former \u00a7 5103, as amended by Stats. 1991, ch. 1026, \u00a7 2, p. 4747.) Husband also suggests that to apply section 852(a)\u2019s express writing requirement and to find no transmutation of the retirement accounts would give Wife an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d under section 721(b). She would retain the benefit of the deed he signed in her favor, while he would not receive a full separate interest in his retirement accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">However, as the history of this case makes clear, Husband forfeited or abandoned any attack on the deed as presumptively invalid under section 721(b). (See <em>Bonds, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 1, 27, citing <em>In re Marriage of Haines </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 277, 293 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 673] [advantaged spouse bears burden of showing agreement was not induced by undue influence].) The parties settled, and the trial court dismissed, all claims involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>Husband\u2019s transfer of the deed to Wife\u2019s trust. He has not subsequently tried to set aside any benefit she obtained from that transaction. No issue involving section 721(b) and the deed is under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">The claim also lacks merit. Husband does not seek to <em>undo </em>a transmutation that was so grossly one-sided and unfair as to be the product of undue influence under section 721(b). (E.g., <em>In re Marriage of Haines, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th 277, 293-294.) He instead invokes these principles to <em>establish </em>a transmutation that fails to comply with the terms of section 852(a), as construed in <em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262. However, absent a transmutation that otherwise satisfies section 852(a), there is no basis for applying the presumption of undue influence under section 721(b). <em>(Campbell, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1065.) Moreover, both statutes protect marital transactions from the same adverse influences. An express written agreement prevents spouses from inadvertently transmuting property through oral, implied, or other easy means. The same requirement also deters false transmutation claims after the marriage ends. Husband has shown no conflict between section 721(b) and section 852(a) affecting the character of his retirement accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">The lower courts erred in finding a valid transmutation of Husband\u2019s retirement accounts, and in characterizing such property as separate rather than community in nature. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">George, C. J., Kennard, J., Werdegar, J., and Chin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">All statutory references are to the Family Code unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">Section 852 reads in full as follows: \u201c(a) A transmutation of real or personal property is not valid unless made in writing by an express declaration that is made, joined in, consented to, or accepted by the spouse whose interest in the property is adversely affected. HO (b) A transmutation of real property is not effective as to third parties without notice thereof unless recorded. HO (c) This section does not apply to a gift between the spouses of clothing, wearing apparel, jewelry, or other tangible articles of a personal nature that is used solely or principally by the spouse to whom the gift is made and that is not substantial in value taking into account the circumstances of the marriage. HO (d) Nothing in this section affects the law governing characterization of property in which separate property and community property are commingled or otherwise combined. HO (e) This section does not apply to or affect a transmutation of property made before January 1, 1985, and the law that would otherwise be applicable to that transmutation shall continue to apply.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">Husband claims here, as on appeal, that Wife \u201cwaived\u201d her right to complain about the alleged oral agreement to treat his retirement accounts as separate property. Husband rests the proposed procedural bar on Wife\u2019s failure to exclude this evidence at trial. However, as we will make clear, Wife does not challenge the transaction on technical, procedural, or evidentiary grounds. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 353, subd. (a).) Nor does she raise a statute of frauds defense of tiie kind deemed forfeited by failure to timely object to evidence of a disputed oral contract. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1624(a); <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 253, 257 [105 P.2d 971]; see 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, \u00a7 266, p. 262.) Wife has consistently claimed that no valid transmutation occurred under section 852(a) and <em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, and that these authorities provide a substantive ground for relief. Hence, we see no bar to resolving the issue under review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1144-8\"><em>MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, addressed former Civil Code section 5110.730. (Added by Stats. 1984, ch. 1733, \u00a7 3, p. 6302.) After <em>MacDonald </em>was decided, and as part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>comprehensive reorganization of the law, the Legislature repealed former Civil Code section 5110.730 (Stats. 1992, ch. 162, \u00a7 3, p. 464), and replaced it with Family Code section 852. (Stats. 1992, ch. 162, \u00a7 10, p. 492, operative Jan. 1, 1994.) Both versions contain the same language. We will refer solely to section 852, even when discussing its predecessor under <em>MacDonald.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">In <em>MacDonald, </em>the majority rejected the dissent\u2019s view that section 852(a) establishes \u201ca simple writing requirement akin to the statute of frauds\u2014a formality that would admit the use of collateral evidence to clarify the writer\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>(MacDonald, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 262, 277 (dis. opn. of Arabian, J.); see discussion, <em>post.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">The issue arose at oral argument whether equitable estoppel may prevent section 852(a) from invalidating an oral transmutation contract. (See <em>Campbell, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1063-1064 [spouse cannot use estoppel to avoid statute\u2019s express writing requirement]; cf. <em>Earhart </em>v. <em>William Low Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 503, 514 [party may be estopped to use statute of frauds as defense to enforcement of oral contract].) Estoppel involves a reasonable and detrimental change in reliance on a contract, even where the act does not involve performance of the contract itself. <em>(Monarco v. Lo Greco </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 621, 623-624 [220 P.2d 737].) However, we need not consider, in this case, whether there are <em>any </em>circumstances that might estop a marital partner from invoking section 852(a). Here, the record, which Husband\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument includes all of the pertinent facts, cannot support an estoppel theory. As counsel acknowledged, an estoppel theory in this case is entirely dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>on, and congruent with, his claim that, despite section 852(a), his execution of the deed effected a transmutation of his retirement accounts because it constituted part performance of a spousal agreement for such transmutation. Hence, recognition of an \u201cestoppel\u201d in this case would entirely circumvent our holding that \u201cpart performance\u201d is <em>not </em>an exception to the strict requirements of section 852(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">Section 721(b) reads in pertinent part as follows: \u201c[A] husband and wife are subject to the general rules governing fiduciary relationships which control the actions of persons occupying confidential relations with each other. This confidential relationship imposes a duty of the highest good faith and fair dealing on each spouse, and neither shall take any unfair advantage of the other. This confidential relationship is a fiduciary relationship subject to the same rights and duties of nonmarital business partners . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1152-8\">MORENO, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEf\">I concur. It is true, as the husband in this action, Douglas Benson, contends, that there may be circumstances in which there is a conflict between Family Code section 852, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorizing transmutation of property within a marriage only by means of express written declaration, and section 721, subdivision (b), imposing on spouses a fiduciary duty toward each other. Such a conflict may occur when, for example, one spouse unfairly gains a benefit from the other spouse in exchange for an orally promised transmutation that in fact has no legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-9\">This kind of unjust enrichment and breach of fiduciary duty, while suggested by the facts of the present case, are not at issue here. As the majority correctly points out, husband has settled his claim with respect to the conveyance of the house he contends was quid pro quo for the alleged oral promise to transmute his retirement accounts from community property to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>separate property. Therefore, he cannot validly claim before this court that he was unlawfully or inequitably disadvantaged by that conveyance. His is the narrower argument that his part performance of an agreement with his wife is an adequate substitute for the express declaration of transmutation required by section 852, subdivision (a), which the majority properly rejects. We therefore have no occasion to decide what statutory or equitable remedy would be available to make whole a spouse who has been disadvantaged by an illusory oral promise to transmute property, or what sanction may be employed against a spouse who has used section 852, subdivision (a) as a means of breaching his or her fiduciary duty and gaining unjust enrichment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">All statutory references are to the Family Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
