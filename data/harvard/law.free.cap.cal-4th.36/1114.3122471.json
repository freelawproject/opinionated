J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVs\">Following the guilt phase of the trial, a Los Angeles County jury found defendant Dean Phillip Carter guilty of the forcible rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and first degree murder of Jillette Mills (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189), and found true the special circumstances that the murder was committed in the course of a forcible rape and in the course of a first or second degree burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 460, 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(C), (G).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-10\">The jury also found defendant guilty of the first degree murder of Susan Knoll (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd.

(a), 189) and of residential burglary (\u00a7 459), and found true the special circumstances that the murder was committed in the course of a forcible rape and in the course of a burglary. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(C), (G).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">In addition, the jury found true the special circumstance that defendant was convicted in the present proceeding of more than one offense of murder. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury returned a verdict of death. This appeal is automatic. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11; \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">We affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">I. <em>Guilt Phase Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">A. <em>The Prosecution\u2019s Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZF\">1. <em>The Death of Tok Kim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">The prosecution commenced its case by introducing, over defendant\u2019s objection, evidence that pertained to the death of Tok Kim, who was 42 years of age, in Alameda County in early April 1984. The evidence, summarized below, was introduced under Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b), for the purpose of demonstrating defendant\u2019s identity and criminal intent in the charged offenses relating to the murders of Jillette Mills, Susan Knoll, and Bonnie Guthrie on April 10 and 11, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-10\">In the early evening of Sunday, April 1, 1984, defendant entered the Rocking Horse Bar and Grill, located in Lafayette, California. The bartender, Nicole Didion, testified that business was slow that evening when defendant sat down at the bar, ordered a drink, and introduced himself to her as \u201cPhil.\u201d He wore casual pants, which she believed were jeans, and a sweatshirt inscribed with the words \u201cTenakee Tavern\u2014Southeast Alaska\u2019s Classiest Joint.\u201d He told Didion that he worked as a cameraman. Cocktail waitress Margo Fulton observed defendant sitting at the bar, and joined his conversation with Didion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-11\">Approximately one-half hour later, Tok Kim entered the bar, sat down a few barstools apart from defendant, and ordered a glass of white wine. She departed from the bar soon thereafter, only to return a few minutes later, declaring that she had been unable to start her Honda automobile. Defendant offered to assist her and left with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-12\">After a few minutes, defendant returned to the bar and asked whether anyone had \u201cjumper cables.\u201d A restaurant employee obtained cables; the car thereafter was started, and defendant returned to the bar to gather his belongings. Defendant remarked to a cocktail waitress that he was getting a ride to the local BART station.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-13\">Approximately 9:00 p.m. the same evening, defendant and Kim walked into Jim Sutton\u2019s Lafayette Shell gasoline station and reported car trouble. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>David Hogan, an employee at the station, assisted the couple in bringing the disabled vehicle to the station. Because the alternator apparently was malfunctioning, the vehicle was left at the station overnight for repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">The next day, April 2, Kim and defendant returned to the Shell station. Hogan noticed that defendant wore a black \u201cMembers Only\u201d jacket that \u201cwas in style back then,\u201d as well as mirrored sunglasses on top of his head. Hogan, observing that defendant\u2019s neck bore a \u201cbig\u2014like a hickey on his neck,\u201d told defendant, \u201cWell[, i]t looked like you had fun last night.\u201d Defendant replied: \u201cI don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing here, I don\u2019t even know her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">At approximately 11:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 10, or Wednesday, April 11, Kim\u2019s neighbor, Connie Santos, heard Kim arguing with someone. Santos knew the voice of Kim\u2019s boyfriend, Ray Blevins, and testified that the person with whom Kim was arguing \u201cwas not [Blevins] definitely, but instead belonged to someone \u2018younger.\u2019 \u201d Santos could not discern the precise words spoken, but recalled that the persons arguing sounded \u201creally angry.\u201d Santos thought that perhaps she should call the police, but instead she went to bed, pulling the bedcovers over her head in an effort to block the noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">On Thursday, April 12, Kim failed to arrive at her job at the Concord Macy\u2019s department store. Her manager at Macy\u2019s, Ingrid Maleska-King, telephoned Kim\u2019s apartment manager, William Elson, to request that he ascertain whether she was at her apartment. Elson, who had observed defendant standing near Kim\u2019s apartment mailbox earlier that same week, did not find Kim at her apartment. Elson also observed that Kim\u2019s vehicle was not in its designated parking space or anywhere in the vicinity. When Kim did not appear for work on Friday, April 13, Maleska-King again contacted Elson and asked him to recheck whether Kim was at her apartment. As Elson approached the apartment on this second occasion, he \u201cfelt extinctively [\u00bfic] that she was in there because of the odor that I smelled.\u201d Elson found Kim\u2019s lifeless body sprawled upon the floor of her bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-8\">Oakland Police Detective Raymond Conner investigated Kim\u2019s death, arriving at her apartment on the morning of April 13. Beneath Kim\u2019s neck, he discovered a curtain tie approximately 18 to 24 inches in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-9\">Kim\u2019s body had decomposed to an extent that it precluded a determination of a cause of death. The pathologist who performed the autopsy, Thomas Rogers, testified over defendant\u2019s objection that the tie found beneath Kim\u2019s neck could have been used to fatally strangle her. On cross-examination, Rogers acknowledged that in view of the body\u2019s advanced state of decomposition, he could not eliminate the possibility that Kim might have died from natural causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>2. <em>The Deaths of Susan Knoll and Jillette Mills</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">Susan Knoll and her sister, Sandra Pender, grew up in Wisconsin. Knoll\u2019s best Mend was Bonnie Guthrie. In 1972, Pender relocated to San Diego, and in 1979 Knoll journeyed west to live with her. Guthrie also relocated to the Los Angeles area at some point and resumed her close Mendship with Knoll. In March 1984, Knoll moved into a Culver City apartment with Jillette Mills. Knoll and Mills each were 25 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">On April 10, 1984, Knoll appeared at work at Mitsubishi Bank, according to Annette Cheng, Knoll\u2019s colleague. On April 11, Knoll was absent from work, and Cheng received a telephone call from a male who declined to identify himself. The caller informed Cheng that Knoll was \u201cjust involved in a traffic accident and she have some minor injury <em>[sic] </em>and would like to go to hospital for the checkup, but she asked me to call the bank to let the bank know that she won\u2019t be in today.\u201d Cheng asked the caller if he was a friend of Knoll\u2019s, and the caller replied: \u201cNo, I just happened to be in the accident scene and she asked me to call for her.\u201d When Cheng asked for the caller\u2019s name, he hung up the telephone. Cheng never saw Knoll alive again. On cross-examination, Cheng acknowledged that when she spoke to the caller, she believed he was a Black man with a southern accent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">For a few days prior to April 10, 1984, Jillette Mills\u2019s brother, Jeff, Med without success to contact Jillette. On April 11, 1984, Jeff and his friend, Christopher Thurman, began searching for her. Jeff and Christopher traveled to Jillette\u2019s Culver City apartment, to her place of employment (Laird Studios), and to a local community college where she had attended classes, but were unable to locate Jillette or her automobile, a distinctive white Datsun 280 ZX that bore the license plate \u201cPHANTM Z.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jeff and Christopher thereafter returned to the apartment building, scaled a security fence, and approached the apartment. Jillette\u2019s apartment door was unlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-7\">Upon searching much of the apartment without success, Jeff and Christopher encountered a framed piece of artwork leaning against the doors of a bedroom closet. Opening the closet doors, Christopher noticed \u201cfeet on the floor\u201d and advised Jeff that \u201cwe have a problem.\u201d The fully clothed bodies of Susan and Jillette were lying on the floor of the closet, one stacked upon the other. Jeff called the police, and Christopher went outside to await their amval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>While Christopher waited by the curb, he leaned on the left front fender of a blue Honda that investigators subsequently determined belonged to Tok Kim. Inside the vehicle, investigators recovered a pair of sunglasses identified at trial by David Hogan, the Lafayette gasoline station attendant, as matching the pair he observed resting atop defendant\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">Police investigators examined Jillette\u2019s apartment for fingerprints and other physical evidence. Two wine glasses found in the kitchen appeared to have been wiped clean to eliminate any traces of fingerprints. A latent palm print was retrieved from the bathroom sink. Martin Collins, a latent print investigator employed by the California Department of Justice, testified that the latent print matched defendant\u2019s right palm print with \u201c100 percent\u201d certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran, Chief of Forensic Medicine at the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, testified that Jillette Mills died of asphyxia due to ligature strangulation. He added that \u201cconsiderable force\u201d had to have been \u201ccontinuously applied\u201d for approximately two minutes or more in order to cause death. Jillette also suffered \u201cblunt force type trauma\u201d to her head, and injury to her genital area consistent with \u201ctraumatic sexual assault\u201d including \u201cpenile penetration . . . and ejaculation.\u201d Sam Le, a Los Angeles County criminalist, testified that a white nightgown found in the apartment contained seminal fluid consistent with defendant\u2019s PGM type and that of 15.8 percent of the population. Seminal fluid recovered from Mills\u2019s vaginal area \u201cwas [of an] insufficient quantity for typing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">Dr. Sathyavagiswaran further testified that Susan Knoll died of asphyxia due to manual strangulation, the result of \u201cconsiderable compression force.\u201d Susan also suffered blunt force injuries and hemorrhages consistent with having struggled against her assailant. Dr. Sathyavagiswaran stated: \u201c[W]hen Miss Knoll was strangulated and was asphyxiated, this was probably a terminal event [\u2014] that she vomited and aspirated, [f] The very fact that the vomitas did not go to the distal parts of the lung, that is, [the] distal bronchi, she did not live very long after this vomitas\u2014after this vomiting episode.\u201d Seminal fluid recovered from Knoll\u2019s vaginal area was of an insufficient quantity for typing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">Each victim had been dead for a minimum of 15 hours prior to the time the autopsies were performed upon their bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-9\">3. <em>The Death of Bonnie Guthrie</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-10\">In the early afternoon of April 11, 1984, Bonnie Guthrie, then 34 years of age, and a friend, Geula Vehab, purchased fruit together in Santa Monica. The two parted company at approximately 1:20 p.m. Between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>p.m., Matty Spiro, the manager of the apartment building in which Guthrie resided, entered her West Los Angeles apartment, accompanied by Manny Gleberman, to repair a leaky bathroom faucet. As Gleberman worked on the faucet, Spiro observed Guthrie lying on her stomach on the bedroom floor: \u201cSo I says to Manny, the plumber\u2014I said, \u2018Look at that, Manny. She\u2019s sleeping on the floor.\u2019 I said, T better close the door and let her sleep.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">The next morning, April 12, Spiro noticed that Guthrie\u2019s automobile was still in the garage. Wondering why Guthrie apparently had not gone to work, he returned to Guthrie\u2019s apartment and knocked on the door. Upon entering the apartment, Spiro noticed Guthrie lying in the same position as he previously had observed. He then notified the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">Dr. Sathyavagiswaran testified that Guthrie died of ligature strangulation. He added that Guthrie\u2019s body bore the signs of having suffered blunt force injury as well as genital abrasions consistent with traumatic sexual assault. Vaginal area samples revealed the presence of spermatozoa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">Two days later, on April 14, Adolph Romero III, a commercial fisherman, noticed a white Datsun 280 ZX parked in front of a San Diego shipyard. Approximately 50 feet from the vehicle, Romero retrieved Guthrie\u2019s wallet from beneath some bushes. When Guthrie could not be reached, the wallet ultimately was turned in to the local police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-8\">4. <em>The Death of Janette Cullins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-9\">The prosecution, pursuant to Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b), presented evidence over defendant\u2019s objection that on or about April 12, 1984, Janette Cullins, who was 24 years of age, died by strangulation. Janette originally had encountered defendant in a San Diego bar in February 1984, and saw him socially the following month. Lee Ann Johnson, who resided across the street from Janette\u2019s apartment, reported that during April 1984 she observed a distinctive-looking vehicle arrive and depart from the area on several occasions. At trial, Johnson testified that the vehicle, a white Datsun 280 ZX, resembled the one owned by Jillette Mills. One night that April, Johnson observed the vehicle parked across the street, its engine running for 10 or 15 minutes, \u201c[a]nd then all of a sudden I heard the car start\u2014take off, and it sort of screeched and made a u-tum and came up past my house to the comer and didn\u2019t stop for the stop sign and went through the stop sign.\u201d Johnson never saw the vehicle again.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">Approximately midday on April 13, Cullins\u2019s previous roommate, Nancy McEachem, drove to Cullins\u2019s apartment because they had planned to conduct a yard sale on the following day, a Saturday, and McEachem wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>to drop off some items to sell. As she was parking her vehicle in front of the apartment, defendant drove up in a white Datsun 280 ZX. He asked McEachem whether Cullins was home. McEachem replied, \u201cHer car is not here. She hasn\u2019t answered a phone call\u201d placed by McEachem earlier that morning. Defendant left, and McEachem entered the apartment. Inside, the drapes were drawn and the Venetian blinds were closed, causing the apartment to appear dark, which McEachem testified was \u201cunusual\u201d for that time of day because \u201cWe had the habit of opening everything up and making it real bright first thing in the morning.\u201d McEachem left a note for Cullins on the dining table and departed from the apartment. McEachem returned the next day to discover Janette\u2019s body lying in the bedroom closet. The cause of her death was asphyxiation due to strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Records of Great American Bank revealed that on April 13, 1984, a withdrawal from Janette Cullins\u2019s account in the amount of $60.00 (leaving an account balance of $4.06) was made from an automatic teller machine located at the bank\u2019s Point Loma Branch. A four-minute videotape of the transaction, introduced into evidence and shown to the jury, depicted a man wearing a black jacket.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">5. <em>Defendant\u2019s Arrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">Approximately 10:50 p.m. on April 17, 1984, Arizona Highway Patrolman Robert Dapser was completing a traffic stop on Interstate 40 in northern Arizona, when he received a call from a track driver on the citizen\u2019s band radio located in his patrol vehicle. The caller advised that \u201can erratic vehicle had been driving in his location, passed by him twice and nearly cut him off both times,\u201d and identified the California license plate on the car as \u201cPHANTOM 2.\u201d The subject vehicle, a Datsun 280 ZX, drove by as Officer Dapser was receiving this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-8\">Officer Dapser pursued the vehicle, which he observed \u201cswerving across the center line of the highway.\u201d He activated the emergency lights on his patrol vehicle and initiated a traffic stop. After illuminating the Datsun with a spotlight, Dapser approached the car and requested that the driver produce identification. Defendant, the lone occupant of the vehicle, produced an expired driver\u2019s license issued by the State of Alaska. Dapser asked for the vehicle registration documents. Defendant searched the center console and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>glove box and then stated, \u201cI can\u2019t find it, she must not have it in here.\u201d Dapser thought he observed a burnt marijuana cigarette in the center console of the Datsun and, having witnessed the vehicle\u2019s erratic movement, decided to take defendant into custody. He advised defendant of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602] (Miranda) and placed him in the patrol vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">Officer Dapser returned to the Datsun to search for the burnt marijuana cigarette. He noticed beer bottles, one of which was empty, located on the passenger side floorboard. While searching for the marijuana cigarette, Dapser observed a bank identification card located in the crevice between the driver\u2019s seat and the center console. The name on the card was that of Janette Cullins. Believing that the truck driver who originally noticed the Datsun had misidentified the license plate, Dapser transmitted a message over his police radio, advising that the license plate was not \u201cPHANTOM 2,\u201d but \u201cPHANTM Z.\u201d Within several minutes, a dispatcher instructed Dapser to detain the vehicle and all occupants at the request of California law enforcement officials. Dapser discontinued his search of the Datsun and arranged for it to be towed to a locked police storage area.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">Officer Dapser administered a Breathalyzer test to defendant, which revealed that his blood-alcohol content was .078 percent approximately 80 to 90 minutes after the traffic stop. Defendant was transported to the Yavapai County jail in Prescott, Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">6. <em>The Contents of the Datsun 280 ZX</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-8\">On April 18, 1984, Officer Dapser released the contents of Jillette Mills\u2019s Datsun 280 ZX, as well as certain personal property confiscated from defendant\u2019s person, to West Los Angeles and Culver City police detectives. The detectives inventoried the personal property and other objects recovered from the vehicle, which included the following items introduced into evidence at defendant\u2019s trial: an American Tourister suitcase containing a plastic jar filled with pennies and labeled \u201cblack bean soy sauce,\u201d a Korean-made wood-handled kitchen knife, yellow rubber gloves, and a gold chain\u2014all identified as having belonged to Kim; a sweatshirt depicting a location in Alaska; an Alpha Beta supermarket CASHEX card identified as having belonged to Susan Knoll; towels, athletic wear, and photographic equipment identified as having belonged to Jillette Mills; three hand-woven sweaters identified as having belonged to Bonnie Guthrie; a \u201cMembers Only\u201d jacket, which contained a butcher knife, a knee-high nylon sock, and a business card <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>from Jim Sutton\u2019s Lafayette Shell gasoline station; a key ring identified as having belonged to Janette Cullins; and a piece of paper with the word \u201cSHYLAS\u201d\u2014the access code to Cullins\u2019s Great American Bank (originally San Diego Federal Savings and Loan) account; and a number of items emblazoned with the names of Las Vegas casinos. A pair of jeans recovered from the Datsun contained a yellow half-sock and a blue bandana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">B. <em>The Defense Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">The defense did not present any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">II. <em>Penalty Phase Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">\n<em>A. The Prosecution\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-9\">The prosecution presented evidence in aggravation establishing that in the early morning hours of March 29, 1984, defendant, uninvited, entered the Ventura County residence of Jennifer S., 22 years of age, with whom he had been acquainted for approximately two weeks. During a period of four and one-half hours, defendant twice strangled Jennifer until she lost consciousness. After she regained consciousness, defendant tied her hands behind her back. Sometimes wielding a bone-handled knife, defendant forced her to orally copulate him on multiple occasions. Unable to attain an erection, defendant complained that Jennifer \u201ccould do it better.\u201d Shaking violently and uncontrollably, Jennifer asked for a drink of water. Instead, defendant located a bottle of wine and two wine glasses and \u201ctook the wine and . . . forced it against\u201d her, causing it to spill onto Jennifer\u2019s face. Thereafter, defendant demanded and obtained cash kept at the residence. Subsequently, he pulled off Jennifer\u2019s clothes and raped her. At some point, defendant informed Jennifer he \u201cliked cocaine,\u201d and Jennifer told him he could find a small amount in a cupboard. Defendant retrieved the drug, which she assumed he snorted, and he subsequently \u201ccalmed down quite a lot.\u201d Shortly after reassuring defendant that she would not call the police and feigning concern for defendant\u2019s well-being, Jennifer \u201cran out the front door and ran as fast as [she] could\u201d to a neighbor\u2019s apartment, where she \u201cpounded\u201d and \u201ckicked\u201d the door. The neighbor answered and shortly thereafter notified the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">The police took Jennifer to the Ventura County Medical Center, where she was treated for facial cuts, hip abrasions, and several broken fingernails, bits of which were recovered by police investigators from the floor of her residence. Jennifer testified that she was \u201cfairly certain\u201d that the facial cut she suffered was from the knife defendant had wielded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>The prosecution also introduced into evidence abstracts of judgments reflecting defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions, a 1974 burglary conviction in Oregon and a 1977 burglary conviction in Alaska.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">B. <em>The Defense Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">The defense evidence in mitigation was extensive, involving the testimony of 21 witnesses, as well as multifaceted, presenting various aspects of defendant\u2019s background and character, as summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">First, defendant\u2019s older brother, Jerry Lee Carter, and their younger sister, Polly Anne Reasner, testified regarding the difficulties of growing up as the children of an alcoholic mother and alcoholic stepfather in the small, remote Alaskan town of Nome. Esther Carter, defendant\u2019s mother, was half Eskimo; Jim Carter, defendant\u2019s stepfather, served for several years as Nome\u2019s chief of police.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s parents argued and fought frequently, hurling profanities as well as furniture at each other. As a result, the children \u201cwanted to get as far away from them as you could.\u201d As a young child, defendant (who was bom in 1955), repeatedly ran away from home for days at a time, once reaching Anchorage several hundred miles away, and another time hiding in the wheel well of an aircraft. When defendant was eight or nine years of age, defendant\u2019s stepfather affixed a chain to defendant\u2019s ankle, attaching the other end of the chain to a bed, to prevent further similar incidents. A family friend, Bertha Adsuna, recalled that defendant was treated differently from his older brother, and that defendant\u2014unlike Jerry\u2014was dressed by their mother \u201clike an orphan.\u201d When defendant was nine years of age, his parents sent him several hundred miles away to a boarding school for \u201cproblem children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">Second, several witnesses testified that in the late 1970\u2019s, defendant became an accomplished television cameraman, thereafter marrying and becoming the proud father of twin boys. He also engaged in activities not considered unusual for residents of Nome, such as climbing upon icebergs during the springtime ice break. In the early 1980\u2019s, however, defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>enthusiasm for his career began to wane as marital problems and his addiction to cocaine increasingly dominated his life. By 1983, defendant and his wife were divorced, and defendant was not permitted to visit his children. According to his brother, defendant became \u201cdisgruntled,\u201d \u201cheartbroken,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d Defendant missed his sons, and according to a former colleague, Mary Alexander, following defendant\u2019s separation from his family \u201cit was as if the light had gone out.\u201d Defendant told Beth Farley, whose friendship with defendant dated to their childhood, that because he could not see his children, he planned to move away from Alaska and begin a new life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">Third, a number of defendant\u2019s friends and former colleagues testified regarding defendant\u2019s dependability and trustworthiness, but also to his accelerating addiction to cocaine, a substance that defendant termed \u201cmarching powder.\u201d According to one witness, during several months prior to March 1984 defendant was using cocaine regularly, drinking heavily, and was \u201cclearly out of control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">Fourth, two witnesses employed by Ventura County provided further details regarding the rape of Jennifer S. Detective William Ragsdale recalled that Jennifer had remembered that defendant\u2019s eyes were \u201cglazed over\u201d during the incidents on the morning of March 29, and that, at various intervals, defendant acted remorseful and acknowledged he \u201cneeded psychiatric help.\u201d Lynda Zych, a toxicologist, testified that Jennifer tested \u201cpositive for cocaine,\u201d but that a confirming test never was administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">Finally, two witnesses testified regarding events following the attack upon Jennifer S. Andrew Holtz, a former colleague of defendant\u2019s, testified that on March 29, 1984, defendant telephoned him, sounding \u201cvery depressed,\u201d and expressed a desire to visit the Alaska Psychiatric Institute, located in Anchorage. Holtz encouraged defendant \u201cto get in touch with the authorities in Ventura to straighten things out.\u201d Daniel Shields, an employee at the Los Angeles County jail, testified that during defendant\u2019s period of incarceration prior to trial, defendant had not presented any discipline problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">I. <em>Pretrial Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">\n<em>A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at the Preliminary Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">Defendant contends he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at his preliminary hearing because his attorney, Ezekiel Perlo, (1) performed only a perfunctory cross-examination of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses who testified pertaining to the death of Tok Kim and the murder of Jillette Mills, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>(2) failed to cross-examine any of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses called to testify regarding the murders of Bonnie Guthrie and Janette Cullins. Defendant asserts: \u201cThe record demonstrates that defense counsel was not responsible for any meaningful challenge to evidence presented over a five-day preliminary hearing that produced thirty-seven witnesses and twenty-seven exhibits.\u201d As a result of these alleged deficiencies at the preliminary hearing, defendant alleges that he suffered prejudice at trial. The contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">\u201cIn general, irregularities in pretrial commitment proceedings require reversal on appeal only where the defendant shows he was \u2018deprived of a fair trial or otherwise suffered prejudice\u2019 as a result. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pompa-Ortiz </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 519, 529 [165 Cal.Rptr. 851, 612 P.2d 941].) Where the case involves an ineffective assistance claim of the sort at issue here [that is, the alleged failure to adequately cross-examine witnesses], no prejudice typically appears unless counsel\u2019s pretrial performance resulted in the loss of material evidence and caused tangible harm to the defense at trial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 749, 771-773 [251 Cal.Rptr. 83, 759 P.2d 1260] [preliminary hearing counsel\u2019s failure to contest prosecution\u2019s scientific evidence and conduct independent forensic investigation did not impair defense of rape-murder charge at trial, including introduction of expert medical testimony]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Aston </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 481, 494-495 [216 Cal.Rptr. 771, 703 P.2d 111] [unavailability of witness at preliminary hearing was \u2018cured\u2019 when witness later testified for defendant at suppression hearing and was available at trial].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Millwee </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 96, 121-122 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 954 P.2d 990].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">In the present case, defendant has failed to make the requisite showing. Perlo\u2019s performance at the preliminary hearing was not deficient. Defendant\u2019s assertions to the contrary ignore Perlo\u2019s appropriate questioning of various witnesses and instead merely speculate that more vigorous cross-examination of certain witnesses, such as Ray Blevins, Tok Kim\u2019s former boyfriend (who died prior to trial), might have led the trial court to preclude the prosecution from introducing evidence relating to the death of Kim and the murder of Janette Cullins. Defendant\u2019s assertions in this regard do not establish that counsel performed deficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">Moreover, at trial the prosecution presented overwhelming evidence linking defendant to the charged offenses. Thus, even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that the trial court erred in permitting the prosecution to introduce evidence pertaining to Kim and Cullins, defendant does not demonstrate that in the absence of such evidence, the result at trial would have been different. (See <em>People v. Coleman </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 749, 773 [251 Cal.Rptr. 83, 759 P.2d 1260] [in postconviction proceedings, the burden is on the defendant to establish prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s pretrial performance].) Although at trial the defense presented no case-in-chief, defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>counsel vigorously cross-examined numerous witnesses for the prosecution. We further observe that the prosecution\u2019s evidence at trial relating to Kim was inconclusive as to cause of death, and that although the Cullins evidence linked defendant to that homicide, defendant had not yet been tried or convicted in that case\u2014circumstances that considerably lessened the impact of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">On this record, which is similar to that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Millwee, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 96, 122, \u201c[defendant identifies no exculpatory or mitigating evidence overlooked at any phase of the proceedings, nor does he demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance at the preliminary hearing \u2018affected the ability of trial counsel to advocate defendant\u2019s case at trial.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d We therefore reject defendant\u2019s claim that counsel rendered ineffective assistance based upon counsel\u2019s performance at the preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">B. <em>Motion to Suppress Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his section 1538.5 motion to suppress evidence seized from his person and from Jillette Mills\u2019s vehicle following his arrest. Defendant asserts that his detention and arrest were unlawful because they were not supported by probable cause and that the search of his person and the vehicle violated state and federal constitutional guarantees against unreasonable search and seizure. We reject defendant\u2019s position as to each of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">At the pretrial hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, Robert Dapser, the Arizona law enforcement officer who stopped and detained defendant on April 17, 1984, testified that he initiated the traffic stop only after receiving a call that a \u201cwhite Datsun 280 Z with California personalized [license] plates\u201d had been seen driving in a dangerous manner and after the officer personally observed a vehicle that matched that description driving erratically. Upon directing the driver to pull over and stop, Officer Dapser approached the vehicle, observed beer bottles and a burnt portion of a marijuana cigarette inside, and detected the scent of alcohol as well as the faint smell of burnt marijuana. Defendant\u2019s eyes appeared to Dapser to have been \u201crather glossed over,\u201d indicating to Dapser that defendant \u201cwas under the influence of something.\u201d Dapser took defendant into custody for possession of the marijuana cigarette and advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>him of his rights under <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, \u201cfor driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs.\u201d Less than 10 minutes later, Dapser was notified to detain the vehicle and all occupants at the request of law enforcement officials located in Culver City, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court denied the motion, finding: \u201cI think the officer did have sufficient cause to stop, detain, and then arrest Mr. Carter under the facts and observations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">On appeal, defendant\u2019s arguments are substantially similar to his assertions in the trial court. For the following reasons, we find them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">\u201c \u2018An appellate court\u2019s review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress is governed by well-settled principles. [Citations.] [f] In ruling on such a motion, the trial court (1) finds the historical facts, (2) selects the applicable rule of law, and (3) applies the latter to the former to determine whether the rule of law as applied to the established facts is or is not violated.

Salvucci </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 83, 91-92 [65 L.Ed.2d 619, 628, 100 S.Ct. 2547].) The legitimate expectation of privacy must exist in the <em>particular area searched or thing seized </em>in order to bring a Fourth Amendment challenge.\u2019 <em>(People v. Hernandez </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1182, 1189 [245 Cal.Rptr. 513], italics in original.)\u201d <em>(People v. McPeters, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 1148, 1171.) The burden is on the defendant to establish that a legitimate expectation of privacy <em>(Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 98, 104 [65 L.Ed.2d 633, 100 S.Ct. 2556]) was violated by government conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">Our independent review has not disclosed any error in the superior court\u2019s application of these principles. In the present case, defendant, as the driver of a stolen vehicle, lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy to contest the search of that vehicle. (See <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1978) 439 U.S. 128, 141, fn. 9 [58 L.Ed.2d 387, 99 S.Ct. 421] [\u201c \u2018No . . . interest of the Government in the effective and rigorous enforcement of the criminal law will be hampered by recognizing that anyone legitimately on premises where a search occurs may challenge its legality by way of a motion to suppress, when its fruits are proposed to be used against him. This would of course not avail those who, by virtue of their wrongful presence, cannot invoke the privacy of the premises searched.\u2019 \u201d (Italics omitted.)]; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Melnyk </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1533 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 570].) To accept defendant\u2019s assertion that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy while driving a stolen vehicle would be to overlook the word \u201cunreasonable\u201d in the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">As noted, Officer Dapser received information that a specific vehicle was being driven recklessly\u2014information that soon was corroborated when he saw it drive by. Therefore, he had a reasonable basis to stop the vehicle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>detain the driver. Upon encountering defendant, Dapser had further indicia of unlawful conduct: defendant\u2019s eyes appeared glazed, the odor of alcohol and marijuana wafted from the car\u2019s interior, the passenger-side floorboard was littered with beer bottles, and a burnt marijuana cigarette was visible. Because possession of marijuana was a felony in Arizona at that time, the officer\u2019s observations provided him with a reasonable basis to arrest defendant and take him into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Thus, even if we were to assume defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy was reasonable, his challenge to the seizure of incriminating evidence fails because his detention and arrest were lawful, thereby eliminating any reasonable expectation of privacy that would have existed had the vehicle not been stolen. <em>(New York v. Belton </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 454 [69 L.Ed.2d 768, 101 S.Ct. 2860].) Nor are we persuaded that the length of the detention prior to arrest\u2014less than 10 minutes\u2014was, as defendant asserts, \u201cfor an excessive time waiting for the dispatcher\u2019s report,\u201d or that Officer Dapser\u2019s ultimately unsuccessful search for the marijuana cigarette during that period required \u201can inordinate amount of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">In sum, the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence recovered from Jillette Mills\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">C. <em>Motion to Strike Prior Burglary Convictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in (1) refusing to strike his prior burglary convictions from Oregon and Alaska, alleged as prior serious felonies within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a), and section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(18); (2) declining to dismiss these alleged prior convictions pursuant to section 1385; and (3) admitting evidence of the prior convictions at the penalty phase pursuant to section 190.3, subdivision (c). Defendant argues each of these alleged errors denied his constitutional rights to due process of law, a fair trial, and a reliable sentence. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">Prior to the commencement of trial, defendant moved to strike the prior conviction allegations on the grounds that the Oregon and Alaska priors did not constitute \u201cserious felony convictions\u201d within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In defendant\u2019s view, certain distinctions between the language of the Oregon and Alaska burglary statutes on the one hand, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>California statute on the other, precluded the introduction of the out-of-state priors.* **<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, defendant alleged that neither the Oregon nor the Alaska burglary statute included all of the elements of the California crime of residential burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">At a pretrial hearing conducted on March 20, 1987, the superior court rejected defendant\u2019s motion to strike his prior burglary convictions. The court observed: \u201cIt seems like the purpose of this rule is to look to see if and to avoid the holding of an individual responsible for a serious felony prior for conduct that in this state would not substitute for a serious felony. And based on my review of the documents and the points and authorities in this case, that isn\u2019t what we\u2019re facing here, [f] . . . [f] What we have here is that it appears that what the defendant was charged with and convicted of is conduct, precisely that which is required to come within [section] 459 as a first degree burglary.\u201d The court concluded, \u201cThe motion to strike is denied at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">On appeal, defendant contends the trial court should have stricken the prior serious felony enhancements that were based on his residential burglary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>convictions in Oregon and Alaska, because the foreign convictions did not include all the elements of the \u201cserious felony\u201d of \u201cresidential burglary\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1), (4), 1192.7, subd. (c)(18)) as defined in California (\u00a7 459). Defendant further urges that the court violated then applicable law when it went behind the facial elements of the foreign convictions, and considered the entire records of the foreign convictions to determine whether the minimum elements of a California residential burglary were actually present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">As set forth in the margin (fh. 9, <em>ante), </em>the Oregon and Alaska statutes required only entry with intent to commit a \u201ccrime.\u201d (Or. Rev. Stat., \u00a7\u00a7 164.215, 164.225(1); Alaska Stat., \u00a7\u00a7 11.20.080, 11.20.090.) By contrast, Penal Code section 459, then and now, requires entry with intent to commit <em>\u201cgrand or petit larceny </em>or any <em>felony.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Thus, defendant\u2019s Oregon and Alaska convictions conceivably could have been for conduct which, if committed in California, would not support a conviction under section 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">As defendant observes, the law as it existed in 1984 allowed courts to look only at the face of a foreign conviction to determine whether its minimum elements established a \u201cserious felony\u201d under California law. <em>(People v. Crowson </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 623 [190 Cal.Rptr. 165, 660 P.2d 389].) But, as defendant acknowledges, we overruled <em>Crowson </em>in <em>People v. Myers </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1193 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 911, 858 P.2d 301]. <em>Myers </em>held that, in determining whether a foreign conviction satisfies the minimum elements of a \u201cserious felony\u201d in California, the court may examine \u201cthe entire record of the prior conviction.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1201; see also <em>People v. Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 355-356 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150] [in determining the truth of a prior-conviction allegation, the trier of fact may look to the entire record of the conviction, overruling <em>People </em>v. <em>Alfaro </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 627 [230 Cal.Rptr. 129, 724 P.2d 1154].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">Defendant fails to explain his view that <em>Myers </em>is not fully retroactive, and no reason appears to depart from the general rule that judicial decisions, even those overruling prior authority, have full retroactive effect. (See, e.g., <em>Burris v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1012, 1023 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 876, 103 P.3d 276]; <em>Woosley v. State of California </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 758, 793-794 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 838 P.2d 758].) Retroactive application is particularly appropriate here, because <em>Myers </em>would apply to the consideration of the prior conviction at any new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">Although defendant additionally questions the \u201ccompetence\u201d of the foreign records on which the trial court relied, he fails to persuade us that the records are invalid or otherwise deficient. Our own review of those records reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>that as to the Alaska conviction, defendant pleaded guilty to \u201cunlawfully breaking] and entering] a . . . residence, . .. the breaking and entering being with the intent to commit the crime of larceny therein,\u201d and that as to the Oregon conviction, defendant was found guilty of \u201cknowingly and unlawfully entering] a dwelling [a residence] . . . with the intent to commit the crime of theft therein.\u201d (Cf. former \u00a7 459, \u201cEvery person who enters any house, . . . apartment, . . . with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary\u201d [Stats. 1984, ch. 854, \u00a7 2, p. 2896]; see also former \u00a7 460, subd. (1), \u201cEvery burglary of an inhabited dwelling house ... is burglary of the first degree\u201d [added by Stats. 1923, ch. 362, \u00a7 1, p. 747]; \u00a7 490a, \u201cWhenever any law or statute of this state refers to or mentions larceny, . . . said law or statute shall hereafter be read and interpreted as if the word \u2018theft\u2019 were substituted therefor\u201d; \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(18), any burglary of the first degree is a \u201cserious felony.\u201d) Because each one of defendant\u2019s prior convictions thus would satisfy the necessary elements to convict defendant of first degree burglary in California, we reject defendant\u2019s challenge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">After the jury reached its guilt phase verdicts, defendant, outside the jury\u2019s presence, renewed his request that evidence of his prior burglary convictions be excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration, this time requesting that the trial court exercise its discretion under section 1385 to strike the allegations.

The circumstance that defendant\u2019s prior convictions were committed before the 1986 amendment that added subdivision (b) to section 1385 (\u201cThis section does not authorize a judge to strike any prior conviction of a serious felony . . .\u201d) did not preclude the trial court in 1989 from denying defendant\u2019s motion to strike the prior conviction allegations. No error or abuse of discretion appears.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>Defendant next contends the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of defendant\u2019s prior burglary convictions under section 190.3, subdivision (c) at the penalty phase. He is incorrect. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 201 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480] [\u201cThe plain meaning of subdivisions (b) and (c) of section 190.3 is that the jury must consider any <em>violent </em>criminal activity by the defendant, whether or not it led to prosecution and conviction, <em>and </em>any \u2018prior <em>felony </em>conviction\u2019 (italics added), whether the underlying offense was violent or nonviolent.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)].) Defendant\u2019s prior burglary convictions in Oregon and Alaska clearly qualify as prior felony convictions. Defendant offers no persuasive argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">Finally, even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that defendant is correct in asserting that the trial court erred in admitting defendant\u2019s prior burglary convictions at the penalty phase, we perceive no prejudice. The jury did not learn of defendant\u2019s prior convictions until after it already had considered the evidence that defendant had committed the charged murders and had found him guilty of those crimes as well as other offenses. Under these circumstances, there existed no reasonable possibility of a different outcome at the penalty phase had the prior burglary convictions not been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">D. <em>Denial of Pretrial Motion to Exclude Other-crimes Evidence Pertaining to the Deaths of Tok Kim and Janette Cullins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">Defendant contends the superior court abused its discretion in denying his motion to exclude evidence pertaining to the death of Tok Kim in Alameda County and the murder of Janette Cullins in San Diego County. He argues that the judgment must be reversed in its entirety due to the lower court\u2019s admission of this \u201cother-crimes evidence\u201d in purported violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. We conclude defendant\u2019s position is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-8\">In March 1987, approximately two years prior to the commencement of defendant\u2019s trial, the prosecution informed the defense of its intention to introduce, at the guilt phase of defendant\u2019s trial, evidence of the then pending, unadjudicated crimes charged against defendant in Alameda and San Diego Counties. In July 1987, defendant responded to the prosecution\u2019s notice by filing a \u201cmotion to exclude evidence of pending prosecutions in Alameda and San Diego Counties.\u201d In July 1988, the superior court considered and summarily denied defendant\u2019s motion. Approximately one year later (on the eve of trial), defendant renewed the motion to exclude this evidence, limiting the motion to the Kim matter only and asserting that the prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>had failed to disclose laboratory and related police reports revealing that defendant had not been the donor of semen detected on a bedspread in Kim\u2019s apartment. The court summarily denied this motion as well.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">As we have summarized in the foregoing statement of facts, at the guilt phase of trial the prosecution, over defense objection, introduced evidence pertaining to the death of Tok Kim and the murder of Janette Cullins. Defendant had yet to be tried in those cases and, in the wake of the death judgments rendered in the present case and in the subsequently tried case involving Janette Cullins, the Alameda County District Attorney dismissed the charges against him based on the death of Tok Kim. As noted, defendant contends the trial court below erred in permitting the prosecution to introduce evidence of these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">Character evidence is not admissible to show conduct on a specific occasion. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (a).) This type of evidence sometimes is referred to as evidence of criminal disposition or propensity. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Sam </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 194, 203 [77 Cal.Rptr. 804, 454 P.2d 700].) The rule excluding such evidence, however, is qualified by Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b), which provides: \u201cNothing in this section prohibits the admission of evidence that a person committed a crime, civil wrong, or other act when relevant to prove some fact (such as . . . opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity . . .) other than his or her disposition to commit such an act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">\u201cEvidence that a defendant has committed crimes other than those currently charged is not admissible to prove that the defendant is a person of bad character or has a criminal disposition; but evidence of uncharged crimes is admissible to prove, among other things, the identity of the perpetrator of the charged crimes, the existence of a common design or plan, or the intent with which the perpetrator acted in the commission of the charged crimes. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101.) Evidence of uncharged crimes is admissible to prove identity, common design or plan, or intent only if the charged and uncharged crimes are sufficiently similar to support a rational inference of identity, common design or plan, or intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 402-403 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 646, 867 P.2d 757].) On appeal, the trial court\u2019s determination of this issue, being essentially a determination of relevance, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scheid </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1, 14 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 348, 939 P.2d 748]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 201 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1223, 1239 [270 Cal.Rptr. 451, 792 P.2d 251]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577, 617 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376]; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Khan </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 993 F.2d 1368, 1376.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">\u201cTo be relevant on the issue of identity, the uncharged crimes must be highly similar to the charged offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 380, 403.) Evidence of an uncharged crime is relevant to prove identity only if the charged and uncharged offenses display a \u2018 \u201cpattern and characteristics ... so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting 1 McCormick on Evidence (4th ed. 1992) \u00a7 190, pp. 801-803.) \u2018The strength of the inference in any case depends upon two factors: (1) the <em>degree of distinctiveness </em>of individual shared marks, and (2) the <em>number </em>of minimally distinctive shared marks.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 756 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267], italics in original, disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 684, fn. 12 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1].)\u201d <em>(People v. Kipp </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 349, 369-370 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 716, 956 P.2d 1169].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling, certain of the charged and uncharged offenses displayed common features that revealed a highly distinctive pattern. As noted in our summary of the evidence, Jillette Mills and Susan Knoll each was fatally strangled and their bodies found in a closed bedroom closet; in the uncharged offense involving Janette Cullins, the victim\u2019s body also was found strangled in her closed bedroom closet. Although defendant notes certain differences in the circumstances surrounding the victims\u2019 deaths, the combination of fatal strangulation and placement of a young woman\u2019s body in a closed bedroom closet is both highly distinctive and suggestive that the same person perpetrated the crimes involving Knoll, Mills, and Cullins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">To be highly distinctive, the charged and uncharged crimes need not be mirror images of each other. Thus, although there were certain differences in the crimes committed against Knoll and Mills, and those against Cullins, such distinctions went to the weight of the evidence and did not preclude the prosecution from introducing the evidence regarding Cullins\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">Although the evidence of Kim\u2019s death did not share the distinctive features of the murders charged in the present case, it clearly was relevant on the issues of intent and a common plan.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The vehicle owned by Tok Kim was missing at the time her body was found but later was discovered near the residence of Knoll and Mills. Subsequently, a white Datsun 280 ZX matching the description of Mills\u2019s vehicle, missing since the time Mills\u2019s body was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>found, was observed in the vicinity of Cullins\u2019s apartment near the time of Cullins\u2019s murder. When arrested, defendant had on his person or in the Datsun an eclectic array of objects identified as having belonged to (1) each of the three victims in the murders charged in the present case, (2) Janette Cullins, and (3) Tok Kim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">The shared characteristics of the killings, as well as the presence of evidence associated with a particular victim or victims at events related to the next murder, indicate that when defendant committed the crimes charged in the present case as well as the uncharged crimes, he acted pursuant to a common plan to kill and steal from his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">\u201cA lesser degree of similarity is required to establish relevance on the issue of common design or plan. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 380, 402.) For this purpose, \u2018the common features must indicate the existence of a plan rather than a series of similar spontaneous acts, but the plan thus revealed need not be distinctive or unusual.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 403.) . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">\u201cThe least degree of similarity is required to establish relevance on the issue of intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 380, 402.) For this purpose, the uncharged crimes need only be \u2018sufficiently similar [to the charged offenses] to support the inference that the defendant \u201c \u2018probably harbor[ed] the same intent in each instance.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (People v. Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 349, 371.) Considering the shared characteristics noted above, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in implicitly determining that the charged and uncharged offenses were sufficiently similar to support an inference that defendant harbored the same intent\u2014to kill and to steal\u2014in each instance. (See <em>People v. Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 349, 371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-8\">As we stated in <em>Kipp, </em>\u201cThere is an additional requirement for the admissibility of evidence of uncharged crimes: The probative value of the uncharged offense evidence must be substantial and must not be largely outweighed by the probability that its admission would create a serious danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 380, 404-405.) On appeal, a trial court\u2019s resolution of these issues is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 405.) A court abuses its discretion when its ruling \u2018falls outside the bounds of reason.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>De Santis </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1198, 1226 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 628, 831 P.2d 1210].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 349, 371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">We find no abuse of discretion. Evidence of the circumstances surrounding the death of Tok Kim was highly probative, as it helped to establish a link between her recent acquaintance with defendant and her sudden death, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, Bonnie Guthrie, and Janette Cullins that shortly followed. Because the five women each died within a period of approximately four days, the proximity of these incidents to each other \u201cfurther enhanced\u201d the probative value of the other crimes evidence. (See <em>People v. Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 349, 371.) Kim\u2019s Honda was discovered shortly after her death, hundreds of miles from her residence, parked in front of the apartment in which the bodies of Knoll and Mills were discovered, and at approximately the same time that Mills\u2019s car disappeared. Evidence of the circumstances of Cullins\u2019s death was probative for the same reason. Mills\u2019s missing white Datsun 280 ZX matched the description of the vehicle that a neighbor observed rapidly driving away from the apartment building in which Cullins (who also had been acquainted with defendant) had resided. The cause of Cullins\u2019s death, and the location of her body in a bedroom closet, closely resembled both the manner of killing and the concealment utilized by the perpetrator at the Knoll/Mills crime scene. As noted, at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest items linking him to all five deceased women were discovered on his person or in Mills\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">These evidentiary links were highly probative as to the identity of the perpetrator of the crimes, as well that person\u2019s murderous and larcenous common plan and intent. The prosecution was required to prove in its case-in-chief that defendant intended to kill Knoll, Mills, and Guthrie, each of whom was fatally strangled. When the trial court ruled admissible the evidence in question, defendant had not conceded either the issue of identity or intent, nor did the prosecution possess other evidence proving these material disputed facts so conclusively that evidence of the Kim and Cullins deaths should have been excluded as merely cumulative. (See <em>People v. Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 349, 372.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">\u201cAgainst this substantial probative value on material and contested issues, we must weigh the danger of undue prejudice to defendant, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 349, 372.) Evidence of the Kim and Cullins crimes \u201cposed a substantial danger of prejudice to defendant because a jury would be inclined to view [such] evidence ... as evidence of his criminal propensities, and because a jury might well view defendant as deserving of punishment\u201d for the Kim and Cullins crimes regardless of his guilt of the Knoll, Mills, and Guthrie murders. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cBut prejudice of this sort is inherent whenever other crimes evidence is admitted <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 380, 404), and the risk of such prejudice was not unusually grave here.\u201d <em>(People v. Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 349, 372.) The Efim death and the Cullins murder were not significantly more inflammatory than the charged offenses; the prosecution was unable definitively to establish that Kim had died at the hands of another, and there was no evidence that Cullins suffered sexual assault as had Mills and Guthrie.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>Moreover, the jury was instructed correctly pursuant to CALJIC Nos. 2.09 and 2.50 as to the limited purposes for which it might consider the evidence of the Kim and Cullins matters. The instructions conveyed that evidence relating to those events could not be considered to prove defendant\u2019s bad character or criminal disposition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Defendant also contends that in view of the summary nature of the trial court\u2019s ruling denying defendant\u2019s motion, the court \u201cfailed to engage in the balancing process required under Evidence Code section 352 or [Penal Code] section 954,\u201d and on that basis reversal is required. We disagree. The parties agreed to present the issue to the court based on the strength of their written submissions (that is, without oral argument), prompting the court to observe that the parties\u2019 arguments \u201ccertainly were completely handled in the papers.\u201d Although \u201cthe better practice\u201d would have been for the trial court, prior to issuing its ruling, to have set forth on the record its balancing of the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 767, 793 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 301]), its ruling did not have to be that explicit. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Garceau </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 140, 177-179 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 664, 862 P.2d 664] [trial court\u2019s failure to state on the record that it had weighed prejudice against probative value held not erroneous when parties had argued at length as to the admissibility of certain testimony that allegedly was unduly prejudicial to the defendant]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Raley </em>(1992) 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>Cal.4th 870, 894-895 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 678, 830 P.2d 712] [trial court\u2019s explicit rejection of the Evidence Code section 352 claim deemed to be sufficient, the court \u201chaving heard lengthy argument\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mickey </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 612, 655-656 [286 Cal.Rptr. 801, 818 P.2d 84] [in upholding admissibility of the defendant\u2019s letters that assertedly were privileged under Evidence Code section 980, observing that although the trial court could have been more explicit in explaining its reasoning, \u201cwe review the ruling, not the reasoning\u201d]; see also <em>People v. Triplett </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 624, 626-629 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 225] [reviewing the evolution of the case law in this area].) In the present case, the parties submitted the issue to the court on the strength of their thoroughly prepared written arguments. In view of the court\u2019s indication it had reviewed such submissions, the weighing process contemplated by Evidence Code section 352 may be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">In view of the foregoing, we conclude the trial court did not exceed the bounds of reason in determining that the probative value of the evidence of the Kim and Cullins matters \u201cwas not substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission would create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d <em>(People v. Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 349, 372.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">Finally, even if we were to assume that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the evidence relating to the deaths of Kim and Cullins, reversal would not be required unless it is reasonably probable the outcome would have been more favorable to defendant had such evidence been excluded. <em>(People v. Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 349, 374.) In view of the strong evidence implicating defendant in the charged murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie, it is not reasonably probable that an outcome more favorable to defendant would have been reached in the absence of the evidence related to Kim and Cullins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">E. <em>Denial of Motion for Severance of the Culver City Crimes (Knoll and Mills) from the West Los Angeles Crimes (Guthrie)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-8\">Defendant contends the trial court improperly denied his motion to sever defendant\u2019s trial on the \u201cCulver City crimes\u201d involving the murders of Susan Knoll and Jillette Mills, the rape of Mills, and the burglary of the apartment shared by Knoll and Mills (offenses that were alleged to have occurred on April 10, 1984) from the \u201cWest Los Angeles crimes\u201d involving the murder and rape of Bonnie Guthrie and the burglary committed at her apartment (offenses that were alleged to have occurred on April 11, 1984). Defendant argues that in denying the motion to sever and thereby compelling him to face \u201ca joint trial of offenses arising from separate incidents on different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>dates,\u201d the trial court denied defendant a panoply of state and federal constitutional rights, requiring reversal of the entire judgment. In particular, defendant maintains that \u201cwhile the offenses are of the same class, the crimes were not inextricably connected in their commission, and the so-called common markers between the Mills/Knoll and Guthrie homicides can only be termed \u2018minimally distinctive\u2019 under close scrutiny.\u201d Defendant further contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever in the same summary fashion as the court had denied defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the other crimes evidence, and in failing explicitly to weigh the relevant factors on the record and exercise its discretion. None of these claims has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">\u201cSection 954 provides that \u2018[a]n accusatory pleading may charge . . . two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or offenses, under separate counts, . . . provided, that the court in which a case is triable, in the interests of justice and for good cause shown, may in its discretion order that the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading be tried separately or divided into two or more groups and each of said groups tried separately.\u2019 Because both offenses involved murder and thus belonged to the same class of crimes, the statutory requirements for joinder were satisfied. Therefore, defendant can predicate error in denying the motion to sever only upon a clear showing of potential prejudice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Osband </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 622, 666 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sandoval </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 155, 172-173 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 342, 841 P.2d 862], affd. <em>sub nom.

Bradford, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 1229, 1314-1316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to sever clearly was based on certain obvious similarities among the crimes. \u201cPursuant to Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b), evidence that a defendant has committed an offense, although inadmissible to demonstrate a defendant\u2019s <em>disposition </em>to commit crimes, may be received to establish, among other things, identity, intent, motive, or plan. To be admissible to demonstrate a distinctive modus operandi, the evidence must disclose common marks or identifiers, that, considered singly or in combination, support a strong inference that the defendant committed both crimes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 954, 988-989 [269 Cal.Rptr. 492, 790 P.2d 1289]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bean </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 919, 937 [251 Cal.Rptr. 467, 760 P.2d 996]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Memro, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 786, 851; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt[, supra], </em>7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>Cal.4th 380, 403 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 646, 867 P.2d 757].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>supra, 15 Cal.4th 1229, 1316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">The Susan Knoll/Jillette Mills and Bonnie Guthrie offenses, having been committed approximately one day apart, each involved the murder by strangulation of young women whose belongings were found approximately one week later in defendant\u2019s possession. On this basis alone, the evidence connecting defendant to the Knoll/Mills and Guthrie crimes would be cross-admissible if the court had ordered separate trials, thereby dispelling any inference of prejudice. <em>(People v. Bradford, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 1315-1316.) Moreover, because both crime scenes involved murder and sexual assault, the evidence from each disclosed a commonality with regard to intent and plan (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (b)), while presenting little if any possibility that one of the charges or set of charges would have unduly inflamed the jury against defendant. Although all three women were not strangled in an identical manner\u2014Mills and Guthrie were strangled by ligature, whereas Knoll was strangled manually\u2014both crime scenes had in common a ligature strangulation, as well as the traumatic sexual assault of Mills and Guthrie. Nor did the prosecution join a \u201cweak case\u201d with a \u201cstrong\u201d one\u2014the evidence linking defendant to each crime was especially compelling. Further, Knoll and Guthrie were best friends, a circumstance that suggested one person committed the crimes against both victims in the two-day period, and that therefore supported the cross-admissibility of the evidence. The murders of each of the three women presented one or more special circumstances; because <em>each </em>one of the murders by itself formed the basis for capital charges to be brought against the perpetrator, <em>joinder </em>did not lead to one set of crimes being \u201celevated\u201d to capital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">Although the better practice would have been for the trial court to make clear on the record the basis for its denial of defendant\u2019s motion to sever, the court\u2019s failure to articulate its reasoning does not invalidate its ruling or undermine the correctness of that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">Further, we observe that even had defendant demonstrated that the evidence would not have been cross-admissible, he has failed to establish prejudice. He has not demonstrated that one offense or set of offenses was \u201csignificantly more likely to inflame the jury against defendant, since the murders were similar in nature and equally gruesome. Defendant has not shown that evidence of guilt was significantly stronger in one case, creating the danger that that case would be used to bolster the weaker case, because the prosecutor\u2019s evidence was nearly equal in strength\u201d in establishing defendant\u2019s involvement in the Knoll/Mills and Guthrie murders. <em>(People v. Bradford, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 1317-1318.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>Under these circumstances, no abuse of discretion appears. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">F. <em>Pretrial and Midtrial Motions Contesting the Sufficiency of the Evidence of Felony Murder in the Deaths of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie, and of the Special Circumstances of Burglary and Rape</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">Prior to trial, defendant moved pursuant to section 995 to strike and set aside the substantive charges and special circumstances pertaining to the murders and to other offenses involving victims Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie. The motion was denied. Defendant thereafter petitioned the Court of Appeal for writ relief, which also was denied. At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal, pursuant to section 1118.1. This motion, too, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">Defendant generally contends there was insufficient evidence (1) to support his conviction, based on the theory of felony murder, for the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie, and (2) to find true the special circumstance allegations of burglary and rape. Defendant specifically asserts the evidence was inadequate to establish that he harbored a felonious intent upon entering the victims\u2019 residences; he notes the premises bore no sign of forced entry. Defendant\u2019s position is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">The law applicable to a claim of insufficiency of the evidence is well settled: \u201c \u2018In reviewing [a claim regarding] the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Citation.] \u201c[T]he court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Citation.] We \u201c \u2018presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.] If we determine that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the due process clause of the United States Constitution is satisfied [citation], as is the due process clause of article I, section 15, of the California Constitution [citation].\u201d <em>(People v.

Rape was defined in pertinent part as \u201can act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person not the spouse of the perpetrator [that was] [][] ...[][].. . accomplished against a person\u2019s will by means of force or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.\u201d (Former \u00a7 261, subd. (2), as amended by Stats. 1984, ch. 1635, \u00a7 79.5, p. 5865.)

There is no question that each of these killings was unlawful and was committed with malice aforethought. Defendant\u2019s palm print was discovered in the apartment shared by Susan Knoll and Jillette Mills where their bodies were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">Similarly, the evidence was sufficient to establish rape; Mills\u2019s and Guthrie\u2019s bodies bore signs of having suffered traumatic sexual assault, and seminal fluid discovered on a white nightgown in the apartment was consistent with defendant\u2019s PGM type and that of 15.8% of the population.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">With regard to the offense of burglary, evidence of a forced entry is not required to establish felonious intent; defendant\u2019s intent instead may be inferred from all of the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Matson </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 35, 41 [117 Cal.Rptr. 664, 528 P.2d 752].) Defendant\u2019s commission of crimes in close temporal proximity, combined with a very similar modus operand! in each incident, strongly indicates that he entered the residences with the requisite felonious intent, <em>(ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">Defendant was arrested driving Mills\u2019s stolen Datsun 280 ZX, containing an Alpha Beta supermarket CASHEX card identified as having belonged to Knoll; towels, athletic wear, and photographic equipment identified as having belonged to Mills; and three hand-woven sweaters identified as having belonged to Bonnie Guthrie.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">In view of the evidence summarized above, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the murders of Knoll, Mills, and Guthrie occurred in the course of defendant\u2019s having committed the felonies of burglary and rape. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>evidence adduced at trial clearly was sufficient, for purposes of the felony-murder rule and the special circumstances alleged, to establish that defendant committed rape and burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">G. <em>Motion to Reconsolidate the Los Angeles, Alameda, and San Diego County Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">As originally filed, the complaint against defendant charged all of the crimes allegedly committed in Alameda, Los Angeles, and San Diego Counties in a single pleading. Defendant subsequently moved to dismiss the charges arising from the Alameda and San Diego crimes committed against Tok Kim and Janette Cullins, respectively. The prosecution did not oppose the motion, instead informing defendant that if the motion were granted, the crimes committed in Alameda and San Diego Counties would form the basis for a refiling of the charges against defendant in those counties.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">On January 28, 1986, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges involving the crimes committed in Alameda and San Diego Counties. Defendant thereafter separately was charged in San Diego County for the murder of Janette Cullins, and was transferred to that county for arraignment, preliminary hearing, and other pretrial motions. Defendant also was charged in Alameda County with murder and related offenses involving Tok Kim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>On August 8, 1988, more than two and one-half years after the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the Alameda and San Diego County charges, defendant\u2014now represented by new counsel\u2014moved to reconsolidate the Alameda, Los Angeles, and San Diego cases. At the hearing conducted 10 days later, defense counsel informed the court that the motion was made over defendant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> After hearing the parties argue the issue and observing that the disagreement between defendant and his attorneys as to whether to seek reconsolidation \u201c[d]oes raise an interesting issue,\u201d the court granted defense counsel\u2019s request for one additional day in which to review the matter with defendant. At the hearing the next day, defense counsel informed the court that notwithstanding counsel\u2019s efforts to persuade defendant to seek reconsolidation, defendant remained in \u201cclear opposition\u201d to the motion. The court determined that defendant\u2019s position on the issue was \u201cparamount,\u201d and denied the motion to reconsolidate.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to reconsolidate the Alameda, Los Angeles, and San Diego cases. Specifically, defendant contends that his trial attorneys\u2019 decision to seek reconsolidation over defendant\u2019s objection fell within counsel\u2019s \u201ctactical prerogative\u201d to \u201cwaive\u201d defendant\u2019s right to a jury drawn from the vicinage where the crimes were committed, and that the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion violated defendant\u2019s rights to \u201cdue process of law, fair trial, burden of proof, effective assistance of counsel, death eligibility and reliable determinations of guilt and penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">Although it is questionable whether the trial court was correct in determining that defendant, rather than defense counsel, possessed the \u201cparamount\u201d authority to decide whether a motion to reconsolidate the charges should have been proffered (see, e.g., <em>People v. Guzman </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 915, 935-939 [248 Cal.Rptr. 467, 755 P.2d 917]), even if the trial court erred in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>determination we conclude that reversal of the judgment is not warranted because the error was not prejudicial. Had the trial court granted defense counsel\u2019s motion to reconsolidate the Alameda and San Diego charges with the Los Angeles charges, there is no reasonable probability (or, for that matter, possibility) that defendant would have fared better in a consolidated trial involving these additional charges than he did in a trial of the Los Angeles charges alone. Defendant presents no persuasive basis for concluding that a jury that imposed the death sentence for three murders would have imposed a lesser sentence if defendant had been charged in this proceeding with additional crimes, including murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">Defendant contends that a trial court\u2019s error in failing to consolidate charges should be characterized as \u201cstructural error\u201d that requires reversal without any showing of prejudice. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Cahill </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 478, 501-502 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 853 P.2d 1037].) Defendant presents no authority, however, to support the claim that a failure to consolidate charges arising from crimes committed in different counties constitutes structural error, and we conclude that the contention lacks merit. Although the severance of the Los Angeles charges from the San Diego and Alameda charges\u2014on defendant\u2019s own motion\u2014resulted in defendant\u2019s having to face two separate capital trials, in the absence of any showing how defendant was prejudiced in either trial it is clear that the failure to consolidate the cases did not undermine the basic fairness of either trial or warrant reversal of the judgment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">H. <em>Pretrial Ruling Denying Exclusion of the Evidence Related to Kim or of the Testimony of Ray Blevins, Based on the Prosecution\u2019s Failure to Timely Disclose Exculpatory Semen Evidence at the Kim Crime Scene</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">On June 15, 1989, five days before the prosecution commenced the presentation of its case-in-chief, defendant moved for a mistrial or, alternatively, for exclusion of the evidence pertaining to the death of Tok Kim or of the testimony of her former boyfriend Ray Blevins, on the ground the prosecution had failed to timely provide the defense with a 1986 laboratory report generated by the Oakland Police Department. The report indicated defendant was not the donor of semen found on a bedspread in Kim\u2019s apartment. Defendant argued that the prosecution\u2019s failure to respond in a timely fashion to a February 19, 1988 discovery order to produce any forensic evidence or related reports pertaining to the bedspread, coupled with Blevins\u2019s death in 1987, precluded the defense from ascertaining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>Blevins was the donor of the semen. In response, the prosecution argued that the report had not been timely disclosed because Oakland Police Department officials had failed to transfer it to the prosecutor and, in any event, the report was immaterial because the prosecution alleged that defendant had murdered Kim, not that he had raped her. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion, asserting that the laboratory report was \u201chighly material.\u201d We review the matter for abuse of discretion. <em>(People v. Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 957 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044].) No abuse of discretion appears. When the report was provided to the defense, the prosecution had yet to present its case-in-chief, and the defense still had time to formulate a response to the evidence. Moreover, as indicated above, a proffer of rape never had been part of the proffer of the other crimes evidence. Rather, the relevance of the evidence pertaining to Kim\u2019s death was twofold: (1) to demonstrate a similarity in the circumstances of her death to the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie, pursuant to Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b), and (2) to establish a link between defendant and the Los Angeles County murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie based upon the circumstances that Kim\u2019s <em>vehicle </em>was parked outside the apartment occupied by Knoll and Mills, and that Mills\u2019s vehicle, containing possessions belonging to each of the victims, was being driven by defendant at the time of his arrest. The discovery of semen on Kim\u2019s <em>bedspread, </em>and the report establishing that defendant had not been the donor of that fluid, was, at best, of marginal significance in the prosecution\u2019s case against defendant with regard to the Los Angeles County murders. Therefore, defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecution\u2019s belated disclosure of the laboratory report prior to the swearing-in of the jury and the introduction of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Defendant makes the related assertion that the prosecutor misled the jury by arguing that the circumstances surrounding the deaths of each of the victims, including Tok Kim, had sexual assault as a common marker. The record belies this claim. In his closing summation to the jury, which was relatively brief in view of the number of crimes charged against defendant, the prosecutor did not assert that Kim had been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted, and instead made clear that only \u201ctwo [victims] were raped\u201d and that \u201c[t]he evidence relating to Miss Kim [was] offered to you for your determination in how the defendant was involved in this and, if he was, how he relates to all of this.\u201d Later in his summation, the prosecutor asked, rhetorically if also ambiguously, \u201cWhen did [defendant] form the intent to steal or to rape? Was this, in the case of Miss Kim, which is not before you as a finding that you have to make, an afterthought? Certainly it\u2019s possible.\u201d The fleeting reference to Kim in this context hardly suggested to the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>defendant had sexually assaulted her; to the contrary, the prosecutor explicitly reminded the jury that it need not make any findings as to Kim. Again, no prejudice appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">I. <em>Pretrial Ruling Admitting the Alameda County Eyewitness Identifications</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">As part of the police investigation following the discovery of Tok Kim\u2019s body on April 13, 1984, Oakland Police Sergeant Raymond Conner prepared a photographic lineup containing defendant\u2019s photograph as well as the photographs of five other individuals (members of the Oakland Police Department, shown wearing street clothes, without indicia of their occupation). The lineup was shown to nine witnesses, eight of whom identified defendant as the man they saw with Kim, and one of whom alternated between selecting defendant\u2019s image and that of one other individual depicted in the lineup. The order in which the photographs were arranged was changed between presentations to the witnesses, who were separately shown the lineup. At a pretrial proceeding, defendant moved to suppress the photographic identifications as having been the product of an unduly suggestive lineup. Following an evidentiary hearing, in which Sergeant Conner testified, the court denied the motion, observing; \u201c[Cjertainly there are some differences, as there always are in photographs, but I don\u2019t find that the photographic lineup was unduly suggestive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">On appeal, defendant renews his contention that the lineup was impermissibly suggestive, \u201cresulting in a tainted in-court identification critical to the People\u2019s case.\u201d He asserts the testimony given by several of these witnesses at trial deprived him of his federal and state constitutional rights to due process of law, a fair trial, confrontation, an impartial jury, and reliable determinations of guilt, death eligibility, and penalty. Specifically, defendant contends; (1) he was the only person whose photograph depicted an individual wearing an orange shirt that resembled a \u201cjail jumpsuit\u201d; (2) the photograph of defendant was of \u201cbooking-photograph quality,\u201d as distinguished from the Polaroid photographs of the other individuals depicted in the lineup; (3) upon identifying defendant\u2019s photograph, the witnesses were asked to sign their names on the reverse side of the image, a technique that \u201csubtl[y] . . . reinforce[d]\u201d and tainted the witnesses\u2019 identification of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">\u201c \u2018In deciding whether an extrajudicial identification is so unreliable as to violate a defendant\u2019s right to due process, the court must ascertain (1) \u201cwhether the identification procedure was unduly suggestive and unnecessary,\u201d and, if so, (2) whether the identification was nevertheless reliable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1223, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>1242 [270 Cal.Rptr. 451, 792 P.2d 251].)\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wash </em>[(1993)] 6 Cal.4th [215,] 244 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 421, 861 P.2d 1107].)\u201d <em>(People v. Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 366-367 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708].) Whether we review deferentially or independently the trial court\u2019s finding regarding suggestiveness (see <em>id., </em>at p. 367; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1183, 1216-1217 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 702, 842 P.2d 1]), defendant\u2019s position lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">Our review of the photographs contained in the lineup indicates that defendant overstates the significance of the distinguishing characteristics seen in the photographs, and overlooks their more compelling general similarities. Each one of the six color photographs is approximately the same size, and depicts a middle-aged or somewhat younger adult male with a mustache and dark hair. Two of the individuals are shown wearing white T-shirts, two are seen wearing light-colored \u201cdress\u201d or \u201cpolo\u201d shirts, one wears a plaid shirt, and one individual\u2014defendant\u2014is wearing an orange shirt. Nothing about defendant\u2019s shirt identifies it as a \u201cjail jumpsuit\u201d or any other type of jail-issued clothing, and even if it had, a conclusion that the lineup was unduly suggestive would not necessarily follow. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 1183, 1217 [\u201cThe fact that defendant was the only person depicted in jail clothing . . . was not unduly suggestive under the circumstances present here.\u201d].) The expressions exhibited by the individuals are roughly comparable: each has his eyes open and his mouth closed, except for one individual whose mouth is slightly parted. Such distinctions are immaterial. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 1217 [minor differences in facial hair among the participants in a photo lineup held not to be suggestive].) Although the size of the white border around defendant\u2019s photograph is slightly larger than the border seen on the Polaroid images, and the Polaroid images are glossy while the image of defendant is semigloss, such trivial distinctions also are immaterial. <em>{Ibid. </em>[differences in background color and image size among the photographs held not to render the lineup impermissibly suggestive].) The witnesses clearly were instructed to consider the <em>persons </em>depicted, not whether a particular image was potentially distinguishable from the others based upon variations in photographic composition or processing.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">Nor do we attach significance to Sergeant Conner\u2019s request that the witnesses write their names on the backs of the particular photographs they identified. Although it would have been preferable to employ a more neutral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>recordation procedure\u2014for example, one in which a witness did not discover upon selecting an individual from the lineup that other witnesses previously had identified the same person\u2014we disagree with defendant that the procedure utilized by Conner was unduly suggestive or represented a \u201csubtle method of reinforcement.\u201d Because the witnesses\u2019 signatures were added only <em>after </em>each witness had made his or her selection, we find no basis for concluding that the witnesses were induced to identify defendant\u2019s image. (Compare <em>People v. Ochoa, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 353, 411\u2014413 [photographic identification of the defendant upheld notwithstanding the circumstance that his photograph was the only one taken in profile: \u201c \u2018A procedure is unfair which suggests <em>in advance of identification </em>by the witness the identity of the person suspected by the police.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">In sum, regardless of the applicable standard of review, we conclude that defendant has failed to meet his burden of establishing that the photo identification procedure used here was unduly suggestive. (See <em>People v. Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 312, 367.) We therefore need not reach the question \u201c \u2018whether the identification was nevertheless reliable under the totality of circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

Specifically, counsel offered a broad range of stipulations in an effort to prevent the prosecution from introducing exhibits depicting postmortem photographs of the five individuals (including closeup images of various wounds) and testimony of family members as to the victims\u2019 ownership of various items of personal property discovered in Mills\u2019s Datsun 280 ZX <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>Immediately prior to the parties\u2019 opening statements, outside the jury\u2019s presence, the defense renewed its offers to stipulate that on a certain date, Knoll and Mills died by strangulation. Counsel argued that the stipulation \u201cmust be accepted,\u201d emphasizing in particular the potentially prejudicial impact of one closeup photograph depicting a dark wound on the neck of Knoll\u2019s body, an image that counsel described as \u201cterribly disturbing and in my opinion prejudicial.\u201d Counsel further offered stipulations as to the testimony to be given by family members. The prosecution rejected the proffered stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">At trial, defense counsel renewed the offer to stipulate that Knoll and Mills \u201cdied of strangulation\u201d and, in view of the prosecution\u2019s rejection of the proffered stipulations, counsel objected under Evidence Code section 352 to the introduction of two coroner\u2019s photographs, one depicting the wound to Knoll\u2019s neck, the other depicting bruises to Guthrie\u2019s vaginal area. The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objections to the introduction of the photographs, observing; \u201cI don\u2019t feel that they\u2019re disturbing to the point of being excludable.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">The trial court thereafter admitted the challenged photographic evidence and the testimony of various relatives identifying the items of personal property found in the Datsun 280 ZX.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">On appeal, defendant renews his challenge to the above described evidence. He contends that because, in view of \u201cthe lack of substantive defense presented at [the] guilt phase, trial counsel were willing to stipulate to many facts they considered not in dispute,\u201d including the strangulation of victims Knoll, Mills, and Guthrie and the victims\u2019 ownership of the items found in the Datsun 280 ZX, the prosecution was required to accept the stipulations offered by the defense. Defendant further contends that the photographic evidence was unduly gruesome as well as cumulative, and that evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>pertaining to the personal property found in the car\u2014that is, the \u201chighly emotional\u201d testimony given by Sandra Pender (Susan Knoll\u2019s sister), Jennifer Boilman (Jillette Mills\u2019s sister), and George Cullins (Janette Cullins\u2019s father)\u2014\u201cwas clearly the subject of stipulation or other available procedures, such as identification by police personnel.\u201d Defendant assigns further error to the trial court\u2019s failure to engage in a weighing process as to the admissibility of the photographs in response to defendant\u2019s objection on Evidence Code section 352 grounds. Finally, defendant asserts that he was denied various of his state and federal constitutional rights because of \u201cthe trial court\u2019s erroneous rulings admitting inflammatory and prejudicial autopsy and family evidence [regarding the items found in the car].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">As we shall explain, none of defendant\u2019s contentions have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">We recently set forth the applicable analysis in <em>People v. Heard </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 946 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 131, 75 P.3d 53]: \u201cIn reviewing the ruling of the trial court, we reiterate the well-established principle that \u2018the admissibility of this evidence has two components: (1) whether the challenged evidence satisfied the \u201crelevancy\u201d requirement set forth in Evidence Code section 210, and (2) if the evidence was relevant, whether the trial court abused its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 in finding that the probative value of the [evidence] was not substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission would create a substantial danger of undue prejudice.\u2019 <em>(People v. Scheid </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1, 13 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 348, 939 P.2d 748].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 972.) We address these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">1. <em>Relevance of the Photographs and Testimony of Relatives</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">\u201c \u2018The rules pertaining to the admissibility of photographic evidence are well-settled. Only relevant evidence is admissible (Evid. Code, \u00a7 350; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>[(1994)] 9 Cal.4th 83, 132 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garceau[, supra,] </em>6 Cal.4th 140, 176-177 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 664, 862 P.2d 664]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Babbitt </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 660, 681 [248 Cal.Rptr. 69, 755 P.2d 253]), and all relevant evidence is admissible unless excluded under the federal or California Constitution or by statute. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 351; see also Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (d).) Relevant evidence is defined in Evidence Code section 210 as evidence \u201chaving any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d The test of relevance is whether the evidence tends \u201c \u2018logically, naturally, and by reasonable inference\u2019 to establish material facts such as identity, intent, or motive. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garceau, supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 177.) The trial court has broad discretion in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>the relevance of evidence (ibid.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 132; <em>People </em>v. <em>Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 681) but lacks discretion to admit irrelevant evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 132; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 505, 527 [224 Cal.Rptr. 112, 714 P.2d 1251].)\u2019 <em>(People v. Scheid, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 1, 13-14.)\u201d <em>(People v. Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 946, 972-973.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">In his opening brief, defendant does not challenge the relevance of the photographs depicting the deceased women, although in his reply brief he adopts a more critical stance. Defendant\u2019s ambivalent position is inconsequential. The images plainly were relevant to the proceedings at the guilt phase of trial <em>(People v. Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 946, 973-975 [and cases cited therein]), as well as at the penalty phase, to demonstrate circumstances in aggravation. <em>(People v. Thompson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 134, 182 [266 Cal.Rptr. 309, 785 P.2d 857].) Nor does defendant clearly assert a relevancy challenge to the testimony regarding the property found within the Datsun 280 ZX, although his characterization of that testimony as being of \u201cminimal probative value,\u201d which in his reply brief is amplified to \u201cirrelevant, cumulative, and prejudicial,\u201d could be construed as a challenge to its relevancy. To the extent defendant\u2019s characterization constitutes a relevance-based challenge, we reject it\u2014the testimony linking the property to the women clearly fell within Evidence Code section 210\u2019s definition, and was not cumulative. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 946, 973-975 [and cases cited therein].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">2. <em>The Photographs and Testimony Were Not Unduly Prejudicial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to exclude this evidence pursuant to Evidence Code section 352. Defendant maintains the photographs were gruesome and cumulative. He further contends the testimony given by relatives of Knoll, Mills, and Cullins was \u201chighly emotional [and] outweighed the minimal probative value of such testimony.\u201d The People disagree with defendant\u2019s characterizations and contend the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the probative value of the photographs and the testimony outweighed any potential prejudice. As we shall explain, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">\u201cThe admission of photographs of a victim lies within the broad discretion of the trial court when a claim is made that they are unduly gruesome or inflammatory. [Citations.] The court\u2019s exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal unless the probative value of the photographs clearly is outweighed by their prejudicial effect. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th 83, 133-134 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>The photographs at issue \u201cserved to illustrate and corroborate the testimony given by various prosecution witnesses regarding the circumstances of the crime[s].\u201d <em>(People v. Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 946, 976.) \u201c \u2018[I]nsofar as defendant is contending that the trial court was required to exclude the photograph[s] under Evidence Code section 352 because th[e] physical evidence was cumulative of the testimonial evidence presented, the trial court correctly rejected defendant\u2019s argument. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 926, 938 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 259, 838 P.2d 1212] [\u201c \u2018[W]e have often rejected the argument that photographs of a murder victim should be excluded as cumulative if the facts for which the photographs are offered have been established by testimony.\u2019 \u201d]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Kaurish </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 648, 684 [276 Cal.Rptr. 788, 802 P.2d 278]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 86, 115 [246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d 37].)\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scheid, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 1, 19.)\u201d <em>(People v. Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 976.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">As to whether the photographs or the testimony in question had an unduly prejudicial effect, we observe that \u201c \u2018[w]e have described the \u201cprejudice\u201d referred to in Evidence Code section 352 as characterizing evidence that uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against a party as an individual, while having only slight probative value with regard to the issues. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garceau, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 140, 178.) As we previously have observed, victim photographs and other graphic items of evidence in murder cases always are disturbing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 584, 594 [238 Cal.Rptr. 66, 737 P.2d 1350].)\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 134; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Fierro </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 173, 223 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 821 P.2d 1302].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 976.) Here, the challenged photographs depict the wounds suffered by Knoll and Guthrie; \u201cthat they are graphic and unpleasant to consider does not render the introduction of those images unduly prejudicial. (See <em>People v. Navarette </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 458, 496 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 89, 66 P.3d 1182] [rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention that the \u2018sexually suggestive nature\u2019 of photographs taken of the victim rendered them unduly prejudicial, and holding that \u2018[wjhen the victim of a murder has been stabbed directly between the breasts and left with her pants and underwear around her ankles, the defendant cannot complain that the jury is exposed to images of her nudity.\u2019]; see also <em>People v. Riel </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1153, 1194 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 998 P.2d 969] [\u2018The fact that the exhibits involved blood was due to the crime, not the court\u2019s rulings.\u2019].)\u201d <em>(People v.

Coleman </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 749, 776 [251 Cal.Rptr. 83, 759 P.2d 1260].) \u201cThe photographs ... do not appear to be of the sort that might inflame a jury. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302, 320, 321 and fn. 9 [208 Cal.Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669], overruled on another ground in <em>People v. Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1149-1150 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306] [upholding trial court\u2019s finding that four crime scene photographs, which included a photograph of one victim\u2019s head in a large pool of blood and of another victim lying face up with bleeding wounds, were \u2018not gruesome\u2019]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>[(1986)] 42 Cal.3d 1222, 1258 [232 Cal.Rptr. 849, 729 P.2d 115] [victims\u2019 bodies were not depicted \u2018in a badly decomposed condition ... or after they had been grossly disfigured during autopsy\u2019].)\u201d <em>(People v. Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 977.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">Further, \u201cas we observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Scheid, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 1, 20, \u2018the trial court clearly and properly could find that the photograph[s were] not so gruesome as to have impermissibly swayed the jury <em>\u201cin light of the testimony detailing each and every fact relating to the crime scene and </em>victims.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Certain \u201cwitnesses for the prosecution testified in detail as to what they observed when they first encountered [the bodies]. (See <em>People v. Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 1222, 1258 [observing that the inflammatory nature of nine photographs \u2018was relatively slight in comparison with the heinous nature of the crime presented to the jury through the testimony of witnesses\u2019].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 977.) The jurors having heard that testimony, the photographic images taken of the victims once their bodies had been taken to the coroner\u2019s facility were unlikely to have elicited an improper response from the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">Nor were the photographs unduly prejudicial on the ground they were cumulative by reason of their corroboration of facts independently established by testimony. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at pp. 977-978, and cases cited therein.) Similarly, although the testimony of the victims\u2019 friends and family members identifying objects found in the Datsun 280 ZX may have been punctuated with emotion that is not unexpected in a capital trial (for example, Mills\u2019s sister, Jennifer Bollman, cried during her testimony), such testimony was not unduly prejudicial in view of the expression of that emotion or because ownership of the identified items might have been established by stipulation or other means. The circumstance that the defense might have preferred that the prosecution establish a particular fact by stipulation, rather than by live testimony, does not alter the probative value of such testimony or render it unduly prejudicial. The prosecution was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>not required to accept such a stipulation or other \u201csanitized\u201d method of presenting its case. <em>(People v. Garceau, supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th 140, 182; see also <em>People v. Box </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 1153, 1199 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 69, 5 P.3d 130]; <em>People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th 83, 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">Moreover, as was the situation in <em>People </em>v. <em>Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at page 978, \u201ceven if the photographs engendered a disturbing response among the jurors, we believe the risk defendant would be prejudiced by that response was minimal, because the jury knew defendant had committed the acts described by the witnesses who had appeared before them.\u201d We believe that risk, as well as the risk that jurors somehow might have been improperly moved by the testimony of friends and family members toward a guilty verdict, was further minimized here by the circumstance that the defense at the guilt phase rested without calling a single witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">Accordingly, we conclude the trial court reasonably determined that the probative value of the photographic and testimonial evidence outweighed its potentially prejudicial effect. Although, in the interest of creating a clearer record, the court could have been more explicit in setting forth its reasoning in denying defendant\u2019s motions and overruling defense objections relating to the challenged evidence (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 25 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468] [\u201cthe record must affirmatively show that the trial judge did [affirmatively] weigh prejudice against probative value\u201d]), we are persuaded that the court engaged in a deliberative weighing process and acted within its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 in admitting the photographic and testimonial evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Heard, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 978; <em>People v.

Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 1222, 1258, applying the standard of <em>People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-9\">\u201cUnder the <em>Watson </em>standard, the erroneous admission of a photograph warrants reversal of a conviction only if the appellate court concludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>that it is reasonably probable the jury would have reached a different result had the photograph been excluded. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 836.)\u201d <em>(People v. Scheid, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 1, 21.) The photographic evidence at issue did not disclose to the jury any information that was not presented through the testimony of witnesses; the testimonial evidence merely established that items of property found in the Datsun 280 ZX belonged to certain victims, thereby helping to establish a link between defendant and those victims. Although the photographic and testimonial evidence may have been unpleasant for the jury to confront, it was not unusually disturbing or unduly gruesome, and was no more inflammatory than the testimony provided by other witnesses for the prosecution (such as the medical examiners, who offered their expert opinions as to the victims\u2019 suffering during the fatal strangulations). \u201cUnder these circumstances, we conclude it is not reasonably probable that the admission of the photographic and testimonial evidence] affected the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>(People v.

Blevins also identified certain objects as being similar to those he had seen in Kim\u2019s apartment. Some of these objects were seized in the search of the Datsun 280 ZX that defendant was driving at the time of his arrest. Defendant\u2019s attorney at the preliminary hearing briefly cross-examined Blevins. Several months later, but prior to the commencement of defendant\u2019s trial, Blevins died.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-7\">In pretrial proceedings, defendant moved to exclude from his trial the testimony given by Blevins at the preliminary hearing \u201con the ground that the lack of any meaningful cross-examination denied [defendant] his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, and prevented] him from presenting any effective defense to the events in Alameda County.\u201d The motion was denied. On the eve of trial, defendant renewed the motion to exclude this testimony, and that motion again was denied. At trial, the prosecution read into the record Blevins\u2019s testimony given at the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-8\">On appeal, defendant contends the admission of Blevins\u2019s testimony violated Evidence Code section 1291, as well as defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the state and federal Constitutions. Specifically, defendant asserts the court should have excluded the testimony because at the preliminary hearing defense counsel made \u201cno effort ... to focus on Blevins as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>third-party suspect in Kim\u2019s murder,\u201d despite counsel\u2019s knowledge that Blevins and Kim had argued bitterly just prior to her death. According to defendant, Blevins\u2019s prior testimony should have been found inadmissible pursuant to Evidence Code section 1291 \u201cbecause there had been no meaningful cross-examination by [defense counsel] at [the] preliminary hearing, and therefore no adequate showing the preliminary hearing testimony was reliable.\u201d Defendant, however, misconstrues the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">A criminal defendant has a constitutionally guaranteed right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him or her. (U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.; <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 400, 403-405 [13 L.Ed.2d 923, 85 S.Ct. 1065].) The right of confrontation is not absolute, however, and may \u201cin appropriate cases\u201d bow to other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. <em>(Chambers v.

An exception to the confrontation requirement exists where the witness is unavailable, has given testimony at a previous judicial proceeding against the same defendant, and was subject to cross-examination by that defendant. <em>(Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36, 59 [158 L.Ed.2d <em>177, </em>124 S.Ct. 1354]; <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Page, supra, </em>390 U.S. at p. 722; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 309, 339-348 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 513, 114 P.3d 758]; <em>People v. Stritzinger </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 505, 515 [194 Cal.Rptr. 431, 668 P.2d 738]; see also <em>California v. Green </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 149, 167-168 [26 L.Ed.2d 489, 90 S.Ct. 1930] [where a defendant has had an opportunity to cross-examine a witness at the time of his or her prior testimony, that testimony is deemed sufficiently reliable to satisfy the confrontation requirement].) Further, the federal Constitution guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not a cross-examination that is as effective as a defendant might prefer. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Owens </em>(1988) 484 U.S. 554, 559 [98 L.Ed.2d 951, 108 S.Ct. 838].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">California permits the use of the prior testimony of a witness against a criminal defendant only when the unavailability of the witness and the reliability of the testimony are established. (\u00a7 686; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1291, subd. (a)(2).) A witness is deemed unavailable if he or she is deceased. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 240, subd. (a)(3).) The testimony is deemed reliable if \u201c[t]he party against whom the former testimony is offered was a party to the action or proceeding in which the testimony was given and had the right and opportunity to cross-examine the declarant with an interest and motive similar to that which he has at the hearing.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1291, subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-7\">\u201cIn <em>People </em>v. <em>Zapien </em>[(1993)] 4 Cal.4th 929, 975 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 846 P.2d 704], this court recognized that the \u2018[a]dmission of the former testimony of an unavailable witness is permitted under Evidence Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>1291 and does not offend the confrontation clauses of the federal or state Constitution\u2014not because the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the preliminary hearing is considered an exact substitute for the right of confrontation at trial [citation], but because the interests of justice are deemed served by a balancing of the defendant\u2019s right to effective cross-examination against the public\u2019s interest in effective prosecution.\u2019 The court further determined that a defendant\u2019s motive in cross-examining a witness at a preliminary hearing may differ somewhat from the motive at trial, but nevertheless the earlier testimony may be admissible at the trial under section 1291 because the \u2018motives need not be identical, only \u201csimilar.\u201d \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zapien, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 975, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 742, 784 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 842 P.2d 1192].) Following similar reasoning and principles, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wharton </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 522 [280 Cal.Rptr. 631, 809 P.2d 290] the court held the defendant\u2019s interest and motive in cross-examining the alleged rape victim at the preliminary hearing in a prior unrelated criminal prosecution was sufficiently similar to the defendant\u2019s interest and motive at the penalty phase of a subsequent capital trial to warrant the admission of the preliminary hearing testimony under Evidence Code section 1291. (53 Cal.3d at p. 589.)\u201d <em>(People v. Samayoa </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 850 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 938 P.2d 2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">In the present case, defendant\u2019s motive and interest in cross-examining Blevins at the preliminary hearing were closely similar, if not identical to, defendant\u2019s objectives at the guilt phase of the trial\u2014namely, to attempt to discredit the prosecution\u2019s theory as to the date on which defendant initially encountered Tok Kim (in turn, suggesting that someone other than defendant encountered Kim at the Lafayette bar on the evening of April 1, 1984). The record indicates that at the preliminary hearing, defense counsel sought to establish that Blevins saw defendant and Kim together around midday April 1, 1984, several hours prior to the time the prosecution\u2019s other witnesses placed the pair together initially.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">In view of the foregoing, we conclude the trial court properly, if implicitly, concluded that defendant\u2019s \u201cmotive and interest\u201d in cross-examining Blevins at the preliminary hearing and at the trial were sufficiently similar to satisfy the requirements of Evidence Code section 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">Defendant further contends the admission of Blevins\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony violated defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right of confrontation, because defense counsel\u2019s brief cross-examination constituted incompetent representation. We disagree. As we previously have explained: \u201cas long as a defendant was provided the <em>opportunity </em>for cross-examination, the admission of preliminary hearing testimony under Evidence Code section 1291 does not offend the confrontation clause of the federal Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>simply because the defendant did not conduct a particular form of cross-examination that in hindsight might have been more effective.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Samayoa, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 795, 851, italics omitted; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Zapien </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 929, 975 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 846 P.2d 704]; <em>People v. Alcala, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 742, 784 [the requirement that the party have a similar interest and motive is satisfied notwithstanding the decision of defense counsel to alter the nature or scope of cross-examination].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">It is undisputed that at the time of trial, Blevins was dead and thus unavailable as a witness. Blevins\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing, where defendant had an interest and motive to cross-examine him similar to what defendant had at the trial, therefore was admissible. The trial court did not err in permitting the prosecution to introduce that testimony against defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">II. <em>Jury Selection Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Challenge to the Jury Selection Procedures</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">Defendant contends the jury selection procedures employed at his trial were improper, mandating a reversal of the judgment. Specifically, he contends: (1) the trial court failed to administer the oath of truthfulness on penalty of perjury to 28 prospective jurors, (2) the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by interposing improper objections to defense counsel\u2019s voir dire examination, resulting in the improper restriction of voir dire, and (3) the trial court erred in denying a number of challenges for cause and also abused its discretion by denying defendant peremptory challenges in addition to the 20 specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 231, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">Although defendant\u2019s initial contention is correct insofar as he asserts the trial court erred in failing to administer the oath to prospective jurors, for the reasons set forth below we conclude that defendant has failed to establish prejudice and that none of defendant\u2019s other contentions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">A. <em>The Oath of Truthfulness on Penalty of Perjury Administered to Prospective Jurors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-11\">On March 20 to 21, 1989, the trial court commenced jury selection by screening one panel of prospective jurors. On March 27, 1989, the court screened a second panel. On May 1 to 2, 1989, the court screened a third panel. With regard to the latter two panels of prospective jurors, the trial court apparently failed to administer the oath to prospective jurors mandated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>by Code of Civil Procedure former section 232, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Defendant moved for a mistrial or, alternatively, to excuse the 28 prospective jurors who had not been given the oath at the commencement of the voir dire examination. The court denied these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">After conducting further voir dire examination, the prosecution and the defense both informed the court that the jury as constituted was acceptable. At that point, the court administered the oath to jurors mandated by Code of Civil Procedure former section 232, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> According to defendant, 14 of the prospective jurors who were not administered the oath prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure section 232, subdivision (a) for prospective jurors at the outset of the voir dire examination became actual jurors or alternates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s error at the commencement of the voir dire process in failing to administer the oath of truthfulness to the prospective jurors who comprised the second and third panels was a \u201cstructural defect\u201d and therefore was reversible per se, citing <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 279, 307-309 [113 L.Ed.2d 302, 111 S.Ct. 1246], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Cahill </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 478, 502 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 853 P.2d 1037]; see also <em>People v. Pelton </em>(1934) 116 Cal.App. Supp. 789, 791 [116 Cal.App. 789, 7 P.2d 205] (holding that a conviction by an unsworn jury renders the verdict \u201ca nullity justifying a reversal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s position. First, neither <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, supra, </em>499 U.S. 279 (holding that the harmless-error rule applies to erroneously admitted coerced confessions), nor <em>People </em>v. <em>Cahill, supra, </em>5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>Cal.4th 478 (holding that the erroneous admission of a coerced confession does not require automatic reversal under California law), addressed the juror-oath question presented here and therefore are unhelpful to defendant\u2019s case. The fundamental or \u201cstructural\u201d defects discussed in those decisions consisted of significant irregularities, unlike the present situation, where the trial court partially but not fully complied with the oath-giving provisions set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 232. (See <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, supra, </em>499 U.S. at pp. 309-310; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cahill, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 478, 501-502.) Similarly, the decision in <em>People v. Pelton, supra, </em>116 Cal.App. Supp. 789, unlike the present case, involved the trial court\u2019s failure to administer the oath to jurors mandated by Code of Civil Procedure section 232, subdivision (b). These decisions do not support defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court\u2019s failure to administer the oath of truthfulness to prospective jurors, as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 232, subdivision (a), constitutes a structural defect. Indeed, although empanelling one or more jurors who are actually biased against the defense would constitute structural error <em>(In re Carpenter </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 634, 654 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 665, 889 P.2d 985], citing <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, supra, </em>499 U.S. 279, 309), here the trial court\u2019s error in failing to swear some of the prospective jurors has not been shown to have resulted in the inclusion of any biased jurors on the panel, and defendant\u2019s claim of structural error fails for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">Second, although there is a dearth of California case law examining the factual situation presented here, our decision in an analogous case, <em>People v. Lewis </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 629-631 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 22 P.3d 392], is instructive. In <em>Lewis, </em>we addressed the question whether the trial court erred in failing to administer the oath to prospective jurors prior to their answering written questionnaires regarding their views on the death penalty and other matters. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 629.) Observing that the prospective jurors had signed their questionnaires under penalty of perjury and were sworn under Code of Civil Procedure section 232, subdivision (a), prior to being personally questioned in open court, we held that although the defendant was \u201ccorrect that prospective jurors should have been sworn under Code of Civil Procedure section 232[, subdivision (a),] before filling out the questionnaires, he fails to establish that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to administer the oath at that juncture. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>at pp. 630-631; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 69, 72-74 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 86] [no prejudicial error where the oath taken pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 232, subdivision (b), did not ask the jurors to agree to follow the instructions of the court].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">For similar reasons as those found in <em>Lewis, </em>we reject defendant\u2019s assertion of prejudicial error here. Although the trial court omitted giving the first oath, the jury ultimately was instructed as to its duty to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions and was presumed to have performed its official duty, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>defendant has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to administer the required oath at the outset of questioning some of the prospective jurors. We further observe that, as in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 610, 629-631, the prospective jurors each filled out a juror questionnaire that was signed under penalty of perjury, a circumstance that undoubtedly impressed upon the prospective jurors the gravity of the matter before them and the importance of being truthful and thereby ameliorated at least in part the trial court\u2019s failure to timely administer the oath set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 232, subdivision (a). In view of the virtual certainty that these prospective jurors understood that they were required to answer truthfully the questionnaires, we reasonably may infer that the same prospective jurors similarly understood that they were required to respond truthfully to the questions posed during the voir dire examination\u2014much of which was essentially a followup to the prospective jurors\u2019 answers given in response to the questions set forth in the questionnaires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">Accordingly, on these facts we believe the jury understood that it was required to answer truthfully the questions posed during the voir dire examination. We therefore conclude the court\u2019s error in not administering the oath to some of the prospective jurors was not prejudicial to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">B. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s Objections to Defense Counsel\u2019s Questions During Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">In the course of defense counsel\u2019s examination of eight prospective jurors, the prosecutor interposed objections on the ground that counsel\u2019s questions asked the prospective jurors to \u201cprejudge\u201d the case. None of these eight individuals became a member of defendant\u2019s jury (although one individual was selected as an alternate juror). Prior to the parties\u2019 presentation of their respective cases, defendant moved for a mistrial or, in the alternative, for excusal of the prospective jurors, asserting that the prosecutor\u2019s objections impeded and dismpted counsel\u2019s voir dire examination. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">On appeal, defendant reiterates his contention that the prosecutor impermissibly interfered with defense counsel\u2019s voir dire examination of the prospective jurors and on that basis contends the trial court erred in denying his motion. He is mistaken; our review of the voir dire examination of the prospective jurors in question reveals that the prosecution\u2019s objections to defense counsel\u2019s questions were proper. The two passages of the hearing transcript cited by defendant as examples of the prosecutor\u2019s objections reveal no impropriety on the part of the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-9\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Then, is it fair to say that if indeed the opposite were true, that is, it was not only not exemplary but there were other\u2014there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>evidence of other activity\u2014criminal activity, that in that situation it would be difficult to see anything other than a death verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-5\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Excuse me. I object. It asks the juror to prejudge the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-6\">\u201cThe court: Objection sustained, [f] . . . [f]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-7\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: .... It would be some amount of extraordinary background evidence of an exemplary nature before you could even consider it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-8\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Just a moment please. Now, I have an objection and it asks the juror to prejudge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-9\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I would ask the [prospective] juror to go outside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">To the contrary, insofar as defense counsel\u2019s questions sought to ascertain the prospective jurors\u2019 views as to hypothetical cases not before the court, they were improper and the court acted within its discretion in prohibiting such questioning. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Noguera </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 599, 646 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 842 P.2d 1160].) Insofar as counsel\u2019s questions sought to commit a prospective juror to vote in a certain way given a particular set of facts, the questions similarly were improper. (See <em>People v. Williams </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 392, 408 [174 Cal.Rptr. 317, 628 P.2d 869] [\u201cWe reaffirm that it is not \u2018a function of the examination of prospective jurors to educate the jury panel to the particular facts of the case, to compel the jurors to commit themselves to vote a particular way, to prejudice the jury for or against a particular party, to argue the case, to indoctrinate the jury, or to instruct the jury in matters of law.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">Moreover, even were we to conclude that the prosecution\u2019s objections were improper, any error clearly would be harmless in view of the circumstance that none of the eight prospective jurors became a member of defendant\u2019s jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-12\">C. <em>Peremptory Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-13\">During jury selection, defendant challenged for cause Prospective Jurors Hickert, Kotz, Hughes, MacDonald, Craddock, Richards, Swope, and Humphrey. The trial court denied each of these challenges. Although Prospective Juror Craddock was selected as an alternate juror, none of these individuals was impaneled as a member of defendant\u2019s jury. After exercising 18 out of the 20 peremptory challenges available to it, the defense informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>the court that the jury as constituted was acceptable. The prosecution similarly indicated its acceptance of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">Defendant contends the trial court committed reversible error under the federal and state Constitutions in denying the challenges to excuse the above-named prospective jurors based upon their views regarding the death penalty. (See <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 412, 423-424 [83 L.Ed.2d 841, 105 S.Ct. 844]; U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7, subd. (a) (15), (16). As noted, however, when the defense accepted the jury, it had not exhausted all of its peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">\u201cIn order successfully to claim error in the denial of a challenge for cause of a prospective juror, a defendant on appeal must demonstrate that the ruling affected his or her right to a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>(People v. Horton </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1068, 1093 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 516, 906 P.2d 478]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th 83, 121; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garceau, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 140, 174.) Because defendant exercised peremptory challenges to remove the prospective jurors whom he unsuccessfully had challenged for cause, these individuals could not have compromised the impartiality of the jury. As a result, \u201cunder <em>Witt, </em>[defendant] cannot claim constitutional error based upon the trial court\u2019s denial of those challenges for cause.\u201d <em>(People v. Horton, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1093; see also <em>People v. Johnson, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 1183, 1211.) Indeed, \u201c[i]t is well settled that even if the trial court erred in denying a defendant\u2019s motion to remove a juror for cause, that error will be considered harmless if \u2018[n]one of the prospective jurors whom defendant found objectionable actually sat on his jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 920, 939 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 897 P.2d 574].) \u201cMoreover, defendant did not communicate to the trial court any dissatisfaction with the jury selected.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">In sum, defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury was not violated, and any error by the trial court in denying defendant\u2019s motions to exclude the above mentioned members of the jury venire for cause would not have been prejudicial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Horton, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 1068, 1093; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 920, 939.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>III. <em>Jury Instruction Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">A. <em>Instructions Regarding the Las Vegas Evidence and Evidence of \u201cFlight </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">At the outset of trial, and outside the jury\u2019s presence, the defense moved to exclude certain items that were recovered from the Datsun 280 ZX subsequent to defendant\u2019s arrest. These items included: a glass cup bearing the words \u201cSilver City Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada,\u201d a booklet of casino coupons (characterized by the prosecutor as \u201cdrink tickets\u201d) with one ticket bearing the word \u201cvoid\u201d and \u201c4/17/84\u201d (the date of defendant\u2019s arrest), and a key with an attached green token identifying the Westward Ho Casino (hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the Las Vegas evidence). Defendant contended that the Las Vegas evidence was irrelevant and, even if relevant, unduly prejudicial as being improperly suggestive of a lack of remorse by defendant. In response, the prosecutor asserted that the listed items were relevant because they were recovered from the vehicle defendant was driving when arrested and established the route defendant had taken following his commission of the charged offenses. The defense offered to stipulate as to the route taken by defendant in the days leading up to his arrest in Arizona, but the prosecution declined to accept the stipulation. The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objections to the introduction of the Las Vegas evidence, which briefly was identified at trial through the testimony of Sergeant Gary McEwen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">Immediately prior to the parties\u2019 closing arguments, defendant renewed his objection to file introduction of the Las Vegas evidence on the grounds of lack of relevancy and undue prejudice. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 210, 352.) The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion, finding that as to the Las Vegas evidence, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that they were probative of any disputed fact. ['([] The fact remains that the defendant was in Arizona heading eastbound and was not in California, and the fact that he may or may not have gone through Las Vegas I did not feel had any relevance and was not probative.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">Defendant moved for a mistrial based upon the trial court\u2019s finding that the Las Vegas evidence erroneously had been introduced into evidence. Alternatively, die defense requested that the court admonish the jury with a curative instruction. The court denied the motion for a mistrial, but admonished the jury as follows: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of exhibits marked. Not all of them were received [into evidence], [f] You\u2019re instructed to disregard exhibits 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>through 23 [the Las Vegas evidence]. It\u2019s a drinking glass, coupons, key chain and a key. Also Exhibit 4-E, which was a kitchen knife and the tape cassettes that were inside Exhibit 14, which was a gray Lancome Bag. [f] You must also disregard any testimony about those things, and they should play no part in your thoughts or deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">Although agreeing with defendant as to the asserted irrelevancy of the Las Vegas evidence, the trial court stopped short of prohibiting the prosecution from arguing to the jury that in its deliberations the jury could consider defendant\u2019s \u201cflight\u201d from California. Indeed, the trial court made clear that exclusion of the Las Vegas evidence \u201cdoes not take away flight as an issue.\u201d Ultimately, the prosecutor did argue defendant\u2019s flight as demonstrating consciousness of guilt. When the trial court read its instructions to the jury, however, the court did not read CALJIC No. 2.52, the standard instruction pertaining to flight. Outside the presence of the jury, the prosecutor commented: \u201cI noticed in your honor\u2019s reading of the instructions that there was no [CALJIC] No. 2.52 instruction which I had requested and which I thought I saw in the instructions when we went through them the other day.\u201d The prosecutor added that he was not asking that the jury be brought back to hear the court read CALJIC No. 2.52, but requested that the instruction be included with the written packet of instructions given to the jury. The defense objected to the giving of the instruction on the grounds that the defense did not contest the circumstance that defendant was arrested in Arizona, and that the omitted instruction focused the jury\u2019s attention on the Las Vegas evidence that the court ultimately had deemed irrelevant. The trial court overruled the objection, finding that the prosecution was \u201centitled to the instruction,\u201d which was inserted into the packet with the other instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">On appeal, defendant contends reversal is warranted on the grounds that introduction of the Las Vegas evidence was unduly prejudicial, the trial court\u2019s curative instruction was inadequate, and the court\u2019s instruction as to flight was violative of defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights. For the reasons set forth below, we reject each of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">Defendant asserts that to the extent the irrelevant Las Vegas evidence was indicative of a lack of remorse on defendant\u2019s part, it was violative of his state and federal constitutional rights to \u201cdue process of law, fair trial, burden of proof, death eligibility, and reliable guilt and penalty phase determinations,\u201d and that the introduction of such evidence was prejudicial because \u201cit create[d] the likelihood a non-statutory factor in aggravation will be considered by the jury in violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s\u201d proscription against vague and unreliable penalty determinations. We disagree. In view of the trivial nature of the Las Vegas evidence relative to the other evidence presented by the prosecution at the guilt and penalty phases, the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>clear and comprehensive admonition to the jury to disregard that evidence, and the substantial evidence supporting the jury\u2019s guilt and penalty phase determinations, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s curative instruction was adequate and that any error in admitting the Las Vegas evidence could not have been unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">Defendant further asserts \u201c[tjhere was no evidence of consciousness of guilt to warrant a flight instruction.\u201d In support of this contention, defendant argues that there was no evidence he fled immediately after the commission of the charged offenses, that during his travels in the several days leading up to his arrest in Arizona he had not been confronted with (and therefore could not have fled from) the charges filed against him, and that at every point during his detention and arrest in Arizona he was cooperative. Defendant maintains that in view of these circumstances, the trial court erred in furnishing the jury with a written copy of CALJIC No. 2.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention. Section 1127c requires a trial court in any criminal proceeding to instruct as to flight where evidence of flight is relied upon as tending to show guilt.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> CALJIC No. 2.52, which is derived from section 1127c, advises the jury \u201cthat evidence of flight alone is insufficient to establish guilt, but may be considered with other proven facts in deciding the question of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Visciotti </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1, 60 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 495, 825 P.2d 388].) Contrary to defendant\u2019s position, the instruction neither requires knowledge on a defendant\u2019s part that criminal charges have been filed, nor a defined temporal period within which the flight must be commenced, nor resistance upon arrest. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In view of the evidence introduced by the prosecution establishing that defendant left California in the days immediately following the charged offenses and was in possession of the vehicle belonging to murder victim Jillette Mills when he was arrested in Arizona, the flight instruction plainly was warranted here. <em>(Ibid, </em>[a jury could infer that the defendant\u2019s flight reflected consciousness of guilt].) As noted, the instruction merely permitted the jury to consider evidence of flight in deciding defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence; it did not suggest that the jury should consider such evidence as dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">Moreover, even if we were to conclude the instruction should not have been given, any error would have been harmless. The instruction did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>assume that flight was established, but instead permitted the jury to make that factual determination and to decide what weight to accord it. <em>(People v. Visciotti, </em>supra, 2 Cal.4th at p. 61.)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">B. <em>Instructions on Lesser Included Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">At the close of the guilt phase of defendant\u2019s trial, and outside the presence of the jury, defendant requested that the court instruct the jury on second degree murder and second degree felony murder.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Defense counsel argued that the jury \u201creally ought to have instructions on those . . . lesser included . . . areas that would be reasonably within their frame of a verdict. . ..\u201d The prosecutor objected: \u201cThere is not one wit of evidence [sic], nor a scintilla either, for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>matter, having to do with second degree murder or any other lesser crime, given the medical testimony and the unique facts of the case. ['}[] I don\u2019t think any theory [of admissibility] has been advanced until now, and either by cross-examination or any other\u2014anywhere else in this case, and I don\u2019t see it under the facts.\u201d Acknowledging that \u201cwhen you have crimes of degrees they have to be told about it, and sometimes it\u2019s an issue,\u201d the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s request, finding: \u201cHere it\u2019s either first [degree murder] or nothing [i.e. acquittal] [f] . . . [f] The court\u2019s . . . ruling is to reject the murder of the second degree instructions. I don\u2019t see that as a theory in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">On appeal, defendant contends the trial court deprived him of various constitutional rights and thus committed reversible error in declining to give the requested instructions pertaining to second degree murder and second degree felony murder, and further, that the court had a sua sponte duty to give such instructions even if defendant had not requested them. In support of this argument, defendant emphasizes that he \u201cis entitled under [the] state and federal Constitutions to have the jury instructed on lesser-included offenses <em>arising from the </em>evidence.\u201d (Italics added.) He contends that in addition to the possible verdicts of a first degree murder conviction and an acquittal, the jury ought to have been afforded the \u201cthird option\u201d of convicting defendant of second degree murder. (See <em>Beck v. Alabama </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 625, 637 [65 L.Ed.2d 392, 100 S.Ct. 2382].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">We discern no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the instructions requested by defendant. \u201cCalifornia decisions have held for decades that even absent a request, and even over the parties\u2019 objections, the trial court must instruct on a lesser offense necessarily included in the charged offense <em>if there is substantial evidence the defendant is guilty only of the lesser. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Birks </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 118 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 848, 960 P.2d 1073], italics added.) In the present case, we agree with the trial court that there was not substantial evidence to warrant the second degree murder instructions requested by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">As described above, the prosecution\u2019s evidence demonstrated that Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie were murdered at their residences in similar fashion within days of each other. All three had been fatally strangled\u2014Mills and Guthrie by ligature, and Knoll by what the medical examiner described as the use of \u201cconsiderable compression force\u201d (and had suffered blunt force injuries consistent with having struggled against her assailant). Not only does the manner in which each of these three killings was perpetrated strongly indicate in itself that each of the killings was willful, premeditated, and deliberate, but the entire course of conduct clearly revealed by the evidence, taken as a whole, is inconsistent with any suggestion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>killings were not willful, premeditated, and deliberate. Furthermore, the evidence additionally demonstrated that each of the murders occurred during the commission of either rape or burglary, a circumstance that in itself establishes the offenses as first degree murders under the felony-murder doctrine. (\u00a7 189.) Defendant fails to point to any substantial evidence that would support a jury\u2019s determination that the killing of any of the victims constituted second degree, rather than first degree, murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Defendant cites a number of decisions in support of his contrary contention, but these cases either have been overruled or involve inapposite factual situations. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303] [a defendant has a right to instructions on lesser related offenses that merely bear some relationship to the charged offense, overruled on that point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Birks, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 108, 136]; <em>People v. Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697] [modifying the defendant\u2019s conviction of first degree felony murder to second degree murder where the defendant was an immature 17-year-old youth involved in a conspiracy with other youths to \u201crip-off\u201d a marijuana farm and discharged his firearm when confronted by the victim, who displayed a shotgun]; <em>Vickers v. Ricketts </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 798 F.2d 369 [prisoner was stabbed and fatally strangled by his cellmate, who had a brain disorder related to an epileptic condition].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">The trial court therefore properly refused to instruct the jury regarding second degree murder and second degree felony murder. Because no evidence was presented indicating a basis for finding any of the killings to have been an excusable or justifiable homicide, the court also properly refused to give the homicide instruction. (CALJIC No. 8.00.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">C. <em>Instructions Regarding Felony Murder and Special Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">The trial court instructed the jury as to first degree felony murder and as to special circumstances. (CALJIC Nos. 8.21, and 8.80, respectively.)<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>On appeal, defendant contends the trial court should have instructed the jury that it could not find the special circumstance allegations of burglary murder, rape murder, and multiple murder true unless it found that defendant possessed the intent to kill Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie. Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s error in failing so to instruct constitutes a \u201cstructural defect\u201d in the proceedings that is reversible per se (see <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, supra, </em>499 U.S. 279, 307-309), or that alternatively constitutes an error that cannot be characterized as being harmless beyond a reasonable doubt (see <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824]) and therefore requires setting aside the findings of special circumstances and reversing the judgment of death. (See <em>People v. Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 41-44 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262].) We reject defendant\u2019s position, for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">\u201cIn 1983, this court held that intent to kill was an element of felony-murder special circumstances whether or not the defendant was the actual killer. <em>(Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131, 153-154 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862].) Although we overruled <em>Carlos </em>in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson[, supra], </em>43 Cal.3d 1104, 1147, holding that the intent-to-kill requirement applied only to an accomplice [and] not to the actual killer, <em>Carlos </em>remained applicable to [(and the trial court was required to instruct the jury on)] intent to kill in . . . all cases involving a defendant charged with a felony-murder special circumstance if the offense was committed during the \u2018window\u2019 period between our decisions in <em>Carlos </em>and <em>Anderson. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Marshall, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 1, 41-42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>In the present case, the jury found a total of six special circumstance allegations to be true\u2014one allegation of multiple murder, two allegations of rape murder (as to Mills and Guthrie), and three allegations of burglary murder (as to Mills, Knoll, and Guthrie). (\u00a7\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3), (17)(C) &amp; (G).) The murders occurred in April 1984, during the <em>Carlos/Anderson </em>\u201cwindow\u201d period. Accordingly, the jury in this case could find the special circumstance allegations to be true \u201conly if it found that defendant acted with intent to kill.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 1, 42.) Nonetheless, as defendant asserts and the People concede, the trial court\u2019s instruction on special circumstances, CALJIC No. 8.80, in relevant part informed the jury that defendant\u2019s intent was inconsequential: \u201cIf you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the actual killer, you need not find that the defendant intended to kill a human being in order to find the special circumstance to be true.\u201d (See fn. 33, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">\u201cWe have consistently held that when a trial court fails to instruct the jury on an element of a special circumstance allegation, the prejudicial effect of the error must be measured under the test set forth in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California[, supra,] </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]. [Citations.] Under that test, an error is harmless only when, beyond a reasonable doubt, it did not contribute to the verdict. <em>(Chapman, supra, </em>at p. 24 [87 S.Ct. at p. 828].)\u201d <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 635, 689 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 573, 941 P.2d 752].) We have held that \u201c \u2018error in failing to instruct that a special circumstance contains a requirement of the intent to kill is harmless [beyond a reasonable doubt] when \u201cthe evidence of defendant\u2019s intent to kill . . . was overwhelming, and the jury could have had no reasonable doubt on that matter.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Marshall, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 1, 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">In the present case, the evidence was overwhelming that defendant possessed the intent to kill when he murdered Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie. As noted, within a very brief period all three victims were killed by strangulation\u2014Knoll by manual strangulation, Mills and Guthrie by ligature strangulation. The latter two victims also suffered traumatic sexual assaults. That evidence, considered with the evidence that the bodies of Knoll and Mills were concealed within a closet, and that in each instance defendant departed from the crime scene with selected possessions of each victim, is consistent only with intentional killings. No evidence was presented that would have supported a finding of unintentional murder. Under these circumstances, we conclude that no reasonable jury, properly instructed, would have failed to find that defendant acted with the requisite intent to kill. We are satisfied that the trial court\u2019s instruction removing that issue from the jury\u2019s consideration was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>People v. Johnson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1, 46-47 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 593, 859 P.2d 673] [intent to kill properly found where one victim was strangled and set on fire, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>other victim was beaten to death]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Osband, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 622, 683 [concealing of victim\u2019s body beneath dresser drawers \u201cfurther supports the view that [the defendant] intended to kill\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">D. <em>Guilt Phase Instructions in General</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">The trial court instructed the jury pursuant to several pattern jury instructions at the conclusion of the guilt phase, including CALJIC Nos. 2.01 (sufficiency of circumstantial evidence, generally), 2.02 sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove specific intent), 2.50 (evidence of other crimes), 2.50.1 (evidence of other crimes by the defendant proved by a preponderance of the evidence), 2.50.2 (definition of preponderance of the evidence), 8.83 (sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove special circumstance), and 8.83.1 (sufficiency of evidence to prove mental state). Defendant contends that decisions rendered by this court rejecting constitutional challenges to these instructions (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 926, 942-943; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mickey, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 612, 669-671) are \u201cinconsistent with principles set forth by the United States Supreme Court\u201d and should be reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">Defendant has provided no basis for reconsidering our prior decisions upholding the validity of these pattern jury instructions. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 926, 942-943; <em>People v. Mickey, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 612, 669-671.) We therefore reject defendant\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">IV. <em>Alleged Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-11\">Defendant contends his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the guilt phase by conceding defendant\u2019s guilt, as demonstrated by counsel\u2019s failure to (1) make an opening statement, (2) present any evidence on defendant\u2019s behalf, and (3) make any substantive argument in his summation (which comprised four and one-half pages of the reporter\u2019s transcript) as to whether the prosecution had sustained its burden of proof as to defendant\u2019s guilt of the crimes charged or the truth of the special circumstances alleged. Relying upon <em>Griffin v. California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229], defendant further contends that during the guilt phase summation, his counsel improperly drew adverse attention to defendant\u2019s assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination. Defendant also contends counsel inappropriately conceded guilt in his penalty phase summation.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">As we explain, defendant fails to demonstrate that counsel rendered constitutionally deficient performance, or that such performance was prejudicial to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>\u201cIn assessing claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, we consider whether counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms and whether the defendant suffered prejudice to a reasonable probability, that is, a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>(Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 694 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068]; <em>People v. Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 217 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839].) A reviewing court will indulge in a presumption that counsel\u2019s performance fell within the wide range of professional competence and that counsel\u2019s actions and inactions can be explained as a matter of sound trial strategy. Defendant thus bears the burden of establishing constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel. <em>(Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>at p. 687 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2064]; <em>In re Andrews </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1234, 1253 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 473, 52 P.3d 656].) If the record on appeal sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged, an appellate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be rejected unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or there simply could be no satisfactory explanation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza Tello </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 264, 266 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 437, 933 P.2d 1134].) Otherwise, the claim is more appropriately raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 266-267.)\u201d <em>(People v. Carter </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1166, 1211 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 553, 70 P.3d 981]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cunningham </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 926, 1003 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 291, 25 P.3d 519] [same]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitcham </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1027, 1059 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 230, 824 P.2d 1277] [\u201cThe decisions whether to waive opening statement and whether to put on witnesses are matters of trial tactics and strategy which a reviewing court generally may not second-guess.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Each one of counsel\u2019s decisions\u2014to forgo making an opening statement, present a defense, or offer more than a brief summation\u2014was tactical. In view of the strong evidence directly linking defendant to the charged murders, as well as the looming prospect of other capital trials in Alameda and San Diego Counties arising out of the deaths of Tok Kim and Janette Cullins, reasonably competent counsel could have determined to hear the prosecution\u2019s case prior to deciding whether to present a defense, and further could have determined that counsel\u2019s summation ought to be limited to inviting the jury to consider whether the prosecution actually had met its burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (See generally <em>People v. Mitcham, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 1027, 1059.) Indeed, in his summation, counsel alluded to the other criminal cases pending against defendant to suggest a reason why defendant did not take the stand, and emphasized the significance of the reasonable doubt instruction.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>Reasonably competent counsel could have determined that an extended summation would present the danger of focusing the jury\u2019s attention upon the heinous details of the crimes committed. Likewise, reasonably competent counsel also could have determined that in view of the strong evidence linking defendant to the murders, a guilty verdict was virtually a foregone conclusion, and that defendant\u2019s prospects of avoiding the death penalty would be improved if the defense refrained from placing its \u201ccredibility\u201d at risk by suggesting an implausible defense and instead focused upon challenging the testimony of certain witnesses who testified for the prosecution.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">Thus, reasonable defense counsel could have had a number of legitimate tactical reasons for refraining from making an opening statement, presenting witnesses in defense, or summarizing the case more extensively. The record before us does not fully reveal why counsel elected to proceed in the manner in which defendant now complains, and defendant\u2019s claim must fail for that reason. <em>(People v. Mitcham, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 1027, 1059.) To the extent the record on appeal does provide insight into the basis for counsel\u2019s decision not to present a defense at the guilt phase, counsel\u2019s strategy was a tactical one influenced by the relative strengths and weaknesses of a decision to present a defense, as well as by the pendency of the murder charges against defendant in other counties. (See <em>post, </em>at pp. 1192-1193.)<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">As noted, defendant also complains that his counsel \u201cdrew adverse attention to [defendant\u2019s] assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d At issue is counsel\u2019s argument to the jury, in which he hypothesized a number of reasons why a defendant might elect not testify, including the observation, \u201csome people tell the truth in this kind of setting, some people lie poorly.\u201d Defendant asserts that counsel\u2019s remark was an improper comment upon defendant\u2019s invocation of his constitutional right not to testify, in contravention of <em>Griffin v. California, supra, </em>380 U.S. 609. In response, the People respond that counsel\u2019s comment did not draw adverse attention to defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>In his guilt phase summation, defense counsel argued to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-5\">\u201cIn this decision your process is analytical; that is, have the crimes been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a moral certainty, and has it been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a moral certainty that [defendant] is the person who committed one or more of the acts charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-6\">\u201c[Defendant] <em>did not testify. </em>The court will instruct you that you may not consider this in any way, shape, or form. <em>You may not hold it against him. </em>However, experience tells us that people often have trouble with that concept. \u2018Well, if I were the defendant, I would testify. I would be up there screaming about it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-7\">\u201cLet me say a word about this: <em>There are many reasons that a defendant may or might not testify in a </em>case, speaking hypothetically.

California, supra, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615 [\u201cWe . . . hold that the Fifth Amendment. . . forbids either comment <em>by the prosecution </em>on the accused\u2019s silence or instructions <em>by the court </em>that such silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d (Italics added.)].) Defendant does not cite any authority in support of the broad reading of <em>Griffin </em>that he advances here\u2014to the contrary, the decisions upon which defendant relies are distinguishable, involving either a <em>prosecutor\u2019s </em>comment upon a defendant\u2019s silence <em>(People v.

Modesto </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 695, 711 [59 Cal.Rptr. 124, 427 P.2d 788]), or the trial of a case against multiple defendants in which the comment was made by counsel for a codefendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 157-161 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Haldeen </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 478, 481 [73 Cal.Rptr. 102]) or a codefendant sought to make such a comment <em>(People v. Jones </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 237, 243-244 [88 Cal.Rptr. 871]). The absence of authority on the point is not surprising, because if\u2014by merely reminding the jury at summation that the defendant did not <em>testify\u2014defense counsel </em>thereby would inject <em>Griffin </em>error into the proceedings, counsel would be placed in the awkward and untenable position of deciding whether to infringe upon his or her client\u2019s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in order to increase the likelihood that any conviction would be vulnerable to a grant of a new trial or reversal on appeal. <em>Griffin </em>does not stand for such a proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Moreover, even if we were to overlook the foregoing fundamental defect in defendant\u2019s position, no <em>Griffin </em>error appears. Viewing defense counsel\u2019s remarks in their proper context, it is clear that counsel was not suggesting that the jury draw any sort of adverse inference from defendant\u2019s silence. Nor did counsel\u2019s comments represent a \u201cconcession of [defendant\u2019s] guilt\u201d as defendant asserts. Rather, the passage quoted above reveals that counsel merely sought to explain to the jury that there are \u201cmany reasons\u201d why a defendant may not testify, including the <em>\u201chypothetical^\u201d </em>possibility that \u201c[s]ome people tell the truth in this kind of setting, some people lie poorly,\u201d and that the jury should not hold such silence against him. (Italics added.) Counsel\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s failure to testify were made \u201cso that you do not consider any of it and hold it against him,\u201d and manifestly did not constitute the type of comments that <em>Griffin </em>declared invalid. (See <em>Griffin v. California, supra, </em>380 U.S. 609, 613-615.)<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swanson </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 943 F.2d 1070 similarly is misplaced. <em>Swanson </em>held that defense counsel effectively abandoned and betrayed his client and aided the prosecution by arguing to the jury that there was no reasonable doubt his client was the person who committed the bank robbery charged in the indictment. By contrast, defense counsel\u2019s performance in the present case did not constitute abandonment. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>view of the strong prosecution evidence linking defendant to the charged offenses, as well as to the murder cases then pending against defendant in Alameda and San Diego Counties, defense counsel reasonably could believe that their Ghent\u2019s interests would best be served by treating the case \u201cas a penalty case,\u201d rather than by presenting a defense or relying upon defendant\u2019s testimony. Consistent with that strategy, at the close of the guilt phase counsel argued to the jury that a defendant might choose not to testify for any one or more of several reasons. Defense counsel\u2019s argument clearly was proper.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">Next, defendant offers myriad contentions\u2014most briefly stated and quite conclusory in nature\u2014in an effort to demonstrate he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. These contentions encompass a wide array of both general and specific claims, including defense counsel\u2019s failure to present a coherent defense and more vigorously challenge the following: the prosecution\u2019s witnesses by cross-examination, the identification evidence discovered during the Kim investigation, the evidence linking defendant to Mills\u2019s murder (by highlighting evidence that Mills habitually kept personal items in her vehicle), the special circumstances allegations, the purportedly confusing jury instructions submitted to the trial court by the prosecution, and the absence of pinpoint jury instructions. All of these contentions, however, amount to or relate to trial tactics and, as noted previously, must be rejected because the record before us does not reveal why defense counsel elected to proceed in the manner they did and of which defendant now complains. <em>(People v. Mitcham, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 1027, 1059.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">For the same reasons, we reject defendant\u2019s similar attack on the manner in which counsel represented defendant at the penalty phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">In sum, defendant fails to demonstrate on this record that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance at trial. To the contrary, the record indicates that counsel was placed in the extremely challenging position of representing a defendant clearly linked to the deaths of five women, four of whom died by strangulation within days of each other, as well as to the near fatality by strangulation of a sixth woman. The record before us does not suggest that counsel\u2019s performance in defending against the charges in the manner summarized above, in the face of the prosecution\u2019s strong case against their client, \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms,\u201d nor that \u201cdefendant suffered prejudice to a reasonable probability, that is, a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>outcome.\u201d (See <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694; <em>People v. Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 171, 217.) Defendant\u2019s related claims, that counsel committed <em>Griffin </em>error and inappropriately conceded defendant\u2019s guilt at the penalty phase, lack merit for the reasons previously discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">V. <em>Conflict of Interest Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">\n<em>The Conflict Between Defendant and His Trial Counsel, Defendant\u2019s Desire to Testify, and the Motion for New Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\">In a multi-pronged argument, defendant contends the trial court failed to inquire adequately into defendant\u2019s conflict with his attorneys regarding the presentation of a defense during the guilt phase of the proceedings (including defendant\u2019s desire to testify), failed to appoint new counsel once the conflict was disclosed, and improperly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. As we shall explain, none of defendant\u2019s contentions has merit. (See fn. 34, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">A. <em>Factual and Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">On July 5, 1989, at the conclusion of the People\u2019s case-in-chief at the guilt phase, defendant\u2019s trial counsel requested an in camera hearing pursuant to <em>People v. Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44]. At the hearing, conducted outside the presence of the jury and the prosecution, defense counsel informed the court that notwithstanding the circumstance that several defense witnesses were available to be called, counsel was prepared as part of the defense strategy to rest without putting on a defense, and that defendant \u201cemphatically disagrees with that strategy.\u201d The trial court agreed with defense counsel\u2019s reasoning that \u201cin these matters the decisions should be with the counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-10\">On July 10, 1989, prior to the presentation of the parties\u2019 closing arguments, defense counsel requested a second in camera hearing under the authority of <em>Marsden. </em>During a brief hearing, counsel informed the court that during the July 5 <em>Marsden </em>hearing, he had neglected to mention that \u201cby not putting on the witnesses, it also precluded the potential of [defendant\u2019s] testifying . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-11\">Later that same day, after the parties had argued their respective cases to the jury, defense counsel informed the court during an in-camera hearing that defendant \u201casked me to spread upon the record that he does not agree with the closing argument that counsel made, that he had asked me what it was, and that he was not informed of the type of argument, [f] And he certainly does not feel that it was adequate, and this just compounds the problem of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>lack of defense by the argument that counsel made, and he asked me to spread that upon the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">On July 17, 1989, the jury returned its guilt phase verdict. Later that same day, defense counsel requested a third <em>Marsden </em>hearing, informing the court that \u201c[defendant] continues to express disappointment [in] the manner in which to this point the case has been handled by counsel.\u201d Defense counsel continued: \u201c[Defendant requests the court] to appoint Mr. Rowan Klein . . . to . . . prepare and file a new trial motion or some motion pre-penalty phase. . . . ni] I will say that counsel opposes that motion. We have opposed other things before, and we would oppose that.\u201d The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, stating: \u201c[I]t is just not timely. The motion to appoint Mr. Klein, even the motion for new trial, isn\u2019t\u2014now is not the time to raise such a motion. Certainly, if at some time it looks like Mr. Klein\u2019s expertise would be of some assistance, I\u2019d entertain the motion; but now I don\u2019t think is the appropriate time to even consider it. That request is denied . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">On August 7, 1989, the jury returned its penalty phase verdict. Approximately four weeks later, on September 5, 1989, the court conducted a fourth <em>Marsden </em>hearing, wherein defense counsel informed the court of their client\u2019s request that they be relieved and replaced by Attorney Rowan Klein. The court granted the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">On January 9, 1990, defendant, assisted by his newly appointed attorney, filed a motion for new trial that asserted: (1) defendant erroneously was denied his constitutional rights to testify and to present a defense at the guilt phase of trial; (2) the trial court erroneously failed to afford defendant a hearing regarding his allegations that a conflict of interest existed between him and his attorneys; (3) defendant did not validly waive his constitutional right to testify; (4) the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of other alleged homicides; and (5) the trial court erroneously determined that defendant lacked standing to object to evidence that was seized from the vehicle in which he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, one of defendant\u2019s trial counsel, Howard Gillingham, testified that defendant \u201cwanted to put on at all times a full-blown defense ....[][] There was no question that [defendant], from early on, wanted to . . . contest the guilt at the special circumstance level. No question about that.\u201d Gillingham added: \u201cNear the end of the case-in-chief, ... we definitely knew that [defendant] did not agree with our approach.\u201d Gillingham explained the term, \u201cour approach\u201d to mean: \u201cOur approach was this case was a potential death case, and at some point I, along with [cocounsel] Miss Morrissey, made the decision that that\u2019s how it had to be litigated. ...[][] As an example, the review of the voir dire of the jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>was almost entirely death-focused, so right from the beginning ... the tentative decision was it was going to be tried as a penalty case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Gillingham affirmed that the position of both attorneys representing defendant was not to present a defense and that defendant would not testify at the guilt phase. When Gillingham conveyed this position to defendant near the conclusion of the guilt phase of the trial, defendant\u2019s response, according to Gillingham, was \u201c[ajgitated. Total disagreement, which I must say, has been vindicated. We sort of had that feeling. [][]... [\u2022][] [W]e knew that [defendant] wanted to contest the guilt phase. . . .\u201d Gillingham stated that defendant wanted to put on a defense and wanted to testify. On cross-examination, Gillingham acknowledged that he and defendant\u2019s cocounsel considered the decision not to present a defense at the guilt phase to have been tactical in nature, and that factors influencing counsel\u2019s decision included the strength and weaknesses of presenting a defense as well as the pending murder cases against defendant in Alameda and San Diego Counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">Defendant testified that shortly after Gillingham was appointed to represent him, \u201cI told him that I wanted to present a defense and that during the guilt phase I was more concerned about the guilt phase and I felt it was necessary for me to testify. [][]... [][] I questioned the way he was conducting voir dire. I wasn\u2019t happy with what he was doing, with what he was focusing on. [][] . . . [][] He wasn\u2019t really paying any attention to the guilt aspect. He was more concerned with the penalty phase. That is what I felt, anyway.\u201d According to defendant, on \u201cthe day before the prosecution rested,\u201d Gillingham \u201ctold me that he didn\u2019t plan to call any witnesses and that he wasn\u2019t going to put on a defense. [1] . . . [][] He also stated, well, if he didn\u2019t put on a defense and I am going to testify, I asked him about that, and he said if we are not going to put on a defense I was not going to be testifying.\u201d Defendant\u2019s reaction to counsel\u2019s strategy was, \u201cI was upset. I indicated pretty strongly that I wasn\u2019t happy with him. [f] . . . [][] I told him I wanted to call witnesses, put on a defense and testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">On cross-examination, defendant acknowledged that his trial attorneys had opined it was in defendant\u2019s best interest that defendant not testify: \u201cthey said it was a tactical decision.\u201d Defendant also acknowledged understanding that if he had testified at trial, he would have been subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor, including questions regarding the items taken from Tok Kim and Janette Cullins found in the car defendant was driving when apprehended, and that defendant would be asked to explain how those items came into his possession and that such answers \u201cmore than likely\u201d would have been communicated to the prosecutor\u2019s counterparts in Alameda and San Diego Counties and ultimately used against defendant in proceedings conducted in those counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>Defendant further testified on cross-examination that during the <em>Marsden </em>hearings, defense counsel accurately summarized the disagreements that existed between defendant and counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">During an in-camera portion of the hearing, defendant\u2019s new counsel recited the names of several persons whom he identified as having been potential defense witnesses but who were not called to testify at the guilt phase of the trial in light of prior trial counsel\u2019s decision not to put on a case-in-chief. Counsel thereafter argued extensively in favor of the motion for new trial, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">B. <em>The Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">1. <em>Defendant\u2019s Conflict with His Attorneys at Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">Defendant contends that he was denied his constitutional right to present a defense, including his right to testify, and that the trial court failed adequately to inquire as to the nature of the conflict. As we shall explain, we reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">Although \u201ca defendant in a capital trial [has] the right to have his only viable defense to the guilt or special circumstance charges presented at the initial stage of trial\u201d <em>(People v. Frierson </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 803, 815 [218 Cal.Rptr. 73, 705 P.2d 396 (plur. opn. of Kaus, J.)), and counsel lacks the authority to override the defendant\u2019s decision to present such a defense at the guilt phase of the trial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 843, 856 [258 Cal.Rptr. 184, 771 P.2d 1270]), in the present case the record does not establish that defendant had a viable defense. (See <em>id., </em>at p. 857 [\u201c[defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Frierson </em>... is misplaced, since the record does not show that any defense he wished to present had credible evidentiary support\u201d]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 671 [\u201cWhen the record reflects a tactical choice to curtail presentation of defense evidence or closing argument with the defendant\u2019s purported knowledge and acquiescence, it would amount to an untoward interference with the attorney-client relationship to suggest the trial court has an obligation to question the defendant as to his concurrence in counsel\u2019s trial strategy and to secure a waiver of any rights incidentally relinquished.\u201d].) Here, the record supports the People\u2019s position that defendant, \u201ca person with a sophisticated view of the criminal justice system from the inside,\u201d complained sufficiently during proceedings conducted in the trial court so as to create a colorable appellate issue, but not sufficiently to obligate the trial court to relieve his counsel.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>Accordingly, defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the opportunity to present a defense, and to \u201cconflict-free, effective representation,\u201d should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">With respect to defendant\u2019s asserted desire to testify at trial, we are guided by well settled rules: \u201c \u2018Every criminal defendant is privileged to testify in his own defense, or to refuse to do so.\u2019 <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1971) 401 U.S. 222, 225 [28 L.Ed.2d 1, 91 S.Ct. 643, 645].) The defendant\u2019s \u2018absolute right not to be called as a witness and not to testify\u2019 arises from the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution. <em>(Cramer </em>v. <em>Tyars </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 131, 137 [151 Cal.Rptr. 653, 588 P.2d 793].) Although tactical decisions at trial are generally counsel\u2019s responsibility, the decision whether to testify, a question of fundamental importance, is made by the defendant after consultation with counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McKenzie </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 616, 631, fn. 9 [194 Cal.Rptr. 462, 668 P.2d 769]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 883 F.2d 750, 755, vacated on other grounds (1991) 928 F.2d 1470; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Robles </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 205, 215 [85 Cal.Rptr. 166, 466 P.2d 710].)\u201d <em>(People v. Hines </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 997, 1032 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 938 P.2d 388].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">Moreover, we previously have rejected the position that a trial court must obtain an affirmative waiver on the record whenever a defendant fails to testify at trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alcala, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 742, 805-806 [\u201cWhen the record fails to disclose a timely and adequate demand to testify, \u2018a defendant may not await the outcome of the trial and then seek reversal based on his claim that despite expressing to counsel his desire to testify, he was deprived of that opportunity.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d]; see also <em>Florida v. Nixon </em>(2004) 543 U.S. 175 [160 L.Ed.2d 565, 125 S.Ct. 551, 561] [although defense counsel \u201cwas obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy\u201d to the defendant, counsel \u201cwas not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding [the defendant\u2019s] guilt\u201d]; <em>People v. Cox, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 618, 671 [\u201c \u2018[A] trial judge may safely assume that a defendant, who is ably represented and who does not testify[,] is merely exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and is abiding by his counsel\u2019s trial strategy; otherwise, the judge would have to conduct a law seminar prior to every criminal trial.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>Here, as noted above, defendant had ample opportunity during the course of three <em>Marsden </em>hearings to inform the court that he wished to testify, against the advice and over the objection of defense counsel, <em>even if defense counsel were permitted to decline to present any other defense witnesses who would support defendant\u2019s own testimony. </em>In view of defense counsel\u2019s repeated efforts during the <em>Marsden </em>hearings to inform the trial court of the conflicts that had arisen with his client, the trial court reasonably could have determined that had defendant told his counsel that defendant insisted upon testifying despite the absence of any other defense witnesses, his counsel would have conveyed that demand to the trial court. In view of the circumstance that counsel never told the trial court that defendant had made such a demand, on this record we may not assume that defendant in fact had insisted upon testifying even where no other defense witnesses would be presented to support his testimony. (Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Robles, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 205, 214-215 [a defendant has the right to testify in his or her own defense, over counsel\u2019s objection, when the defendant insists upon being permitted to testify].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Similarly, defendant\u2019s further contention that the trial court failed adequately to inquire into his conflict with trial counsel similarly is belied by the record before us. As noted above, the court conducted three <em>Marsden </em>hearings during the course of the trial for the purpose of permitting the airing of the conflict between defendant and his attorneys. During these hearings, defense counsel brought to the court\u2019s attention defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with counsel\u2019s trial strategy and tactics. Although at the hearing on the motion for new trial, defendant testified that counsel had not informed the court at the July 5th and July 10th <em>Marsden </em>hearings of all the witnesses whom defendant wanted to call, we are satisfied from the record before us that in the course of conducting three <em>Marsden </em>hearings, the trial court adequately inquired as to the issues raised by the defense, and that counsel fairly characterized the nature of the conflict for the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">2. <em>Failure to Appoint New Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">Defendant contends that in view of the conflict between him and his trial counsel, the trial court was obligated to appoint new counsel, and the court\u2019s failure to do so constitutes reversible error. As we have indicated in the immediately preceding section, however, the record does not indicate that any defense that defendant sought to present had \u201ccredible evidentiary support\u201d <em>(People v. Burton, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 843, 857; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1115, 1139 [282 Cal.Rptr. 465, 811 P.2d 757]; see also <em>People v. Frierson, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d 803, 815 [\u201ca defendant in a capital trial . . . retain[s] the right to have his only <em>viable </em>defense to the guilt or special circumstance charges presented at the initial stage of the trial\u201d (italics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>added)].) In view of that circumstance, the trial court was under no obligation to interrupt the trial proceedings to order the appointment of new counsel. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in not appointing new counsel upon learning of the conflict between defendant and his counsel regarding trial tactics and strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">3. <em>Motion for New Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">In view of defendant\u2019s foregoing contentions, but without additional argument beyond what he has cited in support thereof, defendant asserts the trial court committed reversible error in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. As we previously have explained, however, defendant fails to persuade us that his conflict with defense counsel over trial tactics and strategy (including the decision whether defendant should testify), the trial court\u2019s inquiries into that conflict, or the court\u2019s refusal to appoint new counsel prior to the conclusion of the penalty phase, either singularly or in the aggregate, deprived defendant of his state or federal constitutional rights. Having discerned no error in this regard, we conclude the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">VI. <em>Penalty Phase Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">A. <em>The Admissibility of Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Attack on Jennifer S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">Prior to the commencement of trial, defendant moved to exclude from the penalty phase the evidence of (1) defendant\u2019s prior conviction for the Ventura County sexual assault committed upon Jennifer S., and (2) the facts underlying that conviction. Defendant asserted he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during the Ventura County proceedings, that but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance he would have been acquitted in that case, and that therefore the Ventura County conviction and the facts underlying that conviction should be excluded from the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-10\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, the prosecution conceded that because the conviction had not occurred before the charged murders, it was not a \u201cprior\u201d conviction within the meaning of section 190.3, factor (c), and thus evidence <em>of the conviction itself was </em>not admissible under that provision. (See <em>People v. Balderas, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 144, 203.) Accordingly, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-11\">With regard to the direct evidence of defendant\u2019s attack upon Jennifer S. underlying the conviction, however, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. Accordingly, as described earlier <em>(ante, </em>at p. 1135), at the penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>phase the prosecution introduced the testimony of Jennifer S. and other evidence relating to defendant\u2019s brutal attack upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">On appeal, defendant renews his challenge to the trial court\u2019s ruling denying his motion to exclude the evidence underlying the Ventura County conviction. He argues that had he not been represented ineffectively in Ventura County, \u201che would have been acquitted of the charges there and the evidence would not have been admissible against him here,\u201d relying on the portion of section 190.3 providing that \u201cin no event shall evidence of prior criminal activity be admitted for an offense for which the defendant was prosecuted and acquitted.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheldon </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 935, 948-952 [258 Cal.Rptr. 242, 771 P.2d 1330].) Defendant points in particular to the Ventura County prosecutor\u2019s assertedly improper reference to defendant\u2019s failure to testify in that case (see <em>Griffin v. California, supra, </em>380 U.S. 609), implicitly asserting that had defense counsel in those proceedings more vigorously and effectively challenged the prosecutor\u2019s comments, the conviction would not have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s contention lacks merit. To begin with, in the prior proceeding both the trial court and the Court of Appeal explicitly rejected the claim that the prosecutor\u2019s comments undermined the validity of the conviction.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Furthermore, even if defendant nonetheless properly could challenge the prior conviction on this ground at this point (an issue we need not and do not decide), and even if the error upon which defendant relies had been prejudicial, the very most that defendant would have been entitled to would have been an order striking the prior conviction for purposes of this proceeding, <em>not </em>the entry of an acquittal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Horton, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at pp. 1126-1141.) Because, in any event, as already noted, evidence of the conviction itself was not admitted in the present case, defendant\u2019s challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in the Ventura proceeding or to defense counsel\u2019s allegedly ineffective assistance in that proceeding has no bearing upon the validity of the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence of the conduct underlying the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">With regard to that evidence, past cases make clear that the introduction of evidence of the Ventura assault was proper under section 190.3, factor (b), which authorizes the trier of fact at the penalty phase to consider \u201c[t]he presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use force or violence,\u201d whether such violent criminal conduct occurred prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>to or after the charged capital offense. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Avena </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 394, 426-428 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 916 P.2d 1000] [unlike prior felony convictions, evidence of violent conduct is admissible even if it occurred after the capital crime]; <em>People v. Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 676-677 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705] [possession of knife during burglary is sufficient to establish implied threat of force or violence]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 97 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127] [upholding constitutionality of section 190.3, factor (b)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Balderas, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 144, 204-205 [evidence of other criminality, if proved beyond a reasonable doubt, \u201cis simply one factor the penalty [phase] jury is to consider in deciding the appropriate punishment for the capital offense\u201d].) No error appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">B. <em>Adequacy of the Jury Instructions Given</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">Defendant raises a number of contentions related to the standard jury instructions given by the trial court. As we shall see, none of these contentions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">First, defendant contends the standard California instructions \u201cdo not adequately channel sentencing discretion by clear and objective standards that provide specific and detailed guidance for the sentencing authority, resulting in arbitrary and capricious sentencing decisions in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d We repeatedly have rejected similar claims. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 267-268 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710]; <em>People v. Osband, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 622, 702-703; <em>People v. Sanders </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 475, 563-564 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 905 P.2d 420].) We are not persuaded to reconsider those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">Second, defendant contends that on the second day of the jury\u2019s penalty deliberations, the trial court failed to respond adequately to two questions submitted by the jury that sought guidance as to the meaning of the terms \u201cextenuating,\u201d \u201cmitigating,\u201d and \u201caggravating\u201d circumstances, and that the failure of the trial court to make an adequate record of its response deprived defendant of his right to due process of law by denying him meaningful appellate review of the proceedings. The jury\u2019s questions, submitted in a pair of notes signed by the jury foreman, inquired: \u201c[1] We would like the legal definition of: extenuating[,] mitigating[, and] aggrevating [ric], [2] If a member of the jury finds that the aggravating circumstances [are] greater than the mitigating circumstances, may the juror vote for life? If a member of the jury finds that the mitigating circumstances [are] greater than the aggravating circumstances, may the juror vote for death?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>With regard to the jury\u2019s request for definitions, the record is silent as to how, if at all, the trial court responded.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> We find entirely speculative, however, defendant\u2019s assertion that the jury\u2019s request that the trial court elaborate on certain legal definitions \u201craises serious doubts about the reliability of the sentencing process conducted here.\u201d Even if we infer from the record that the trial court, either intentionally or inadvertently, ignored the jury\u2019s request for definitions of the terms \u201cextenuating,\u201d \u201cmitigating,\u201d and \u201caggravating\u201d circumstances, and did not discuss the matter with counsel, any error (see \u00a7 1138) was harmless, because those terms did not require further definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">As to the second note from the jury, the trial court answered \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno,\u201d respectively.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The jury thereafter continued its deliberations and, without submitting any further inquiries to the court, reached its verdict five days later. Although the better practice would have been for the court (or the parties) to ensure that the proceedings responsive to the jury\u2019s questions were reported, on the record before us we are unable to discern any error in the trial court\u2019s handling of the jury\u2019s inquiries.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">Finally, defendant contends that because he was personally absent from court when the jury submitted the foregoing inquiries (although his counsel was present), reversal of the death judgment is mandated. Although defendant did not waive his presence at any stage of the trial, his failure to demonstrate prejudice from his absence at this stage of the proceedings forecloses his claim. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 1229, 1358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">C. <em>Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">Defendant contends certain comments made by the prosecutor on eight distinct occasions during closing argument constituted prejudicial misconduct in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>\u201cImproper remarks by a prosecutor can \u2018 \u201cso infect[] the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Darden v. Wainwright </em>(1986) <em>477 </em>U.S. 168, 181 [106 S.Ct. 2464, 2471, 91 L.Ed.2d 144]; <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 637, 642 [40 L.Ed.2d 431, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1871]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 819 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673].) Under state law, a prosecutor who uses deceptive or reprehensible methods to persuade either the court or the jury has committed misconduct, even if such action does not render the trial fundamentally unfair. <em>(People v. Hill, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 819; <em>People </em>v. <em>Berryman </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1048, 1072 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 867, 864 P.2d 40] <em>(Berryman); People v. Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 447 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610] <em>(Price).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">\u201cNevertheless, as a general rule, to preserve a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, the defense must make a timely objection and request an admonition to cure any harm. The rule applies to capital cases. <em>(Berryman, supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1072 [rejecting defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct both for failure to object or request admonition at trial[,] and on the merits]; <em>Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 447, 460-462 [declining to address whether prosecutors committed misconduct[,] because defense did not object at trial]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Monteil </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 877, 914 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 705, 855 P.2d 1277] . . . [although trial counsel objected to prosecutor\u2019s remarks at trial, the failure to request admonition failed to preserve claim of prosecutorial misconduct on appeal].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 969-970 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Ochoa, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 353, 427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">With regard to seven of the eight instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct, defense counsel did not object when the comments were made. Further, the record before us fails to disclose a basis for applying any exception to the general rule requiring both an objection and a request for a curative instruction. (See <em>People v. Frye, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 970.) Accordingly, insofar as defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct relates to comments that were not objected to, the claim is barred. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">The instance in which an objection to the purported misconduct was interposed consisted of the prosecutor\u2019s arguing to the jury: \u201cWhat kind of a man does things like this? Well, the defense has tried to tell you what kind of a man, and they have not told you very much. They have had, as any criminal defendant facing the nature of these charges, a great deal of time to find people, to call them. Virtually unlimited money\u2014\u201d At that point, defense counsel objected. The trial court ruled: \u201cThe objection is sustained as [to] monetary [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>On appeal, defendant contends that although the trial court sustained his objection, defendant did not seek an admonition because to do so \u201cwould have been futile and not cured the prejudice.\u201d We disagree. Defendant\u2019s objection having been sustained, defendant bore the burden of seeking a curative admonition from the court. He refrained from doing so. Although defendant asserts here that such corrective action would have been pointless, his argument is unpersuasive. The prosecutor\u2019s reference to money was fragmentary and ambiguous. It appears likely that the reference had minimal potential effect upon the jurors. Whatever potential for harm arose from the prosecutor\u2019s remark was assuaged by the court\u2019s ruling and certainly was capable of elimination by means of an admonition, had one been requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s brief remark was fleeting and of marginal significance. The trial court\u2019s ruling alerted the jury to the inappropriate nature of the comment. In addition, the prosecutor\u2019s other comments\u2014about which defendant has waived his right to complain based upon his failure to object below\u2014came within the bounds of fair comment or at most constituted trivial improprieties. Under these circumstances, and in view of the nature of defendant\u2019s crimes, we conclude that any possible error was harmless, because defendant has failed to establish \u201ca reasonable likelihood the jury understood or applied the complained-of [statements] in an improper or erroneous manner.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frye, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 894, 970.)<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">D. <em>Motion for New Trial Based on Alleged Juror Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">Prior to sentencing, defendant moved for a new trial on various grounds that already have been discussed. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1195-1200.) At the hearing on the motion, defendant orally conveyed an additional ground upon which he urged the trial court to grant his motion, juror misconduct. Defense counsel contended: \u201cThe basis of the allegation is that there may have been perjury committed by [Juror K.] in the questionnaire she completed for the court and counsel. Specifically Question 61 which says: \u2018Have you ever been in a situation where you feared being hurt or being killed as a result of violence of any sort?\u2019 Answer was: \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d The defense argued that Juror K., who was 31 years of age when she completed the juror questionnaire, feared being raped, slept with a knife under her bed, and therefore committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>perjury when she responded in the negative to Question 61. The defense added that Juror K. communicated her concealed fear to Juror C-M.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">The prosecutor argued that the issue raised by Question 61 \u201cis directed toward a specific instance\u201d and did not apply to the \u201cgeneral fear\u201d on the part of Juror K. noted by defense counsel, adding that there was no evidence before the court of any misconduct. The trial court voiced some misgivings over the defense\u2019s claim, observing: \u201cI think we all fear violence [\u2014] [I]f we don\u2019t, then there is something wrong with us, I imagine,\u201d but permitted defense counsel to question Juror K., as set forth below.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>After hearing further argument from the parties, the trial court without comment denied the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that Juror K. \u201cintentionally concealed her direct experience in <em>voir dire </em>and her questionnaire responses,\u201d in contravention of defendant\u2019s rights under the United States and California Constitutions \u201cto [an] impartial and unbiased jury, due process, fair trial, present a defense, determination based on material facts and evidence at trial, and to death eligibility and reliable determinations of guilt and penalty.\u201d Defendant asserts that in view of the charges filed against defendant (including burglary, rape, and murder), Juror K.\u2019s testimony\u2014\u201crevealing fears of being victim to the very crimes at issue in [defendant\u2019s] case\u201d\u2014must be presumed to establish prejudicial concealment in the absence of affirmative and competent rebuttal, citing <em>In re Stankewitz </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 391, 402 [220 Cal.Rptr. 382, 708 P.2d 1260]; <em>People v. Pierce </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 199, 207 [155 Cal.Rptr. 657, 595 P.2d 91]; and <em>Dyer v. Calderon </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 151 F.3d 970, 973, fn. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">In response, the People contend that the court\u2019s ruling \u201cnecessarily rested on implied findings that Juror K. did not conceal the information, and/or that it was not material, and/or that any concealment was not deliberate, and/or that Juror K. had no actual bias against appellant.\u201d The People further contend that the present case is unlike those relied upon by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">Both parties refer to other answers provided by Juror K. on the questionnaire: Question 57 asked, \u201cHave you or anyone close to you been the victim of a crime, reported or unreported?\u201d to which Juror K. answered affirmatively, indicating that she been the victim of burglaries in San Jose, Pasadena, and West Lost Angeles. Question No. 71 asked, \u201cAny other comments?\u201d to which Juror K. responded, \u201c[E]veryone has feares [szc] + you don\u2019t know what will happen in the next minute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>In previous decisions, we have reviewed at some length the principles that guide our examination of a claim of juror misconduct during voir dire. (See, e.g., <em>In re Carpenter, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th 634, 646-660; <em>In re Hitchings </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 97, 110-123 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 74, 860 P.2d 466].) We need not reiterate here those extensive discussions; suffice it to say for present purposes that \u201cjuror misconduct involving the concealment of material information on voir dire raises the presumption of prejudice,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his presumption of prejudice \u2018 \u201cmay be rebutted by an affirmative evidentiary showing that prejudice does not exist or by a reviewing court\u2019s examination of the entire record to determine whether there is a reasonable probability of actual harm to the complaining party [resulting from the misconduct]. . . \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Hitchings, supra, </em>at p. 119; see also <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Calderon, supra, </em>151 F.3d 970, 973, fn. 2 [\u201cThe presence of a biased juror cannot be harmless; the error requires a new trial without a showing of actual prejudice.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">Applying the foregoing standards, it is clear that Juror K.\u2019s failure to answer Question 61 more completely did not constitute misconduct and, even if we were to assume that misconduct did occur, the presumption of prejudice was rebutted by the substance of her testimony at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for new trial. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that defendant is correct in asserting that Juror K.\u2019s answer to Question No. 61 was <em>inaccurate, </em>her statement at the hearing that \u201cI hadn\u2019t and haven\u2019t thought about that incident at all for the last 12 years\u201d diminished if not dispelled its potential significance.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">Further, even if Juror K. in fact had concealed the information, the circumstances that the incident was \u201cvery brief\u2019 and occurred more than a decade earlier, and that Juror K. realized because she had been burglarized that \u201ceveryone has feares [,?zc],\u201d established that the omitted information was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>immaterial to her overall qualifications or suitability to serve as a juror. Those qualifications clearly were established in the course of counsel\u2019s voir dire.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Moreover, even if we were to assume Juror K.\u2019s answer to Question No. 61 was inaccurate, evasive, and material, the circumstance that as a teenager living alone for the first time, Juror K. was \u201cparanoid for a short period of someone breaking in,\u201d leading her to keep a kitchen knife in close proximity overnight, does not provide any basis for concluding that she harbored undisclosed juror <em>bias. </em>Accordingly, the presumption of prejudice was rebutted <footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">We further note defendant\u2019s misplaced reliance upon our decisions in <em>In re </em>Stankewitz, <em>supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 391, and <em>People v. Pierce, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 199, and the United States Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Calderon, supra, </em>151 F.3d 970. In <em>Stankewitz, </em>the petitioner successfully sought a writ of habeas corpus following his conviction of first degree murder, alleging he was denied a fair trial because one of the jurors, a police officer, had violated the court\u2019s instructions and \u201c \u2018consulted\u2019 his own outside experience as a police officer on a question of law\u201d as to when a robbery takes place. (40 Cal.3d at p. 399.) We characterized the juror\u2019s determination as being \u201ctotally wrong,\u201d and concluded that because the juror \u201cstated it again and again to his fellow jurors [he] thus committed overt misconduct.\u201d (40 Cal.3d at pp. 399-400, fin. omitted.) In <em>Pierce, </em>the defendant obtained a reversal of his conviction for second degree murder upon the ground of juror misconduct, because one of the jurors had ignored the court\u2019s repeated admonitions not to discuss the case with third persons by discussing the proceedings during the course of the trial with a police officer acquaintance who had testified as a prosecution witness in the case. (24 Cal.3d at p. 209.) In <em>Dyer, </em>in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>court reversed a first degree murder conviction, a juror answered \u201cno\u201d to questions asking whether a relative or close friend ever had been a victim of any type of crime or had been accused of any offense other than a traffic offense, notwithstanding the circumstance that the juror\u2019s brother had been murdered and her estranged husband had been arrested for rape. None of these decisions, involving egregious transgressions in derogation of the jurors\u2019 oaths, is remotely apposite to the misconduct alleged to have occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">\u201c \u2018The determination of a motion for a new trial rests so completely within the court\u2019s discretion that its action will not be disturbed unless a manifest and unmistakable abuse of discretion clearly appears.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Williams, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 1268, 1318 [rejecting a claim of juror misconduct based upon allegations that during a capital trial a juror consumed tranquilizers and engaged in a discussion regarding \u201c \u2018the religious aspects of the penalty phase\u2019 \u201d].) Our review of the relevant portions of the record described above leads us to conclude that the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based upon alleged juror misconduct. We agree with that court\u2019s implied finding that Juror K.\u2019s fear of an intruder more than a decade earlier was highly unlikely to have influenced her role as a juror. Defendant\u2019s assertions to the contrary lack support and thus are unpersuasive. No abuse of discretion by the trial court occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">E. <em>Section 190.4, Subdivision (e) Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">Approximately five months after the jury returned its penalty phase verdicts, the court considered defendant\u2019s automatic motion for modification of the death sentence. At a hearing, the court stated that it had reviewed the evidence introduced at trial, found the jury\u2019s verdicts as to guilt and its findings as to special circumstances to be supported by the weight of the evidence, considered the factors in aggravation and mitigation as set forth in section 190.3, and concluded that \u201cthe aggravating circumstances substantially outweigh[ed] the mitigating circumstances.\u201d The court on that basis denied defendant\u2019s application for modification of the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">On appeal, defendant contends the trial court improperly denied the motion, because (1) prior to ruling on the motion, the court considered other-crimes evidence introduced at the guilt phase of trial (notably the deaths of Tok Kim and Janette Cullins), and (2) following the hearing on the motion to modify but prior to imposing the death judgment, the court considered victim-impact statements. Defendant\u2019s position is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">\u201c \u2018In ruling on a verdict-modification application, the trial judge is required by section 190.4[, subdivision] (e) to \u201cmake an independent determination whether imposition of the death penalty upon the defendant is proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>in light of the relevant evidence and the applicable law.\u201d [Citations.] That is to say, he must determine whether the jury\u2019s decision that death is appropriate under all the circumstances is adequately supported. [Citation.] And he must make that determination independently, i.e., in accordance with the weight he himself believes the evidence deserves.\u2019 <em>(People v. Marshall </em>[(1990)] 50 Cal.3d [907,] 942 [269 Cal.Rptr. 269, 790 P.2d 676].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">\u201cOn appeal, we subject a ruling on such an application to independent review: the decision resolves a mixed question of law and fact; a determination of this kind is generally examined de novo [citation]. Of course, when we conduct such scrutiny, we simply review the trial court\u2019s determination after independently considering the record; we do not make a de novo determination of penalty.\u201d <em>(People v. Mickey, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 612, 703-704; see also <em>People v. Jones </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 119, 191 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 386, 931 P.2d 960] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">Defendant contends initially that the trial court improperly considered the other-crimes evidence involving the deaths of Tok Kim and Janette Cullins in a light different from that considered by the jury\u2014that is, the jury may have considered the evidence in the context of establishing intent, identity, or common plan, whereas the trial court at the section 190.4, subdivision (e) hearing considered the Kim and Cullins evidence in aggravation. As the People point out, however, the trial court was entitled to consider the Kim and Cullins evidence as a factor in aggravation under the category of criminal activity involving the use of force or violence. (\u00a7 190.3, factor (b).) In any event, any error in this regard clearly would have been nonprejudicial, because the court\u2019s comments in extensively reviewing the list of aggravating and mitigating evidence and finding that the circumstances in aggravation \u201csubstantially outweigh[ed]\u201d the circumstances in mitigation make clear that there is no reasonable possibility that such an error would have affected the trial court\u2019s denial of the application for modification of the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">With regard to defendant\u2019s claim pertaining to improper reliance by the trial court upon victim-impact evidence, we perceive no error. The court heard and denied defendant\u2019s application for modification of the death sentence on January 11, 1990. No victim-impact statements were made in connection with that motion. Although the record contains 12 letters (either undated or bearing 1989 dates) written by family and friends of the victims Knoll, Mills, and Guthrie generally expressing extreme anger, loss, and sadness, the record does not indicate that the court considered any of these statements prior to denying the application for modification of defendant\u2019s death sentence.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> On January 30, 1990, immediately prior to the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>imposition of the judgment of death, it heard similar statements made by Jillette Mills\u2019s mother, Sue Ann Mills, Bonnie Guthrie\u2019s sister, Jennifer Bollman, and Susan Knoll\u2019s sister, Sandra Pender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">Defendant assigns error to the court\u2019s consideration of the statements submitted by the victims\u2019 family members and friends. His contention fails for two reasons. First, he failed to object to the statements in question and therefore forfeited appellate review of this claim. <em>(People v. Ramos </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1133, 1183 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 892, 938 P.2d 950]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 959, 1013 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 839 P.2d 984].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">Second, defendant\u2019s claim fails on the merits. We previously have rejected similar contentions that <em>Booth v. Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 107 S.Ct. 2529], prohibiting victim impact statements, extends to proceedings under section 190.4, subdivision (e). <em>(People v. Ramos, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1184; <em>People </em>v. <em>Benson, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 754, 812; cf. <em>Payne v. Tennessee </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 808, 830 and fn. 2 [115 L.Ed.2d 720, 111 S.Ct. 2597], overruling <em>Booth v. Maryland, supra, </em>482 U.S. 496.) Nevertheless, we also have observed that \u201cthe scope of a modification motion does not encompass statements of the victim\u2019s relatives or any other evidence not presented to the jury during the penalty phase trial. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Ramos, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1184.) Here, however, the record is clear that in denying defendant\u2019s application to modify the death sentence, the trial court relied solely upon the evidence presented to the jury and was guided by the factors enumerated in section 190.3; as indicated above, the three oral statements now challenged by defendant were made approximately three weeks after the court denied the application, and nothing in the record indicates that the trial court considered the letters at any time. Thus, the record before us provides no basis for concluding that the trial court in ruling on the application improperly considered any matter that was not placed before the jury.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">F. <em>Cumulative Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">Defendant contends that the cumulative effect of the asserted errors committed at his trial led to a miscarriage of justice, requiring reversal of the guilt and penalty phase judgments. Having determined that defendant\u2019s trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>was nearly devoid of any error, and that to the extent any error was committed it was clearly harmless, we conclude that defendant\u2019s contention as to cumulative error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">G. <em>The Delay Between Imposition of Sentence and Execution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">Defendant was sentenced to death on January 30, 1990, and counsel was appointed to pursue his automatic appeal more than four years later, on March 18, 1994. Defendant contends that the passage of this period of time, in addition to the approximately 11 years that have elapsed since then (during which time defendant has pursued his automatic appeal and claims on habeas corpus in state and federal court), are \u201clargely the result of inadequate resources provided by the state to review death verdicts, and the complexity of review mandated by past abuses.\u201d Defendant contends that in view of these asserted circumstances, the judicial process compels him \u201cto endure the uncertainty and ever-present tension on death row for such an extended period of time constituting] cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment . . . .\u201d (See <em>Lackey </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 1045 [131 L.Ed.2d 304, 115 S.Ct. 1421] (mem. opn. on denial of cert, by Stevens, J.) [observing that neither retribution nor deterrence is served when prisoners serve 17 years under a sentence of death].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">Defendant\u2019s contention resembles a claim that we declined to address in <em>People v. Barnett </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 1044, 1182-1183 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 121, 954 P.2d 384]. As we explained in <em>Barnett, </em>\u201c[b]ecause defendant\u2019s claim is dependent upon evidence and matters not reflected in the record on appeal, we decline to consider it at this juncture.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 1183.) For similar reasons, we decline to address defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">H. <em>Use of Lethal Injection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">Defendant contends the use of lethal injection as a method of execution constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and on that basis is unconstitutional. We previously have rejected the identical claim (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Samayoa, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 795, 864; <em>People v. Holt </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 619, 702 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213]), and defendant fails to present any reason for us to reconsider our prior decisions. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">The judgment is affirmed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AFh\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied October 26, 2005.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1170-8\">In addition to its personalized license plate, Jillette Mills\u2019s white Datsun was easily identifiable by a black, front-fender car cover (or \u201cbra\u201d) emblazoned with the vehicle model \u201c280 ZX,\u201d black engine cover vents, dual-colored pinstripes, a tinted glass \u201cT-top\u201d roof, black \u201csports slats\u201d that covered much of the rear window, a black rear stabilizer, and dual-colored wheel rims shod with Goodyear Eagle GT tires.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1173-9\">In a separate proceeding conducted in San Diego County, defendant was charged with and found guilty of the first degree murder of Janette Cullins; the jury in that case also found true several special circumstances and returned a verdict imposing a sentence of death, and the San Diego court thereafter imposed a judgment of death.

As we have explained <em>ante, </em>because defendant failed to object the trial court did not act to cure any purported harm through admonition.
