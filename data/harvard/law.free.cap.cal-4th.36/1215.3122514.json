J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjX\">Following the guilt phase of the trial, a San Diego County jury found defendant Dean Phillip Carter guilty of the murder of Janette Cullins. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury also found defendant guilty of the burglary of Cullins\u2019s inhabited residence (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460) and the robbery of Cullins (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 213.5), finding that during the course of the burglary and the robbery, defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7). The jury found true the special circumstances that the murder was committed while lying in wait, in the course of a robbery, and in the course of a burglary, and that defendant previously had been convicted of the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie. (\u00a7 190.2, former subd. (a)(2), (15), (17)(i), (vii), as amended by Prop. 115, \u00a7 10, as approved by voters, Primary Elec. (June 5, 1990).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>The jury further found defendant guilty of forcible rape (\u00a7 261) and forcible oral copulation (\u00a7 288, subd. (c)) arising out of his attack on Barbara S. on March 25, 1984 (approximately 18 days prior to the murder of Janette Cullins). The jury found defendant guilty of burglary of an inhabited residence (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460) and robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 213.5) in connection with the attack on Barbara S. As to each of the crimes committed against Barbara S., the jury found that defendant had used a deadly weapon, a knife. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022, subd. (b), 12022.3, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury returned a verdict of death. The court sentenced defendant to death for the murder of Janette Cullins, in addition to imposing a consecutive sentence of 21 years 8 months for the crimes committed against Barbara S. This appeal is automatic. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11; \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">We set aside the special circumstance of lying in wait, but otherwise affirm the judgment in its entirety as to both guilt and penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">I. <em>GUILT PHASE EVIDENCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"AvL\">A. <em>The Prosecution\u2019s Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-G\">1. <em>Overview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">The prosecution\u2019s theory of the case was that defendant, spumed by a number of women who had rejected his clumsy, unwanted advances, embarked upon a crime spree that spanned approximately three weeks in the early spring of 1984, and consisted of sexually assaulting, robbing, and fatally strangling various women whom he previously had befriended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">On March 24, 1984, defendant, who was then 28 years of age, telephoned an acquaintance of approximately one month, Cathleen Tiner, who declined his invitation to \u201crun off to Mexico and get married.\u201d That evening, he telephoned another acquaintance, Polly Haisha, then 18 years of age, informing her that he would be arriving in San Diego the next day. Haisha, who had declined defendant\u2019s invitation to \u201cquit school and come sail to France,\u201d and had cancelled several dates with defendant, asked him never to call her again. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>Like Tiner and Haisha, Janette Cullins in the weeks leading up to her death also had spumed defendant\u2019s advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">On March 25, 1984, Susan Loyland, with whom defendant had maintained a sexual relationship, traveled to Mexico without defendant, notwithstanding the circumstance that she previously had made plans to travel with him that day. In the evening, defendant broke into Loyland\u2019s San Diego residence, raped at knifepoint Barbara S., Loyland\u2019s housemate, and also stole money from Loyland\u2019s tip cache. Loyland never heard from defendant again.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">On March 27, 1984, defendant, having befriended Jennifer S. in the preceding few days, raped her at knifepoint in her Ventura County apartment. He strangled her to the point at which she lost consciousness, and stole her tip money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">Defendant thereafter traveled north to the San Francisco Bay Area, and on April 1, 1984, encountered Tok Kim at a bar located in Lafayette. They commenced a relationship over the next several days, during which period several witnesses observed them together. Kim\u2019s decomposed body was discovered on April 13, 1984. Although the cause of her death could not be determined, strangulation could not be excluded as the cause. Kim\u2019s vehicle and various personal items were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">Kim\u2019s vehicle was discovered several hundred miles away in Los Angeles County, parked in front of the Culver City apartment in which the bodies of Susan Knoll and Jillette Mills were found stacked in a closed bedroom closet on April 12, 1984. Mills had been sexually assaulted, and each victim had died from asphyxia caused by strangulation. Knoll\u2019s vehicle was discovered one block from the apartment. Mills\u2019s distinctive Datsun 280 ZX automobile, as well as personal items belonging to both victims, were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-9\">On April 12, 1984, the body of Bonnie Guthrie was discovered on the bedroom floor of her Culver City apartment. She had been sexually assaulted and died from asphyxia caused by strangulation. Personal items were missing from her apartment. Later that same day, defendant made an unexpected visit to Cathleen Tiner at her residence in San Diego; Tiner and Janette Cullins had met defendant at a San Diego bar in February 1984. Tiner told defendant she was expecting her date for the evening momentarily and could not see him. Defendant departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-10\">On April 14, 1984, the body of Janette Cullins was found lying in the closed bedroom closet of her San Diego apartment. The cause of her death was asphyxia caused by strangulation. Near the front door, the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>wood chips on the floor indicated that someone had broken into her apartment. Cullins had died approximately one to two days earlier. A neighbor had observed that the preceding evening, Jillette Mills\u2019s vehicle had been parked in front of Cullins\u2019s residence and had departed suddenly and loudly. Cullins\u2019s vehicle subsequently was discovered several blocks away. A video-camera at a bank automated teller machine on April 13 recorded a man resembling defendant retrieving money from Cullins\u2019s bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">On April 17, 1984, an Arizona highway patrol officer observed Mills\u2019s vehicle traveling erratically near Ashfork, Arizona. The officer effected a traffic stop and arrested defendant. Inside the vehicle, investigators recovered numerous personal items Unking defendant to each one of the deceased women.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">In order to explain certain factual differences in the crime scenes at the various residences where the deceased women were found, the prosecution theorized that the reason defendant did not conceal the bodies of Tok Kim or Bonnie Guthrie was that neither victim had a roommate who might discover the body. With respect to the killings of Susan Knoll and Jillette Mills, the prosecution theorized that defendant first murdered Knoll, placing her body in the closet, moved her vehicle to make it appear she was not at home, and then waited until Jillette Mills arrived and murdered her. The prosecution further theorized when defendant broke into Janette Cullins\u2019s apartment, murdered her, concealed her body in the closet, and then moved her vehicle, defendant similarly may have intended to kill two women. Cullins\u2019s new roommate, Cheri Phinney, whom defendant had met earlier that day, was not yet in possession of an apartment key, however, and did not return to the apartment that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-7\">2. <em>The Rape of Barbara S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">The prosecution presented the testimony of a number of witnesses to establish that on March 25, 1984, defendant raped Barbara S. at the residence she shared with Susan Loyland in the marina area of Bay Park, located in San Diego.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>Barbara S. testified that on that date, she performed yard work at her residence for most of the day, ate dinner, then fell asleep while watching <em>60 Minutes </em>on television in her bedroom. She awakened to find a man grabbing her and dragging her from her bed. The man held at her throat a \u201csturdy knife\u201d with a blade about six inches in length. The man repeatedly demanded money and held her while he rummaged through her purse. When he sought more money, Barbara S. directed him to the dresser, where she had $200. That money was missing after the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">The man then pushed Barbara S. to her knees and repeatedly told her not to look at him. While he still held the knife, the man forced her to orally copulate him. Barbara S. complied because she was frightened. She recalled that notwithstanding her compliance, the man\u2019s penis was \u201csemi-flaccid\u201d and \u201cnothing to write home about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">Shortly thereafter, the man bent Barbara S. over the bed facedown and raped her; the man never attained a full erection, and the incident lasted \u201cmaybe a very short time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">The man then \u201chog-tied\u201d Barbara S.\u2019s hands and feet behind her with her pantyhose, and she heard her car keys being removed from her purse. The man departed, telling Barbara S. that \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t sleep with the TV on.\u201d Thereafter, she heard \u201c[a] motor sound, and he screeched off.\u201d She partially freed herself by hobbling to the dishwasher, extracting a knife with her teeth, and using the knife to cut the ligature that bound her feet and hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-8\">Helen McGirr, a neighbor who was a retired registered nurse, testified that she heard Barbara S.\u2019s cries for help and directed her husband to contact the police, who arrived at the scene approximately 10 minutes later. McGirr found Barbara S. \u201claying in kind of a curled-up position unclothed at the front door right in the doorway\u201d and noticed that Barbara S.\u2019s hands were \u201cdark blue, almost black\u201d from having been tied up. McGirr was certain Barbara S. was not under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">San Diego Police Department Detective Ken Creese testified that in his interview with Barbara S. shortly after the attack, the victim appeared \u201cto be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>upset, shaken, somewhat traumatized,\u201d and was unable to identify her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">Susan Loyland testified that she rented a room in Barbara S.\u2019s residence at the time of the attack, and had maintained a sexual relationship with defendant in the weeks immediately prior to the attack. Loyland had discussed traveling with defendant to Rosarito Beach, Mexico, on March 25, 1984, but left without him that morning when she was unable to locate him. Loyland suspected defendant might have been Barbara S.\u2019s assailant, and so informed the police on the night of the attack.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">Based upon information supplied by Loyland, police investigators placed defendant\u2019s photograph in a photo lineup. Barbara S. was unable to identify the perpetrator from the lineup, but told one detective that the voice of her attacker sounded similar to that of defendant\u2019s. She testified that during the attack, she thought she recognized her assailant\u2019s voice but could not identify it, and after seeing news reports of defendant\u2019s arrest several weeks later, \u201cit came together like a ton of bricks\u201d that the man\u2019s voice was defendant\u2019s. At trial, Barbara S. identified defendant as the man who had attacked her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">Following the attack, Barbara S. noticed her kitchen and bedroom telephone lines had been cut, and that a window screen in Loyland\u2019s room was \u201cbent out at a 45-degree angle.\u201d Loyland determined that some tip money was missing from a concealed location near the window. She testified: \u201cnobody would look in the place that I had it. . . you\u2019d have to know that the coins were in there.\u201d Defendant occasionally had accompanied her home after work, and had seen her conceal her tip money, usually \u201cbetween 10 and 20 bucks a night in coins.\u201d Loyland never saw or heard from defendant after March 25, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">Barbara S.\u2019s next-door neighbor, Janell Barksdale, testified that approximately 6:00 p.m. on March 25, she observed a man whom she did not recognize walk toward Barbara S.\u2019s residence. The man had dark hair, a moustache, and an olive complexion, and \u201cwas attractive . . . nice to look at.\u201d Upon learning of the attack upon Barbara S., Barksdale told investigators of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>having seen a man in the area that evening. Three years later, upon seeing a photograph of defendant in the newspaper, Barksdale contacted investigators to inform them that she recognized the person in the newspaper photograph as the man she had observed. At trial, she identified defendant as the man she saw that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">3. <em>The Rape of Jennifer S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">Over defendant\u2019s objection, the prosecution commenced its case by presenting, under Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b), substantially the same evidence pertaining to the March 29, 1984 attack on Jennifer S. in Ventura, as is summarized in <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at page 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">4. <em>The Death of Tok Kim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-8\">The prosecution introduced evidence pertaining to the Alameda County death of Tok Kim in early April 1984. With two exceptions, the evidence was substantially similar to that summarized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pages 1128-1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">The first exception involved the testimony of Eddis Jeffrey, who did not testify in defendant\u2019s Los Angles County murder trial. Jeffrey, an apartment maintenance worker at the building in which Kim resided, testified that he saw defendant and Kim arrive at her apartment building on the afternoon of April 9 and leave shortly thereafter in the same vehicle. That was the last time Jeffrey saw Kim. Jeffrey acknowledged that prior to trial, he had identified in a police photo lineup prior to trial an individual other than defendant as the person he had seen with Kim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">The second exception involved the testimony of Dr. Byron Blackboume, a forensic pathologist employed by the San Diego County Medical Examiner. Over defendant\u2019s objection, Dr. Blackboume stated that after reviewing the Kim autopsy and crime scene photographs, he believed that her death possibly could have been caused by asphyxiation due to ligature strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-11\">5. <em>The Fatal Strangulations of Susan Knoll and Jillette Mills</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-12\">The prosecution introduced evidence pertaining to the fatal strangulations on or about April 10-11, 1984, of roommates Susan Knoll and Jillette Mills in Los Angeles County. The evidence was substantially similar to that summarized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pages 1130-1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>6. <em>The Fatal Strangulation of Bonnie Guthrie</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\">The prosecution introduced evidence pertaining to the fatal strangulation on or about April 11, 1984, of Bonnie Guthrie in Los Angeles County. The evidence was substantially similar to that summarized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pages 1131-1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">7. <em>The Fatal Strangulation of Janette Cullins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">The prosecution presented evidence, summarized below, establishing that defendant and Janette Cullins had been casually acquainted during the several weeks preceding Cullins\u2019s death on April 12 or 13, 1984, and that defendant fatally strangled her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">a. <em>Cullins\u2019s acquaintance with defendant in early 1984</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">On Saturday evening, February 25, 1984, Janette Cullins and a friend, Cathleen Tiner, went to Jose Murphy\u2019s, a Pacific Beach nightclub that was featuring Cullins\u2019s and Tiner\u2019s favorite band. The band stopped playing at 1:30 a.m. (February 26), and the women walked across the street to the Old Pacific Beach Caf\u00e9. They were hungry and knew the caf\u00e9 served breakfast until 3:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">Cathleen Tiner testified: \u201cWhen we got into the restaurant there was still a real good crowd, so we decided, let\u2019s have a drink, let\u2019s go over to the bar and see if we can get a drink before we go over to breakfast. . . . fi[] [However, t]here was a very large crowd there. We were getting bumped around a lot. We could not get to the bar at all. We were far away from it. . . . fi[] Mr. Carter came up to us and, at that time, we didn\u2019t know his name, and . . . said my friend\u2019s at the bar, would you like me to order some drinks for you? fit] We said yes, and he said what would you like? fi[] We said two Harvey Wallbangers. [f] And so he yelled at this friend who was standing over to the bar, [\u2018]hey Antoine [whose last name was Masure], two Harvey Wallbangers.[\u2019] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-10\">Tiner added: \u201cVery shortly thereafter, [defendant\u2019s] friend came through the crowd with our drinks and with their drinks. I offered to pay for the drinks. I kept trying to pay for them. fi[] [Masure] kept saying no, no, no. [fl ... I kept insisting on paying for the drinks. He wouldn\u2019t take the money. . . . fi[] [Masure] just took our drinks and walked over to a table and sat them down on a table, and we ended up sitting down with them. . . . [f] We talked briefly. Dean asked Janette\u2014I heard Dean ask Janette for her phone number.\u201d Tiner testified that Cullins eventually gave defendant her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>telephone number, and that defendant asked the two women whether they had roommates or lived alone. Tiner gave Masure a card with her own telephone number on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Tiner further testified that defendant and Masure wanted the women to accompany them \u201csomeplace else,\u201d but the men did not provide a further description. The women declined: \u201cWell, we said the right way for you to do it would be to call us and ask us out rather than try for us to go out with you now. [f] Antoine said we\u2019ll go into the twin phone booths and you stand in the other and we\u2019ll call you. Then everything will be okay. [][] We didn\u2019t agree with that idea, so Dean Carter said how about dinner. . . . [f] I said when. He said Antoine\u2019s a great cook, how about dinner. I said when, and they said we\u2019ll call you. . . . [][] We left shortly thereafter. I would say we were there less than an hour. ... [1] Mr. Carter said we\u2019ll walk you to your car because we don\u2019t want anyone to get you, or attack you in the parking lot. So they walked us to my car and we drove off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">A few days later, defendant and Masure invited the women to have dinner with them on March 2, 1984, on their \u201cyacht\u201d named the Sea Quest, which was docked near Harbor Drive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The four had dinner on the vessel without incident, with the exception that Cullins\u2019s vehicle did not start immediately when the women departed that evening. Defendant and Masure, together with a third party who arrived with cables, assisted the women in \u201cjump-starting\u201d the vehicle. On the way home, Tiner and Cullins discussed the evening. Tiner related Masure\u2019s observation that he thought Cullins had not been ready to leave and wanted to stay with defendant. Cullins replied: \u201cNo way. I had no intentions of spending the night with him, and if he ever calls me again, I will tell him that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">Two days later, on March 4, defendant telephoned Tiner, informing her that he had spent the day sightseeing with Cullins, and wanted to know whether Tiner \u201cwanted to go out and do something with him that night.\u201d Tiner declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">Defendant telephoned Tiner again on March 24, 1984, indicating that he wanted to see Cullins \u201cone time before he went back to Alaska.\u201d Tiner falsely informed defendant that she was unaware of Cullins\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cHe said to me, why don\u2019t I come down there and we can run off to Mexico and get married.\u201d Tiner declined that offer, as well as defendant\u2019s invitation to go out with him on the following evening.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>Tiner then telephoned Cullins to inform her that defendant was looking for her. Cullins replied: \u201cI thought I\u2019d gotten rid of him. Now I won\u2019t be able to answer the phone.\u201d Tiner further testified: \u201c[Cullins] was angry. She was upset about it that he was calling again.\u201d Nancy McEachem, Cullins\u2019s former roommate, testified that when she had shared an apartment with Cullins and the telephone rang, Cullins on multiple occasions had informed her: \u201cIf that\u2019s Dean, I don\u2019t want to talk to him.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">b. <em>The events leading to the discovery of Janette Cullins\u2019s body</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Janette Cullins resided in apartment B, located at 3972 Kendall Street in the Pacific Beach neighborhood of San Diego. In search of a new roommate, Cullins placed an advertisement in The Reader, a local free newspaper. Cheri Phinney responded to the ad and began moving into the apartment during the second week of April 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">On Thursday, April 12, 1984, Phinney and Cullins spent the day at the apartment. Phinney painted her new bedroom and bathroom, while Cullins kept her company, vacuumed the carpet, and performed other housekeeping chores. Approximately midaftemoon, Cullins responded to a knock at her door. The visitor was defendant, and Cullins returned to Phinney, asking her \u201cto come through the living room so that he [defendant] would be aware that there was someone else in the house.\u201d Defendant stayed for approximately one hour, asking questions such as how long she planned to continue painting. Shortly thereafter Cullins informed Phinney that defendant had departed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-8\">At approximately 6:30 p.m., Cullins left the apartment, informing Phinney that Cullins was planning to attend the symphony with her friend, Cathleen Tiner.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, Phinney answered a telephone call and wrote down a message on a piece of paper. The paper was whole when Phinney wrote the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>message, and she left blank the top portion of the paper. When Phinney left the apartment at approximately 7:15 p.m., the drapes and blinds were open. As she locked the door upon leaving, Phinney did not notice any damage to the front door frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">Cathleen Tiner testified that after she and Cullins attended the symphony, the two women went to a restaurant and then returned to Tiner\u2019s apartment, where they watched television until 11:00 p.m. Cullins informed Tiner that defendant was back in town. After watching television with Tiner, Cullins left to return to her own apartment. Tiner never saw Cullins alive again.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">Leanne Johnson, who resided across the street from Cullins\u2019s apartment, testified that at approximately 11:15 p.m. on April 12, she heard the engine of a vehicle running for about 10 minutes. Johnson peered through her drapes and observed a white vehicle that she identified as matching the white Datsun 280 ZX that defendant was driving when later arrested. Johnson testified: \u201cIt was probably 11:30 just before the news went off that I heard the car move out of the parking space and make a U-turn and it almost hit a pickup truck at the house next to mine. [][] It just went up the street. It didn\u2019t stop at the stop sign .... H]... I mean whoever was in the car sort of pulled out fast, and it was a big loud noise and I did look out and I did see him make a U-tum and almost hit the pickup truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">Throughout the next day, Cheri Phinney attempted to contact Cullins without success. Nancy McEachem testified that on April 13, she was unsuccessful several times in attempting to contact Cullins by telephone. Cullins\u2019s telephone answering machine, which usually was switched on, was not activated. Concerned, McEachem drove to Cullins\u2019s apartment around midday. When she arrived, \u201canother car pulled up on the opposite side of the street from me, and a man got out of the car and asked me if Jan was home. ...[][] I said no, it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s home, her car is not here, I assume she\u2019s not. This person had identified himself as Dean. . . . [f] He was driving a white [Datsun] Z with a black bra on the front of the car.\u201d McEachem identified the individual who spoke with her as defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">McEachem had moved out of the apartment on April 6, but had retained a key in order to return on the morning of April 14 for the purpose of conducting a yard sale. McEachem entered the apartment (alone), stayed less than 15 minutes, left a message for Cullins, and departed. McEachem testified: \u201cThe apartment was closed up. Everything was pretty dark. The blinds were drawn, were closed very tightly, and all the windows, especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>the window in the kitchen, which is a place we never close them in [sz'c].\u201d McEachem explained that the living room drapes also were drawn, an unusual circumstance, adding that when she and Cullins shared the apartment, they never adjusted the window coverings to their completely closed position. Although McEachem entered Cullins\u2019s bedroom, the closet doors were shut, and she did not look inside the closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Shortly after 6:00 p.m. on the evening of April 13, as Cathleen Tiner was preparing to attend a San Diego Padres baseball game with a friend, defendant arrived unexpectedly at Tiner\u2019s front door, \u201cbetter groomed than I had ever seen him before.\u201d He wore a beige sweater with a brown windowpane check.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Tiner testified: \u201cI was very surprised. . . . [][] I said Dean, I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t invite you in. I have company coming over. You should have called. . . . [H And he said [\u2018][W]ell, I was here in the neighborhood, I just thought I\u2019d stop by.[\u2019] [. . .] He said, [\u2018]Did Jan [Cullins] tell you I was in town?[\u2019] [(0 And I said yes, she did. [][] And he said, [\u2018]I told her not to tell you that.[\u2019] [f] I said, well, she did. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t invite you in. You have to leave. I have . . . company coming over. I have to go. [][] And then [defendant] put his chin up like this, and said, [\u2018]Do you know she stood me up today?[\u2019] [f] I said, no, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Tiner shut the door, unsuccessfully attempted to reach Cullins by telephone, and then attended the baseball game.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">On the morning of April 14, Cheri Phinney again attempted to contact Cullins, and Nancy McEachem answered the telephone. McEachem informed Phinney that Cullins was not at home. Phinney drove to the apartment, arriving about 8:30 a.m. McEachem was there with her fianc\u00e9. The drapes and curtains were closed. Phinney noticed wood chips on the floor by the front door.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">Because Phinney and McEachem had expected Cullins to be at the apartment, they began to search for a note from her, or a document with her license plate number in the event they needed that information to ascertain from local authorities whether Cullins had been involved in a traffic accident. In the course of searching for this information, McEachem opened a bedroom closet door and discovered the partially clothed body of Janette Cullins, lying on some boxes. McEachem\u2019s fianc\u00e9 contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>c. <em>The police investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">Richard Thwing, a San Diego police officer assigned to the police department\u2019s homicide division, testified that the front door of Janette Cullins\u2019s apartment displayed signs that a forced entry had been made. Cullins\u2019s body was lying in the bedroom closet. Her neck bore what appeared to be a ligature mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">Adolph Romero III testified that on the morning of April 14, 1984, as he was walking to work near the Point Loma piers by North Harbor Drive in San Diego, he retrieved a wallet he noticed in some bushes near the sidewalk. The wallet contained a driver\u2019s license and other identification items and credit cards in the name of Janette Cullins. Cullins\u2019s father later identified the wallet as having belonged to her. Because Romero had an important appointment that morning, he gave the wallet to a friend, Robert Pack, who gave the wallet to the police. During the same week that Romero found the wallet, he also had seen parked within one block of that location a white Datsun 280 ZX.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">Dannis Nuckolls, who worked as a San Diego Police Department evidence technician in April 1984, testified that in conducting an inventory of the contents of Cullins\u2019s wallet, he found a driver\u2019s license and various identification cards, all in the name of Bonnie Guthrie. On April 14, 1984, San Diego police officers recovered Guthrie\u2019s purse from the same North Harbor Drive area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">Hormez Guard, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on Janette Cullins at 9:00 a.m. on April 15, 1984. Dr. Guard testified that the cause of Cullins\u2019s death was asphyxia due to ligature strangulation, adding that he found evidence the victim had suffered \u201ca sharply cutting incised wound\u201d inflicted \u201cafter death, or . . . when the person was dying,\u201d consistent with the use of a sharp knife. There was no evidence of sexual assault. On cross-examination, Dr. Guard stated that the time of Cullins\u2019s death was between 24 and 48 hours prior to the time that he performed the autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">George Cullins, Janette\u2019s father, testified that he had purchased a Triumph TR 7 for Janette in 1980 or 1981. At the time of purchase, the vehicle bore a personalized license plate that read \u201cSHYLAS,\u201d which she ultimately replaced.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">Susan Seminoff, a friend of Cullins\u2019s, testified that in December 1980 she and Janette went together to open checking accounts at San Diego Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>Bank, which subsequently changed its name to Great American Bank (and later, after Cullins\u2019s murder, to Wells Fargo Bank). Seminoff recalled that in selecting an automatic teller machine (ATM) card password, Cullins picked the word from her license plate, \u201cSHYLAS.\u201d The word \u201cSHYLAS\u201d was written on the back of a tom Alpha Beta Supermarket receipt recovered by investigators from the \u201cMembers Only\u201d brand jacket found in the Datsun 280 ZX that defendant was driving when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">Sandra Homewood, an examiner of questioned documents employed by the San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office, testified that in comparing exemplars of defendant\u2019s handwriting with entries found in his address book, Homewood discerned several \u201cunique and conspicuous characteristics\u201d and made a \u201cpositive identification\u201d that defendant had written in his address book the names Susan Loyland (rape victim Barbara S.\u2019s tenant, see, <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1223-1226), Janette Cullins, Cathleen Tiner, and Susan Knoll. With regard to the slip of paper that read \u201cSHYLAS,\u201d Homewood was unable to eliminate defendant or identify him as the writer. In comparing the note to an exemplar of Janette Cullins\u2019s handwriting, Homewood indicated there existed \u201cvery strong indications\u201d that Cullins had written it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">Great American Bank records revealed that on April 13, 1984, a withdrawal from Janette Cullins\u2019s account in the amount of $60.00 (leaving an account balance of $4.06) was made from an ATM located at the bank\u2019s Point Loma branch. A four-minute videotape of the transaction was introduced into evidence and shown to the jury. The tape depicted a man wearing a sweater (identified as having been knitted by Bonnie Guthrie) and a black jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">8. <em>Defendant\u2019s Arrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">The prosecution introduced evidence pertaining to defendant\u2019s April 17, 1984 arrest in Arizona that was substantially similar to that summarized in <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pages 1133-1134, with one noteworthy addition, as follows. In the trial conducted in the present case, the prosecution introduced the testimony of Jerald McKeand, a deputy sheriff employed by Yavapai County, Arizona, who recalled that at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest, defendant wore cutoff jeans, a gray sweatshirt, tennis shoes, and green socks. Defendant also wore a gold necklace that had belonged to Tok Kim and a workout shirt that had belonged to Jillette Mills.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">9. <em>The Contents of the Datsun 280 ZX</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">The prosecution introduced evidence pertaining to the contents of the Datsun 280 ZX that defendant was driving when he was stopped and arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>in Arizona. The evidence was substantially similar to that summarized in <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pages 1134-1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">B. <em>The Defense Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">Outside the presence of the jury, the trial court informed defendant that he had the right either to testify or not to testify. Defendant replied that he was not going to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">Unlike defendant\u2019s trial in Los Angeles County, in which the defense did not present any evidence at the guilt phase (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 1135), the defense at this trial introduced the testimony of witnesses pertaining to the Los Angles County murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie, the San Diego County murder of Janette Cullins, and the San Diego rape of Barbara S.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-8\">1. <em>The Los Angeles County Murders</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-9\">The defense introduced the testimony of Ronald C. Tulio, an employee of the United States Postal Service, who had been Susan Knoll\u2019s boyfriend and also was acquainted with Knoll\u2019s roommate, Jillette Mills, and their friend, Bonnie Guthrie. Tulio testified that he and Knoll had lived together from July 1983 to February 1984, after which Knoll moved in with Mills. In the immediate aftermath of the Los Angeles County murders, members of the Culver City Police Department interviewed Tulio.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-10\">On cross-examination, Tulio acknowledged that his breakup with Knoll had been an emotional one, and that on the afternoon of April 12, 1984, Culver City Police Department officers investigating the Los Angeles County murders arrested him and detained him at the Culver City jail for four days. On the night of April 12, 1984, when Janette Cullins was murdered in San Diego County, Tulio was in police custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-11\">When asked on cross-examination what defense counsel had told Tulio he (Tulio) might testify about, Tulio recalled counsel stating: \u201cHe [defense counsel] said all he wanted to do was have me say that obviously the Culver City Police Department made a mistake in arresting me, saying that San Diego [Police Department] could make the same mistake arresting the wrong guy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-12\">Culver City Police Officer Craig Bloor testified that at the time of the Los Angeles County murders, he resided in an apartment building adjacent to the building in which the bodies of Susan Knoll and Jillette Mills were discovered. April 10, 1984, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Officer Bloor noticed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>someone he did not recognize walking from the next-door apartments to the street. Upon learning several days later of the double homicide that had occurred in the adjacent building, Officer Bloor identified a photograph of Ronald Tulio as depicting the man he saw on April 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">On cross-examination, however, Officer Bloor testified that when he observed Tulio at the police station, he recognized some similarities to the person he saw on April 10 but also noticed several differences, and concluded Tulio was not the man he had seen on that date. Instead, Officer Bloor identified defendant in court as the man he noticed on April 10, adding that the man was wearing a \u201c \u2018Members Only\u2019 style cut jacket that was popular then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">On cross-examination, Officer Bloor acknowledged having spoken with defendant on April 10: \u201cI asked him what he was doing in the area, and he said he was looking for a friend\u2019s house . ... HD ... HD Then he says[,] \u2018[Wjhy, do I look suspicious[?]\u2019 [f] I said yeah, you could. Then he said[, \u2018jit\u2019s good that you check.fj Then he left.\u201d Defendant held \u201csome kind of blue folder or something like that\u201d that Officer Bloor recalled was \u201cvery similar\u201d to a blue folder the prosecution previously had introduced into evidence. The folder, which contained a photograph of defendant, was among the items that investigators recovered from Jillette Mills\u2019s Datsun 280 ZX.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">2. <em>The Murder of Janette Cullins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">The defense presented the testimony of Michael T. Palermo, who in 1984 was employed as a San Diego Police Department latent print examiner. Palermo testified that as part of the Cullins murder investigation, he examined latent fingerprint impressions recovered from Cullins\u2019s apartment, but none matched defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">The defense also presented the testimony of William W. Loznycky, Jr., who in 1984 worked as a San Diego Police Department criminalist. Loznycky testified that neither fibers found on the hand of Janette Cullins, nor head or pubic hairs recovered from a blanket and sheets found in her residence, could be matched to defendant or his clothing. On cross-examination, Loznycky testified that he also examined an \u201cO-type\u201d bloodstain taken from the crime scene that did not match the victim\u2019s blood, but could have been left by defendant, whom Loznycky characterized as having an \u201cO\u201d blood type.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">Finally, the defense presented the testimony of Lauren Carville, who resided in the apartment one floor below the one occupied by Cullins. Carville testified that she and Cullins had sunbathed in their shared backyard during the afternoon of April 12, during which time an acquaintance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>Cullins visited with Cullins for about 15 minutes. Carville saw Cullins depart in her vehicle that evening at approximately 7:00 p.m., after which Carville went out. Returning at approximately midnight, Carville noticed that Cullins\u2019s vehicle was not parked in front of their apartment building, where Cullins normally parked her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">3. <em>The Rape of Barbara S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">The defense presented the testimony of San Diego Police Department Officer Gene Loucks, who interviewed Barbara S. shortly after she was attacked. Officer Loucks testified that Barbara S. was unable to recall several physical attributes of her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-7\">II. <em>PENALTY PHASE EVIDENCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aob\">A. <em>The Prosecution\u2019s Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-8\">The prosecution introduced into evidence the abstracts of judgment from defendant\u2019s prior burglary convictions in Oregon and Alaska and, over defendant\u2019s objection, his prior rape conviction in Ventura County. (See <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pp. 1135-1136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-9\">The prosecution also introduced evidence that a deputy sheriff discovered in defendant\u2019s San Diego County jail cell a homemade knife or \u201cshank\u201d wrapped in masking tape, as well as a 22-inch pipe. San Diego Police Department Sergeant Carlos Chacon testified over defendant\u2019s objection that weapons such as those seized from defendant\u2019s cell could have been smuggled into the jail in parts and assembled, and that the shank found in defendant\u2019s cell was designed as an offensive weapon to inflict serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-10\">B. <em>The Defense Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">The defense introduced extensive evidence pertaining to defendant\u2019s difficult childhood and upbringing in Alaska (defendant is part Eskimo), as well as evidence that he was an accomplished and cooperative television cameraman and a good father and friend. The evidence was substantially similar to that summarized in <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pages 1136\u20141137.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">I. <em>PRETRIAL ISSUES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">A. <em>Double Jeopardy and Multiple Punishment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">Several weeks prior to the commencement of jury selection, defendant filed motions to dismiss the proceedings against him on the grounds of double jeopardy, collateral estoppel, and the statutory prohibition against multiple punishments. In the alternative, defendant moved \u201cto sever the trial of the issues raised by his pleas of once in jeopardy and former conviction . . . from the trial of his guilt or innocence of the crimes charged in the information.\u201d Defendant asserted that he previously had been placed in jeopardy in the Los Angeles County proceedings, and that during those proceedings the jury heard and considered both evidence and argument suggesting defendant was responsible for the murder of Janette Cullins. Having been sentenced to death in those proceedings, defendant sought, on state and federal constitutional grounds, the dismissal of the San Diego County charge that he murdered Cullins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motions, stating, among its reasons: \u201cA legal analysis based on the statutes, case law and facts of this case as presented to the court for purposes of these motions shows there is no legal basis for a finding by the court of once in jeopardy. ...[][] The double jeopardy argument is meritless under the law and this fact situation, and therefore, the motion to dismiss would be denied, [f] . . . [f] This motion is so meritless that in all honesty I don\u2019t see how anyone could call it incompetence of counsel not to enter the double jeopardy plea at the arraignment. [][] . I\u2019m not going to allow the plea. I can\u2019t do that because in my discretion there\u2019s no legal basis for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-10\">On appeal, defendant reiterates the contentions he made in the trial court. As we shall explain, defendant\u2019s position is procedurally barred by his own successful motion in the Los Angeles County proceedings to dismiss the Cullins murder charge. (See <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pp. 1158-1159.) Even were we to ignore that procedural flaw, the trial court correctly determined that neither double jeopardy, nor collateral estoppel, nor section 654 considerations barred the San Diego proceedings, and therefore properly rejected defendant\u2019s motions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>1. <em>The Procedural Bar Based upon Defendant\u2019s Successful Motion in the Los Angeles Proceedings to Sever the San Diego Charges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">As we have explained in the companion appeal, <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at page 1158, \u201cthe complaint against defendant charged all of the crimes allegedly committed in Alameda, Los Angeles, and San Diego Counties in a single pleading. Defendant subsequently moved to dismiss the charges arising from the Alameda and San Diego crimes committed against Tok Kim and Janette Cullins, respectively. The prosecution did not oppose the motion, instead informing defendant that if the motion were granted, the crimes committed in Alameda and San Diego Counties would form the basis for a refiling of the charges against defendant in those counties.\u201d The trial court in Los Angeles County thereafter granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges involving the crimes committed in Alameda and San Diego Counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">Because defendant previously sought and obtained in Los Angeles County the dismissal of the San Diego charges, knowing that the dismissal would compel the San Diego County prosecutor to file separate charges in that county for the crimes defendant was alleged to have committed in that jurisdiction, defendant\u2019s contention that proceeding with the San Diego County prosecution was fundamentally unfair or violative of his rights under the state and federal Constitutions is not well taken or worthy of extensive discussion. In view of the evidence linking defendant to the murder of Janette Cullins, San Diego County was entitled to prosecute defendant for that crime (as well as other crimes alleged to have been committed by defendant within that jurisdiction). (\u00a7\u00a7 777, 790;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>People v. Carpenter, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 1038-1039; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 8, 15 [130 Cal.Rptr. 129, 549 P.2d 1225].) Having moved in Los Angeles County for dismissal of the charges involving crimes committed in San Diego, notwithstanding the prosecutor\u2019s representation that the motion, if granted, would effect a <em>severance </em>of the charges against defendant and a refiling in the respective counties in which the crimes occurred, defendant cannot now complain that severance led to a second murder prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>2. <em>Defendant\u2019s Jeopardy, Section 654, and Collateral Estoppel Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">Even if we were to assume that these claims are not barred, we would conclude that defendant\u2019s contentions based upon double jeopardy principles, section 654, and collateral estoppel, lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">a. <em>Double jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">The state and federal Constitutions declare that no person shall twice be placed in jeopardy for the same offense. (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15.) In Los Angeles County, defendant was placed in jeopardy for the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie. In those proceedings, he was neither charged with, nor convicted of, any crimes pertaining to the murder of Janette Cullins or the rape of Barbara S. Accordingly, jeopardy never attached to defendant in the Los Angeles County proceedings for the crimes committed in San Diego County. (See <em>People v. Carpenter, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1039, fn. 4. [\u201c \u2018 \u201c[Tjhe murder of two persons, even by the same act, constitutes two offenses, for each of which a separate prosecution will lie, and ... a conviction or acquittal in one case does not bar a prosecution in the other.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d]; <em>People v. Medina </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 694, 765 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 165, 906 P.2d 2] [rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention that double jeopardy principles should apply where the defendant already once had defended against the charges at the penalty phase of the earlier trial]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watts </em>(1997) 519 U.S. 148, 154-155 [136 L.Ed.2d 554, 117 S.Ct. 633].) Accordingly, defendant\u2019s double jeopardy argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">b. <em>Section 654</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-9\">Defendant\u2019s assertion that section 654 barred the San Diego County prosecutor from proceeding against him is deficient for reasons analogous to those noted immediately above. At the time of defendant\u2019s trial, section 654 prescribed: \u201cAn act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of this code may be punished under either of such provisions, but in no case can it be punished under more than one; an <em>acquittal </em>or <em>conviction and sentence </em>under either one bars a prosecution for the same act or omission under any other.\u201d (Stats. 1977, ch. 165, \u00a7 11, p. 644, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-10\">Because defendant was neither acquitted nor convicted of the murder of Janette Cullins or the rape of Barbara S. in Los Angeles County, section 654 did not bar the San Diego County proceedings instituted against him for those crimes. <em>(People v. Carpenter, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 1038-1039 [rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>the defendant\u2019s contention that section 654 barred separate prosecutions in Marin County and Santa Cruz County for the crimes committed in each county]; see also <em>People v. Bradford, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at pp. 13-17 [where criminal behavior began in one county and, following a police chase, terminated in another, the crimes committed in each county properly were tried separately in the respective counties].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">c. <em>Collateral estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">Defendant contends the prosecutor was barred by collateral estoppel principles from trying defendant in San Diego County for the murder of Janette Cullins and the rape of Barbara S. We observe: \u201cTraditionally, collateral estoppel has been found to bar relitigation of an issue decided at a previous proceeding \u2018if (1) the issue necessarily decided at the previous [proceeding] is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated; (2) the previous [proceeding] resulted in a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the prior [proceeding].\u2019 [f] It is implicit in this three-prong test that only issues actually litigated in the initial action may be precluded from the second proceeding under the collateral estoppel doctrine. [Citation.] An issue is actually litigated \u2018[w]hen [it] is <em>properly raised, </em>by the pleadings or otherwise, and is submitted for determination, and is <em>determined . . </em>. .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 468, 484 [186 Cal.Rptr. 77, 651 P.2d 321], fn. omitted; see also <em>People v. Taylor </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 686, 695 [117 Cal.Rptr. 70, 527 P.2d 622] [the doctrine\u2019s purposes are: \u201c(1) to promote judicial economy by minimizing repetitive litigation; (2) to prevent inconsistent judgments which undermine the integrity of the judicial system; and (3) to provide repose by preventing a person from being harassed by vexatious litigation.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">Here, the circumstance that the jury in the Los Angeles County proceedings never was asked to determine, and did not determine, defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the murder of Janette Cullins and the rape of Barbara S. defeats defendant\u2019s claim of collateral estoppel. Nor would any of the purposes of the doctrine noted above be served by its application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-8\">B. <em>Motion to Disqualify the Trial Court Judge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-9\">On November 5, 1990, several months prior to the commencement of trial, defendant filed a motion pursuant to Code of Civil procedure section 170.1, subdivision (a)(6), to disqualify San Diego County Superior Court Judge Melinda J. Lasater from presiding at his trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>The basis for defendant\u2019s motion was that Judge Lasater had maintained a \u201cworking relationship and a friendship with the prosecutor in this case [San Diego County Deputy District Attorney James Pippin] such that a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to be impartial.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">Judge Lasater thereafter conducted a hearing in which she reviewed her contacts with Mr. Pippin that spanned a period of approximately 16 years, noting the dates when they had worked together and general information pertaining to their social contacts. During the hearing, Judge Lasater recalled, among other things, that she and Mr. Pippin had worked together in the San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office until she left that office in 1987, that her family and his had gone camping with other families, that her husband had purchased Mr. Pippin\u2019s son\u2019s dirt bike approximately 10 years prior to the hearing, that there had been sporadic social contacts at parties, that she had performed the wedding of Mr. Pippin\u2019s daughter at his daughter\u2019s request in August 1990, that his daughter gave her a necklace similar to necklaces given to the bridesmaids, and that Mr. Pippin\u2019s daughter had \u201chouse sat\u201d for her approximately one year earlier, for which his daughter had been paid a \u201cminimal amount.\u201d Judge Lasater attached a copy of the hearing transcript to her answer.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>On November 30, 1990, Judge Allen J. Freckle, selected by agreement of the parties, conducted a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion. Relying on <em>United Farm Workers of America v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 97, 104 [216 Cal.Rptr. 4], and <em>Leland Stanford Junior University v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 403, 408 [219 Cal.Rptr. 40], the court observed that \u201c[t]he standard [for disqualification set forth in Code of Civil Procedure, section 170.1, subdivision (a)(6)] is fundamentally an objective one.\u201d Reviewing the nature of the professional and social contacts between Judge Lasater and Mr. Pippin, the court viewed \u201cas weightless, particularly given the substantial passage of time, the assertion that a reasonable person would doubt Judge Lasater\u2019s impartiality because of her past association with Mr. Pippin .... [f] ... [f] This court is further satisfied that any, albeit unreasonable doubt, concerning Judge Lasater\u2019s impartiality in this case would be erased by a reasonable person\u2019s being apprised of Judge Lasater\u2019s excellent reputation for integrity and fierce independence. [][] This court, therefore, finds that a reasonable person, aware of all the facts, would not reasonably entertain a doubt that Judge Lasater will be able to be impartial in this case.\u201d The court thereafter denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">Defendant did not seek review in the Court of Appeal by way of a petition for writ of mandate, the procedure required by Code of Civil Procedure section 170.3, subdivision (d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">In his appeal to this court, defendant contends that the superior court below erred in denying his motion to disqualify Judge Lasater. Acknowledging his failure to comply with the writ review requirement set forth in Code of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>Procedure section 170.3, subdivision (d), defendant nevertheless asserts as a \u201cstructural defect\u201d reviewable on appeal the \u201cdeni[al of] due process of law in violation of [the] state and federal Constitutions because the judge who presided over his case and who rendered the sentence of death was not impartial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">We find no merit in defendant\u2019s position. His failure to comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure, section 170.3, subdivision (d), precludes him from challenging the denial of his statutory disqualification motion on appeal from the judgment rendered in the trial court. <em>(People v. Brown </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 322, 333 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 710, 862 P.2d 710] <em>(Brown).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">Even if we were to overlook the procedural deficiency inherent in defendant\u2019s challenge to the denial of his disqualification motion, we would find no merit in the assertion, implicit in defendant\u2019s argument, that Judge Lasater had a responsibility to recuse herself in view of her prior professional and casual social relationship with Mr. Pippin. Defendant provides no statutory or case law authority in support of that position, and we are aware of none. Because virtually all judges are drawn from the ranks of the legal profession, such prior relationships are neither unusual nor dispositive. (See <em>United Farm Workers of America v. Superior Court, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.3d 97, 100 [\u201c[T]he proper performance of judicial duties does not require a judge to withdraw from society and live an ascetic, antiseptic and socially sterile life. Judicial responsibility does not require shrinking every time an advocate asserts the objective and fair judge <em>appears </em>to be biased. The duty of a judge to sit where not disqualified is equally as strong as the duty not to sit when disqualified.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">In our view, Judge Freckle correctly determined that on the facts presented in the pleadings below, a reasonable person would not entertain a doubt as to Judge Lasater\u2019s impartiality. (See <em>United Farm Workers of America v. Superior Court, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.3d at pp. 105-106; cf. <em>Sincavage v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 224, 230-231 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 615] [disqualification proper where, 13 years earlier, judge had been a prosecutor representing the People in other proceedings against the defendant].) Accordingly, disqualification was not mandated in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">Defendant asserts a nonstatutory due process claim based upon evidence of bias adduced at trial. We need not decide whether defendant has forfeited this claim by failing to file a writ petition on this ground (see generally <em>Brown, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 336), because his claim lacks merit. Specifically, defendant cites Judge Lasater\u2019s contempt order, issued on the eve of the penalty phase (June 3, 1991), against defense counsel <em>and </em>defendant for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>failure to provide penalty phase discovery to the prosecution, as well as Judge Lasater\u2019s observation, made in considering defendant\u2019s application to modify the death sentence rendered by the jury, that defendant \u201cfrankly had no intention of testifying in Los Angeles.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">Neither of the actions cited by defendant, extracted from a trial court record in excess of 9,000 pages, remotely approaches the threshold required to establish the existence of judicial bias. (See <em>People v. Clark </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 41, 143 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 833 P.2d 561] [\u201cThe question for us to decide is whether the judge \u2018officiously and unnecessarily usurp[ed] the duties of the prosecutor . . . and in so doing createfd] the impression that he [was] allying himself with the prosecution . . . .\u2019\u201d].) Moreover, our independent review of the entire record reveals a trial court judge who was scrupulously fair and courteous to each side, and whose rulings exhibited neither bias nor prejudice. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">C. <em>Motion to Exclude Evidence of Wood Chips</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">At the preliminary hearing, Cheri Phinney testified that in April 1984, she decided to move into the apartment occupied by Janette Cullins. On April 12, Phinney was at the apartment, painting her new bedroom and bathroom. Phinney recalled that the carpet area in the living room near the front door had been vacuumed. At the time Phinney departed from the apartment, between 7:00 and 7:15 p.m., she did not notice any damage to the doorjamb surrounding the front door or any wood chips on the carpet beneath the door latch. When Phinney returned to the apartment on the morning of April 14, shortly before the discovery of Janette Cullins\u2019s body, she noticed wood chips on the floor, as depicted in a photograph introduced by the prosecution. On cross-examination, Phinney acknowledged that on April 14, she did not mention the wood chips to the investigating detective and she also failed to mention the wood chips during her testimony at defendant\u2019s trial in Los Angeles County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">San Diego Police Department Homicide Detective James Shively testified that as part of his investigation of the crime scene on April 14, he directed that the wood chips be photographed. On cross-examination, Detective Shively acknowledged he did not mention the wood chips in the crime scene report that he prepared. He further acknowledged that under his direction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>evidence technician Dannis Nuckolls removed a portion of the doorjamb. Detective Shively did not recall whether he directed anyone to collect the wood chips.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">San Diego Police Department Sergeant Douglas Naliboff testified that when he responded to the crime scene on the morning of April 14, the doorjamb \u201cappeared that it had been pried open. There were wood chips separated from the doorjamb itself and laying on the floor.\u201d He identified the prosecution\u2019s photographs as depicting the doorjamb and wood chips that he observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">Defendant moved to exclude all evidence related to the condition of the front door of Janette Cullins\u2019s apartment, including testimony regarding the doorjamb and the wood chips, and photographs of the wood chips. The basis for his motion was that the prosecution assertedly had \u201cfailed to preserve the wood debris, and carelessly removed the door and doorjamb removed and photographed [szc].\u201d Defendant asserted that the prosecution\u2019s failure to preserve the \u201cpotentially exculpatory wood chips\u201d violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to a fair trial and due process of law, and that pursuant to Evidence Code section 352 the testimonial or photographic evidence was not admissible in the absence of the wood chips themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, finding: \u201cDefendant\u2019s . . . motion to exclude ... the wood chips evidence and doorjam[b] is denied. There is an insufficient showing of bad faith by law enforcement as shown in <em>[Arizona </em>v.] <em>Youngblood </em>[(1988) 488 U.S. 51 [102 L.Ed.2d 281, 109 S.Ct. 333]]. In addition, the probative value of the evidence more than substantially outweighs any prejudice of the failure to preserve the wood chips. [][] The record should reflect that law enforcement took pictures of the evidence from several angles and preserved the door jam[b], itself. They apparently did not actually preserve the wood chips which are reflected in the pictures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to exclude this evidence. He argues that because the charge of burglary, as well as the burglary and lying-in-wait special circumstances, each depended upon the prosecution establishing that defendant unlawfully entered Cullins\u2019s apartment, \u201cthe government's] fail[ure] to preserve evidence which was material and potential [ly] exculpatory\u201d deprived him of a myriad of state and federal constitutional rights. Defendant further asserts that the photographs of the wood chips could have been taken <em>after </em>the doorjamb was removed, and thus the failure to preserve the wood chips deprived defendant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>opportunity to demonstrate that the presence of the chips \u201cmay have been the result of Nuckolls\u2019s post-crime removal of wood.\u201d Defendant maintains that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to exclude evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and requires reversal, and further that the trial court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion under Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">For the reasons that follow, defendant\u2019s position lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">\u201cLaw enforcement agencies have a duty, under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to preserve evidence \u2018that might be expected to play a significant role in the suspect\u2019s defense.\u2019 <em>(California </em>v. <em>Trombetta </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 479, 488 [81 L.Ed.2d 413, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 2534]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Beeler </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 953, 976 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 891 P.2d 153].) To fall within the scope of this duty, the evidence \u2018must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u2019 <em>(California </em>v. <em>Trombetta, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 489 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2534]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beeler, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 976). The state\u2019s responsibility is further limited when the defendant\u2019s challenge is to \u2018the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.\u2019 <em>(Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood[, supra,] </em>488 U.S. 51, 57 [102 L.Ed.2d 281, 109 S.Ct. 333, 337].) In such case, \u2018unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 58 [109 S.Ct. at p. 337]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Beeler, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 976.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">\u201cOn review, we must determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the superior court\u2019s finding, there was substantial evidence to support its ruling. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Griffin </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1011, 1022 [251 Cal.Rptr. 643, 761 P.2d 103].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roybal </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 481, 509-510 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 966 P.2d 521]; see also <em>People v. Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 771, 810 [281 Cal.Rptr. 90, 809 P.2d 865].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">Under this standard, the court below did not err in concluding there was no showing of bad faith by law enforcement in failing to preserve the evidence; none of the testimony at the preliminary hearing (or trial) suggested otherwise. Similarly, nothing in the record suggests that the court below erred in determining that the wood chips did not have an exculpatory value that was apparent prior to their disappearance, or that the wood chip evidence was of such a nature that defendant was unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means. (See <em>People v. Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d <em>771, </em>810.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>Nor do we find any abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s determination that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudice that could be attributed to the failure to preserve the wood chips that had been observed by Cheri Phinney and Sergeant Naliboff. Investigators photographed the wood chip evidence. The photographic evidence indicated that someone had forced an entry into Janette Cullins\u2019s apartment, and therefore was probative as to the burglary charge and the burglary special circumstance. Defendant does not demonstrate how, in the absence of the wood chips themselves, the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the testimony and photographs of the wood chips. Defendant\u2019s assertion that removal of a portion of the doorjamb during the investigation might have created the wood chips is speculative and has no bearing on whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">II. <em>JURY SELECTION ISSUES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">Defendant contends the trial court erroneously prohibited sequestered voir dire examination of prospective jurors, unfairly restricted the examination of the prospective jurors by counsel, conducted voir dire in an oppressive atmosphere, improperly instructed prospective jurors, and applied an incorrect standard to exclude persons from the jury. In view of these asserted errors, defendant contends he was denied a myriad of rights guaranteed to him under the state and federal Constitutions and therefore his conviction and sentence must be reversed. As we shall explain, none of defendant\u2019s contentions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">A. <em>Defendant\u2019s Motion for Sequestered Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">At the commencement of jury selection, defendant moved for sequestered voir dire of prospective jurors pursuant to <em>Hovey v. Superior Court </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 1 [168 Cal.Rptr. 128, 616 P.2d 1301]. The prosecution joined in the request. The trial court denied the motion, stating that \u201cProposition 115 is the law and is applicable. ...[][] And I intend to follow Proposition 115, and that includes, at this particular point in time, I\u2019m not going to be using a sequestered inquiry of the jurors. [][] In making that decision, I\u2019m exercising my discretion as well as requested by the People.\u201d When defendant renewed his request, the trial court repeated its denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">On appeal, defendant contends he was \u201cdenied meaningful voir dire by the court\u2019s improper procedures,\u201d including the trial court\u2019s denial of sequestered voir dire. He is mistaken. Proposition 115, which took effect on June 6, 1990 (approximately eight months prior to jury selection here), enacted Code of Civil Procedure section 223, which in relevant part provided (prior to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>amendment in 2000): \u201cIn a criminal case, the court shall conduct the examination of prospective jurors[, and such examination] . . . shall, where practicable, occur in the presence of other jurors in all criminal cases, including death penalty cases.\u201d (Stats. 1990, p. A-245, italics omitted.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">Moreover, we repeatedly have rejected contentions similar to those advanced by defendant. (See, e.g. <em>People v. San Nicolas </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 614, 633-634 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 612, 101 P.3d 509]; <em>People v. Ramos </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 494, 513-515 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 575, 101 P.3d 478]; <em>People v. Slaughter </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1187, 1199 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 477, 47 P.3d 262]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Box </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 1153, 1180-1181 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 69, 5 P.3d 130]; see also <em>People v. Waidla </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 713 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46] [Proposition 115 \u201cabrogates\u201d the requirement found in <em>Hovey v. Superior Court, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 80, of individual sequestered voir dire examination of prospective jurors during the death qualification portion of jury selection in a capital case]; <em>Tapia v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 282, 288 [279 Cal.Rptr. 592, 807 P.2d 434] [applying Proposition 115 to crimes committed prior to enactment of the new statute, where (as here), the trial is conducted after its enactment].) Defendant has not provided us with any persuasive basis for revisiting the holdings in those decisions, and we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">The trial court made clear that its ruling was guided by the provisions set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 223. The court also explained at length the basis for its exercise of discretion in denying the requests for sequestered voir dire. No error or abuse of discretion appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>B. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Imposition of Time Limits on Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">The trial court permitted counsel for each party to have 60 minutes to conduct voir dire of the first 20 prospective jurors, and gave 30 minutes to each side for each additional group of nine jurors. The defense and prosecution each protested vociferously that the court\u2019s limits were unduly restrictive.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The parties repeatedly moved the court to reconsider its ruling, each side citing the difficulty of ascertaining a prospective juror\u2019s views during group voir dire within the time allotted by the trial court. The court denied these requests, expressing confidence that the process would afford counsel an adequate amount of time in which to conduct the voir dire examination <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>On appeal, defendant contends the trial court\u2019s restriction of the amount of time permitted each side in obtaining answers to questions was improper and resulted in a denial of meaningful voir dire. We have observed that the adequacy of voir dire is a matter \u201c 1 \u201cnot easily subject to appellate review. The trial judge\u2019s function at this point in the trial is not unlike that of the jurors later on in the trial. Both must reach conclusions as to impartiality and credibility by relying on their own evaluations of demeanor evidence and responses to questions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Holt </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 619, 661 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213], quoting <em>Mu'Min </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 415, 424 [114 L.Ed.2d 493, 111 S.Ct. 1899]; see also <em>People v. Cardenas </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 240, 247 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 583] [\u201c \u2018The exercise of discretion by trial judges under the new system of court-conducted voir dire is accorded considerable deference by appellate courts.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People v. Taylor </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1299, 1313 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 676] [same].) The applicable standard is a demanding one: \u201cUnless the voir dire by a court is so inadequate that the reviewing court can say that the resulting trial was fundamentally unfair, the manner in which voir dire is conducted is not a basis for reversal. [Citation.] A fortiori, the same standard of reversible error applies when both the court and counsel participate in the voir dire.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Holt, supra, </em>15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>Cal.4th at p. 661; see also <em>People v. Bolden </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 515, 538 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 802, 58 P.3d 931] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">Our review of the record reveals the voir dire examination conducted here was more than adequate. The trial court informed the parties that if, in addition to the initial questions posed by the court and by each side, counsel desired that further inquiries be made of a prospective juror, counsel would be given the opportunity to request that the court ask followup questions directed to those particular jurors. \u201cThe right to voir dire, like the right to peremptorily challenge [citation], is not a constitutional right but a means to achieve the end of an impartial jury. [Citation.] . . . [I]t is the duty of the trial judge to restrict the examination of the prospective jurors within reasonable bounds so as to expedite the trial. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Wright </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 367, 419 [276 Cal.Rptr. 731, 802 P.2d 221]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bittaker </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1046, 1086 [259 Cal.Rptr. 630, 774 P.2d 659].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">In view of the circumstance that the parties clearly were given the opportunity to elicit information on voir dire, we conclude, consistent with our foregoing pronouncements, that the time limits of which defendant complains did not prevent defense counsel from making reasonable inquiries into the fitness of prospective jurors to serve on the jury. No error or abuse of discretion appears. (See e.g., <em>People v. Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 353-354 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708]; <em>People v. Lucas </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 415, 480 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 525, 907 P.2d 373].)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">Moreover, even were we to assume that the trial court abused its discretion in restricting voir dire, defendant has failed to establish prejudice. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 354; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bittaker, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 1082 [no abuse of discretion where the court formulated four specific questions to ask prospective jurors during the death-qualifying process, and refused to permit further questions from counsel].) The trial court\u2019s rulings were minimally restrictive, and the circumstance that both parties passionately argued against them suggests that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>court\u2019s restrictions did not disproportionately impact one side to the advantage of the other. Jury selection required eight court days, a period of time hardly indicative of an unduly rapid proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">C. <em>The Atmosphere in the Courtroom</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">At certain points during the voir dire examination, defense counsel complained about the overcrowded conditions occasioned by the large number of prospective jurors who had been directed into the courtroom. At one point, counsel declared: \u201cThere is a carnival atmosphere in here not fitting for this kind of case. We\u2019ve got a hundred and I don\u2019t know how many people jammed into this one courtroom. Jurors are complaining. It is extremely uncomfortable, not only for the jurors, but for counsel. And the whole . . . atmosphere militates against the calm deliberation which we ought to be applying to this case.\u201d On another occasion, the court informed the jury venire: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that since all these chairs are so close up here that I\u2019m just doing that to harass you, because given the way the last few days have gone for most of us, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you thought that.\u201d On yet another occasion, the court indicated that it had received a note from a prospective juror that read, \u201cCan you lower the room temperature, it\u2019s too stuffy, etc.,\u201d to which the court responded, \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to have him tell us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-7\">Defendant characterizes the atmosphere in the courtroom during the voir dire examination as having been \u201coppressive,\u201d a circumstance that he contends\u2014when viewed either singly or together with the trial court\u2019s other asserted errors\u2014warrants reversal. We disagree. The panel was comprised of 140 prospective jurors. Although the warm, crowded conditions in the courtroom undoubtedly were neither optimum nor particularly comfortable, they did not deprive defendant of any rights to which he was entitled. To the extent defendant\u2019s claim is directed at the difficult \u201cworking conditions\u201d under which the defense was forced to operate during voir dire, the prosecution was compelled to perform under the identical challenging conditions. To the extent defendant\u2019s claim is directed at the potentially adverse impact the conditions may have had upon prospective jurors, we observe that defendant was entitled to an impartial jury, not a contented one. Although defendant\u2019s representations as to the nature of the courtroom atmosphere portray a challenging environment for all concerned, we observe that the eight-day duration of these conditions was not inordinately lengthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">Significantly, the defense had six peremptory challenges remaining when it accepted the jury\u2014a circumstance indicating that, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the \u201coppressive\u201d nature of the courtroom atmosphere, the defense was not dissatisfied with the jury as sworn. Indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>defense <em>requested </em>that the jury be sworn. \u201c \u2018When the jury was finally selected, defendant did not claim that any juror was incompetent, or was not impartial. We therefore find no prejudicial error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 354.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">D. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Voir Dire Examination of Prospective Jurors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">Defendant contends the trial court misled prospective jurors, some of whom eventually were sworn as jurors in the case, by conducting an \u201cimproper and misleading voir dire examination [that] left the defense guessing at bias or prejudice,\u201d and by misstating the law related to the penalty phase of the proceedings. Defendant refers to assertedly imprecise questions posed by the trial court, and its repeated use during voir dire of inquiries such as, \u201cwould you <em>hesitate </em>to vote for the death penalty, and would you have a <em>tendency </em>to vote for the death penalty?\u201d (Italics added.) Further, in response to questions posed by prospective jurors as to whether the \u201cweighing process\u201d described by the court would involve a \u201cmoral decision,\u201d the trial court answered in the negative. Defendant contends that this response by the court conflicted with CALJIC No. 8.88 (1989 rev.), which specifically instructed jurors that \u201cYou are free to assign whatever <em>moral </em>or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider.\u201d (Italics added.) Defendant further asserts that \u201cthe record does not demonstrate adequate bases for trial court rulings on challenges for cause, in large part because it is not clear the views of prospective jurors would have prevented or substantially impaired performance of their duties as jurors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s voir dire examination reveals that although defendant is correct that certain statements made by the court lacked precision, may have been overly simplistic, and contained technical misstatements of law, the court made clear that its comments were \u201cnot instructions on the law which I\u2019m giving you at this time. You\u2019ll receive, if you\u2019re selected as a juror, the actual instructions on the law in their full detail later.\u201d We believe the court\u2019s admonition made clear that its comments were directed toward generally familiarizing the prospective jurors with the tasks ahead in order to elicit responses from them that would assist the parties in determining whether or not to exercise their available challenges. Significantly, counsel were given the opportunity to ask followup questions of prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>E. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Rulings on Challenges for Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">In considering defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in ruling on challenges for cause, we are guided by well established principles. If, as occurred in the present case, a defendant has unused peremptory challenges available when the trial court impanels the jury, and the defendant does not express dissatisfaction with the jury ultimately selected, his or her claim is not preserved on appeal. <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 353, 444 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 408, 966 P.2d 442].) Even were defendant\u2019s claim properly preserved, we would reject it on the merits because he has failed to identify any prospective juror who he contends was improperly retained on the jury despite a valid challenge for cause, or one who erroneously was removed for cause. In view of defendant\u2019s failure to establish specific reversible error, his contention must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">HI. <em>GUILT PHASE ISSUES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">A. <em>Testimony of Polly Haisha</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">Over defendant\u2019s objection on the ground of lack of relevancy, the prosecution introduced the testimony of Polly Haisha, an acquaintance of defendant\u2019s, who, as a senior in high school, met defendant at a party in February 1984. Haisha testified that she accepted defendant\u2019s invitation at the party to go sailing with him and gave him her telephone number, but subsequently cancelled the date because she \u201cjust felt really uncomfortable about the whole thing. I had a weird feeling about it. I ca[lled] him up and canceled. I made up an excuse why I couldn\u2019t go . . . .\u201d Haisha and defendant spoke several times in the ensuing weeks; the two repeatedly rescheduled their date but, in Haisha\u2019s words, \u201cI would always cancel out shortly before we were supposed to meet.\u201d Haisha identified defendant in court and in photographic exhibits. She also verified that an entry in defendant\u2019s address book was her telephone number at the time (observing, however, that her name had been misspelled).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">Haisha further testified that upon informing defendant during one of their initial conversations of her plans to attend college, he responded: \u201cYou know, that\u2019s just a waste. He said why don\u2019t you quiet [jzc] school and come sail to France with me. You\u2019ll get a better experience of life there than you could in school, [f] I said, well, you know, that might be so, but I plan on going to college. I barely know you. I\u2019m not going to give up my life so I can sail to France with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>In response to the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry regarding defendant\u2019s demeanor on the telephone, Haisha testified: \u201cWell, the very first time I talked to him the next day after I met him at the party, he was really nice and very open to what we could do, and anything that I wanted\u2014to whenever we wanted to meet after that. [|] It got\u2014 he got more and more aggressive. Like the time I said I wouldn\u2019t go to France with him, he acted like I was making fun of him; somehow that was a stupid idea or something, [f] He would get kind of mean and when I would cancel on dates, he would get kind of irritated, like he had to change his whole schedule for me. Yet, again, he wasn\u2019t happy. [1] It kind of scared me, but he would always tone it down towards the end so I wouldn\u2019t be afraid to talk with him the next time. [|] . . . [][] Later on, towards the end of our phone conversations, he mentioned his ex-wife . . . and at that time he was really bitter about it and, you know, would call her names and said he was happy that part of his life was over. He was happy to get away from her. [f] He called her a bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Haisha also testified that in the evening of March 24, 1984, defendant contacted her by telephone and informed her he would be in San Diego on the following day. In response, Haisha \u201casked him at the end of our phone call never to call me again, and that I didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore, [f] I certainly didn\u2019t want to see him, and he became very irritated and said why all of a sudden this change, we haven\u2019t even gone out yet. [f] I said well, I don\u2019t feel comfortable about talking to you or seeing you. I would rather this ended right now, and would you please just never call this number again. . . . [][] He was very irritated and he started getting mad and almost hostile. That\u2019s when I knew for sure I made the right choice, because at previous times in phone conversations he had gotten that way.\u201d She added that she did not remember defendant ever contacting her again after that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">On cross-examination, Haisha testified that during the time period in which defendant was on trial (April 1991), she was a law student who, in the previous year, had worked as an intern in the San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office, and that she planned to return to that office again to work as an intern after taking the bar examination that upcoming summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">On appeal, defendant reiterates his contention at trial that Haisha\u2019s testimony was irrelevant and that it warranted exclusion for that reason, additionally asserting on appeal that the testimony was highly prejudicial, \u201cdesigned to inflame the jury,\u201d and constituted improperly admitted character evidence (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (b)), and that the trial court erred in failing to exercise its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 to exclude this evidence. Defendant adds that the trial court\u2019s admission of Haisha\u2019s testimony violated a panoply of defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>Preliminarily, we observe that defendant did not object at trial based upon Evidence Code section 352 or 1101\u2014a point acknowledged by defendant but apparently overlooked by the People\u2014and therefore has not preserved this claim for our review. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyette </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 381, 424 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 58 P.3d 391].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">With regard to the substance of defendant\u2019s contentions, we conclude they are without merit for reasons similar to those set forth in response to defendant\u2019s challenge to the admission of other evidence introduced in the Los Angeles proceedings. (See <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pp. 1165-1173.) In view of our more extensive summary of the applicable legal principles involving relevancy and prejudice in the companion appeal, the brief analysis that follows shall suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">The prosecution met its burden of establishing that the testimony of Polly Haisha was relevant under Evidence Code section 210. Haisha\u2019s testimony corroborated the testimony of Susan Loyland that defendant intended to be in San Diego on March 25, 1984, the date on which Loyland\u2019s housemate, Barbara S., was raped in San Diego, and after which neither Haisha nor Loyland ever heard from defendant again. Haisha\u2019s testimony also bolstered the prosecution\u2019s theory of the case that defendant embarked upon his murderous crime spree in the immediate aftermath of being spumed by a number of women, including Haisha. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1221-1223.) Implicit in the prosecution\u2019s theory is that these rejections comprised a \u201ctrigger\u201d that, once pulled, propelled defendant to rape and murder women whom he recently had befriended. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s demeanor during his conversations with Haisha\u2014including his frustration and anger when Haisha cancelled their scheduled dates\u2014in the weeks leading up to the murders and other crimes appears relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">The evidence was not unduly prejudicial. It merely described Haisha\u2019s initial encounter with defendant at a party and his subsequent fruitless efforts to meet her again, causing him to become irritated or angry. The testimony was not altogether uncomplimentary, as Haisha recalled that during their first telephone conversation, defendant \u201cwas really nice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude Haisha\u2019s testimony. Further, viewed in the context of defendant\u2019s trial, in which the prosecution\u2019s evidence overwhelmingly established that defendant committed multiple bmtal murders and vicious rapes, the testimony of Polly Haisha\u2014a woman whom defendant did not physically attack, and who had only minimal personal contact with him\u2014was not even remotely prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>Citing Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (a), defendant also contends Haisha\u2019s testimony was \u201cimproperly admitted character evidence, and no doubt carried over to penalty phase as non-statutory aggravation evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s argument fails because, as noted, it was not presented at the trial court, nor did admission of the evidence violate Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (a), because the prosecution did not offer Haisha\u2019s testimony to prove defendant\u2019s conduct on a specific occasion. Finally, it is not reasonably possible that the evidence \u201ccarried over\u201d as an aggravating circumstance to the penalty phase, or that in the absence of the evidence defendant would have received a more favorable penalty verdict. As noted above, a massive amount of other, far more damaging evidence was introduced against defendant at the guilt and penalty phases of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">Considered as guilt phase evidence, even if we were to determine under any theory that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony of Polly Haisha, such error would have been harmless under the applicable <em>Watson </em>standard, because it is not reasonably probable that the jury would have reached a different result in the absence of Haisha\u2019s testimony. <em>(People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">B. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">Defendant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of the crimes committed against Barbara S. and Janette Cullins, as well as the prior murder and lying-in-wait special-circumstance findings. \u201cIn reviewing a criminal conviction challenged as lacking evidentiary support, \u2018 \u201cthe court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(People v. Hillhouse </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 469, 496 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 45, 40 P.3d 754].) The same standard of review applies to special circumstance allegations. <em>(People v. Maury </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 342, 396 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 561, 68 P.3d 1].) An appellate court must accept logical inferences that the jury might have drawn from the evidence even if the court would have concluded otherwise. <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 11 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618].)\u201d <em>(People v. Combs </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 821, 849 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 61, 101 P.3d 1007].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">1. <em>The Crimes Committed Against Barbara S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">Defendant contends his conviction of the crimes committed against Barbara S. is not supported by sufficient evidence. He is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">As we have noted <em>(ante, </em>at pp. 1221-1226), one day after having been rejected by Polly Haisha and Cathleen Tiner, defendant arrived in San Diego on March 25, 1984, having made plans to travel to Mexico that day with Susan Loyland, who departed from San Diego without him. Janell Barksdale, the next-door neighbor of Barbara S. and Susan Loyland, observed defendant approaching the victims\u2019 residence on the evening of March 25. That evening, defendant broke into Loyland\u2019s residence, stole some of her tip money from a concealed location that previously had been revealed to him, and raped at knifepoint Barbara S., Loyland\u2019s housemate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-8\">Barbara S. provided details of the rape, oral copulation, robbery, and burglary, including the circumstances that her assailant\u2019s voice sounded familiar to her and that weeks later she recognized the voice as defendant\u2019s. At trial, she identified defendant as the man who attacked her. Susan Loyland established that defendant had seen the location where she had concealed the money determined to have been taken from her bedroom, and explained why she suspected defendant might have been Barbara S.\u2019s assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">Defendant glosses over the foregoing highly incriminating evidence, instead emphasizing Barbara S.\u2019s general uncertainty and inability to identify her assailant in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Defendant also asserts the prosecution \u201cclearly bootstrapped\u201d its case in the Barbara S. sexual assault to the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence implicating defendant in the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, Bonnie Guthrie, and Janette Cullins, the death of Tok Kim, and the sexual assault of Jennifer S. He further asserts that the evidence supporting the convictions was undermined by the fact that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>court excluded evidence indicating that Barbara S. suffered from alcoholism in the spring of 1984.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">None of defendant\u2019s points is persuasive. Barbara S.\u2019s identification of defendant as the man who assaulted and robbed her at knifepoint in her residence was supported by her housemate\u2019s testimony that money was stolen from a concealed location known to defendant, and by a neighbor\u2019s testimony that defendant walked toward the residence on the night of the attack. Thus, the prosecution\u2019s evidence implicating defendant in the attack on Barbara S. more than adequately meets the substantial evidence standard summarized above. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Combs, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 849.)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">2. <em>The Crimes Committed Against Janette Cullins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">Defendant contends the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction of murder, robbery, and burglary stemming from crimes committed at the residence of Janette Cullins on or about April 12, 1984. He challenges on similar grounds the jury\u2019s true findings as to the burglary, robbery, and lying-in-wait special circumstances. With the exception of the last special circumstance, we find unpersuasive each of these assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">The evidence adduced at trial established that defendant visited Janette Cullins\u2019s apartment on the afternoon of April 12, 1984, asking her new roommate, Cheri Phinney, how long Phinney planned to be there. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>evening, Cullins attended the symphony with her friend, Cathleen Tiner, who last saw Cullins at approximately 11:00 p.m., when Cullins departed to return to her apartment. A neighbor of Cullins observed the distinctive white Datsun 280 ZX in which defendant subsequently was arrested, parked with its engine running for several minutes late that evening. A number of Cullins\u2019s friends unsuccessfully attempted to contact Cullins on April 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">A visitor to Cullins\u2019s apartment on April 14 noticed wood chips on the floor by the front door\u2014evidence consistent with a forced entry. Cullins\u2019s body was found partially clothed in the bedroom closet, and her neck bore a ligature mark. The concealment of the body in a closet and the cause of Cullins\u2019s death\u2014asphyxia due to strangulation\u2014bore a strong resemblance to the circumstances of the Susan Knoll/Jillette Mills murders in Culver City three days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">Cullins\u2019s wallet containing her various items of identification was recovered from a location near where the distinctive Datsun 280 ZX was parked that same week. The wallet also contained Bonnie Guthrie\u2019s identification, strongly suggesting that one person had murdered and robbed both women.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">On April 13, 1984, a man wearing a dark jacket made a withdrawal from Cullins\u2019s bank account. Four days later, in Arizona, a paper bearing the word \u201cSHYLAS,\u201d a bank passcard bearing Cullins\u2019s name, and a black jacket were among the items found in defendant\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">The foregoing evidence amply supports the jury\u2019s conclusions that late in the evening of April 12, 1984, defendant, with the requisite felonious intent, forced his way into Cullins\u2019s apartment, encountered Cullins, compelled her to disclose her bank password, then fatally strangled her, concealed her body in her bedroom closet, took her wallet, and subsequently depleted her bank account. The evidence thus established the elements of the charged offenses\u2014burglary, robbery, and murder\u2014as well as the elements of the burglary and robbery special circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">In reaching our conclusion, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the prosecution failed to establish that defendant acted with felonious intent. Nor do we find persuasive his related contention that the robbery and burglary special-circumstance findings were improper because the crimes were merely incidental to the murder or intended to facilitate or conceal the murder. (See <em>People v. Zapien </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 929, 984-985 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 846 P.2d 704].) The requisite intent for each crime, and supporting each of these special circumstances, readily may be inferred from the evidence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Matson </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 35, 41 [117 Cal.Rptr. 664, 528 P.2d 752] [\u201cAlthough the People must show that a defendant charged with burglary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>entered the premises with felonious intent, such intent must usually be inferred from all of the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence, rarely being directly provable. [Citations.] When the evidence justifies a reasonable inference of felonious intent, the verdict may not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d]; see also <em>People v. Ochoa, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 413-414 [In reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence as to special circumstance findings, \u201c \u2018 \u201cwe must determine \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the [allegations] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">The requisite intent and all essential elements were present here. Cullins\u2019s apartment showed signs of a forced entry consistent with an intent to commit a felony. The evidence that the doorjamb had been pried, producing a scattering of wood chips near the front door, supported the burglary charge and the burglary special circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">The circumstance that defendant harbored an intent to rob Cullins\u2014quite independent of his intent to murder her\u2014may be inferred from the evidence that he obtained her bank account password prior to fatally strangling her. The circumstances of the break-in, murder, robbery, and theft, together with defendant\u2019s hurried, loud, and dramatic departure in the stolen vehicle consistent with a perpetrator\u2019s escape from a crime scene, amply support the inference of defendant\u2019s intent to commit burglary. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moody </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 357, 363 [131 Cal.Rptr. 923].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">With regard to defendant\u2019s contention that the lying-in-wait special circumstance was not supported by substantial evidence, the People contend the evidence adduced at trial suggested that defendant accomplished his entry prior to Cullins\u2019s arrival home. The People urge that no other explanation for the forcible entry, indicated by the presence of the wood chips, was adduced at trial, and that it reasonably could be inferred that defendant was lying in wait for his victim from the forced entry, as well as from the presence of Jillette Mills\u2019s stolen vehicle, with its engine running for several minutes, at the approximate time Cullins likely returned to her apartment. (See <em>People v. Hillhouse, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 500-501; <em>People </em>v. <em>Michaels </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 486, 516-517.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">We reject the People\u2019s position on this point. The evidence in support of the lying-in-wait special circumstance\u2014essentially, the wood chips and the car with its engine running\u2014appears unduly reliant upon the <em>inference </em>suggested by the prosecution that defendant arrived <em>prior to </em>Cullins\u2019s return home in order to attack her <em>by surprise. </em>The wood chip evidence tended to show forced entry, not that the entry occurred prior to Cullins\u2019s arrival. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>Cullins may have arrived at her apartment before defendant did, and he may have forced his way in while she was undressing elsewhere in the apartment. Under the latter scenario, the lying-in-wait special circumstance would rely upon the neighbor who heard the car engine running, and the time of that event cannot be pinpointed. Moreover, the car idling, besides occurring at an uncertain time, does not strongly imply that defendant was waiting in the car to attack Cullins; if defendant had planned a home invasion when Cullins arrived home, he likely would have turned off the engine so as not to attract attention. We therefore set aside the special circumstance of lying in wait.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">At the time of defendant\u2019s arrest, he was fleeing California in a vehicle that had belonged to murder victim Jillette Mills, and was in possession of personal property that linked him to each one of the murdered women, including the murder victim in the present case. As noted, Janette Cullins\u2019s body was concealed in a manner similar to that used to hide the bodies of Susan Knoll and Jillette Mills. Each of these women, and Bonnie Guthrie, had been fatally strangled. No reasonable explanation, other than defendant\u2019s culpability for the charged offenses, presented itself at trial. Indeed, the evidence in support of the charged crimes and burglary and robbery special circumstances was overwhelming.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">3. <em>The Prior Murder Special Circumstance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">Defendant contends the trial court committed prejudicial error when it denied his motion to strike the prior-murder special-circumstance allegations derived from the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie, reflected in the Los Angeles County judgment rendered against defendant on January 30, 1990. Defendant challenged the prior convictions on the ground they were \u201cconstitutionally defective,\u201d because defendant \u201cwas denied the right to effective assistance of counsel\u201d and \u201cdenied his constitutional right to testify at the guilt phase of the Los Angeles trial; he was erroneously denied his constitutional right to present a defense at the guilt phase of that trial; and the Los Angeles trial court erroneously failed to afford him a hearing on conflict of interest allegations between him and his attorneys, in violation of his right to counsel.\u201d Defendant further asserts that \u201cfailure to dismiss [the prior murder] special circumstances . . . would deny [him] a fair trial and due process of law . . . and would deny him protection against cruel and unusual punishment\u201d in violation of the applicable state and federal constitutional guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>In the companion case, <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 1114, we have upheld the judgment of death against defendant for the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie. In so doing, we have rejected contentions that are substantially similar to those made in support of defendant\u2019s motion at the trial of the present case to strike the prior murder special-circumstance allegations\u2014contentions that, by his own acknowledgment, he has included \u201cto a large extent\u201d here. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1156-1157.) As we have explained in that decision, the Los Angeles County murder convictions were valid, and therefore the San Diego trial court properly denied the motion to strike. Insofar as defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the validity of the prior murder convictions forming the basis for the prior murder special circumstance differ from the arguments made in his automatic appeal from the Los Angeles County judgment convicting him of those murders, we reject those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">C. <em>Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">Defendant contends the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct, requiring reversal of the judgment, based upon the following asserted transgressions: (1) \u201cmisstatements of fact and deceptive practices to gain favorable rulings,\u201d (2) \u201ccomments disparaging of defense counsel,\u201d and (3) \u201cprosecutorial misconduct during opening and rebuttal arguments, including adverse comment upon defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination, improper shifting of the burden of proof, and misstatements of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">\u201c \u2018The applicable federal and state standards regarding prosecutorial misconduct are well established. \u201c \u2018A prosecutor\u2019s . . . intemperate behavior violates the federal Constitution when it comprises a pattern of conduct \u201cso egregious that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.\u201d \u2019 \u201d [Citations.] Conduct by a prosecutor that does not render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial misconduct under state law only if it involves \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the jury.\u201d \u2019 \u201d [Citation.] As a general rule a defendant may not complain on appeal of prosecutorial misconduct unless in a timely fashion\u2014and on the same ground\u2014the defendant [requested] an assignment of misconduct and [also] requested that the jury be admonished to disregard the impropriety. [Citation.] Additionally, when the claim focuses upon comments made by the prosecutor before the jury, the question is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied any of the complained-of remarks in an objectionable fashion.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Samayoa </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 841 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 938 P.2d 2].)\u201d <em>(People v. Ochoa, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 427; see also <em>People v. Box, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pp. 1207-1208 [rejecting claim of prosecutorial misconduct where the defendant \u201cfailed to satisfy the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>rule requiring assignment of misconduct and request for admonition as to the prosecutor\u2019s comment of which he now complains\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Here, defendant failed to request an assignment of misconduct or an admonition with regard to any of the conduct he now challenges as improper. Accordingly, he has not preserved his claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">Even assuming defendant\u2019s claims properly were before us, we would reject them on the merits, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">1. <em>Alleged Misstatements of Fact and Deceptive Practices</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">Defendant contends that prior to trial, the prosecution misled the trial court into believing that a key found in defendant\u2019s possession was a key to Barbara S.\u2019s business office. Defendant implies the prosecution acted in bad faith in light of its subsequent disclosure that the key could not be located. No misconduct appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">Defendant faults the prosecution for declining to stipulate to certain facts supporting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized from the Datsun 280 ZX. Defendant contends the prosecution\u2019s position was characterized by \u201cobfuscation and gamesmanship.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s reluctance to accept a stipulation was not improper. (See <em>People v. Garceau </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 140, 182 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 664, 862 P.2d 664].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-10\">Defendant contends the prosecution misrepresented the significance of the testimony of witness Polly Haisha. Defendant argues that the prosecution on the first day of trial deceptively suggested that Haisha was a potential witness who was unlikely to be called unless the defense denied ownership of the address book that included her name. Defendant also complains that Haisha, a law student, was permitted to remain in the courtroom during a portion of the opening statements, until the defense objected that her presence violated the court\u2019s order excluding witnesses from observing the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-11\">At trial, defendant objected to Haisha\u2019s testimony on relevancy grounds, which the trial court properly overruled, as we previously have explained. (See, <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1254-1257.) Defendant did not object to Haisha\u2019s testimony on the ground that the prosecution had violated discovery rules or had engaged in misconduct. Therefore, he has waived any such claim on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ochoa, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 427.) Even if we assume prosecutorial misconduct, it is not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have occurred in the absence of Haisha\u2019s testimony. <em>(People v. Haskett </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 841, 866 [180 Cal.Rptr. 640, 640 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>776].) As we previously have noted, Haisha was a minor witness whose testimony was peripheral to the central events underlying defendant\u2019s crime spree. Neither her presence during a portion of the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, in violation of the court\u2019s order excluding witnesses, nor her eventual testimony at trial, could have made any possible difference in the outcome of the trial, in view of the compelling evidence that linked defendant to the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">2. <em>The Prosecutor\u2019s Comments Regarding Defense Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">Defendant contends the prosecution made disparaging comments regarding defense counsel. Again, defendant did not object to the comments of which he now complains, and thereby has waived his claim. <em>(People v. Gionis </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1196, 1215 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 456, 892 P.2d 1199].) Even if defendant\u2019s contention properly were before us, we would reject it. With one exception, the comments were not made in the presence of the jury, and defendant fails to demonstrate how these comments outside the jury\u2019s presence, which were of the sort one might expect to encounter during a vigorously contested capital trial, prejudiced the proceedings below. With regard to the one comment made before the jury\u2014at the commencement of the prosecution\u2019s guilt phase rebuttal argument\u2014we note that it was fleeting, imprecisely attributed to a member of the United States Supreme Court, and not remotely similar in degree of impropriety to the comments we have held to constitute prejudicial misconduct. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Hill </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 800 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673],)<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>3. <em>Other Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">Immediately after making the comment noted in the margin (fn. 33, <em>ante), </em>the prosecutor commented upon the failure of the defense to present evidence as to \u201cwhy defendant was in that car with all that property. They could do that if they wanted to.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Defendant interposed an objection that the prosecutor improperly was \u201csuggesting that the defendant should have testified, and [is] drawing attention to the fact that he did not.\u201d (See <em>Griffin v. California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229] <em>{Griffin).) </em>In view of the arguable ambiguity inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s comments, the trial court declined to rule as to their propriety, and instead acceded to defendant\u2019s request to reinstruct the jury at that time pursuant to CALJIC Nos. 2.60, and 2.61, which recognized defendant\u2019s constitutional right not to testify and his option to rely on the state of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">On appeal, defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted <em>Griffin </em>error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 475, 527-529 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 905 P.2d 420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">\u201c \u2018Pursuant to <em>Griffin, </em>it is error for a prosecutor to state that certain evidence is uncontradicted or unrefuted when that evidence could not be contradicted or refuted by anyone other than the defendant testifying on his or her own behalf.\u2019 <em>(People v. Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 371 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432].) We also have said \u2018it is error for the prosecution to refer to the absence of evidence that only the defendant\u2019s testimony could provide.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 372, citing <em>People v. Murtishaw </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 733, 757 &amp; fn. 19 [175 Cal.Rptr. 738, 631 P.2d 446].) <em>Griffin\u2019s </em>prohibition against \u2018 \u201cdirect or indirect comment upon the failure of the defendant to take the witness stand,\u201d \u2019 however, \u2018 \u201cdoes not extend to comments on the state of the evidence or on the failure of the defense to introduce material evidence or to call logical witnesses.\u201d \u2019 <em>(People v. Hovey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 572 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776], quoting <em>People v. Jackson </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 264, 304 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P.2d 149].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 208, 257 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 224, 106 P.3d 895]; see also <em>People v. Stewart </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 425, 505-506 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 656, 93 P.3d 271]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 554 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 145, 73 P.3d 1137]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1229, 1339 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 145, 939 P.2d 259].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">In this case, we need not decide whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted error under <em>Griffin, </em>because even if we assume (without deciding) that error occurred, in view of the indirect nature of the prosecutor\u2019s comment, the court\u2019s timely reinstruction of the jury, and the strength of the evidence against defendant, it is \u201cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Hasting </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 499, 511 [76 L.Ed.2d 96, 103 S.Ct. 1974]) even if the prosecutor had not made the comment at issue. Accordingly, no prejudicial error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">Defendant also characterizes as improper argument certain additional remarks made by the prosecutor during summation: \u201cThere are people among us who murder other people because they like to murder other people. [&lt;[[] There are evil people among us. [f] . . . [][] [Defense counsel] stresses that you are the conscience of the community, and you are. People in the community have emotions. It\u2019s . . . improper for you to have your verdict influenced by emotion. But it is proper for you to express through a verdict how you feel about this case, to tell the defendant Dean Carter, what you did, you murdered Janette Cullins, was evil, was senseless, it was vicious, it was unforgivable, and it was first degree murder.\u201d Elsewhere during his summation, the prosecutor argued similarly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">Defendant did not interpose an objection, and thus waived his claim. But even if the issue properly had been preserved, we would reject defendant\u2019s claim of error. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were not, as defendant asserts, references to \u201cimproper[] character propensity,\u201d but instead came \u201cwithin the range of permissible comment regarding egregious conduct on defendant\u2019s part. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Thomas </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 489, 537 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 199, 828 P.2d 101] [rejecting a challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the defendant as a \u201c \u2018mass murderer, rapist,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018a perverted murderous cancer,\u2019 \u201d and a \u201c \u2018walking depraved cancer\u2019 \u201d]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 920, 961 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 897 P.2d 574] [upholding prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the defendant as \u201c \u2018coiled like a snake\u2019 \u201d and a \u201c \u2018rabid dog\u2019 \u201d].) Moreover, in view of the overwhelming evidence that connected defendant to the charged crimes, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201ccould not have carried such an emotional impact as to make it likely the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>decision was rooted in passion rather than evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Thomas, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">D. <em>Alleged Instructional Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">Prior to instructing the jury, the trial court reviewed with counsel the instructions to be given. Defendant objected to the trial court giving CALJIC No. 17.20, an instruction that directed the jury to determine whether, if the jury found defendant guilty of robbery and/or burglary, defendant in the commission of those crimes committed great bodily injury on Janette Cullins.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">Defense counsel argued: \u201c[Tjhere [are] all kinds of results that could follow from this. [][] I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a [section] 654 issue or not, but for the [great bodily injury allegation,] if the [great bodily injury] is the killing, and you could have some absurd results in this, one is that, for example, the defendant was found guilty of the robbery and the burglary, and not the murder and then the intentional [great bodily injury,] so I\u2019m wondering if this instruction should be given at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">The prosecutor responded: \u201cI think [the instruction] should be given. I mean the issue in this case is who did the crime. The same person that robbed her killed her, and counsel expresses the possibility of bizarre results; that they could find him guilty of robbery with the intention of inflicting [great bodily injury], and not the murder. [|] I can\u2019t imagine that happening. I imagine Mr. Carter would be happy as a clam if that happened, but that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-9\">The trial court acknowledged the possibility of \u201can unexpected result under the facts as we know them,\u201d but concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t see where it would be prejudicial or confusing to give the instruction.\u201d The trial court thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>instructed the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 17.20. Upon returning verdicts of guilty as to robbery and burglary, the jury found \u201ctrue\u201d the allegations that defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury on Cullins with regard to both of those offenses. The court imposed sentencing enhancements of three years\u2019 imprisonment for each of the special allegations, which the court stayed pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred in giving the instruction, citing section 12022.7, subdivision (g), which provides that a sentencing enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury \u201cshall not apply to murder or manslaughter.\u201d Defendant further contends that reversal of the judgment is required \u201cbecause as a matter of law criminal sanctions were imposed upon insufficient proof and double punishment is prohibited by law.\u201d He also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the great bodily injury findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument in all respects. The jury was properly instructed, because the allegations of great bodily injury clearly and specifically enhanced each of the robbery and burglary counts, not the murder count. The jury\u2019s verdicts specifically found defendant guilty of robbery and burglary, with a great bodily injury finding enhancing each of those two crimes. Nothing contained in the jury\u2019s verdicts or in the record as a whole indicates that the jury misunderstood its function in this regard or was confused by the challenged instruction. With regard to defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the findings as to the enhancements, the fatal strangulation of Janette Cullins provides the evidentiary support for the allegations that in committing the robbery and the burglary, defendant inflicted great bodily injury. The circumstance that the trial court stayed the three-year enhancements that were imposed based upon the jury\u2019s findings that defendant inflicted great bodily injury means that defendant was not subject to double punishment. No error appears.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">E. <em>Miscellaneous Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">Defendant raises a number of contentions that are either virtually identical or substantially similar to certain claims raised on appeal from the Los Angeles County death judgment rendered against him for the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie\u2014contentions that we have rejected in the companion appeal in <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 1114. These contentions are as follows: 1) defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>evidence seized from his person and from the stolen Datsun 280 ZX improperly was denied; 2) defendant\u2019s motion to exclude other-crimes evidence involving the death of Tok Kim, the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie, and the rape of Jennifer S., improperly was denied; 3) the photographic lineup procedures used by the Oakland Police Department in the investigation of Tok Kim\u2019s death in Alameda County were impermissibly suggestive, and therefore the trial court erred in denying the motion to exclude the Alameda County witness identifications of defendant; 4) defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the preliminary hearing testimony of Alameda County witness Ray Blevins (who had died prior to trial) improperly was denied; and 5) defendant\u2019s motion to sever his trial for the murder of Janette Cullins from the charge of rape involving Barbara S. improperly was denied.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">For the reasons we have set forth more extensively in the companion matter, <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 1114, we reject defendant\u2019s contentions. Insofar as defendant\u2019s claims do not precisely mirror those set forth in the companion appeal, neither defendant\u2019s additional arguments nor the variants in their phrasing persuade us that the trial court committed an error or abuse of discretion prejudicial to defendant\u2019s case. Indeed, these claims are not deserving of additional discussion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laursen </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 192, 205 [104 Cal.Rptr. 425, 501 P.2d 1145].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">IV. <em>PENALTY PHASE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">A. <em>Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Sexual Assault on Jennifer S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">At the conclusion of the People\u2019s case in aggravation, the prosecutor, over defendant\u2019s objection, offered abstracts of judgment as proof that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>had been convicted of: (1) sexual assault crimes committed against Jennifer S. in Ventura County in March 1984, (2) burglary in Alaska in 1978, and (3) burglary in Oregon in 1974. Defendant argued against the introduction of defendant\u2019s Ventura County convictions on the basis that because the judgments were rendered in October 1984, they postdated the April 1984 murder of Janette Cullins and therefore were inadmissible as prior felony convictions under section 190.3, factor (c). (See, e.g., <em>People v. Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411, 453 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273]; <em>People v. Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 201-202 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">The trial court agreed with defendant\u2019s interpretation of the temporal requirements of section 190.3, factor (c), but pursuant to section 190.3, factor (b), correctly recognized that \u201cthe evidence of crimes of violence can occur before or after the murder, and the [Jennifer S.] rape is a crime of violence.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Malone </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 1, 47 [252 Cal.Rptr. 525, 762 P.2d 1249].) The trial court thereafter admitted evidence of defendant\u2019s sexual assault upon Jennifer S.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">On appeal, defendant reiterates his contention that the trial court improperly admitted this evidence. For the reasons aptly noted by the trial court, no error appears.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">Even if the trial court had failed to recognize the distinction between section 190.3, factors (b) and (c), and admitted evidence of defendant\u2019s crimes against Jennifer S. under subdivision (c), the error would have been harmless, \u201cbecause the evidence was admissible as evidence of violent criminal activity under [section 190.3,] factor (b).\u201d <em>(People v. Bradford, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p.1374.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">Defendant further contends the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could double-count the crimes committed against Jennifer S. under section 190.3, factors (b) and (c). His citation to the record, however, is to an inapposite instruction (CALJIC No. 2.82\u2014Concerning Hypothetical Questions), and our review of the other instructions given to the jury has not revealed any such \u201cdouble-counting\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">B. <em>Exclusion of Proffered Evidence in Mitigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-10\">The defense introduced evidence of defendant\u2019s troubled childhood while growing up in Alaska. Several witnesses testified that defendant spent considerable portions of his childhood and adolescence in orphanages, juvenile institutions, and foster homes, and was incarcerated in penal institutions during much of his early adulthood.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>The trial court rejected the proffered testimony on the ground of relevancy and under Evidence Code section 352, explaining at some length the court\u2019s reasoning.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred in excluding the testimony in question. Although certain aspects of Dr. Ellana\u2019s testimony clearly fell outside the bounds of relevancy (for example, cultural attitudes and problems in Nome at the time of defendant\u2019s 1991 trial, seven years after he was incarcerated in California), and other aspects were cumulative (for example, the harsh living conditions experienced by residents of Nome), the question whether her testimony ought to have been excluded <em>in its entirety </em>is closer. Dr. Ellana did have firsthand knowledge of the rigid and prejudicial attitudes regarding \u201chalf-breeds\u201d expressed by defendant\u2019s stepfather; as noted earlier, defendant is part Eskimo. Consistent with the principles set forth in Evidence Code sections 210 and 352, we believe that the trial court could have set certain limits as to the areas in which Dr. Ellana could testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">We need not decide whether the trial court\u2019s ruling to exclude Dr. Ellana\u2019s testimony in its entirety was erroneous, however, because even if we assume that error occurred, defendant suffered no prejudice. The jury heard a considerable amount of other testimony regarding Nome\u2019s harsh conditions and defendant\u2019s troubled childhood. Viewed in the context of the comprehensive case in mitigation presented by the defense, Dr. Ellana\u2019s testimony was of marginal significance and unlikely to have swayed the jury. Defendant fails to persuade us that it is reasonably possible a more favorable result would have been reached in the absence of the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding this testimony. <em>(People v. Brown, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 432, 447-448.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">3. <em>The Proffered Testimony of James W. L. Park</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">Outside the presence of the jury, the defense offered the testimony of James W. L. Park, an expert in prison operations, prison construction, and prisoner classification who had lengthy experience working in the California Department of Corrections. Park testified that prisons use audiovisual equipment, and that a prisoner with experience in this field would be a benefit to the prison system. Based upon his review of defendant\u2019s records of incarceration, Park stated that in his opinion defendant would make \u201can above[-] average adjustment\u201d to living in a maximum security prison. Park further testified that defendant \u201cwould not be a danger to staff or to prisoners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">The trial court ruled that Park could testify before the jury as to his opinion that defendant would adjust to life in prison, but also that if Park so testified, the prosecution would be permitted to cross-examine Park with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>defendant\u2019s psychological testing results and history of violence and criminal behavior.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">Defense counsel thereafter informed the court that the defense would not call Park as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">On appeal, defendant contends \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s improper ruling effectively precluded the expert\u2019s testimony in violation of [defendant\u2019s] constitutional rights.\u201d We disagree. The proffered testimony sought to introduce into evidence certain experience and character traits of defendant that suggested he would adjust well to prison life and probably would not be dangerous to other inmates and staff. Had the defense introduced that evidence, the prosecution would have been entitled to cross-examine Park regarding defendant\u2019s psychological propensities and prior criminal record. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 882-883 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906].) The trial court did not preclude Park from testifying, nor unduly restrict the areas of inquiry pertaining to his proposed testimony, but instead simply made clear that if the defense offered evidence of defendant\u2019s character related to the likelihood of his adjustment to life in prison, the prosecution would be entitled to cross-examine the witness and seek to rebut his testimony. Under these circumstances, the defense for obvious tactical reasons declined to introduce Park\u2019s testimony. No error or abuse of discretion appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">4. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling Prohibiting Allocution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">Although acknowledging that the right of allocution is not recognized in California, defendant nevertheless contends the trial court erred in refusing his request to plead for mercy without being subject to cross-examination. No error appears. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1171, 1209 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 800, 906 P.2d 1068]; <em>People v. Hunter </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 957, 989 [264 Cal.Rptr. 367, 782 P.2d 608].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>C. <em>Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">Defendant contends the prosecution committed misconduct at the penalty phase by \u201cpropounding] questions to witnesses in bad faith,\u201d interposing objections on the ground of hearsay, propounding \u201carguments . . . designed to improperly invoke non-statutory aggravation evidence in violation of [s]ection 190.3 and [defendant\u2019s] constitutional rights,\u201d and by improperly commenting upon defendant\u2019s failure to testify in violation of <em>Griffin v. California, supra, </em>380 U.S. 609. Defendant further contends the prosecution improperly \u201cused every means available to curtail testimony regarding [defendant\u2019s] childhood\u2014or other\u2014socio-medico information and history that were legitimately proffered for a sentence less than death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that defendant greatly overstates his position. Although a prosecutor is not permitted to comment, \u201ceither directly or indirectly, on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify in his defense,\u201d the prosecutor may comment \u201c \u2018on the state of the evidence, or on the failure of the defense to introduce material evidence or call logical witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Turner </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 406, 419 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 182, 99 P.3d 505], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 755.) For the most part, the prosecution\u2019s handling of its penalty phase responsibilities fell within the range of appropriate behavior. The prosecution was vigorous in its cross-examination and summation, and in interposing objections (most of which clearly were well-founded). Even were we to assume that the isolated incidents of which defendant now complains constituted misconduct, they were trivial in the context of defendant\u2019s trial and did not resemble or even approach the sort of misconduct that we have held to be prejudicial. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Hill, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 800.) We therefore reject defendant\u2019s claim of prejudicial error.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">D. <em>Miscellaneous Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">Defendant raises a number of contentions that are virtually identical or substantially similar to claims raised on appeal from the Los Angeles County death judgment rendered against him for the murders of Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie, and which we have rejected in the companion case of <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 1114. These contentions are as follows: 1) the trial court\u2019s pattern jury instructions to the jury were inappropriate; 2) the delay between the pronouncement of defendant\u2019s death sentence and his execution renders the entire process unconstitutional; and 3) the use of lethal gas as a method of execution is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">For the reasons we have set forth more extensively in the companion matter, <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pages 1201-1214, we reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>defendant\u2019s contentions. Insofar as defendant\u2019s claims do not precisely mirror those set forth in the companion appeal, neither defendant\u2019s additional arguments nor the variants in their phrasing persuade us that the trial court committed an error or abuse of discretion prejudicial to defendant\u2019s case. Indeed, these contentions are not deserving of additional discussion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laursen, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 205.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">E. <em>Challenges to the Death Penalty Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">Defendant contends that many features of California\u2019s capital sentencing scheme, singly and in combination, violate the federal Constitution. We previously have rejected similar challenges, and because defendant has not presented any persuasive reason for us to reconsider those rulings, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">The 1978 death penalty law does not violate the Eighth Amendment by failing to distinguish between death-eligible and non-death-eligible murders in a meaningful and nonarbitrary way. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Combs, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 821, 868; <em>People v. Morrison </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 698, 729 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 682, 101 P.3d 568]; <em>People v. San Nicolas </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 614, 676-677 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 612, 101 P.3d 509]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 833, 884 &amp; <em>fn. </em>7 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 747, 62 P.3d 1]; <em>People v. Barnett </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 1044, 1179 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 121, 954 P.2d 384]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 119, 196 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 386, 931 P.2d 960]; <em>People v. Sanchez </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 1, 60-61 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 906 P.2d 1129]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanley </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 842-843 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481].) The special circumstances set forth in the statute are not overinclusive by their number or by their terms, nor have these categories been construed in an overly inclusive manner. <em>(People v. Ray </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 356 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 914 P.2d 846].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">Section 190.3, factor (a) does not bias the determination of penalty in favor of death, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, as defendant acknowledges.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> (See <em>People v. Duncan </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 955, 978-979 [281 Cal.Rptr. 273, 810 P.2d 131]; <em>People v. Murtishaw </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1001, 1020 [258 Cal.Rptr. 821, 773 P.2d 172].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">The use in section 190.3, factor (d) of the adjective \u201cextreme\u201d does not act as a barrier to the jury\u2019s proper consideration of defendant\u2019s evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>in mitigation.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> (See <em>People v. Morrison, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 698, 729.) Nor was it reasonably probable that, because of factor (d), the jury failed properly to weigh defendant\u2019s evidence in mitigation. To the contrary, we observe that the trial court in the instant case instructed the jury pursuant to section 190.3, factor (k) (factor (k)) as reflected in CALJIC No. 8.85, which provided the jury wide latitude to consider <em>any </em>extenuating circumstance in determining penalty.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 698 [upholding the validity of factor (d), in view of factor (k)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 754, 804 [276 Cal.Rptr. 827, 802 P.2d 330] [\u201c[T]here is no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have inferred from [CALJIC No. 8.85 (k)] that they could not consider mental or emotional disturbance <em>of any degree whatever </em>in mitigation of penalty\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s assertion that the factor (k) instruction is the least accurately understood of California\u2019s sentencing factors, contributing to \u201cpronounced\u201d \u201cconstitutional harm,\u201d we repeatedly have rejected challenges to its validity. (See, e.g., <em>People v. San Nicolas, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at pp. 675-676; see also <em>Boyde v. California </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 370, 381 [108 L.Ed.2d 316, 110 S.Ct. 1190] [upholding a predecessor version of factor (k)].) We do so again here. We also observe that defendant does not demonstrate that the jury misunderstood its function in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">CALJIC No. 8.88 (1989 rev.) is not inconsistent with the requirement set forth in section 190.3 that \u201cIf the trier of fact determines that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances [,] the trier of fact shall impose a sentence of confinement in state prison for a term of life without the possibility of parole.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>McPeters </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1148, 1194 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 832 P.2d 146] [rejecting a similar contention].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury (or otherwise require) that the jury must agree unanimously as to aggravating circumstances, that all aggravating factors must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that aggravation must outweigh mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt, and that death must be found to be the appropriate penalty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 421; <em>People v. Berryman </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1048, 1101-1102 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 867, 864 P.2d 40].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">The trial court\u2019s failure to delete inapplicable factors from the instructions given to the jury did not violate defendant\u2019s rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendments. <em>(People v. Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 421.) Moreover, as defendant acknowledges, the trial court instructed the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.85 that \u201conly those factors that are applicable on the evidence adduced at trial are to be taken into account in the penalty determination in the individual case.\u201d We therefore reject defendant\u2019s contention that he was deprived of his right to an individualized sentencing determination based upon permissible factors relating to him and the crimes he committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">The circumstance that under California law an individual prosecutor has discretion whether to seek the death penalty in a particular case did not deny defendant his constitutional rights to equal protection of the laws or to due process of law. <em>(People v. Barnett, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 1044, 1179; <em>People v. Ray, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 313, 359; <em>People v. Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 152 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887]; see also <em>Gregg v. Georgia </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 153, 225 [49 L.Ed.2d 859, 96 S.Ct. 2909] (cone. opn. of White, J.) [\u201cAbsent facts to the contrary, it cannot be assumed that prosecutors will be motivated in their charging decision by factors other than the strength of their case and the likelihood that a jury would impose the death penalty if it convicts.\u201d].) Moreover, nothing in the present case even remotely suggests that defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were denied by the decision of the San Diego County prosecutor to seek the death penalty. To the contrary, the evidence of defendant\u2019s penchant for overpowering young women and strangling them to death amply demonstrates that the prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek the death penalty was neither arbitrary nor capricious, but rather an appropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion in response to defendant\u2019s criminal rampage across California. Defendant, an apparently unremorseful serial killer and rapist, is precisely the type of individual against whom virtually any California prosecutor would seek the death penalty. Defendant is totally unconvincing in suggesting otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>E <em>Cumulative Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">Defendant contends that the cumulative effect of the asserted errors committed at his trial led to a miscarriage of justice, requiring reversal of the guilt and penalty phase judgments. Having determined that defendant\u2019s trial was nearly free of error, and that, to the extent error was committed, it clearly was harmless, we conclude that defendant\u2019s claim of cumulative error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-7\">The special circumstance of lying in wait is set aside.

After reviewing the statement of disqualification, I conducted a hearing with all parties and their counsel present in which I detailed the contacts I could remember with Mr. Pippin over the last 17 years. . . . HQ Although I was with the district attorney\u2019s office for almost 13 years, I have had relatively few contacts with Mr. Pippin. He was my supervisor for only four months in 1974, more than 15 years ago. During my last five years with the district attorney\u2019s office, I was a division chief assigned to the Juvenile Division and Mr. Pippin was assigned as a division chief in the Superior Court division. We were essentially equals in this capacity and had very little contact. HO The social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>functions we both attended were incidental to our professional responsibilities with the district attorney\u2019s office, rather than a reflection of any close personal friendship. Our social interaction over the years has been no different than that of any other member of the legal community who occasionally engages in social activities with members of the profession, ['ll] It is common practice for judges of this Court to perform wedding ceremonies for members of the legal community and their families. My agreement to perform the wedding ceremony for Mr. Pippin\u2019s daughter was such an arrangement and was done at his daughter\u2019s request, rather than Mr. Pippin\u2019s. I was not paid to perform the ceremony and specifically indicated that no fee should be paid. []Q Mr. Pippin\u2019s alleged comments regarding my predilection in ruling on motions dealing with constitutional challenges to the death penalty, are also unfounded. As I stated at the time of the hearing referenced above, I have never seen such a motion and would consider it premature to assume such a posture until I had been presented with the issue and reviewed it. [f] I am neither biased nor prejudiced for or against Mr. Pippin, the defendant or his counsel, and am satisfied that I can perform my duty to decide the issues presented fairly and impartially in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">Code of Civil Procedure, section 170.3, subdivision (d), provides: \u201cThe determination of the question of the disqualification of a judge is not an appealable order and may be reviewed only by a writ of mandate from the appropriate court of appeal sought within 10 days of notice to the parties of the decision and only by the parties to the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">Far from exhibiting bias, Judge Lasater\u2019s comment in fact was made while <em>explaining the basis </em>for the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s claim that he had been denied his right to testify in the Los Angeles proceedings.

S. rape charge in the San Diego proceedings, do not persuade us that the trial court below abused its discretion. To the contrary, the court reviewed in exhaustive detail the basis for its conclusion that severance was improper, observing, among other things, that the rape and murder charges were of the same class under section 954, each crime involved a forced entry into a residence, each involved evidence that a knife had been used, each involved theft, and each victim previously had been acquainted with defendant. Strong evidence linked defendant independently to the death of Janette Cullins and to the rape of Barbara S. Accordingly, the likelihood that the jury might convict defendant of having committed one of the charged crimes based on the evidence that he committed the other was virtually nonexistent. No abuse of discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to sever appears. Nor has defendant demonstrated that prejudice actually resulted from the joinder of the murder and rape charges at trial.

I write separately to address the merits of defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly commented on defendant\u2019s invocation of his right not to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-10\">Defendant was charged with the murder of Janette Cullins. In its case-in-chief, the prosecution presented evidence that defendant had also murdered four other women: Tok Kim, Susan Knoll, Jillette Mills, and Bonnie Guthrie. When defendant was arrested for the murders, he was driving a car belonging to murder victim Mills. In the car, the police found a key ring that belonged to victim Cullins; a kitchen knife, rubber gloves, and a gold chain, belonging to victim Kim; a supermarket CASHEX card that belonged to victim Knoll; towels, athletic wear, and photographic equipment that belonged to victim Mills; and three handwoven sweaters that belonged to victim Guthrie.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-11\">In his rebuttal argument to the jury, the prosecutor said: \u201cNo one prevents [the defense] from telling you what happened. No one prevents them from bringing forth witnesses to explain why the defendant was in the car with all that property. They could do that if they wanted to.\u201d Defense counsel objected, asserting the prosecutor was in essence commenting on defendant\u2019s invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination. Without ruling on the objection, the trial court instructed the jury that defendant had a constitutional right not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-12\">The majority does not decide whether the prosecutor\u2019s comment was proper, concluding that any error was harmless. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1266-1267.) In my view, the comment violated the rule established in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229]. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>There, the United States Supreme Court held that a prosecutor who comments on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify at trial violates the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, as protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. The court explained that such a comment \u201csolemnizes the silence of the accused into evidence against him,\u201d and thus \u201ccuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 614; see also <em>Portuondo v. Agard </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 61, 65 [146 L.Ed.2d 47, 120 S.Ct. 1119].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">This court has explained that, as a general rule, <em>Griffin v. California, supra, </em>380 U.S. 609, does not prevent prosecutors from commenting on the failure of the defense to introduce relevant evidence or to call logical witnesses. <em>(People v. Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 572 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776].) But <em>Griffin </em>does not allow a prosecutor to argue to the jury \u201cthat certain testimony or evidence is uncontradicted, if such contradiction or denial could be provided <em>only </em>by the defendant, who therefore would be required to take the witness stand.\u201d <em>(People v. Bradford </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1229, 1339 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 145, 939 P.2d 259]; see also <em>People v. Johnson </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1183, 1229 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 702, 842 P.2d 1] [\u201ca prosecutor errs by referring to evidence as \u2018uncontradicted\u2019 when the defendant, who elects not to testify, is the only person who could have refuted it\u201d]; <em>People v. Murtishaw </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 733, 757-758 [175 Cal.Rptr. 738, 631 P.2d 446].) Similarly, \u201ca prosecutor may not comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to present evidence to contradict the government\u2019s case if \u2018the defendant alone had the information to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>(U.S. v. Triplett </em>(8th Cir. 1999) 195 F.3d 990, 995.) To determine whether a prosecutor\u2019s comment violated <em>Griffin, </em>a reviewing court must decide whether there is a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the jury construed the remark as a commentary on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>(People v. Roybal </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 481, 514 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 966 P.2d 521]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 663 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">Here, the evidence presented to the jury at trial did not disclose the existence of any living person other than defendant who could have testified as to how defendant had acquired a car that belonged to one of the murder victims and that contained property belonging to each of the other murder victims. Nor would there necessarily be such a person if defendant were innocent of the murders. Thus, there is a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d <em>(People v. Roybal, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 514; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 663) that the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that nothing prevented the defense from \u201cbringing forth witnesses to explain why the defendant was in the car with all that property\u201d was construed by the jury as a commentary on defendant\u2019s failure to testify in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s improper comment does not, however, require reversal of the judgment. As the majority correctly explains, any error was harmless \u201cin view of the indirect nature of the prosecutor\u2019s comment, the court\u2019s timely reinstruction of the jury, and the strength of the evidence against defendant.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1267.) Thus, it is \u201cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Hasting </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 499, 511 [76 L.Ed.2d 96, 103 S.Ct. 1974]) even if the prosecutor had not made the comment at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied October 26, 2005, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
