The Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>Appeal upheld the trial court\u2019s sustaining of a demurrer. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">Plaintiff Steven Reynolds, on behalf of himself and those similarly situated,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleges he was employed by defendants Earl Scheib, Inc., and Earl Scheib of California, Inc. (hereafter jointly Scheib, or the corporate defendants), and by defendants Bement, Buchalter, Colburn, Helm, Kyman, Seigel, Sunkin, and Smith (hereafter collectively the individual defendants), as a \u201cshop manager\u201d and an \u201cassistant shop manager\u201d at several locations of defendants\u2019 automobile painting business. Defendants own and operate approximately 50 automobile painting shops in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">The individual defendants are shareholders of the corporate defendants and have at material times been agents (officers or directors) of the corporate defendants. Plaintiff alleges the individual defendants each \u201cdirectly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, employed or exercised control over wages, hours, or working conditions of Class members.\u201d Each individual defendant \u201cauthorized, directed, sanctioned, consented, cooperated, approved, aided, instigated, assisted, participated in, and voted for tortious and unlawful acts of commission or omission which have operated to the prejudice and injury of the Class, including but not limited to causing the corporate defendants to violate the overtime regulations found in the applicable wage order and commit other statutory violations.\u201d Notwithstanding each individual defendant \u201cknew or reasonably should have known that his conduct and/or conduct under his control was injuring the Class,\u201d each \u201cfailed to take or order appropriate action to avoid the harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">According to plaintiff, defendants had \u201ca policy and practice to require their Shop Managers in their Earl Scheib automobile paint shops to work long overtime hours without overtime compensation.\u201d Defendants allegedly misclassified class members as exempt employees and deprived them of statutory overtime compensation in order to maximize defendants\u2019 profits and income. As a consequence of defendants\u2019 actions, plaintiff and those similarly situated have not received statutorily guaranteed overtime compensation that is owed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>Plaintiff initially filed a complaint only against Scheib, seeking damages as well as equitable relief on behalf of himself, the general public, and similarly situated employees who worked at Scheib\u2019s automobile painting shops in California from March 13, 1996, to the present. Plaintiff subsequently added as a defendant Scheib\u2019s president, Christian Bement, who cross-complained and removed the case to federal court. After the case was remanded to state court, plaintiff named the seven remaining individual defendants, who thereafter demurred. The trial court sustained the demurrers with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">In the operative first amended complaint, plaintiff alleged numerous causes of action, including claims denominated as \u201cfailure to pay overtime compensation in violation of Labor Code sections 1194, 510 and applicable wage orders,\u201d unlawful deduction of wages, and various tortious violations of the Labor Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">The individual defendants demurred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to some causes of action and without leave to amend as to the others. Plaintiff did not amend, judgment was entered for defendants, and the entire action was dismissed with prejudice as against the individual defendants. The Court of Appeal affirmed. We granted plaintiff\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">Our task in reviewing a judgment sustaining a demurrer is to determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. <em>(Hill v. Miller </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 757, 759 [51 Cal.Rptr. 689, 415 P.2d 33].) We assume the truth of the properly pleaded material facts and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom. <em>(Coleman </em>v. <em>Gulf Ins. Group </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 782, 789, fn. 3 [226 Cal.Rptr. 90, 718 P.2d 77].) We give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. <em>(Speegle v. Board of Fire Underwriters </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 34, 42 [172 P.2d 867].) We also consider matters that may be judicially noticed. <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>A. <em>Overview: State Remedies for Unpaid Overtime</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">An employee\u2019s wage rights may be provided for in an employment contract and also are closely regulated by statute. \u201cThe Labor Code[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] prescribes such matters as the time and manner of paying wages, minimum wage requirements, and mandatory overtime pay . . . .\u201d <em>(Cuadra </em>v. <em>Millan </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 855, 858 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 952 P.2d 704]; see \u00a7 510, subd. (a).)4 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) is \u201cempowered to formulate regulations (known as wage orders) governing employment in the State of California.\u201d <em>(Tidewater Marine Western, Inc. v. Bradshaw </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 557, 561 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 186, 927 P.2d 296] <em>{Tidewater).) </em>The IWC has promulgated 18 orders that remain in force today, 16 relating to specific industries and occupations, one general minimum wage order that applies to all California employers and employees (excluding public employees and outside salespersons), and one order implementing the Eight-Hour-Day Restoration and Workplace Flexibility Act of 1999 (Stats. 1999, ch. 134, \u00a7 1). (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 11000 et seq.; especially <em>id., </em>\u00a7 11090, Order Regulating Wages, Hours, and Working Conditions in the Transportation Industry (hereafter Wage Order No. 9).)  The latter, Wage Order No. 9, is the IWC wage order applicable to persons employed in an automobile painting business. (See Wage Order No. 9, subd. 2(N).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), headed by the Labor Commissioner, is \u201cempowered to enforce California\u2019s labor laws, including IWC wage orders.\u201d <em>(Tidewater, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 561-562.) The Labor Commissioner is required to determine all matters arising under his or her jurisdiction, including questions concerning the employment status of any wage claimant. <em>(Post v. Palo/Haklar &amp; Associates </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 942, 947 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 4 P.3d 928], citing \u00a7 98, subd. (a).) The Legislature also has provided California workers a private right of action to vindicate their overtime rights. (See \u00a7 1194, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">Pursuant to the foregoing scheme, if \u201can employer fails to pay wages in the amount, time or manner required by contract or by statute, the employee has two principal options. The employee may seek <em>judicial </em>relief by filing an ordinary civil action against the employer for breach of contract and/or for the wages prescribed by statute. (\u00a7\u00a7 218, 1194.) Or the employee may seek <em>administrative </em>relief by filing a wage claim with the commissioner pursuant to a special statutory scheme codified in sections 98 to 98.8. The latter option was added by legislation enacted in 1976 (Stats. 1976, ch. 1190, \u00a7\u00a7 4\u201411, pp. 5368-5371) and is commonly known as the \u2018Berman\u2019 hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>procedure, after the name of its sponsor.\u201d <em>(Cuadra v. Millan, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 858, fn. omitted.) We also have recognized that, in an action brought pursuant to the unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), an employee may recover payment of unlawfully withheld wages as a restitutionary remedy. <em>(Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 177 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">In addition to the foregoing avenues for the recovery of wages, the Labor Commissioner or the employee may seek certain civil penalties when the employee is not paid statutorily guaranteed wages. (\u00a7 2699, subd. (a); see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 210 [penalty for failure to pay statutorily prescribed wages], 225.5 [penalty for unlawfully withholding wages], 558 [penalty for violating chapter or IWC order].) Under the recently enacted Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (\u00a7 2698 et seq., added by Stats. 2003, ch. 906, \u00a7 2), \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law, any provision of [the Labor C]ode that provides for a civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees . . . may, as an alternative, be [enforced, and the penalty] recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees . . .\u201d (\u00a7 2699, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">B. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cExercises Control\u201d Liability Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">In a series of regulations concerning employment in a wide variety of industries and occupations, the IWC since 1947 has defined \u201cemployer\u201d to include an individual who \u201cexercises control over the wages, hours, or working conditions of any person.\u201d (Wage Order No. 9, subd. 2(F) (hereafter the IWC employer definition).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Noting that section 510, in obligating \u201can employer\u201d to pay overtime compensation, does not define that term, and that section 1194, in providing \u201cany employee\u201d with a private right of action to recover unpaid minimum or overtime wages, does not specify potential defendants, plaintiff argues we should apply the IWC employer definition in order to determine who are proper defendants here. That definition, plaintiff asserts, includes corporate control figures like the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">While plaintiff does not contend any statute expressly subjects corporate control figures to liability, as employers, for unpaid wages, he argues that we can infer the IWC\u2019s authority to specify appropriate section 1194 defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>from its powers to fix a minimum wage and to provide safeguards to ensure employees receive the minimum and overtime wages due them. (See <em>Cal. Drive-in Restaurant Assn. v. Clark </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 287, 302 [140 P.2d 657] [discussing IWC\u2019s \u201cpower to provide safeguards to ensure receipt of the minimum wage\u201d].) Applying the IWC employer definition to corporate control figures, plaintiff posits, is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of section 1194. (See <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v. Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 392, 411 [128 Cal.Rptr. 183, 546 P.2d 687]; see generally Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11342.1 [scope of agency authority], 11342.2 [validity of regulations].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">The individual defendants disagree that the IWC employer definition applies to this case, insisting none of them may be held personally liable for any overtime or other compensation owed to plaintiff by his corporate employer. They argue that California\u2019s labor statutes do not impose personal liability on corporate officers and directors for unpaid wages owed by a corporate employer and that common law principles protect them against incurring civil liability, as employers, for economic harm plaintiff\u2019s corporate employer may have caused him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">In resolving the question, we look in the first instance not to the IWC\u2019s authority nor to the asserted necessity of its employer definition, but to the IWC\u2019s intent in promulgating the employer definition. The best indicator of that intent is the language of the provision itself. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 337, 350 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 882, 852 P.2d 377].) As plaintiff acknowledges, the plain language of Wage Order No. 9 defining employer does not expressly impose liability under section 1194 on individual corporate agents. Nor can we infer that the Legislature, simply by amending sections 510 and 1194 several times after the IWC adopted its employer definition, impliedly intended to incorporate that definition into a unified remedial scheme comprised of those statutes and the regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-7\">A statute will be construed in light of the common law unless the Legislature \u201c \u2018 \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d \u2019 \u201d indicates otherwise. <em>(California </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number><em>Assn. of Health Facilities v. Department of Health Services </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 284, 297 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 872, 940 P.2d 323].) We agree with the individual defendants that, had the Legislature intended to depart from the common law by engrafting Wage Order No. 9 onto section 1194, it would have more clearly manifested that intent. Neither section 510 nor section 1194 contains any reference to the IWC employer definition: section 510 in detailing certain obligations of \u201can employer\u201d leaves that term undefined; section 1194, without mentioning \u201cemployer,\u201d simply provides that \u201cany employee\u201d receiving less than the applicable legal minimum wage or legal overtime compensation is entitled to recover the same in a civil action.  \u201cIn this circumstance\u2014a statute referring to employees without defining the term\u2014 courts have generally applied the common law test of employment.\u201d <em>(Metropolitan Water Dist. v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 491, 500 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 857, 84 P.3d 966] [discussing Gov. Code, \u00a7 20028, subd. (b)].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cCalifornia courts have applied this interpretive rule to various statutes dealing with public and private employment.\u201d <em>(Metropolitan Water Dist., supra, </em>at p. 500; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 500, fn. 5, citing cases.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">Under the common law, corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency are not personally liable for the corporate employer\u2019s failure to pay its employees\u2019 wages. (See, e.g., <em>Oppenheimer </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 420, 424 [309 P.2d 887]; see generally 1 Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations (2002 supp.) \u00a7 41.) This is true regardless of whether a corporation\u2019s failure to pay such wages, in particular circumstances, breaches only its employment contract or also breaches a tort duty of care. It is \u201cwell established that corporate agents and employees acting for and on behalf of a corporation cannot be held liable for inducing a breach of the corporation\u2019s contract.\u201d <em>(Shoemaker v. Myers </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 24 [276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054].) And \u201c[d]irectors or officers of a corporation do not incur personal liability for torts of the corporation merely by reason of their official position . . .\u201d <em>(United States Liab. Ins. Co. v. Haidinger-Hayes, Inc. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 586, 595 [83 Cal.Rptr. 418, 463 P.2d 770]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the Court of Appeal that plaintiff cannot state a section 1194 cause of action against the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>defendants. Had the Legislature meant in section 1194 to expose to personal civil liability any corporate agent who \u201cexercises control\u201d over an employee\u2019s wages, hours, or working conditions, it would have manifested its intent more clearly than by mere silence after the IWC\u2019s promulgation of Wage Order No. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">The DLSE, as amicus curiae, warns that the Court of Appeal\u2019s failure to accept plaintiff\u2019s theory of corporate agent liability based on the IWC employer definition may pose an obstacle to the Labor Commissioner\u2019s ability to recover some wages owed to California employees. Apparently it is existing DLSE practice in wage claim actions prosecuted (\u00a7 98.3) or informally heard and determined (\u00a7 98) by the Labor Commissioner to apply the IWC employer definition, including its \u201cexercises control\u201d prong, so as to permit the naming of certain corporate agents as joint defendants with corporate employers. The DLSE, concerned lest its practice in this regard be called into question, urges that we recognize plaintiff\u2019s theory and direct California courts to apply it in private court actions (as the DLSE apparently does in the administrative context) in light of federal cases determining, on the basis of \u201ceconomic reality,\u201d who qualifies as an employer under the ELSA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">We previously have determined that the DLSE\u2019s administrative policies are not due general interpretive deference unless they are promulgated in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, section 11340 et seq. of the Government Code. (See <em>Tidewater, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 568-577.)  And while it is true that \u201c[fjederal decisions have frequently guided our interpretation of state labor provisions the language of which parallels that of federal statutes\u201d <em>(Building Material &amp; Construction Teamsters' Union v. Farrell </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 651, 658 [224 Cal.Rptr. 688, 715 P.2d 648]), \u201cwhere the language or intent of state and federal labor laws substantially differ[s], reliance on federal regulations or interpretations to construe state regulations is misplaced\u201d <em>(Ramirez v. Yosemite Water Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 785, 798 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 978 P.2d 2]). While the ELSA contains an express definition of \u201cemployer\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(d)),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> section 1194 does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-8\">In any event, we have no occasion in resolving this private dispute to address questions concerning the DLSE\u2019s use, in administrative proceedings, of the IWC employer definition. Nor are we persuaded that our narrow holding that plaintiff cannot employ the IWC employer definition to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>section 1194 cause of action against the individual defendants will have the sweeping effect the DLSE fears. Defendants concede the DLSE may utilize the IWC employer definition in exercising its prosecutorial discretion to determine who are appropriate wage claim defendants. And while the DLSE in its adjudicatory role (see generally \u00a7 98 [Berman hearings]; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 13502) is of course obligated to follow the substantive law (\u00a7\u00a7 95, 98, subd. (a)), there is no question that IWC wage orders are among the valid sources thereof (\u00a7 517, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">We also disagree that our holding today poses an obstacle to the Labor Commissioner\u2019s recovering wages owed California workers. Imposition of individual civil liability under the IWC employer definition is not the only means by which an employee can seek recovery against a corporate agent. \u201cThe Berman hearing procedure is designed to provide a speedy, informal, and affordable method of resolving wage claims\u201d <em>(Cuadra v. Millan, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 858), and, as defendants concede, nothing in that process precludes hearing officers from finding individual corporate agents liable for unpaid wages when such liability is proven on established common law<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or statutory* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> theories.

There can be no liability, moreover, \u201cif the alleged conspirator, though a participant in the agreement underlying the injury, was not personally bound by the duty violated by the wrongdoing and was acting only as the agent or employee of the party who did have that duty.\u201d <em>(Doctors' Co. v.

(See, e.g., <em>Oppenheimer v. Robinson, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.2d at p. 424 [employee not personally liable for nonpayment of wages to fellow employee]; <em>Oppenheimer v.

Plaintiff concedes the Court of Appeal below correctly concluded he cannot amend the complaint to allege more specific facts respecting his causes of action denominated in the first amended complaint as conversion, negligence per se, negligence, violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., declaratory relief, accounting, and injunctive relief. In his petition for review, however, plaintiff asked us to decide whether the Court of Appeal erred in denying him leave to amend his causes of action for \u201cunlawful deductions\u201d and for allegedly tortious violations of various Labor Code sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">We are not persuaded either court below erred. Whether to grant leave to amend a complaint is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. <em>(Campbell v. Regents of the University of Cal. </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 311, 320 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 320, 106 P.2d 976].)

We agree with defendants that plaintiff forfeited any further leave to amend by failing to request leave in the trial court or to argue in the Court of Appeal that the trial court\u2019s denial as to specific causes of action was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s oblique comment at the hearing on the demurrer that \u201cI suppose we could state a common law fraud claim\u201d cannot fairly be interpreted as a request for leave to amend his complaint to include additional factual allegations. (See generally 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 1132, p. 587.) Nor did plaintiff\u2019s assertion in his opening brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>below that the standards set forth under section 216 (respecting, inter alia, false denial of wages) \u201ccan be imputed to a fraud cause of action and the claim as stated should be interpreted as such,\u201d either raise or argue the amendment issue. As plaintiff concedes, not until he petitioned for rehearing did he present to the Court of Appeal any \u201cadditional facts that were alleged, that could have been alleged, and could have been reasonably inferred.\u201d \u201cIt is well settled that arguments, including insufficiency of the evidence, cannot be raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing.\u201d <em>(Gentis v.

(Lab.

Bradshaw </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 557, 561 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 186, 927 P.2d 296].) As defined in the relevant wage order for purposes of this case, an employer is any individual \u201cwho directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, employs or exercises control over the wages, hours, or working conditions of any person.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 11090, subd. (2)(F).) Armed with this definition, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>contends liability for unpaid overtime wages extends to certain corporate officers and agents who meet the \u201cexercises control\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">As a legal argument, plaintiff\u2019s position is not untenable, but it has a certain labyrinthine quality that, ultimately, cannot conceal the absence of any clear indication of legislative intent that the wage order\u2019s definition of \u201cemployer\u201d apply to section 1194 actions. Therefore I concur with the majority. I write separately to bring this issue to the Legislature\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">The underlying question in this case is whether, under certain narrowly circumscribed conditions, workers should be able to sue corporate officers and agents for unpaid overtime wages where the corporate form is being misused to defraud workers of these wages. Relevant to consideration of this issue is our recent observation in <em>Sav-on Drug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 319, 340 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 906, 96 P.3d 194]: \u201cLabor Code section 1194 confirms \u2018a clear public policy . . . that is specifically directed at the enforcement of California\u2019s minimum wage and overtime laws for the benefit of workers.\u2019 \u201d It also bears repeating that overtime pay \u201crelates but incidentally to wages\u201d and that the underlying purpose of the wage laws \u201cconcem[s] not only the health and welfare of the workers themselves, but also the public health and general welfare.\u201d <em>(California Grape etc. League v. Industrial Welfare Com. </em>(1969) 268 Cal.App.2d 692, 703 [74 Cal.Rptr. 313].) In other words, the public as a whole has a stake in enforcing the overtime wage law and creating deterrents to violations of that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">The abuse of the corporate form to avoid paying overtime wages is well documented, as is the identity of the workers who are most often the victims of this abuse. \u201cIncreasingly, employers are incorporating instead of operating as sole proprietors or partnerships. As corporations go out of business, the sole shareholders or majority shareholders are protected from personal liability for the debts of the corporation, including wage debts, even though they profit from the unpaid labor of workers.\u201d (Foo, <em>The Informal Economy: The Vulnerable and Exploitable Immigrant Workforce and the Need for Strengthening Worker Protection Legislation </em>(1994) 103 Yale L.J. 2179, 2201.) \u201cEmployers faced with large wage judgments often play the \u2018shell game\u2019\u2014that is, they close down one corporation and start up another. The corporate shield of limited liability protects shareholders, directors, and officers from personal liability for the wages of their former employees. Former employees are unable to reach the assets of the new corporation or company because of the legal fiction that the predecessor and successor are separate legal entities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 2189.) The workers most often affected by these abuses are low-wage workers, often non-English-speaking immigrants in the garment, restaurant, electronics, and agricultural industries. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 2209.) The amicus curiae brief of the Division of Labor Standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>Enforcement describes such a case, involving three defunct garment contractors, all closely held corporations owned by members of a single family. The business failed to pay any wages to more than 250 employees over a two-month period in 2001, even as the officers and sole shareholders encouraged their employees to continue working with false promises of eventual wages. <em>(Lujan v. Wong et al. </em>(Super. Ct. S.F. City and County, 2002, No. 404939).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">The exploitation of such vulnerable workers by unscrupulous individuals hiding behind the corporate form takes place against a backdrop of diminished public resources for the enforcement of the state\u2019s labor laws. The Legislature itself has acknowledged this problem in the uncodified portions of section 2698, the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (the Private Attorneys General Act), wherein the Legislature states: \u201cStaffing levels for state labor law enforcement agencies have, in general, declined over the last decade and are likely to fail to keep up with the growth of the labor market in the future.\u201d (Stats. 2003, ch. 906, \u00a7 1, subd. (c).) This recognition was, indeed, a spur to the enactment of the Private Attorneys General Act which, in time, may provide workers with a mechanism for recovering unpaid overtime wages through private enforcement of section 558, which authorizes civil penalties for violations of the wage laws that include unpaid wages from \u201c[a]ny employer or other person acting on behalf of an employer,\u201d a phrase conceivably broad enough to include corporate officers and agents in some cases. (\u00a7 558, subd. (a).) The Private Attorneys General Act remains, however, untested at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">Section 1194, by contrast, is an established remedy directed specifically at the recovery of unpaid overtime wages. Given the Legislature\u2019s stated commitment to the enforcement of the state\u2019s labor laws, and its willingness to entrust enforcement of those laws, in some cases, to workers themselves, it would make sense for the Legislature to extend the reach of section 1194 to include individuals who are directly responsible for the nonpayment of overtime wages but who hide behind the corporate form. Permitting workers to recover unpaid overtime wages from corporate officers and agents in some limited circumstances is neither a novel nor an untested remedy. As plaintiff and various amici curiae point out, the federal equivalent of section 1194 contained in the Federal Labor Standards Act (FLSA) has long given workers this right under a definition of \u201cemployer\u201d that includes \u201cany person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203 (d).) In construing this language, federal courts apply a standard that looks, not simply at the corporate form, but also to the underlying economic reality of whose hand is on the tiller when it comes to payment (or nonpayment) of overtime wages. (See, e.g., <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Agnew </em>(1st Cir. 1983) 712 F.2d 1509, 1514 [under the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d approach, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>corporate officers with significant ownership interest who exercised \u201coperational control of significant aspects of the corporation\u2019s day to day functions\u201d including employee compensation and \u201cwho personally made decisions to continue operations despite financial adversity\u201d are employers within the meaning of the FLSA and \u201cchargeable with personal liability for failure to pay minimum and overtime wages as required by the FLSA\u201d].) Taking a leaf from federal law, the Legislature could similarly authorize section 1194 actions against such individuals. I urge the Legislature to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">On September 7, 2005, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1132-12\">All further statutory references, unless otherwise specified, are to the Labor Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
