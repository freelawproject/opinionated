Resources Code, \u00a7 2710 et seq.)?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2We conclude he has.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>2</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">SMARA, enacted in 1975 (Stats. 1975, ch. 1131, \u00a7 11, p. 2793), requires that California surface miners provide reclamation plans for their mining operations and financial assurances to implement those plans. (\u00a7 2770, subd. (a).) A reclamation plan under SMARA is a written plan specifying how mined land will be treated so as to minimize the environmental impacts of mining and render a mined site usable in the future for alternative purposes. (See \u00a7 2733.) Financial assurances are a mine operator\u2019s pledges of funds sufficient to perform reclamation in accordance with an approved reclamation plan. (\u00a7 2773.1, subd. (a)(1).) SMARA prohibits the continuation past stated dates of any surface mining operation not covered by a reclamation plan and financial assurances that have been approved by the \u201clead agency\u201d responsible for that operation. (\u00a7 2770, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Respondent and real party in interest Loring Brunius operates two surface mines, Weber Creek Quarry and Diamond Quarry, in respondent County. County, as designated lead agency, was primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with SMARA in its jurisdiction. (\u00a7 2774.1, subd. (f).) The Director is vested with control of the Department of Conservation (Department) (see \u00a7 601) and also is assigned various responsibilities under SMARA (see, e.g\u201e \u00a7\u00a7 2774, 2774.1, 2796, 2796.5), as will be explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Both the Director and the State Mining and Geology Board (Board) (see \u00a7 660 et seq.) in the mid-1990\u2019s sought to enforce SMARA against Brunius, who at the time was operating both of his quarries without approved reclamation plans or financial assurances. In June 1995, the Director obtained a stipulated judgment requiring Brunius to pay $70,000 in administrative penalties subject to reduction if Brunius complied with SMARA by certain dates. When Brunius failed timely to comply, the Director ordered him to cease all mining activity at Weber Creek Quarry and Diamond Quarry. Brunius, however, having subsequently submitted reclamation plans and financial assurances, obtained a preliminary injunction against operation of the Director\u2019s order, in light of Brunius\u2019s pending applications for County\u2019s approval of his plans and assurances. The Board, for its part, finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>County had, in violation of SMARA, allowed Weber Creek Quarry to operate since 1982 without an approved reclamation plan and since 1994 without approved financial assurances, commenced SMARA\u2019s prescribed procedures for assuming lead agency powers in the County. (\u00a7 2774.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">As part of the review process of Brunius\u2019s reclamation plans and financial assurances, the Director submitted extensive comments as to their inadequacy. In July 1997, County\u2019s Planning Commission nevertheless approved the plans and assurances, as well as a mitigated negative declaration under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (\u00a7 21000 et seq.; see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15000 et seq., especially <em>id., </em>\u00a7 15070), for both Weber Creek Quarry and Diamond Quarry. The Director appealed these approvals to County\u2019s Board of Supervisors, which adopted the mitigated negative declarations and approved the plans and assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Our question arises out of the Director\u2019s filing, in September 1997, two petitions for writs of administrative mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) against County and Brunius, seeking to vacate County\u2019s approvals as in violation of both SMARA and CEQA. The Director alleged that Brunius\u2019s reclamation plans did not meet SMARA\u2019s specifications and that his financial assurances were inadequate. The Director also alleged that County had violated CEQA in approving the mitigated negative declarations for Brunius\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">The Director\u2019s two petitions subsequently were consolidated. In March 1998, the Director filed amended petitions, adding allegations that County had (1) erroneously concluded Brunius possessed a vested right to operate Weber Creek Quarry without a permit, and (2) allowed Brunius unlawfully to expand operations at Diamond Quarry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">The California Mining Association, the Construction Materials Association of California, and the Southern California Rock Products Association (Interveners), all trade associations, were granted leave to intervene. County, Brunius, and Interveners each demurred on the ground the Director lacked standing. The trial court overruled the demurrers, and the Court of Appeal denied Interveners\u2019 and County\u2019s petitions for writs of mandate or other relief from the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">In answering the Director\u2019s petitions, County and Brunius alleged the Director\u2019s lack of standing as an affirmative defense; the Interveners\u2019 complaint also alleged the Director\u2019s lack of standing. The trial court granted County summary adjudication on the Director\u2019s claim in the Weber Creek Quarry writ that County erred in finding the Weber Creek Quarry was a \u201cvested use,\u201d exempt from various SMARA and permitting requirements. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>trial court then granted County and Brunius\u2019s motion to dismiss the CEQA claims for the Director\u2019s failure timely to request a hearing (\u00a7 21167.4). Finally, the trial court dismissed the Director\u2019s remaining SMARA claims on the ground the Director lacked standing to maintain them. The trial court awarded attorney fees to County, Brunius, and the Interveners under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">A divided Court of Appeal affirmed on standing grounds the dismissal of the Director\u2019s SMARA and CEQA claims, but reversed the trial court\u2019s attorney fees award. The Department, Brunius, and County each filed a petition for review. We granted all three petitions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">We are concerned here not with the merits of the underlying dispute, but only with the procedural question whether the Director has standing to petition for a writ of mandate. Answering this question requires us to examine the Director\u2019s role, generally, as the executive officer of a state department and, more specifically, within SMARA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">A. <em>Statutory Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">The majority in the Court of Appeal below accurately detailed the relevant statutory background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-9\">\u201cWithin the Resources Agency is the Department of Conservation (the Department). The head of the Department is an executive officer appointed by the Governor, known as the Director. (\u00a7 601.) The Department\u2019s work is divided into at least four divisions: mines and geology; oil, gas, and geothermal resources; land conservation; and recycling. (\u00a7 607.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-10\">\u201cAlso in the Department is the nine-member State Mining and Geology Board. (\u00a7 660.) . . . The Board represents the state\u2019s interests in the development, utilization, and conservation of mineral resources in California and the reclamation of mined lands, and in federal matters pertaining to mining. The Board also determines, establishes, and maintains an adequate surface mining and reclamation policy. (\u00a7 672.) Although the Director is the head of the Department, he does not control the Board; the Director has no power to amend or repeal any order, ruling, or directive of the Board. (\u00a7 671.) HI ... m</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>\u201cThe Legislature [in adopting SMARA] intended to create and maintain an effective surface mining and reclamation policy to prevent or minimize adverse environmental effects, reclaim mined lands to a usable condition which is ad[a]ptable to alternative uses, and encourage the production and conservation of minerals while giving consideration to values relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, and aesthetic enjoyment. (\u00a7 2712.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-4\">\u201cAt the heart of SMARA is the requirement that every surface mining operation have a permit, a reclamation plan, and financial assurances. (\u00a7 2770, subd. (a).). . . The financial assurances must remain in effect for the duration of the mining operation and until reclamation is complete and shall be made payable to the lead agency and the Department. (\u00a7 2773.1, subd. (a)(2).) The financial assurances may be forfeited if the lead agency or the Board determines the operator is financially incapable of performing reclamation in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, or has abandoned its surface mining operation without commencing reclamation. (\u00a7 2773.1, subd. (b).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-5\">\u201cIn keeping with the recognition of the diverse conditions throughout the state, SMARA provides for \u2018home rule,\u2019 with the local lead agency having primary responsibility. A lead agency is usually the city or county. (\u00a7 2728.) The mining operator submits the reclamation plan and financial assurances to the lead agency for review. (\u00a7 2770, subd. (d); \u00a7 2772.) The Board, through regulations, specifies minimum statewide reclamation standards. (\u00a7 2773.) A lead agency, however, may permit a mining operation to deviate from these standards, if necessary based on the approved end use. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 3700.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-6\">\u201cTo implement its review of proposed reclamation plans and financial assurances, every lead agency is to adopt ordinances in accordance with state policy. (\u00a7 2774, subd. (a).) The Board shall review these ordinances and certify that they are in compliance with state policy. (\u00a7 2774.3.) If the Board finds deficiencies in the lead agency\u2019s ordinance, the Board shall communicate the deficiencies to the lead agency. (\u00a7 2774.5, subd. (a).) After an opportunity to revise the ordinance to comply with state policy, if the Board finds the ordinance is still deficient, the Board shall assume full responsibility for review of reclamation plans. (\u00a7 2774.5, subd. (b).) If the lead agency does not have a certified ordinance, reclamation plans shall be submitted to and approved by the Board. (\u00a7 2774.5, subd. (c).) The Board may amend any reclamation plan that was approved by a lead agency at the time the lead agency\u2019s ordinance did not comply with state policy. (\u00a7 2774.5, subd. (c).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-7\">\u201cPrior to approving reclamation plans and financial assurances, the lead agency submits the proposals and all supporting documentation, including information from any document prepared, adopted or certified pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>CEQA, to the Director for review. (\u00a7 2774, subd. (c).) The Director then may prepare written comments, if he chooses, within 30 days for reclamation plans and 45 days for financial assurances. (\u00a7 2774, subd. (d)(1).) The lead agency shall prepare written responses to the Director\u2019s comments, describing disposition of the major issues raised. In particular, the lead agency shall explain in detail why any specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. (\u00a7 2774, subd. (d)(2).) Thus, although the lead agency must evaluate and respond to the Director\u2019s comments, it need not always accept them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-4\">\u201cIf a lead agency fails to approve a reclamation plan or financial assurances, an appeal may be taken to the Board. (\u00a7 2770, subd. (e).) As originally enacted, SMARA did not contain enforcement provisions. (Stats. 1975, ch. 1131, \u00a7 11, pp. 2793-2803.) As the author explained, SMARA did not contain enforcement provisions \u2018because the bill provides for a local regulatory program. Enforcement provisions would be embodied in local ordinances.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-5\">\u201cIn 1990, in response to concerns about deficiencies of lead agencies in carrying out their responsibilities under SMARA, the Legislature substantially amended SMARA. The amendments provided for various types of enforcement, against both mine operators and lead agencies. Enforcement against mine operators includes notices of violations and fines. (\u00a7 2774.1, subds. (a)-(c).) The lead agency has primary responsibility for enforcing SMARA against mine operators. (\u00a7 2774.1, subd. (f)(1).) Where the Board is not acting as the lead agency, the Director may initiate enforcement actions where (1) the Director has notified the lead agency of the violation and the lead agency fails to take action within 15 days, or (2) the Director determines the violation amounts to imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or safety, or to the environment. (\u00a7 2774.1, subd. (f)(1).) Similarly, the Director may take actions to seek forfeiture of financial assurances where the lead agency has failed to act or has been unsuccessful. (\u00a7 2773.1, subd. (d).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-6\">\u201cWhere the lead agency fails to fulfill its duties under SMARA, the Board may take over the powers of a lead agency, except for permitting authority. The Board may step in if it finds that a lead agency has: (1) approved reclamation plans and financial assurances that are not consistent with SMARA; (2) failed to inspect mines as required by SMARA; (3) failed to seek forfeiture of financial assurances to carry out reclamation; (4) failed to take appropriate enforcement actions; (5) intentionally misrepresented the results of inspections; or (6) failed to submit the required information to the Department. (\u00a7 2774, subd. (a).) The Board may take over as lead agency where the lead agency fails to submit a copy of the mining permit for every surface mining operation within its jurisdiction by July 1, 1991, or fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>submit amendments to the permit or reclamation plans for such mines by July 1 of each subsequent year. (\u00a7 2774, subd. (e).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-4\">\u201cSMARA contains three specific provisions for petitioning for a writ of mandate. Any person may petition for a writ of mandate to compel the Board, the state geologist, [fn. omitted] or the Director to carry out any duty imposed on them by SMARA. (\u00a7 2716.) An operator may petition for a writ of mandate to review any administrative penalties imposed. (\u00a7 2774.2, subd. (e).) A lead agency, an operator, or an interested party may obtain writ review of the Board\u2019s action in taking over as lead agency. (\u00a7 2774.4, subd. (f).)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The parties highlight three considerations bearing on the question whether the Director has standing: (1) that a writ of mandate \u201cmust be issued upon the verified petition of the party beneficially interested\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) that the Director is vested with significant, but limited, powers and responsibilities under SMARA; and (3) that \u201c[t]he head of each [state] department may make investigations and prosecute actions concerning . . . [(J[] matters relating to the business activities and subjects under the jurisdiction of the department\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11180, subd. (a)). We briefly explain each.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">\n<em>Beneficial interest requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">As noted, standing to seek a writ of mandate ordinarily requires that a party be \u201cbeneficially interested\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086), i.e., have \u201csome special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.\u201d <em>(Carsten v. Psychology Examining Com. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 793, 796 [166 Cal.Rptr. 844, 614 P.2d 276].) This standard, we have stated, \u201cis equivalent to the federal \u2018injury in fact\u2019 test, which requires a party to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it has suffered \u2018an invasion of a legally protected interest that is [both] \u201c(a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent <em>(Associated Builders &amp; Contractors, Inc. v. San Francisco Airports Com. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 352, 362 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 654, 981 P.2d 499].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">\n<em>Director\u2019s role under SMARA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">The majority in the Court of Appeal below based its decision primarily on \u201cdeference to the legislative scheme\u201d and what it discerned therein to be \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s delicate balancing between home rule, which permits local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>elected officials to make land use decisions, and effective and consistent statewide enforcement of SMARA.\u201d The majority saw as especially significant \u201cthe limited advisory role of the Director\u201d as compared to the Board\u2019s ability to take over the powers of a lead agency. It reasoned that \u201cthe Director\u2019s limited role under SMARA, especially when compared to the Board\u2019s role in overseeing lead agencies, establishes that SMARA does not give the Director standing to petition for judicial review of a lead agency\u2019s actions in approving reclamation plans and financial assurances that do not comply with SMARA.\u201d We examine the Director\u2019s role under SMARA in detail, <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">\n<em>Government Code section 11180</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">In concluding the Director had standing to pursue this mandate action, the dissenting justice below relied primarily on Government Code section 11180. The statute provides that the head of each state department \u201cmay make investigations and prosecute actions concerning: [(J[] (a) All matters relating to the business activities and subjects under the jurisdiction of the department.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the dissenting justice\u2019s view, the statute confers standing on a department head if the department head is bringing an action \u201crelating to\u201d the business of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">While we have construed Government Code section 11180\u2019s grant of investigatory powers liberally (see <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 475, 479-480 [55 Cal.Rptr. 217, 421 P.2d 65]), we have not addressed whether the statute\u2019s grant of prosecutorial powers warrants similar construction. And while the two California courts that have considered Government Code section 11180\u2019s implications for standing have concluded that the department head involved had standing to pursue the action at issue, neither court relied exclusively on Government Code section 11180 in reaching that conclusion. (See <em>People ex rel. Dept. of Conservation v. Triplett </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 233, 252-256 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 610] (Triplett) [Department\u2019s standing rested in part on interest in Williamson Act cancellation fees]; <em>Tieberg v. Superior Court </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 277, 282-284 [52 Cal.Rptr. 33] (Tieberg) [Director of Department of Employment\u2019s standing to challenge Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board decision rested in part on interest in proper administration of unemployment insurance fund].) As will appear, we likewise eschew exclusive reliance on Government Code section 11180 in concluding the Director had standing to bring the actions at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>B. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">As we shall explain, neither standing analysis proffered in the Court of Appeal below is entirely correct. The majority misread SMARA as impliedly depriving the Director of standing to seek judicial review of inadequate reclamation plans and financial assurances and too narrowly construed the concept of \u201cbeneficial interest\u201d with respect to the Director\u2019s responsibilities. The dissenting justice, in turn, while reaching the right result, mistakenly identified Government Code section 11180 as an independent source of the Director\u2019s standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">As the majority below discerned, Government Code section 11180 only authorizes the Director to sue; it does not of itself confer standing. \u201c \u2018There is a difference between the <em>capacity </em>to sue, which is the right to come into court, and the <em>standing </em>to sue, which is the right to relief in court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1604 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 443].) The statutory authorization granted department heads to sue, no matter how broadly construed, cannot alone confer on the Director standing to pursue a writ of mandate here, because such authorization does not necessarily create in him a \u201cbeneficial interest\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086) in the writ\u2019s issuance. Notwithstanding Government Code section 11180, nothing logically precludes the Legislature from crafting a departmental director\u2019s powers and duties such that he or she lacks a beneficial interest sufficient to confer standing to sue respecting some particular \u201cbusiness activities and subjects under the jurisdiction of the department\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11180, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">No party or amicus curiae identifies an instance of the Legislature\u2019s having so limited a department head\u2019s authority, however, nor are we aware of any. We conclude that, in any event, the Legislature has not crafted SMARA to deprive the Director of standing to seek mandate as a remedy when a local lead agency approves allegedly inadequate reclamation plans or financial assurances. Rather, correctly understood, the Director\u2019s standing to prosecute this petition for a writ of mandate derives from his \u201cbeneficial interest\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086)\u2014under SMARA and, generally, as a state officer charged with serving the public interest\u2014in the adequacy of approved reclamation plans and financial assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">First, the Director\u2019s powers and responsibilities under SMARA raise in him a beneficial interest in lead agencies\u2019 approving adequate plans and assurances. As noted, the Director is entitled to review and comment on every reclamation plan submitted to a lead agency for approval. (\u00a7 2774, subds. (c), (d); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 3805.) It is on this basis, presumably, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>that the majority below characterized the Director\u2019s responsibilities as \u201cprimarily advisory.\u201d But the Director\u2019s review and comment power is not <em>merely </em>advisory; rather, its exercise triggers significant statutory obligations on the part of the lead agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">Initially, the lead agency must submit to the Director for review the mining operator\u2019s reclamation plan or plan amendments and financial assurances, together with any related documents prepared, adopted, or certified pursuant to CEQA. (\u00a7 2774, subd. (c).) In so doing, the lead agency is required to certify to the Director that the reclamation plan is \u201cin compliance with the applicable requirements ... of the California Code of Regulations\u201d implementing SMARA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 2774, subd. (c).) The lead agency also is required to evaluate, \u201cwithin a reasonable amount of time\u201d (id., subd. (d)(1)), the Director\u2019s written comments relating to the submitted plan or assurances and must prepare a written response describing its disposition of the major issues raised (id., subd. (d)(2)). In this response, the lead agency must \u201caddress, in detail, why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted\u201d <em>(ibid..). </em>While the Director\u2019s responsibilities in this part of the SMARA process are advisory in form (in that the lead agency is not required to accept his suggestions), the general interest his review serves, patently, is SMARA compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">We note that, even were the Director\u2019s responsibilities limited to an advisory role, that would not necessarily deprive him of a beneficial interest in the approval by local agencies of adequate reclamation plans and financial assurances. As one California court has recognized in the related context of agricultural land conservation, the Legislature\u2019s having invested the Department with power to \u201cadvise any interested person or entity\u201d about a conservation statute\u2019s purposes and implementation \u201cpoints to the conclusion that the State has standing\u201d to enforce the statute\u2019s substantive provisions, even if a local agency has the primary responsibility for implementing the statute. <em>(Triplett, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at pp. 253-254; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 51206.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">In any event, the Director\u2019s powers and responsibilities under SMARA are not limited to advice and comment. Once a reclamation plan has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>been approved, the Director has express authority to ensure that state law and the reclamation plan are implemented. (See generally \u00a7 2774.1.) The Director has power to inspect any mining operation and, if he determines it is not in compliance with SMARA, he is empowered to order the operator to comply (\u00a7 2774.1, subd. (a)). If after a hearing before the Board the operator fails to comply, the Director may impose administrative penalties of up to $5,000 per day (id., subds. (b), (c)). And if the Director determines the violation \u201cpresents an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or the environment,\u201d he may request the Attorney General on his behalf to seek a court order enjoining the operation. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).) Finally, upon the Director\u2019s complaint, the Attorney General may bring an action to recover administrative penalties against a person violating SMARA or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Plainly, these broad enforcement powers and responsibilities, directed as they are towards overall SMARA compliance and the fulfillment of state reclamation policy generally, confer on the Director a \u201cspecial interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large\u201d <em>(Carsten v. Psychology Examining Com., supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 796).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">For instance, if a mine operator manages, through whatever device, to obtain local lead agency approval of reclamation plans that do not comply with SMARA or its attendant regulations, or that lack safeguards sufficient to facilitate effective administrative oversight and implementation, the Director may be hampered or frustrated in subsequent efforts to enjoin or penalize mining that, on inspection, he determines compromises or threatens to compromise SMARA\u2019s public health and environmental goals. Under such circumstances, of course, simply enforcing the mine operator\u2019s statutory obligation to perform reclamation in accordance with his approved reclamation plan (\u00a7 2773.1, subd. (b)) would by hypothesis be inadequate. Accordingly, the Director has an interest in adequate review of the original approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">Similarly, the Director may be hampered or frustrated in the execution of his statutory powers and responsibilities if he is not permitted to seek judicial review when a lead agency approves allegedly inadequate financial assurances. A fundamental propose of SMARA is that surface mine operators, rather than the taxpaying public, bear the expense of reclaiming lands disturbed by surface mining. To that end, lead agencies must require that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>mine operator\u2019s financial assurances be sufficient to perform reclamation. (\u00a7 2770, subd. (d).) The mine operator is responsible for posting adequate assurances (\u00a7 2773.1, subd. (a)) and for payment of any costs of reclamation in accordance with the approved plan that are in excess of the assurances (id., subd. (b)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">The Director\u2019s statutory powers and responsibilities relating to financial assurances submitted under SMARA reveal his substantial interest in their adequacy. Pursuant to SMARA, such assurances are to be made payable to the Department, as well as to the lead agency. (\u00a7 2773.1, subd. (a)(4).) Under specified circumstances, the Director may seek forfeiture of financial assurances and undertake reclamation of mines. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).) Specifically, if the lead agency or the Board, following a public hearing, determines an operator is financially incapable of performing reclamation in accordance with its approved plan, or has abandoned its mining operation without commencing reclamation, the Director may notify the operator that he intends to take appropriate action to forfeit the financial assurances and, after allowing the operator 60 days to commence reclamation, may \u201c[p]roceed to take appropriate action to require forfeiture of the financial assurances if the operator does not substantially comply\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)(3)), using the proceeds from the forfeited financial assurances to \u201cconduct and complete reclamation in accordance with the approved reclamation plan\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)(4)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">Obviously, if in a case implicating the Director\u2019s statutory power to seek forfeiture of financial assurances and conduct reclamation, those assurances prove inadequate to accomplish the task, the Director cannot effectively discharge his responsibility. In such circumstances, instead of the operator paying the full cost of reclamation, the taxpaying public likely will bear part or all of the burden. Accordingly, whenever a local lead agency approves allegedly inadequate financial assurances, the Director has an interest in obtaining a writ of mandate to address the deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>Thus, the Director\u2019s statutorily conferred powers and responsibilities\u2014those expressly granted him under SMARA, as well as those inhering in his capacity as the executive officer of the state department charged with SMARA\u2019s implementation\u2014create in him a substantial interest in reclamation plans and financial assurances being both legally consistent with SMARA and practically adequate to accomplish SMARA\u2019s goals and state reclamation policy promulgated thereunder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, when a local lead agency approves allegedly illegal or inadequate plans or assurances, the Director is \u201cbeneficially interested\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086) in the issuance of a writ of mandate to address the deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Second, while it is true, as the majority below observed, that the lead agency has primary responsibility for enforcing SMARA while the Director\u2019s role is a backup one (see fns. 8 and 9, <em>ante), </em>that fact is not determinative. Primary responsibility is not exclusive responsibility. Generally, \u201cwhere the Legislature wants only one agency to have jurisdiction over a matter, it says so unequivocally\u201d <em>(Triplett, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 255 [discussing Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 1759]). SMARA contains no such statement. On the contrary, the Legislature expressly has provided that the remedies SMARA accords the Director \u201care in addition to, and do not supersede or limit, any and all other remedies, civil or criminal\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 2774.1, subd. (g)). The writ of administrative mandate, a civil remedy, is thus preserved for the Director\u2019s use when he is beneficially interested and \u201cmust be issued in all [such] cases\u201d where he lacks \u201ca plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">SMARA contains several specific mandate-related provisions, but none affords a remedy when an operator obtains lead agency approval of allegedly inadequate reclamation plans or financial assurances.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This omission, however, does not signify that lead agencies are immune from judicial review, as \u201c \u2018[i]t has never been held that all laws must be contained, or references thereto made, in one statute. It is sufficient that a remedy exists whether it is expressed in the statute expressing the power or in another statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Tieberg, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.2d at p. 282, citing, inter alia, <em>Bodinson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number><em>Mfg. Co. v. California E. Com. </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 321, 324, 325 [109 P.2d 935].) Here, the Director\u2019s mandate remedy is expressed in the Code of Civil Procedure and in the Government Code. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1086 [circumstances under which writ must issue], 1094.5 [administrative mandate]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 11180 [capacity to sue]; see also <em>Brown v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 509, 514 [96 Cal.Rptr. 584, 487 P.2d 1224] [official with responsibility to implement disclosure laws has standing to seek a writ of mandate to enforce them].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">Our acknowledging the Director\u2019s beneficial interest in obtaining a writ of mandate neither diminishes the Board\u2019s authority as conferred by SMARA nor upsets any implicit legislative balance in the statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While the Director has no power to amend or repeal any order of the Board (\u00a7 671), here the Director seeks no such thing. In fact, as the Court of Appeal observed, the record contains no evidence the Board disapproves of the instant lawsuits. Nor, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion below, does the Director seek authority to commence a mandate proceeding against a lead agency <em>in place of </em>the Board\u2019s authority to take over a lead agency\u2019s powers under section 2774.4. Indeed, after the Director filed the instant petitions, the Board assumed lead agency functions from County. But the Board\u2019s takeover authority includes no power retroactively to alter a reclamation plan that has been approved by a local lead agency under a certified ordinance; the Board may amend approved reclamation plans only when they were approved by the Board in the first instance because the lead agency in the jurisdiction did not have a certified ordinance or were approved by the agency under an ordinance that was not in accordance with state policy (\u00a7 2774.5, subd. (c)). And even reclamation plans the Board amends in the exercise of this power must be remanded to the lead agency upon certification of the lead agency\u2019s ordinance <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">In determining whether the Director has standing to enforce SMARA, we \u201c \u2018must consider the consequences that might flow from a particular construction and should construe the statute so as to promote rather than defeat the statute\u2019s purpose and policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Escobedo </em>v. <em>Estate of Snider </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1214, 1223 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 722, 930 P.2d 979].) One possible result of the foregoing scheme, as County acknowledges, is that a SMARA violation, like County\u2019s approval of allegedly inadequate reclamation plans and financial assurances in this case, could remain in place even after the Board exercises its takeover authority.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, unless we acknowledge the Director\u2019s interest in exercising his capacity to seek judicial review (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11180), such lead agency approvals could become final despite their noncompliance with SMARA standards. We thus agree with the Attorney General that the Legislature cannot have intended the Board\u2019s limited lead agency takeover authority to substitute, generally, for the Director\u2019s authority to seek judicial review of a local lead agency\u2019s approval of inadequate reclamation plans or financial assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The statutes that permit a beneficially interested party to obtain a writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086) and a state department head to bring an action relating to the department\u2019s business (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11180, subd. (a)) both had been in effect many decades when the Legislature enacted SMARA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Legislature is deemed to have been aware of those laws and to have enacted SMARA in light of them. (See <em>Viking Pools, Inc. v. Maloney </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 602, 609 [257 Cal.Rptr. 320, 770 P.2d 732].) And the Legislature\u2019s having authorized each department head to prosecute actions concerning matters related to the business activities and subjects under the department\u2019s jurisdiction (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11180, subd. (a)), while not of itself creating the beneficial interest, nevertheless constitutes \u201ca recognition\u201d that such an executive ordinarily \u201chas an interest which is proper to be determined in [such] proceedings\u201d <em>(Tieberg, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.2d at p. 283). Our conclusion that the Director has standing to seek judicial review of allegedly unlawful local lead agency decisionmaking thus reflects discernible legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Third, recognizing the Director\u2019s beneficial interest in a writ of mandate accords with our prior pronouncements, and the pronouncements of other California courts, in similar situations. (See, e.g., <em>People ex rel. Younger </em>v. <em>County of El Dorado </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 480, 491-492 [96 Cal.Rptr. 553, 487 P.2d 1193] [Attorney General had standing to enforce People\u2019s \u201cbeneficial right\u201d to compel counties to pay regional planning expenses]; <em>Triplett, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at pp. 254-255 [state through Department had standing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>seek writ, inter alia, because Department was authorized to interpret Williamson Act]; <em>State Board of Pharmacy v. Superior Court </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 641, 645-646 [144 Cal.Rptr. 320] [State Board of Pharmacy\u2019s standing to seek writ of mandate derived from its beneficial interest in proceeding to determine attorney fees]; <em>Tieberg, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.2d at p. 284 [Director of Department of Employment had sufficient interest in Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board proceedings to justify seeking mandamus review].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">To deny the Director standing here would free surface mine operators who manage to obtain local lead agency approval of inadequate reclamation plans or financial assurances to do less than SMARA requires. If the reclamation plan does not require the operator to reclaim the site in accordance with SMARA, accomplishment of SMARA\u2019s goal of protecting public health and safety, as well as the environment, is at risk. And if the operator\u2019s financial assurances are inadequate to accomplish the reclamation plan, taxpayers are at risk of bearing the burden. Thus, the Director\u2019s standing to pursue a writ of mandate is essential to protect his\u2014and the public\u2019s\u2014interest in adequate reclamation, paid for by the operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">C. <em>Related Vested Use and CEQA Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">The Director, as earlier noted, also has contested County\u2019s vested use determination (viz., that Brunius had a vested nonconforming use and, therefore, did not require a permit; see generally \u00a7\u00a7 2776, 2792), as well as the adequacy, under both CEQA and SMARA, of certain CEQA disclosure documentation that County submitted as part of the SMARA process. The majority below concluded the Director lacks standing to maintain these claims for essentially the same reason it concluded he lacked standing to challenge County\u2019s SMARA approvals\u2014that SMARA defines the Director\u2019s role so as impliedly to deprive him of standing to challenge a lead agency\u2019s actions. On the grounds already reviewed at length, we reject that reasoning and, therefore, the Court of Appeal\u2019s application of it to these claims as well. For the same reasons, generally, that the Director is beneficially interested in obtaining writ review when a lead agency approves reclamation plans or financial assurances that do not comply with SMARA, he may be beneficially interested in obtaining a writ when a lead agency allegedly violates SMARA by making an erroneous vested use determination or by failing to include adequate CEQA disclosure documentation in the reclamation plan approval process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">SMARA exempts anyone with a \u201cvested right to conduct surface mining operations prior to January 1, 1976,\u201d from obtaining a SMARA permit for such, \u201cas long as the vested right continues and as long as no substantial changes are made in the operation except in accordance with\u201d SMARA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>(\u00a7 2776.) Moreover, SMARA expressly does not require \u201cthe filing of a reclamation plan for, or the reclamation of, mined lands on which surface mining operations were conducted prior to January 1, 1976.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If a local lead agency\u2019s erroneous recognition of a vested right to mine were immune from judicial review, the Department could find itself without leverage to enforce the Legislature\u2019s intention that the operator conduct and pay for reclamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">Similarly, the resolution of the CEQA issue, in its standing aspect, depends on our conclusion respecting the Director\u2019s interest under SMARA in obtaining a writ of mandate to challenge an inadequate reclamation plan. CEQA, of course, is aimed at ensuring full disclosure of environmental impacts of projects it governs. <em>(County of Inyo v. Yorty </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810 [108 Cal.Rptr. 377].) SMARA requires that the local lead agency, at the time it submits a reclamation plan and financial assurances to the Director for review, also submit all information regarding the project that has been prepared pursuant to CEQA. (\u00a7 2774, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">All concede the Director\u2019s core SMARA role includes responsibility to review and power to comment on reclamation plans and financial assurances proposed for lead agency approval (see generally \u00a7 2774). When a local lead agency, in fulfilling its SMARA documentation responsibilities to the Director, relies, as SMARA permits it to do (see \u00a7 2774, subd. (c)), on documentation it has prepared pursuant to CEQA, but that documentation does not comply with CEQA\u2019s disclosure requirements, the Director may be deprived of the information he requires in order to fulfill his SMARA review and comment responsibilities. Unless something else in the materials alerts the Director and his staff to matters proper CEQA disclosure would have revealed, the Director will be denied the opportunity to provide comprehensive comments as he is empowered and obligated to do under section 2774, subdivision (d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">In sum, the Director, under SMARA, was entitled to adequate CEQA information. If, as the Director alleges here, County failed in violation both of SMARA and CEQA to provide such, the Director has an interest in the issuance of a writ of mandate to correct the deficiency and effect the Legislature\u2019s intention that adequate CEQA disclosure inform the SMARA process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">D. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">Because we have concluded that the trial court\u2019s dismissal, on standing grounds, of the Director\u2019s SMARA and CEQA claims was erroneous, we have no occasion to address questions relating to the attorney fees award that was based on the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">George, C.
