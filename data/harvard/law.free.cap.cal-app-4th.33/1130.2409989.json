We conclude the employee\u2019s subjective belief, that as a condition of her employment, she was requried to practice for the test, is objectively reasonable. Thus, we annul the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">On March 28, 1993, petitioner employee Linda Burnett Kidwell (hereafter applicant), employed for over 10 years as a state traffic officer by respondent State of California, California Highway Patrol (CHP), suffered an ulnar collateral ligament rupture of her right thumb at home, off duty, while practicing the standing long jump, a required test protocol of the CHP\u2019s annually administered, mandatory physical performance program (PPP) fitness test. As a result of said injury, applicant required surgery and used 58 hours of sick leave. She filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits which was denied by the CHP on the grounds that applicant\u2019s injury did not arise out of and in the course of her employment. The matter proceeded to two days of hearing before the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) in Santa Rosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. According to CHP policy, \u201c[t]he objectives of the [PPP] are to measure the ability of uniformed employees to perform specified physically demanding activities which are required of State Traffic Officers; to promote their ability to perform such activities; to encourage them to maintain themselves in good physical condition; and to minimize on-the-job injuries and illnesses related to poor physical condition.\u201d The annual PPP fitness test was developed by a physiologist from the University of California at Davis. Applicant, hired by the CHP prior to January 1, 1984, was a \u201cTier 1\u201d employee. As such, applicant was <em>required </em>to annually take the PPP fitness test.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The standing long jump was one of the PPP fitness test protocols. The purpose of the standing long jump is to test the muscular leg power (explosive) of each employee. The test is related to the \u201cwork task\u201d of running the 100-yard dash in 20 seconds or less upon exiting from a car, and is scored as a \u201cpass\u201d with a minimum clearance of 68 inches.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1990, 1991 and 1992, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>applicant failed the standing long jump portion of the PPP fitness test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In June 1993, after returning to full duty following the right-hand injury, applicant again passed the annual PPP fitness test, except for the standing long jump, which she failed by only one inch.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">PPP fitness tests are considered \u201cjob related\u201d but not \u201cminimum job standards\u201d for Tier 1 employees. Thus, failing the test did not affect applicant\u2019s employment security. However, CHP policy mandates that failure of the annual PPP fitness test by a Tier 1 officer results in a loss of \u201celigibility for PPP salary differential,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] voluntary initial assignment to special duty, promotion, and voluntary special overtime programs.\u201d In addition to losing these administrative benefits, officers who fail the annual PPP fitness test are issued a \u201cfitness plan\u201d in accordance with CHP guidelines and can begin the \u201cretest cycle\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as outlined in the CHP policy manual. Failure of the PPP fitness test also appears on an officer\u2019s performance evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">On March 28, 1993, the date of injury, applicant had set up an area measuring 68 inches in her home on the carpet to practice the standing long jump. The third time she jumped, she fell forward and jammed her right thumb, pulling the ligaments away from the bone. Liability for applicant\u2019s injury was denied on the basis that she was engaged in an off-duty activity, i.e., practicing the standing long jump, that was not part of her preapproved fitness exercise plan pursuant to CHP policy. Injuries sustained while engaged in a current, preapproved fitness plan are considered job related, even if incurred while off duty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The CHP policy manual provides that there \u201care two categories of exercise regimens from which to choose when developing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>Fitness Plans: aerobic exercises; and muscle strengthening and endurance exercises. An employee may include up to four aerobic exercises; one weight training and one calisthenics program in his/her Fitness Plan.\u201d Applicant had an approved fitness plan on file at the time of her injury. She had signed the appropriate document indicating that only injuries incurred as part of the approved fitness plan were covered under workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><em>The parties stipulated that the standing long jump was not part of applicant\u2019s fitness plan and could not be a part of an officer\u2019s fitness plan. </em>It was a test; it was not an exercise nor a recreational activity. Even had applicant desired to designate the standing long jump as part of her fitness plan, it would not have been permitted. It was unrebutted that the sole reason applicant was performing the standing long jump on March 28, 1993, was to practice for the upcoming PPP fitness test.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It also was unrebutted that no one at the CHP ever told applicant not to practice the standing long jump prior to her injury. In fact, several officers told her to practice and gave her tips on how to perform the jump. Specifically, Officer Verin, whom applicant believed to be her testing coordinator for 1991, showed her the proper technique of jumping and falling forward on her toes, rather than on her heels, in order to assist her in practicing. The CHP does not formally specify methods for learning the proper technique for the standing long jump.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Officer Paulson testified that he formerly had been a training officer for the PPP fitness test for several years. He regularly advised officers to practice for the standing long jump and recommended certain techniques. This included how to position the hands, how to squat, and how to land. He knew of no individual who could take the standing long jump test without some prior preparation. Officer Paulson was never told by anyone at the CHP that officers should not practice for the standing long jump. He was aware that the standing long jump could not be part of an officer\u2019s approved fitness plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Sergeant Dudley testified that he had worked for the CHP since 1971 and had failed the standing long jump portion of the annual PPP fitness test on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>one occasion. His testing coordinator showed him how to practice, and he apparently passed the test on his next attempt. He helped applicant by showing her the techniques that aided him, specifically, swinging the arms so that one jumps out, not up.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Officer Gallagher testified that he had been employed by the CHP for 27 years. His supervisor had told him that when practicing the standing long jump at home, he should make sure he was on a soft surface. In June 1982 he was injured while practicing at his home. His injury was accepted by the CHP as industrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Lieutenant Talbott testified that in his opinion, as the 1993 statewide CHP coordinator for the PPP fitness test, one did not have to practice the standing long jump in order to attain the proper explosive leg power. Rather, one had to develop the leg muscles. An example of developed explosive leg power would be the type of jumping performed by a basketball player. Lieutenant Talbott did admit, however, that one could not learn the <em>technique </em>of the standing long jump without practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">On May 26, 1994, the WCJ issued his decision, concluding that, under the circumstances, practicing the standing long jump at applicant\u2019s home while off duty was a reasonable expectancy of her employment. Thus, the injury sustained to her right hand was industrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">CHP petitioned the Board for reconsideration, contending that the injury was not compensable because it occurred while applicant was off duty in her home voluntarily practicing an activity that was not part of her preapproved fitness plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Against the recommendation of the WCJ, the Board granted reconsideration and issued its opinion on August 15, 1994. Determining that applicant was participating in an off-duty \u201cathletic activity\u201d that was not part of her preapproved fitness plan and that the CHP <em>\u201cspecifically excluded </em>as job-related any activities not part of an individualized, approved fitness plan,\u201d the Board panel in a two-to-one decision rescinded the findings of the WCJ. Conceding that applicant subjectively believed that practicing the standing long jump was expected by the CHP, the Board then concluded that her belief, when viewed objectively, was not reasonable under this appellate district\u2019s opinion in <em>Ezzy </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 252 [194 Cal.Rptr. 90] (hereafter <em>Ezzy). </em>Citing <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 211 [244 Cal.Rptr. 643] (hereafter <em>Taylor), </em>also from this appellate district, the Board held that applicant did not sustain an injury arising out of and in the course of her employment. This petition for writ of review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Labor Code<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> section 3600, subdivision (a), provides in part: \u201cLiability for the compensation provided by this division . . . shall, without regard to negligence, exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the employment... in those cases where the following conditions of compensation concur:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">\"</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\u201c(9) Where the injury does not arise out of voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity not constituting part of the employee\u2019s work-related duties, <em>except where these activities are a reasonable expectancy of, or are expressly or impliedly required by, the employ</em>ment.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">In <em>Ezzy, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 252, this court construed \u201creasonable expectancy\u201d of employment to require two elements: \u201c(1) whether the employee subjectively believes his or her participation in an activity is expected by the employer, and (2) whether that belief is objectively reasonable. [1 . . . The burden rests upon an employer to insure that no subtle or indirect pressure or coercion is applied to induce involuntary participation by an employee.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 260.) The \u201creasonable expectancy\u201d language in section 3600 was added in 1978 (Stats. 1978, ch. 1303, \u00a7 5, p. 4262) \u201cto eliminate from the workers\u2019 compensation scheme <em>only </em>those injuries which were remotely work-connected. The use of such terms as \u2018reasonable expectancy\u2019 and \u2018impliedly required\u2019 in section 3600, ... is evidence that the Legislature recognized the potential use by employers of indirect means to encourage participation in an activity, and that such indirect encouragement changes the voluntary character of such participation. The Legislature intended that injuries occurring under such circumstances should be considered work-connected, and must fall within the coverage of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme.\u201d <em>(Ezzy, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at p. 263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The second prong of the <em>Ezzy </em>test is at issue herein. Whether it is objectively reasonable that applicant believed she was obligated to practice the standing long jump during off-duty hours is a question of law. <em>(Ezzy, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at p. 259; accord, <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 902, 904-905 [239 Cal.Rptr. 719] (hereafter <em>Wilson); Meyer </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1036, 1042 [204 Cal.Rptr. 74].) On this record, we find compelling evidence that applicant unquestionably was under indirect or subtle employer pressure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>pass the standing long jump. <em>(Ezzy, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at pp. 260, 263.) We conclude that her belief that she had to practice at home during her off-duty hours is objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The Board\u2019s reliance on <em>Taylor, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d 211, is carelessly misplaced. In <em>Taylor, </em>this court held that an off-duty knee injury sustained by a City of Berkeley (Berkeley) police officer during his lunch hour while he was playing basketball with other officers and civilians to stay in shape was not compensable. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 213, 216.) The officer maintained that, as a member of Berkeley\u2019s hostage negotiating team, he was expected by Berkeley to keep himself in good shape. The court, agreeing with the Board, found that although the officer may have subjectively believed he was expected to participate in the basketball game for the benefit of his employer, his belief was not objectively reasonable. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 215.) The officer conceded that Berkeley did not require him to participate in the basketball game in order to stay in shape. He also knew it was not an approved activity by Berkeley for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation coverage. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Specifically, the officer was aware of a posted departmental order pertaining to personal injuries sustained by Berkeley\u2019s police officers. Berkeley had designated that compensable injuries would be limited to participation in required training programs and athletics requested in writing and \u201c \u2018. . . specifically approved in advance . . .\u2019\u201d by the chief of police.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Taylor </em>concluded: \u201cWhere an employer expects employees to participate in recreational or athletic activities to maintain certain standards of physical fitness necessary for performance of their work, we think it reasonable to allow the employer to limit its liability for workers\u2019 compensation to injuries sustained in designated and preapproved athletic activities .... To hold otherwise would in effect render the employer potentially liable for any injury sustained in any recreational or athletic activity if the activity contributed to the employee\u2019s physical fitness.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 215-216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We find <em>Taylor </em>readily distinguishable from the case at bar. In <em>Taylor, </em>voluntary participation in an off-duty, lunchtime basketball game obviously was only remotely connected to the requirements of employment as a police officer. Moreover, Berkeley explicitly had limited its liability for injuries sustained in voluntary off-duty athletic activities. There was no pressure, indirect or otherwise, on Officer Taylor to play basketball to keep in shape. He knew he was using the Berkeley gym at his own risk and that any injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>sustained would not be covered without advance authorization and approval. He did not have advance approval because Berkeley clearly intended not to cover officers\u2019 off-duty, lunchtime recreational basketball games.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">In contrast, <em>Wilson, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d 902, not discussed by the Board, is dispositive. In <em>Wilson, </em>the court addressed a City of Modesto (Modesto) police officer\u2019s injury that occurred as he was running while off duty to keep himself in physical condition to pass fitness tests <em>required </em>by Modesto to remain a member of the special emergency reaction team (SERT), a tactical unit of the police department. Annulling the Board finding of noncompensability, the Fifth Appellate District held that the officer established a reasonable basis for his subjective belief that physical conditioning was required by Modesto. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 908-909.) Both prongs of the <em>Ezzy </em>test were met. Officer Wilson believed he was to exercise during off-duty hours because his superior officers told him that off-duty conditioning would be necessary in order to maintain the SERT physical qualifications on a continuing basis. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 906.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In deciding whether Officer Wilson\u2019s subjective belief was objectively reasonable, the court did not find determinative the fact that the officer was neither compensated for his off-duty running and other physical conditioning, nor provided by Modesto with equipment, facilities, or supervision for his workouts. <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 907.) Physical fitness indisputably was a requirement of all SERT members. All members were made aware that off-duty conditioning was necessary to pass the fitness tests required for membership. \u201cIt would be completely unrealistic to conclude that off-duty running was not expected of any member . . . who wanted to pass [Modesto\u2019s] test. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 908.) Additionally, the court emphasized, while SERT membership was voluntary and failure to qualify for SERT was not detrimental to an officer\u2019s career, these facts did not detract from the benefit to Modesto as a factor supporting compensability under <em>Ezzy. (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">With these principles in mind, the facts in the instant case affirmatively support a finding that practicing for the standing long jump, which resulted in applicant\u2019s injury, was a reasonable expectancy of her employment. The Board\u2019s reasoning that applicant was not engaged in an activity reasonably expected of her employment at the time of her injury because she \u201cwas aware\u201d that practicing the standing long jump was not part of her approved fitness plan is pure sophistry. It was conceded that even had applicant wanted to designate the standing long jump as part of her fitness plan, CHP policy prevented her from so doing. The standing long jump is not an exercise; it is one of the requisite protocols of the annual PPP fitness test. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>Moreover, applicant was neither exercising nor working out at the time of her injury. Rather, she was <em>practicing </em>the standing long jump solely to better her technique in hopes that she would ultimately pass that portion of the annually required PPP fitness test. In contrast to <em>Taylor, </em>practicing the standing long jump was not a voluntary off-duty recreational activity akin to a lunchtime basketball game with one\u2019s peers. This record is replete with evidence that practicing the standing long jump was the only way to perfect the technique of jumping.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is patently unreasonable to determine that the CHP did not expect applicant to practice. Additionally, it is unreasonable to assume that applicant should not have practiced in her home. There is no evidence in this record that the CHP offered its employees practice facilities, supervision or on-duty time to practice. Failure to pass the annual PPP fitness test resulted in loss of eligibility for PPP salary differential ($130 per month), voluntary initial assignment to special duty, promotion, and voluntary special overtime programs. Indisputably, this placed applicant under indirect employer influence and pressure to practice a test that she had failed for three previous years in a row. Unlike <em>Wilson </em>where no detrimental effects resulted from failure to qualify for Modesto\u2019s SERT program, here, failure to pass the annual PPP fitness test unquestionably was adverse to an officer\u2019s career.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Under these circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that applicant\u2019s belief that practicing the standing long jump was job related is objectively reasonable. That is, it was a reasonable expectancy of her employment under section 3600, subdivision (a)(9). <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at pp. 906, 909; <em>Ezzy, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at p. 260.) Accordingly, applicant\u2019s injury is compensable. The Board\u2019s decision is annulled, and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Peterson, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The CHP policy manual outlines the test protocol, as follows: \u201cThe employee will stand with feet several inches apart and with toes in back of the take-off line. Shoes will be worn during this test. The employee shall jump forward, taking off from both feet and landing on both feet. Free swinging of the arms and bending of the knees is permissible. However, the feet must not leave the take-off surface until the jump is made. One additional trial will be allowed if the employee fails the initial attempt. The measurement is made from the take-off line to the heel or any part of the body that touches the surface nearest the take-off line, [q]] The distance jumped on the maximum jump shall be recorded in inches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The manual further states that the purpose of the related work task of sprinting 100 yards is to determine the officer\u2019s ability to perform the physically demanding task requiring muscular power of the legs. The task protocol requires an officer to perform the sprint in full summer uniform with protective vest and baton in temperature not to exceed 85 degrees on a firm and level surface. The task begins with the officer behind the steering wheel in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>driver\u2019s seat of a patrol car with the seat belt fastened and the door closed. Upon the command to go, the officer then must remove the seat belt, open the door, get out of the car, and perform the sprint with baton in hand in 20 seconds or less. An officer who fails the standing long jump portion of the PPP fitness test twice in one year is to be offered the related work task. The record is not clear whether applicant either was offered or attempted the related work task when she failed the standing long jump. This, however, is not germane to the issues before this court on review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">On April 16, 1990, applicant cleared a distance of 66 inches.
