Attorneys Douglas Greer and Ronald Castro were appointed to represent respondent; William Lipschultz was appointed as counsel for Frederick.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The criminal cases against respondent and his brother Frederick were consolidated in October of 1980, and a joint pretrial motion for change of venue was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The prosecution engaged Michael Saggs (hereafter Saggs), a serologist employed by the department of justice, to undertake a serological examination to determine the blood type, secretor status and phosphoglumotose (PGM)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> grouping of samples taken from the victim, her panties, two shirts and a bedsheet. The same tests were conducted on respondent, Frederick, the victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and two of her male friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Lipschultz retained appellant Brian Wraxall (hereafter Wraxall) in September of 1980 to independently examine the serological evidence on behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>of Frederick. Wraxall is the executive director, a board director and the chief forensic serologist for the Serological Research Institute (hereafter SERI), a nonprofit public benefit corporation which, among other activities, conducts serological tests in selected criminal and civil cases. Wraxall received from Lipschultz \u201ccuttings\u201d from the bed sheet, the victim\u2019s panties and the two shirts, as well as blood samples in the form of \u201cswatches\u201d from the victim, respondent, Frederick \u201cand other individuals associated with the case.\u201d Wraxall subsequently complained to Lipschultz that the cuttings he received were \u201cinadequate\u201d for testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">A hearing was held on November 14, 1980, upon a motion by Lipschultz on behalf of Frederick which was \u201cjoined\u201d by respondent\u2019s attorneys, for discovery of the items of serological evidence. Wraxall was present at the hearing, along with the prosecutor, Saggs, and the attorneys for respondent and Frederick. The prosecutor expressed concern at the hearing that the limited quantity of crime scene evidence might be consumed upon testing by Wraxall, and, if so, preclude examination by another expert, which, in turn, might result in objection by respondent if he was thereby deprived of an opportunity to conduct an independent analysis. Thus, in accordance with a stipulation, the evidence was released to Wraxall for serological examination by him, with the results to be made \u201cfully available\u201d to and \u201cutilized\u201d by the attorneys for both respondent and Frederick, and with respondent foreclosed from objecting to the admission of evidence of the prosecution\u2019s serological test results on the ground of inability to obtain test results from an independent expert.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wraxall and Lipschultz understood that pursuant to the stipulation the results of any further testing \u201cwould be made available to the attorneys\u201d for respondent as well as Frederick upon demand. Otherwise, Wraxall still considered Frederick to be his primary client.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">After completing an analysis of the samples given to him, the prosecution\u2019s expert, Saggs, essentially concluded that the seminal material taken from the vaginal swabs, the victim\u2019s panties and the bed sheet were consistent with respondent\u2019s blood type O secretor status and PGM 2-1 status. While Frederick, also a blood type O secretor, was found to have a PGM 1-1 type, Saggs was unable to discount him as a possible source due to the \u201cmasking\u201d of PGM 1-1 type by PGM type 2-1. Lipschultz was concerned by Saggs\u2019s conclusion which did not definitively eliminate Frederick as the perpetrator of the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Wraxall subsequently obtained additional and separate samples from Saggs pursuant to the stipulation and conducted his serological analysis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>which was completed by February 20, 1981. Wraxall agreed with Saggs\u2019s determination that the PGM 1-1 type was masked by the PGM 2-1 type. Otherwise, he was unable to duplicate Saggs\u2019s results. Wraxall did not obtain any PGM result from the analysis of the bed sheet sample. He found PGM 1-1 type on one sample of the panties instead of PGM 2-1 type, and found \u201cno activity\u201d on the other sample. On the vaginal swab sample he was given, Wraxall found only PGM 1-1 type activity whereas Saggs found PGM 2-1 type activity. On the vulva sample, Wraxall found PGM 1-1 type activity, as had Saggs. The essential disparity between the results obtained by Wraxall and Saggs is that Wraxall did not find PGM activity consistent with a PGM 2-1 type donor such as respondent on any of the samples he tested. The results obtained by Saggs placed respondent in the class of persons who may have contributed the samples; Wraxall was unable to either exclude respondent from or include him in the donor class.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Wraxall advised Lipschultz that his test results differed from those obtained by Saggs and \u201cmay be of use\u201d to respondent\u2019s defense. His objective was to convey the results he obtained and await contact from respondent\u2019s attorneys if they were \u201cinterested . . . .\u201d He did not then \u201cknow who [respondent\u2019s] attorney\u2019s were\u201d and did not notify them of his test results. In late January or February of 1981, Lipschultz advised respondent\u2019s attorney Greer that Wraxall had been unable to duplicate Saggs\u2019s test results, and further told him that \u201che should talk to Wraxall about the testing because there may be further work that needs to be done.\u201d Wraxall testified that respondent\u2019s attorneys did not thereafter contact him before respondent\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Wraxall believed that his test results might be \u201chelpful\u201d to respondent\u2019s defense, but of a nature and extent unknown to him. He also testified that the disparate results he obtained may have been caused by the different samples he and Saggs tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In February of 1981, Thomas Condit and Thomas Leupp substituted for Lipschultz as Frederick\u2019s attorneys. In May of 1981, Loretta Hellen became cocounsel with Greer for respondent in place of Castro. The cases against respondent and his brother Frederick were severed in April of 1981, and respondent\u2019s trial commenced on May 19, 1981. During the course of the trial, which was quite lengthy and protracted,\u2014with \u201cclose to 70\u201d witnesses called by the prosecution\u2014respondent\u2019s attorneys testified that in discussions with Lipschultz and Leupp they were advised of Wraxall\u2019s failure to obtain any results from his forensic tests. According to Greer, in a telephone conversation on August 31, 1981, Wraxall similarly told him that he \u201cdid not have enough crime scene evidence to analyze to get any results . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Leupp and Lipschultz testified, to the contrary, that they accurately relayed Wraxall\u2019s test results to respondent\u2019s attorneys. Wraxall testified that he never spoke with Greer and Hellen during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Wraxall was not called as a defense witness during respondent\u2019s murder trial. Instead, the defense rebutted the conclusions of Saggs with testimony from Dr. Julita Fong, a clinical pathologist. Fong challenged the conclusions of the prosecutor\u2019s expert based upon her review of the photographs of Saggs\u2019 test results, but did not independently analyze the samples. In light of the information given to them by Wraxall, Lipschultz and Leupp\u2014that the samples tested by Wraxall yielded no results\u2014respondent\u2019s criminal defense attorneys decided against any further attempts to conduct a second independent forensic analysis of the crime scene evidence and devised their trial strategy accordingly. Respondent\u2019s defense attorneys testified that without the evidence of Wraxall\u2019s test results, the cross-examination of Saggs in the murder trial was compromised, the credibility of respondent was \u201cdestroyed,\u201d and the defense was \u201ccrippled\u201d by the inability to prove that respondent did not commit the rape and murder of Heather. Following the jury trial, on May 13, 1982, respondent was convicted of all charges, including murder with special circumstances, and subsequently sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In January of 1985, Frederick entered a plea of guilty in his criminal action to charges of burglary and rape. He was sentenced to a term of nine years and eight months in state prison. Under the terms of the plea agreement, the People retained the right to subsequently prosecute Frederick on the murder charge in the event additional evidence of his guilt was uncovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">An appeal and petitions for writ of habeas corpus were filed on behalf of respondent. In one of the habeas corpus petitions, respondent claimed that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel due to the failure of his trial attorneys, Greer and Hellen, to present testimony from Wraxall. In support of the petition, Wraxall filed a declaration in which he described the results of his analysis as \u201ccontradictory\u201d to Saggs\u2019s results and criticized Saggs\u2019s methods and conclusions. Wraxall further declared: \u201cBased on my independent analysis <em>no </em>identification of the donor of the semen on the vaginal and vulva swabs or the stains on the panties or bedsheet can be made. [Italics added.] In other words, the semen donor could be any male in the population. None of my results indicate that it is more likely to be from Kenneth Williams than any other male.\u201d The petition was ordered consolidated with respondent\u2019s appeal, and, in June 1989, the California Supreme Court reversed respondent\u2019s convictions for error in denying his motion for change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>of venue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1112 [259 Cal.Rptr. <em>473, 774 </em>P.2d 146].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Attorneys Greer and Hellen also filed a separate petition for writ of habeas corpus in Placer County on behalf of respondent in which Saggs\u2019s testimony in the criminal trial was attacked as \u201cfalse and misleading . . . .\u201d When Greer and Hellen learned of Wraxall\u2019s declaration, they contacted Wraxall and sought to procure his report, test results, and testimony. Frederick\u2019s attorney Condit objected on grounds of the work-product and attorney-client privileges. The objection was sustained and Wraxall was foreclosed from testifying in the Placer County Superior Court habeas corpus proceeding on July 29, 1986. Thereafter, Wraxall met with Greer and Hellen, and was advised by them that he had \u201can obligation\u201d to disclose his test results \u201cand was going to have to come clean with everything.\u201d At a subsequent hearing in the Placer County habeas corpus proceeding on March 24, 1987, Wraxall was ordered to testify and furnish respondent\u2019s attorneys with his \u201cnotes,\u201d and he did so. The remainder of Wraxall\u2019s \u201cfile\u201d was not then disclosed to respondent\u2019s attorneys, and Wraxall was reluctant to furnish them with further information until final resolution by formal court order of the objections made by counsel for Frederick. When the objections to disclosure were later overruled by the court, Wraxall provided his test results to respondent\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Meanwhile, on November 20, 1987, respondent filed the present action against appellants for damages which allegedly resulted from Wraxall\u2019s failure to accurately disclose the results of his serological analysis to respondent\u2019s attorneys prior to the criminal trial. Causes of action for fraud and deceit, suppression of information, malpractice, unfair trade practices and conspiracy were included in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">After respondent\u2019s motion for summary adjudication in his favor on the issues of duty and breach of duty was granted, the remaining issues proceeded to a court trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court found in favor of respondent on all of his causes of action save unfair business practices. Respondent was awarded compensatory damages of $25,000 and punitive damages of $200,000. Appellants\u2019 motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Following reversal of his convictions, respondent was twice retried and mistrials were declared due to <em>Wheeler</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>error committed by the prosecutor and the illness of defense counsel. A fourth murder trial was held after trial of the present case, in which, pursuant to a stipulation, the criminal charges against respondent were tried without presentation of expert opinion testimony from either the prosecution or the defense of the results of serological analysis of the blood and semen samples taken from the crime scene. Respondent was again convicted of murder, kidnapping, robbery, burglary and rape following a jury trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In this appeal, we conclude that the judgment in favor of respondent must be reversed for lack of evidence of causation and therefore, do not reach the remaining issues raised by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u201c \u2018The elements of a cause of action in tort for professional negligence are: (1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the professional\u2019s negligence.

Respondent\u2019s judgment of conviction was eventually reversed on appeal, so his burden is to establish a reasonable probability of his <em>acquittal </em>in his first trial if Wraxall\u2019s test results and expert testimony had been made available for use by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Upon review of the record, we find no credible evidence which indicates that Wraxall\u2019s test results would have resulted in a judgment of acquittal in respondent\u2019s first murder trial. Evidence was presented that Wraxall\u2019s results and testimony may have been \u201cexculpatory\u201d or \u201cbeneficial\u201d to respondent in contesting the charges against him, particularly in facilitating effective cross-examination of the prosecutor\u2019s expert, Saggs. The trial court so found, and, while we do not disagree with the trial court\u2019s findings, we conclude that the evidence nevertheless fails to establish the requisite element of a probable acquittal of respondent if Wraxall had disclosed his test results to respondent\u2019s attorneys for presentation during respondent\u2019s first murder trial. We do not think the results obtained by Wraxall, although inconsistent with those of Saggs, are particularly exculpatory in nature. In essence, Wraxall\u2019s analysis yielded his opinion that respondent could neither be identified nor eliminated as the perpetrator of the offense, while Sagg\u2019s test results indicated that respondent\u2019s blood type, secretor and PGM status were consistent with samples taken from the crime, but not to the exclusion of others, including respondent\u2019s brother. The testimony also reveals that Wraxall used different samples in his analysis than did Saggs, which may have accounted for the disparate results.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Thus, Wraxall\u2019s test results may have assisted the defense in some measure in rebutting Saggs\u2019s conclusions, but certainly did not exonerate respondent. We further observe that respondent\u2019s guilt was established by circumstantial evidence and the testimony of numerous other witnesses, with Saggs\u2019s opinions serving as slight corroborating evidence at best. And finally, in his first trial respondent offered the conclusions of pathologist Julita Wong to rebut Saggs\u2019s, so he was not entirely precluded by appellants\u2019 misconduct from challenging the prosecution\u2019s expert opinion testimony. No testimony was adduced by respondent that his acquittal was reasonably probable if Wraxall\u2019s results had been disclosed, and, upon review of the record, we are persuaded to the contrary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We also find no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that respondent suffered emotional distress due to his fear of \u201ctestifying contrary\u201d to the \u201cinaccurate conclusion of Saggs,\u201d without the benefit of Wraxall\u2019s test results. We cannot discern from the evidence presented below any reason for respondent to have greater confidence in his testimony with or without the support of Wraxall\u2019s conclusions. Nor did respondent claim that he suffered emotional anxiety or distress associated with presentation of his testimony during his first murder trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, as neither respondent nor his attorneys knew of Wraxall\u2019s conclusions during the first murder trial, any emotional distress he then suffered can hardly be attributed to appellants\u2019 misconduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Respondent claims that causation is established under the \u201clost chance\u201d theory adopted in medical malpractice cases where the defendant\u2019s negligence has deprived the plaintiff of a statistically measurable chance of survival which is less than even. <em>(Simmons </em>v. <em>West Covina Medical Clinic, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at p. 704.) The \u201clost chance\u201d theory is essentially a relaxed standard of causation which reduces the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof from a probability to a substantial possibility that medical malpractice resulted in the loss of chance of survival. <em>(Dumas </em>v. <em>Cooney, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We find several flaws in respondent\u2019s lost chance theory of causation. First, it has been uniformly rejected in California as \u201ccontrary to sound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>logic, legal precedent and public policy.\u201d <em>(Simmons </em>v. <em>West Covina Medical Clinic, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at pp. 705-706; see also <em>Bromme </em>v. <em>Pavitt, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1506-1508; <em>Dumas </em>v. <em>Cooney, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1608.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The recognition of a lost chance as a cognizable injury where the plaintiff proves only that without the defendant\u2019s negligence an adverse result <em>\u201cmight </em>possibly\u201d have been avoided has been decried as contradictory to \u201c \u2018the very notion of cause in fact.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dumas </em>v. <em>Cooney, supra, </em>at pp. 1609-1610.) Second, the lost chance doctrine, even when recognized, has been limited to medical malpractice cases to grant recovery to patients for deprivation of the opportunity of more beneficial treatment and the resulting gain in life expectancy or comfort, although the evidence fails to establish a reasonable probability that without defendant\u2019s negligence a <em>cure </em>was achievable. (Cf. <em>James </em>v. <em>United States </em>(N.D.Cal. 1980) 483 F.Supp. 581, 587; <em>Pulvers </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 560, 565-566 [160 Cal.Rptr. 392];<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Fennell </em>v. <em>Southern Maryland Hosp. </em>(1990) 320 Md. 776, [580 A.2d 206, 210-212].) In our view, extension of the relaxed lost chance standard of causation to the present case, in which the only cognizable compensable harm to respondent is the conviction he suffered, is entirely inappropriate. (Cf. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>West Covina Medical Clinic, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at p. 705.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Where, as here, respondent was not faced with the prospect of a preexisting condition which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>rendered proof of a reasonable probability of causation difficult, we can perceive of no reason to relax the established standard of proof of causation. <em>(Ibid; </em>see also <em>Bromme </em>v. <em>Pavitt, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1505-1506.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We are also not persuaded to shift the burden to appellants to prove lack of causation. <em>(Simmons </em>v. <em>West Covina Medical Clinic, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at p. 703.)  In negligence and products liability cases, the doctrine has evolved that the burden of proof on the issue of causation may be shifted to the defendant where demanded by public policy considerations. <em>(Fagerquist </em>v. <em>Western Sun Aviation, Inc. </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 709, 723 [236 Cal.Rptr. 633].) \u201c[T]he shift of the burden of proof. . . may be said to rest on a policy judgment that when there is a substantial probability that a defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause of an accident, and when the defendant\u2019s negligence makes it impossible, as a practical matter, for plaintiff to prove \u2018proximate causation\u2019 conclusively, it is more appropriate to hold the defendant liable than to deny an innocent plaintiff recovery, unless the defendant can prove that his negligence was <em>not </em>a cause of the injury.\u201d <em>(Haft </em>v. <em>Lone Palm Hotel </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d <em>756, </em>774, fn. 19 [91 Cal.Rptr. 745, 478 P.2d 465, italics in original]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Americania Motor Lodge </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 1, 6 [113 Cal.Rptr. 771, 88 A.L.R.3d 1188].) The essential principle underlying this narrow exception to the usual allocation of proof is that the burden of proving an element of a case is more appropriately borne by the party with greater access to information. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 870, 885 [274 Cal.Rptr. 849, 799 P.2d 1282]; <em>Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 588, 599 [163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924, 2 A.L.R.4th 1061]; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Irish Truck Lines, Inc. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 373, 378 [113 Cal.Rptr. 489, 521 P.2d 481]; <em>Grill </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 73, 79 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 768, italics in original]; <em>Ott </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 912, 922 [173 CaLRptr. 648].) \u201c[A] defendant who is in a better position to discover and preserve . . . evidence should not be permitted to profit from the plaintiff\u2019s inability to produce it.\u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Irish Truck Lines, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">No definitive or \u201cgeneral rule\u201d exists that delineates the circumstances under which the defendant in a products liability case must prove noncausation of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. <em>(Endicott </em>v. <em>Nissan Motor Corp. </em>(1977) 73 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Cal.App.3d 917, 928 [141 Cal.Rptr. 95, 9 A.L.R.4th 481].) A shift in the normal allocation of the burden of proof is based upon consideration of a \u201c \u2018number of factors: the knowledge of the parties concerning the particular fact, the availability of the evidence to the parties, the most desirable result in terms of public policy in the absence of proof of the particular fact, and the probability of the existence or nonexistence of the fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McGee </em>v. <em>Cessna Aircraft Co. </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 179, 187 [188 Cal.Rptr. 542, A.L.R.4th 3124]; quoting from Law Revision Com. com. to Evid. Code, \u00a7 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">While Wraxall\u2019s test results were not presented in respondent\u2019s murder trial, the evidence was not lost and was available to both appellants and respondent to prove causation in the present case. Further, we have concluded that respondent failed to establish even a substantial probability of causation, which is a condition precedent to a shift in the burden of proof. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Irish Truck Lines, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 378; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Lusk </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1709, 1719 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 265].)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Without any credible evidence in the record that appellants\u2019 failure or refusal to make available Wraxall\u2019s test results was a substantial factor in causing respondent\u2019s conviction, an essential element of respondent\u2019s causes of action in tort has not been adequately established. <em>(Rochlis </em>v. <em>Walt Disney Co. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 201, 216 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 793], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238,1251 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d at p. 404.)

The malpractice action was predicated upon the physician\u2019s failure to test for the risk of Down\u2019s syndrome in time to abort the pregnancy. The undisputed evidence demonstrated that a properly and timely performed genetic test \u201cwould have provided only a 20 percent chance of disclosing the risk of Down\u2019s Syndrome.\u201d <em>(Simmons </em>v. <em>West Covina Medical Clinic, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at p. 702.) In refusing to apply the lost chance doctrine, the court reasoned: \u201cBut we perceive a fundamental distinction between negligently reducing a patient\u2019s chance of survival and negligently depriving a woman of the chance to abort a genetically defective child. In the former situation, the patient\u2019s condition may be attributable to a host of factors in addition to the physician\u2019s negligence. Thus, some courts have recognized that the difficulties of identifying, defining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>and proving injury in these types of medical malpractice cases justify the application of a more flexible standard of causation.

But in the case of a genetically deformed child, it cannot be said that the hereditary condition was caused by the medical practitioner\u2019s negligence when no degree of medical intervention could have worked a cure. And where, as here, the probability of predicting the genetic defect is only 20 percent, we think established tort principles fairly impose liability only where there is a reasonable medical probability of predicting the outcome of the pregnancy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 705.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
