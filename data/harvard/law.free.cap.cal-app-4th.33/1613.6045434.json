J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeQf\">This case presents the heretofore unresolved question whether the 50 percent increase in workers\u2019 compensation recovery provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1617\">*1617</page-number>in Labor Code section 4553<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for cases of serious and willful misconduct by an employer is to be calculated on the basis of the entire workers\u2019 compensation award, including nonindemnity payments, or must be calculated only on the basis of the compensation indemnity. We hold that the 50 percent increase is to be calculated on the entire award, not just compensation indemnity, provided the total benefits do not exceed the amount necessary to fully compensate the worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">On September 14, 1988, petitioner Judy A. Ferguson (applicant) slipped and fell on a wet floor while employed as a general merchandise clerk for respondent Raley\u2019s Supermarkets (Raley\u2019s). This admitted industrial injury resulted in the need for medical treatment and vocational rehabilitation. Applicant was paid temporary disability indemnity and awarded a permanent disability indemnity of 61 percent, the equivalent of $66,780, payable at $210 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Applicant also sought a 50 percent increase in her award under section 4553, alleging serious and willful misconduct by Raley\u2019s. The matter proceeded to hearing on April 24, 1991, before Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge (WCJ) Christopher E. Hamilton. It was undisputed that there were no safety mats on the linoleum floor in the kitchen area, which was frequently wet and slippery from water and grease as a result of spray from a sink and a backed-up drain. It was also undisputed that Raley\u2019s knew of the dangerous condition, as other employees had fallen and complained to management. Applicant\u2019s work supervisor was aware of the dangerous condition, but chose not to put down safety mats because they were a \u201cnuisance.\u201d Instead, employees were advised to \u201cwalk like a duck\u201d in the wet kitchen area. Other than advising employees to walk carefully, Raley\u2019s took no action to correct the hazardous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">On August 29, 1991, the WCJ issued his decision, finding inter alia that applicant\u2019s injury occurred as a result of Raley\u2019s serious and willful misconduct. The WCJ ordered a one-half increase in applicant\u2019s total compensation benefits, including all nonindemnity payments, and reserved jurisdiction for determination of future increased compensation under section 4553 as a result of the serious and willful finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">Raley\u2019s petitioned for reconsideration on September 23, 1991, contesting both the finding of serious and willful misconduct and the calculation of increased compensation on the basis of all the compensation benefits applicant received.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1618\">*1618</page-number>On October 8, 1991, the WCJ filed his report on reconsideration, recommending that the board deny Raley\u2019s petition. As relevant to the issues before this court, the WCJ stated as follows: \u201c[S]o long as an injured worker\u2019s total compensation award is less than the actual damages he could have recovered but for elimination of his right to sue, the added portion of the award over and above his normal compensation benefits would not amount to an unconstitutional penalty or be tantamount to punitive or exemplary damages, which the Appeals Board would have no authority to award. [^Q I think there can be no doubt in the present case that applicant\u2019s award of increased compensation still does not exceed damages she could have obtained if this were a negligence claim rather than a workers\u2019 compensation case. It seems doubtful there was any negligence on her part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The board granted reconsideration on November 22, 1991, and on August 24, 1993, affirmed the WCJ\u2019s finding that applicant\u2019s injury occurred as a result of Raley\u2019s serious and willful misconduct. The board held, however, that the 50 percent increase in compensation pursuant to the section 4553 award applied only to compensation (temporary and permanent) indemnity and not to nonindemnity benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Applicant seeks review, contending that the \u201camount of compensation otherwise recoverable\u201d under section 4553 includes nonindemnity benefits such as medical treatment payments, medical-legal fees, and vocational rehabilitation costs payable to third parties. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">Section 4553 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe amount of compensation otherwise recoverable shall be increased one-half, together with costs and expenses not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250), where the employee is injured by reason of the serious and willful misconduct of [the employer] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">The meaning of this statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language of the enactment itself. <em>(Leroy T. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 434, 438 [115 Cal.Rptr. 761, 525 P.2d 665].) Our role is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effect the purpose of the law. <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) In so doing, we are to harmonize the various parts of the statute with the general tenor and scope of the statutory framework as a whole <em>(Youngblood </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1619\">*1619</page-number>216 Cal.App.3d 764, 772 [265 Cal.Rptr. 211]); where the Legislature has prescribed the meaning to be given precise terms used in a statute, that meaning is binding on the courts. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 621, 638 [268 P.2d 723]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Aadland </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 584, 590 [14 Cal.Rptr. 462].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">Section 4553 cannot be read without reference to section 3207, which defines \u201ccompensation.\u201d From the time our workers\u2019 compensation scheme was initially established, this critical term has consistently been given an expansive meaning, described as including \u201cevery benefit or payment\u201d conferred upon employees. (Stats. 1917, ch. 586, \u00a7 3, subd. (3), p. 833.) Section 3207 currently provides that \u201c \u2018[compensation\u2019 means compensation under Division 4 [Workers\u2019 Compensation and Insurance] and includes <em>every benefit or payment conferred by Division 4 upon an injured employee, including vocational rehabilitation, </em>or in the event of his [or her] death, upon his [or her] dependents, without regard to negligence.\u201d (Italics added.) This broad language leaves no doubt that compensation includes vocational rehabilitation costs and, by virtue of their location in division 4, medical treatment payments and medical-legal fees. (\u00a7\u00a7 4600, 5811; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 226, 231 [133 Cal.Rptr. 517, 555 P.2d 303].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">If medical-legal fees are \u201ccompensation\u201d for calculating increased compensation under section 5814,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as determined by the Supreme Court in <em>Adams, </em>then surely the cost of medical treatment, a more immediate and significant benefit to an injured employee, must also be treated as \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of section 4553.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It would be unconscionable for an employer, whose quasi-criminal or intentional conduct under section 4553 causes injury to an employee, to benefit from a more constrictive statutory interpretation of \u201ccompensation\u201d than applies to an employer who, in violation of section 5814, merely delays unreasonably in the payment of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1620\">*1620</page-number>Finally, the legislative history of section 4553 and related provisions of section 132a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is also consistent with an expansive interpretation of the former statute. Before enactment of the predecessor to section 4553, the workers\u2019 compensation system provided an employee a choice of remedies if his or her injury was caused by the employer\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The employee could either claim workers\u2019 compensation benefits or maintain an action at law for damages. (Stats. 1913, ch. 176, \u00a7 12, subd. (b), pp. 283-284.) This provision was deleted in 1917 and a section enacted specifying a one-half increase in compensation in the event of serious and willful misconduct by the employer as the employee\u2019s <em>sole </em>remedy. (Stats. 1917, ch. 586, \u00a7 6, subd. (b), p. 834.) \u201cThe clear implication is that the addition in 1917 of the \u2018exclusive remedy\u2019 limitation <em>and the provision for a penalty for the willful misconduct of the employer </em>was a substitute for the previous right of an employee to bring an action at law.\u201d <em>(Johns-Manville Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 465, 472 [165 Cal.Rptr. 858, 612 P.2d 948, 9 A.L.R.4th 758] (hereafter <em>Johns-Manville), </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Prior to amendments made in 1982, sections 4553 and 132a <em>both </em>contained a $10,000 limit on the amount recoverable for the one-half increase in compensation from an employer guilty of either serious and willful misconduct or unlawful discrimination. Section 132a incorporated by reference the \u201cprovisions of [sjection 4553\u201d with regard to \u201cincreased compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Effective January 1, 1983, sections 4553 and 132a were both amended. The reference to the \u201cprovisions in [s]ection 4553\u201d was deleted from section 132a, but the statute specifically retained the $10,000 limit on the amount recoverable against an employer. (Stats. 1982, ch. 922, \u00a7 1, p. 3364.) The $10,000 limit on the amount of increased compensation was, however, removed from section 4553, thereby eliminating any restriction on the actual amount that may be awarded under section 4553 when an injury is caused by an employer\u2019s serious and willful misconduct. (Stats. 1982, ch. 922, \u00a7 10, p. 3369.) From this it may be inferred that in 1982, the last time it modified section 4553, the Legislature intended no restriction on the basis upon which the increased compensation award is to be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1621\">*1621</page-number>\u201cThe Legislature is presumed to have in mind existing law when it passes a statute.\u201d <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 684, 695-696 [281 Cal.Rptr. 485].) Moreover, if the Legislature carefully employs a term in one statute and deletes it from another, it must be presumed to have acted deliberately. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Accordingly, the alterations to sections 4553 and 132a effective in 1983 provide compelling evidence of a legislative intent to increase the potential recovery for an employee who suffers an injury caused by the serious and willful misconduct of an employer under section 4553.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we are persuaded the legislative scheme contemplates that an award for increased compensation due to the serious and willful misconduct of an employer under section 4553 must be calculated with reference to <em>\u201cevery </em>benefit or payment conferred by Division 4 upon an injured employee\u201d (italics added), as broadly defined in section 3207 to include medical treatment payments, medical-legal fees and vocational rehabilitation costs, as well as all indemnity benefit payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The remaining question is whether an increased compensation award under section 4553 calculated in this manner may in certain circumstances be constitutionally excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">The workers\u2019 compensation system only authorizes payment of \u201ccompensation\u201d for work-related injuries and does not authorize punitive damages <em>(State Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 885, 888-889 [97 Cal.Rptr. 786, 489 P.2d 818] (hereafter <em>Jensen);</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Cal. Const., former art. XX, \u00a7 21, now art. XIV, \u00a7 4). The board reasoned that a 50 percent increase in the full amount of medical treatment and like nonindemnity benefits payable to third parties would amount to punitive damages and therefore impose an unconstitutional penalty. Though we disagree that an award increased in this manner will <em>necessarily </em>exceed the constitutional limit, we agree it may in some cases have that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">To be sure, the serious and willful misconduct remedy provided by section 4553 is \u201cpunitive\u201d in the sense that it requires an employer to pay an injured employee more than would be required in the absence of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1622\">*1622</page-number>misconduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus the remedy departs to some extent from the no-fault principle upon which our workers\u2019 compensation system is primarily based. It bears noting, however, that this departure may be made only in the event of an exceptionally high degree of employer fault, surpassing even gross negligence. <em>(Mercer-Fraser Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 102, 120 [251 P.2d 955].)  \u201cSerious and willful misconduct\u201d within the meaning of section 4553 is an act deliberately done for the express purpose of injuring another, or intentionally performed whether with knowledge that serious injury is a probable result or with a positive, active, wanton, reckless and absolute disregard of its possibly damaging consequences. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIn sum, the provisions of section 4553 were designed to penalize intentional misconduct of an employer . . . .\u201d <em>(Johns-Manville, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 473.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">While an award for increased compensation under section 4553 may be said to constitute a \u201cpenalty,\u201d however, it does not necessarily provide the injured worker more than is necessary to fully compensate him or her for the injury sustained and is therefore not comparable to exemplary damages. <em>(Jensen, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at pp. 888-891; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Kardon) </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 710, 713-714 [111 Cal.Rptr. 14]; see <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 229; see also <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 933, 941 [182 Cal.Rptr. 171].) Because conventional workers\u2019 compensation benefits do not fully compensate an employee for his or her injuries and other detriment, the increase allowed under section 4553 may only provide full or more nearly full compensation than would be available in the absence of the employer\u2019s serious and willful misconduct. (See <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 85, 90-91 [169 Cal.Rptr. 72];<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> cf. <em>Jensen, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at pp. 888-892.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1623\">*1623</page-number>The theory that the calculation of increased compensation authorized by section 4553 against all compensation awarded, including nonindemnity benefits, is constitutionally excessive has evolved erroneously from language in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>E. Clemens Horst Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1920) 184 Cal. 180 [193 P. 105, 16 A.L.R. 611] (hereafter <em>Horst),</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided shortly after the initial passage of California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system in 1916 and the ensuing enactment in 1917 of the serious and willful statute, the predecessor to section 4553.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The opinion in <em>Horst </em>includes the following two sentences: \u201cIt is . . . to be presumed the legislature found that the actual injury by loss of earnings and other elements of damage, <em>not including expenses for costs of treatment and the like, </em>would be at least fifty per cent more than the fixed schedule would come to, and that it was deemed just if the injury was caused by willful misconduct of the employer he should be made to pay a greater proportion of the burden, and that the allowance in such a case should be increased by adding fifty per cent thereto. <em>Thus considered, the additional allowance is really for additional compensation in the strict sense, and not for exemplary </em>damages.\u201d <em>(Horst, supra, </em>184 Cal. at p. 193, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">Although the first sentence quoted above appears to exclude \u201cexpenses for costs of treatment and the like\u201d from the amount upon which the 50 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1624\">*1624</page-number>increase would be based, this language is dicta. The constitutionality of a 50 percent increase in the injured employee\u2019s temporary disability indemnity benefits was at issue in <em>Horst </em>only because of its arguably punitive character. <em>(Horst, supra, </em>184 Cal. at pp. 182, 192-193.) The analysis in <em>Horst </em>concentrates on the court\u2019s constitutional determination that the remedy for an employer\u2019s willful misconduct is chiefly designed to provide more nearly full compensation to an injured employee rather than to penalize an employer. (Je<em>nsen, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 889.) <em>Horst </em>did not specifically consider the <em>type </em>of \u201ccompensation\u201d which provides the basis for calculation of the 50 percent increase, nor has the Supreme Court ever addressed that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">We are not bound by Supreme Court dicta we do not find relevant and compelling. <em>(Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1265, 1272 [268 Cal.Rptr. 699]; see generally, 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 785, p. 756.) Moreover, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 475, 482, fn. 7 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580].) \u201c \u2018Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\u2019 <em>(Webster </em>v. <em>Fall </em>(1925) 266 U.S. 507, 511 [69 L.Ed. 411, 413, 45 S.Ct. 148].)\u201d <em>(Canales </em>v. <em>City of Alviso </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 118, 127-128, fn. 2 [89 Cal.Rptr. 601, 474 P.2d 417].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Consequently, so long as an award for increased compensation under section 4553 calculated on the basis of <em>all </em>compensation received by the injured worker, including indemnity as well as nonindemnity benefits, does not provide the injured worker more than is necessary to <em>fully </em>compensate the worker for <em>all </em>damages he or she sustained as a result of the injury caused, at least in part, by the willful misconduct of the employer, the award does not constitute punitive damages and is therefore not constitutionally excessive. <em>\u201cThe [legislative] policy choice is ... to offer the augmented award for serious and willful misconduct in trade for the relatively rare award of punitive damage.\u201d (Azevedo </em>v. <em>Abel </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 451, 459-460 [70 Cal.Rptr. 710], italics added; accord, <em>Magliulo </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 760, 778 [121 Cal.Rptr. 621].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1625\">*1625</page-number>We believe the phrase \u201cfull and complete compensation,\u201d as that term is employed in <em>Horst </em>(184 Cal. at p. 193), refers to the amount of compensatory damages a worker could be awarded in a civil action if entitled to sue in tort. Such a compensatory damages award does not exceed the amount that may be awarded under the workers\u2019 compensation system because it is not punitive. A workers\u2019 compensation award may not be deemed punitive in the constitutional sense merely because it exceeds that which could be awarded in the absence of willful misconduct. As noted in <em>Horst, </em>\u201cthe ordinary schedule of compensation [established under the workers\u2019 compensation system] was not considered to be full and complete compensation for the injuries received.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, a workers\u2019 compensation award exceeding that payable under \u201cthe ordinary schedule of compensation\u201d is not ipso facto more than may be justified as \u201cfull and complete compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Should the occasion arise where a section 4553 award of increased compensation is challenged by an employer for exceeding the injured employee\u2019s potential civil tort recovery, the board should adjudicate the question in much the same manner as in cases in which credit is claimed in a third party action and employer negligence is in issue. (\u00a7 3861; see <em>Associated Construction &amp; Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 829, 843-847 [150 Cal.Rptr. 888, 587 P.2d 684]; <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp.

Law of Employee Injuries &amp; Workers\u2019 Compensation (2d rev. ed. 1994) \u00a7 11.42[5], pp. 11-106 to 113.) In this latter context, general tort law, not workers\u2019 compensation law, defines the substantive law concerning recovery in a civil action. <em>(County of San Diego </em>v. <em>Sanfax Corp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 862, 873-874 [140 Cal.Rptr. 638, 568 P.2d 363].) This includes <em>compensatory </em>damages as follows: (1) the reasonable value of necessary medical expenses thus far incurred and fairly certain to be incurred in the future; (2) the value of loss of earnings or impairment of earning capacity from the time of injury to the time of settlement and loss or impairment of future earning capacity; (3) a reasonable compensation for physical pain, physical disability and mental suffering, including past and future; and (4) the value of all other special losses or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1626\">*1626</page-number>expenses that can be proven. <em>(Bonner, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d at p. 1037.) Consideration in this formula of punitive damages, seldom seen (see, e.g., <em>Johns-Manville, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 478), is not allowed because to do so would sanction constitutionally excessive damages and completely undermine the exclusivity of section 4553 as a workers\u2019 compensation remedy for an employment injury caused by the serious and willful misconduct of an employer. These same principles should govern the board\u2019s determination when an employer challenges an award of increased compensation as excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">The board\u2019s opinion and decision after reconsideration dated August 24, 1993, is annulled.

At that time, proceedings under section 132a for increased compensation as a result of unlawful discrimination were subject to the provisions of section 4553, which provided as pertinent for a 50 percent increase in compensation up to a limit of $10,000.

Rather, the 50 percent increase in the award is compensatory in two ways. First, the employee is compensated for damages directly caused as the result of the employer\u2019s prohibited discriminatory conduct.... Secondly, as the workers\u2019 compensation benefits ordinarily provided do not fully compensate the employee for his injuries and his other detriment, the allowance of the increase in benefits provides more nearly full compensation in those cases where the employer has discriminated against the employee because of the industrial injury. (Cf. <em>[Jensen, supra, 5 </em>Cal.3d 885].) <em>In so providing more adequate compensation, the 50 percent increase does not seek to specifically more fully compensate individual classes of benefits but rather to increase compensation in general.

Given the provisions of section 4600 requiring unlimited, reasonable lifetime medical treatment for the effects of an industrial injury, it is conceivable that there may be circumstances where adding a 50 percent increase in compensation to those \u201cbenefits otherwise recoverable\u201d could exceed the injured employee\u2019s potential compensatory recovery in tort and venture into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1625\">*1625</page-number>the realm of a constitutionally impermissible punitive damage award. This issue is not before us. Thus, while our holding herein theoretically allows an employee injured by the serious and willful misconduct of his or her employer to obtain the equivalent of civil tort damages, it categorically does <em>not </em>sanction punitive damages as discussed by the Supreme Court in <em>Johns-Manville, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at page 478. We emphasize the caveat that while compensation otherwise recoverable within the meaning of section 4553 includes every benefit, constitutional restraints may intersect at some point to prohibit the payment of further compensation under section 4553 which in effect then would be construed as punitive or constitutionally excessive damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1008-7\">PHELAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8eE\">I respectfully dissent. By allowing the 50 percent compensation increase to be calculated on the entire amount of the award, including nonindemnity payments such as vocational rehabilitation and medical-legal costs, the majority effectively give an injured employee in a willful misconduct case the functional equivalent of a tort action, save only the opportunity to collect punitive damages. I do not believe the Legislature intended Labor Code section 4553<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to be read so generously.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">In reaching their decision, the majority rely primarily on the broadly worded definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d in section 3207 as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Adams </em>holding that the 10 percent penalty under section 5814 for delayed payments applied to medical/legal expenses as well as to temporary disability indemnity. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 226 [133 Cal.Rptr. 517, 555 P.2d 303].) Additionally, they conclude that the Legislature\u2019s removal of the $10,000 cap on the amount by which compensation could be increased under section 4553 indicated \u201c. . . the Legislature intended no restriction on the basis upon which the increased compensation award is to be calculated.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1620.) The majority\u2019s analysis is fatally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">First, the focus on section 3207 fails to take into account the long-standing interpretation of section 4553 and the Legislature\u2019s obvious acquiescence in that interpretation. Secondly, their attempt to analogize the 50 percent \u201ccompensation\u201d increase under section 4553 to the 10 percent delayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1627\">*1627</page-number>payment penalty under section 5814 fails. Next, the majority read too much into the Legislature\u2019s removal of the $10,000 cap on the amount by which compensation can be increased. Finally, the majority fails to consider the impact their decision will have in the converse situation, that is where there is serious and willful misconduct by an employee. To be consistent, the majority must concede that the employee\u2019s entire compensation package must be reduced by 50 percent if he or she has been found to have sustained an industrial injury as a result of his or her own serious and willful misconduct. (\u00a7 4551.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Section 4553 provides in relevant part, \u201cThe amount of compensation otherwise recoverable shall be increased one-half . . . where the employee is injured by reason of the serious and willful misconduct of [the employer]</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">In <em>E. Clemens Horst Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1920) 184 Cal. 180 [193 P 105, 16 A.L.R. 611] (hereafter <em>Horst), </em>after upholding a finding of serious and willful misconduct, the Supreme Court addressed the employer\u2019s argument that the monetary award for serious and willful misconduct provided for in the newly enacted statute, which was the predecessor to section 4553,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provided for an unconstitutional penalty. The constitutional authority for a workers\u2019 compensation system had authorized, and still authorizes, payment of \u201ccompensation\u201d for work-related injuries; it does not authorize punitive damages. (Cal. Const. former art. XX, \u00a721; see now <em>id., </em>art. XIV, \u00a74.) Therefore, the court agreed with the employer that if the award for serious and willful misconduct is a penalty, \u201c. . . it is beyond the legislative power and void.\u201d <em>(Horst, supra, </em>184 Cal. at p. 192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">The court upheld the constitutionality of the award, finding that it was compensation and not a penalty. The court reasoned as follows. Although the workers\u2019 compensation system fully compensates the worker for medical expenses, it compensates the worker only partially for lost wages. Thus some of the burden of lost wages is on the employee and some is on the employer. Section 4553 forces the employer to pay a greater proportion of the compensation burden because of its misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">The court said, \u201cIt is ... to be presumed the legislature found that the actual injury by loss of earnings and other elements of damage, <em>not including </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1628\">*1628</page-number><em>expenses for costs of treatment and the like, </em>would be at least fifty per cent more than the fixed schedule would come to, and that it was deemed just if the injury was caused by willful misconduct of the employer he should be made to pay a greater proportion of the burden, and that the allowance in such a case should be increased by adding fifty per cent thereto. Thus considered, the additional allowance is really for <em>additional compensation in the strict sense, </em>and not for exemplary damages.\u201d <em>(Horst, supra, </em>184 Cal. at p. 193, italics added.) Thus, from the time of the statute\u2019s first enactment, its validity was viewed by the Supreme Court as depending, at least in part, on the fact that the increase was of compensation only and not of medical costs and \u201clike\u201d costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">The majority dismisses the <em>Horst </em>analysis as \u201cdicta we do not find relevant and compelling.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1624.) I do not believe <em>Horst </em>can be so easily dispatched. The language and holding of <em>Horst </em>have never been questioned by the Supreme Court. Rather, the court has quoted and relied on the decision and cited it with approval. (See <em>Johns-Manville Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 465, 478, fn. 12 [165 Cal.Rptr. 858, 612 P.2d 948, 9 A.L.R.4th 758] <em>(Rudkin); State Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 885, 888-889 [97 Cal.Rptr. 786, 489 P.2d 818] <em>(Jensen).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">In <em>Jensen, </em>the question before the court was whether an award under section 4553 assessed against the Department of Corrections violated Government Code section 818, which proscribed awards of punitive damages against public entities. The court quoted from <em>Horst </em>at length and reaffirmed its holding, stating, \u201cIt is manifest from the analysis in <em>Horst </em>that section 4553 ... is designed to provide more nearly full compensation to an injured employee rather than to penalize an employer; otherwise the section would be unconstitutional.\u201d <em>(Jensen, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 889.) After distinguishing other decisions which seemed to support a contrary conclusion, the court held that the section 4553 award did not violate Government Code section 818, in view of, inter alia, \u201cthe long prevailing rationale of <em>Horst </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Jensen, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 891.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">In <em>Rudkin </em>the court held that a worker injured by asbestos who had filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim could later bring a civil action against his employer for fraudulent concealment of asbestos disease. The court characterized the employer\u2019s actions in the case as so egregious as to justify an award of punitive damages, which could \u201cbe afforded only in an action at law.\u201d <em>(Rudkin, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 478.) At this point the court\u2019s footnote reads, \u201cThe 50 percent increase in the award authorized by section 4553 is additional compensation and does not represent exemplary damages. [Citing <em>Horst </em>and <em>Jensen.]\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 478, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1629\">*1629</page-number>The majority\u2019s rationale under section 3207 is also not persuasive. Workers\u2019 compensation statutes have always defined \u201ccompensation\u201d as including \u201cevery benefit or payment\u201d conferred by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. (Stats. 1917, ch. 586, \u00a7 3, subd. (3), p. 833.) Today section 3207 provides, \u201c \u2018Compensation\u2019 means compensation under Division 4 [Workers\u2019 Compensation and Insurance] and includes every benefit or payment conferred by Division 4 upon an injured employee, including vocational rehabilitation, or in the event of his [or her] death, upon his [or her] dependents, without regard to negligence.\u201d The <em>Horst, Rudkin, </em>and <em>Jensen </em>courts, presumably were aware of the broad general statutory definition of \u201ccompensation,\u201d but found that they were compelled to narrow the definition for purposes of section 4553 so that the constitutional prohibition of punitive damages could be honored. The Legislature has revisited section 4553 by reenactment or amendment on seven separate occasions since <em>Horst </em>was decided in October 1920. (See Historical Note, 44A West\u2019s Ann. Lab. Code (1989 ed.) \u00a7 4553, p. 399.) We must assume that, in doing so, the Legislature had full knowledge of the <em>Horst </em>interpretation of the word \u201ccompensation\u201d found in the former version of section 4553. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Keppeler </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 705, 711 [279 Cal.Rptr. 168].) \u201c \u2018There is a strong presumption that when the Legislature reenacts a statute which has been judicially construed it adopts the construction placed on the statute by the courts.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wilkoff v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 345, 353 [211 Cal.Rptr. 742, 696 P.2d 134]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gangemi </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1790, 1797 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 462].) Therefore, under this long-standing decisional authority, I conclude there is a particular definition of \u201ccompensation otherwise recoverable\u201d as used in section 4553 which prevails over the general usage in section 3207.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The attempt by the majority to draw an analogy to the method for calculating the 10 percent penalty for unreasonably delayed payment of benefits under section 5814 is inapposite. The majority conclude: \u201cIf medical-legal fees are \u2018compensation\u2019 for calculating increased compensation under section 5814, as determined by the Supreme Court in <em>Adams [Adams </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 226], then surely the cost of medical treatment, a more immediate and significant benefit to an injured employee, must also be treated as \u2018compensation\u2019 within the meaning of section 4553.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1619, fns. omitted.) <em>Adams, </em>of course, held that section 5814 should be construed in the light of the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d set forth in section 3207. There is simply nothing in <em>Adams, </em>however, which undermines the long-standing interpretation of the word \u201ccompensation\u201d in section 4553 first announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Horst. </em>Moreover, even the reach of <em>Adams </em>has been restricted. In <em>Gallamore </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1630\">*1630</page-number>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 815, 826 [153 Cal.Rptr. 590, 591 P.2d 1242], the Supreme Court observed, \u201cWe stress that in <em>Adams </em>we did not suggest that the penalty should be applied to any benefits, such as the permanent disability award, which had not been delayed, despite the fact that such benefits arguably were part of the \u2018full\u2019 award to which the penalty could apply.\u201d The court held that the penalty should not be applied to categories of benefits which were neither delayed nor refused. Thus, I find nothing in <em>Adams </em>which supports the expansive definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d which the majority seeks to infuse into section 4553. The penalty calculation under section 5814 is simply not comparable to the compensation indemnity increase which section 4553 authorizes. Section 5814 <em>is </em>a \u201cpenalty statute\u201d which was \u201cenacted as an inducement to prompt payment on the part of private employers and their insurers . . . .\u201d <em>([DuBois </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 396-397 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978].) Section 4533, on the other hand, does not impose a penalty but rather provides an increase in compensation to the employee for an injury. <em>(Fermino </em>v. <em>Fedco, Inc. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 701, 713-714 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 18, 872 P.2d 559].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The majority also attach unwarranted significance to the Legislature\u2019s deletion in 1982 of the $10,000 limit on the amount that can be recovered from an employer as a result of serious and willful misconduct. They conclude: \u201cFrom this it may be inferred that in 1982, the last time it modified section 4553, the Legislature intended no restriction on the basis upon which the increased compensation award is to be calculated.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1620.) I strongly disagree. The amendment neither expressly nor impliedly addresses the \u201cbasis\u201d for calculating an increased compensation award. Rather, the amendment appears to be nothing more than a legislative recognition of the effects of inflation\u2014something it had obviously addressed on three prior occasions when it raised the maximum recoverable amount. In 1949 the Legislature raised the ceiling from $2,500 to $3,750; in 1959 the increase went to $7,500; and in 1972 the maximum award amount was increased to $10,000. (See Historical Note, 44A West\u2019s Ann. Lab. Code, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4553, p. 399.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">Additionally, the majority suggest that, since the Legislature did not remove the $10,000 limit from the 50 percent increase in compensation which can be awarded against an employer for unlawful discrimination under section 132a, this is \u201ccompelling evidence of a legislative intent to increase the potential recovery for an employee who suffers an injury caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1631\">*1631</page-number>by the serious and willful misconduct of an employer under section 4553.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1621.) I agree that the Legislature intended to allow an increased recovery for an employee, but that conclusion does not assist at all in answering the question of how the increase is to be calculated. In short, there is nothing in the 1982 amendments which demonstrates the Legislature intended that the increase was to be calculated on the basis of nonindemnity payments as well as compensation indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Finally, the majority overlook a direct and immediate consequence of their decision which I believe will defeat one of the basic purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation law in the circumstance where the employee is injured on the job as a result of his or her own serious and willful misconduct. Under section 4551, the amount of \u201ccompensation otherwise recoverable\u201d by an injured employee must be \u201creduced one-half\u2019 (with certain specified exceptions). These statutes were enacted at the same time and use identical terminology. Indeed, the words \u201cserious and willful misconduct\u201d in both sections 4551 and 4553 have been construed as having the same meaning. <em>(Rudkin, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 465, 473, fn. 7; <em>Hawaiian Pineapple Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 656, 664 [255 P.2d 431].) Surely the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d in these counterpart statutes must likewise be identical. Thus, under the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccompensation,\u201d an employee\u2019s entire award, including vocational rehabilitation and medical-legal benefits, must be cut in half if the employee is injured as a result of his or her own serious and willful misconduct. I cannot believe the Legislature intended such a drastic consequence in this circumstance. It would surely undermine one of the fundamental purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation law\u2014namely, to provide for an injured employee\u2019s early return to the productive work force, regardless of fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">The California Constitution declares that the \u201csocial public policy\u201d of the state includes \u201cfull provision for such medical, surgical, hospital and other remedial treatment as is requisite to cure and relieve [the job related injured worker] from the effects of such injury.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4.) Taking away one-half of an injured employee\u2019s compensation indemnity award because of serious and willful misconduct may make good sense\u2014but certainly it does not when it comes to medical and rehabilitation expenses. To do so would directly undermine the public policy which seeks to assure prompt return of injured employees to the work force regardless of how or why they received their industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1632\">*1632</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the opinion and decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Petitioner\u2019s application for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 13, 1995.
