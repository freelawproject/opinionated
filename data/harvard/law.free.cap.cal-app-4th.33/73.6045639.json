Years later, she identifies one man as the father and blood tests show this man closely matches the genetic characteristics expected of the child\u2019s father. By statute, these test results trigger a presumption of paternity. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7555; former Evid. Code, \u00a7 895.5.) The other men are not tested. We conclude evidence of the mere existence of other, untested, men is insufficient of itself to rebut the statutory presumption of paternity based on genetic testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The Attorney General prosecutes this appeal from an adverse ruling dismissing a paternity complaint. We construe the premature notice of appeal from this nonappealable ruling to encompass the judgment. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 414, pp. 411-413.) We need address but one of the arguments: whether substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s decision. On this question we disagree with the reasoning and analysis proffered by the Attorney General, but we agree no substantial evidence supports the judgment. We reverse with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The specifics of the testimony will be revisited later, after a discussion of the scientific significance of it. However, to provide context we offer the following pr\u00e9cis: The child was bom on October 17, 1982. The mother had sex with defendant around the time of the Pig Bowl, which was played on January 23, 1982, about nine months before. (See fn. 3, <em>post.) </em>The trial court\u2019s opinion is muddled on this point, but the statement of facts in defendant\u2019s respondent\u2019s brief states without qualification that the mother had intercourse with him during the period of conception. Defendant is bound by this concession. <em>(Mangini </em>v. <em>Aerojet-General Corp. </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1125, 1152 [281 Cal.Rptr. 827]; <em>Federer </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 184, 186 [190 Cal.Rptr. 187]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 482, pp. 472-473.) There was evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>during that period the mother may have had sex with three other men. Based on certain blood tests, when comparing defendant to a random man there was a 99.69 percent relative chance he was the father, even assuming the mother had three other sex partners. Defendant\u2019s \u201cpaternity index\u201d was 970, more than enough to trigger a statutory presumption of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\n<em>Genetic Testing of Blood</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Some knowledge of the science underlying genetic testing is necessary to understand the legal issue raised in this case. \u201cIn a paternity trial, a fact-finder is naturally tempted to seize upon statistical figures, like the paternity index or the probability of paternity, as lifelines of objective truth in a sea of prevarication. \u2018Soft\u2019 evidence involving difficult questions of credibility and other circumstantial matters may be submerged or lost because it appears unnecessary to resolve the questions in light of the hard, scientific, mathematical proof. Under these circumstances it is absolutely essential that the significance of the mathematical proof be clearly understood by both counsel and the fact-finder.\u201d (Peterson, <em>A Few Things You Should Know About Paternity Tests (But Were Afraid to Ask) </em>(1982) 22 Santa Clara L.Rev. 667, 684, fn. omitted (Peterson).)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Through testing of blood and tissue, particularly HLA (human leukocyte [white blood cell] antigen) testing, certain genes can be identified. If a child has a gene not contributed by the mother, it was contributed by the father. If a man could not have contributed the gene, he is not the father. But the converse is not true; merely because he could have contributed the gene does not prove the man is the father. Thus, genetic testing alone cannot <em>establish </em>paternity. By itself, at most it can only preclude paternity. (See Comment, <em>DNA Fingerprinting and Paternity Testing </em>(1989) 22 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 609, 614.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Certain genes are more or less common in given human populations. If the putative father possesses uncommon genes which must have been contributed by the child\u2019s father, often it is said there is a greater likelihood or probability he is the true father, expressed as a high paternity index or \u201cprobability of paternity.\u201d <em>(DNA Fingerprinting and Paternity Testing, supra, 22 </em>U.C. Davis L.Rev. at pp. 616-617.) But the assumption misleads. (Peterson, <em>supra, 22 </em>Santa Clara L.Rev. at pp. 669, 685.) This \u201clikelihood\u201d exists only because we assume the man had what is obliquely referred to as \u201caccess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>to the mother.\u201d (E.g., <em>In re Paternity ofM.J.B. </em>(1988) 144 Wis.2d 638 [425 N.W.2d 404, 409].) Regardless of the genetic makeup of the putative father, if he is infertile or did not have access to the mother, he is not the father. Without access there can be no paternity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 410.)  The trier of fact cannot find a defendant is the father based solely on expert testimony. Such testimony must be coupled with so-called \u201cnongenetic\u201d testimony (\u201csoft\u201d evidence) establishing access.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">A joint committee of the American Bar Association and American Medical Association promulgated certain guidelines which, in combination with standards set by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), create the backdrop for expert testimony in a particular case. <em>(Joint AMA-ABA Guidelines: Present Status of Serologic Testing in Problems of Disputed Parentage </em>(1976) 10 Fam. L.Q. 247 [hereafter Guidelines]; see generally, Walker, Inclusion Probabilities in Parentage Testing (1983).) A brief explanation of certain terms follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The <em>probability of exclusion </em>(or \u201cprior probability of exclusion\u201d) is \u201cthe probability that the tests employed will exclude a falsely accused man. If the probability of exclusion with the tests employed is 95 percent, of 100 non-fathers 95 will be excluded and 5 will not be excluded. . . . This does not mean that there is a 95 percent chance that the alleged father is the true father. . . . [T]here is no direct relationship between the probability of exclusion and the likelihood of paternity. Likelihood of paternity cannot be extrapolated from the probability of exclusion. . . . The significance of the probability of exclusion is that if he is not excluded as a possible father, the likelihood of paternity can be estimated by considering other available empirical evidence.\u201d <em>(Division of Family Services </em>v. <em>Guffey </em>(Mo.App. 1990) 795 S.W.2d 546, 548, fn. 2, italics omitted <em>(Guffey.) </em>Confusingly, a separate \u201cprobability of exclusion\u201d is specific for the given mother-child combination. (Peterson, <em>supra, </em>22 Santa Clara L.Rev. at p. 679; see Reisner &amp; Bolk, <em>A Layman\u2019s Guide to the Use of Blood Group Analysis in Paternity Testing </em>(1981-1982) 20 J. Fam. L. 657, 671 [hereafter A <em>Layman\u2019s Guide].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The <em>paternity index, </em>sometimes called the \u201clikelihood ratio,\u201d or \u201cchance (or likelihood) of paternity,\u201d \u201cinvolves the probability that a cross between the [putative father] and the mother would produce an offspring with the child\u2019s phenotypes and the corresponding probability for a random selection of genes from the male population.\u201d (Kaye, <em>Plemel as a Primer on Proving Paternity </em>(1988) 24 Willamette L.Rev. 867, 877 [hereafter <em>Proving Paternity].) </em>\u201cDespite the alternative labels, it is <em>not </em>the probability that the accused is the father.\u201d <em>(Plemel </em>v. <em>Walter </em>(1987) 303 Ore. 262 [735 P.2d 1209, 1213], italics in original <em>(Plemel)\u2019, </em>see <em>Guffey, supra, </em>795 S.W.2d at p. 549, fn. 2.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The <em>chance of paternity </em>is the paternity index converted into a percentage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Plemel, supra, </em>735 P.2d at p. 1214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The <em>probability of paternity </em>(or \u201cposterior probability of paternity\u201d) is the probability the putative father is the true father of the child in question, and is a term often misused and misunderstood. <em>The probability of paternity must take into account the \u201csoft\u201d or \u201cnongenetic\u201d evidence in the case. </em>Such \u201csoft\u201d evidence is converted into a figure known as the \u201cprior chance\u201d or \u201cprior probability of paternity.\u201d For example, if but one man had access to the mother, his <em>prior </em>probability of paternity (the probability of paternity without considering the genetic evidence) would be 100 percent. His <em>posterior </em>probability of paternity (the probability after considering the genetic evidence) would also be 100 percent, because the \u201csoft\u201d evidence establishes paternity, regardless of the genetic evidence. If a man had no access to the mother, his prior probability of paternity would be zero, as would his posterior probability of paternity. Again, regardless of the genetic evidence, the nongenetic evidence establishes nonpaternity. <em>(Plemel, supra, </em>735 P.2d at p. 1215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">But the nongenetic evidence is never this simple. In most cases the trier of fact has some evidence of access and some evidence of nonaccess. \u201cSince these absolutes cannot be known, we can estimate these values as 90 percent for a strong pro-paternity case and 10 percent for a weak case. Traditionally, laboratories use a neutral figure of 50 percent in their calculations. When 50 percent is used, the likelihood of paternity is mathematically identical to the probability of paternity. Hence when laboratories ignore the prior probability they are assuming it is 50 percent, a figure which may or may not be appropriate.\u201d (A <em>Layman\u2019s Guide, supra, </em>20 J. Fam. L. at p. 674; see <em>Proving Paternity, supra, </em>24 Willamette L.Rev. at pp. 878-881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Use of the 50 percent figure means it is as likely the putative father had access to the mother as the random man. Some courts view this assumption of equal access as an impermissible evidentiary presumption which deprives the defendant of due process. (See <em>State </em>v. <em>Skipper </em>(1994) 228 Conn. 610 [637 A.2d 1101, 1103-1108] [criminal conviction reversed because testimony assumed intercourse took place]; <em>In re Paternity of M.J.B., supra, </em>425 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>N.W.2d at p. 409; but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Spann </em>(1993) 130 N.J. 484 [617 A.2d 247, 253] [no such presumption arose]; <em>Kammer </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1988) 73 Md.App. 565 [535 A.2d 936, 941] [use of equal chance is neutral].) The better practice may be for the expert to testify to a range of prior probabilities, such as 10, 50 and 90 percent, and allow the trier of fact to determine which to use. <em>(Plemel, supra, </em>735 P.2d at p. 1219; Peterson, <em>supra, </em>22 Santa Clara L.Rev. at p. 691, fn. 74; see <em>M.J.B., supra, </em>425 N.W.2d at pp. 410-411; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1987) 320 N.C.452 [358 S.E.2d 679, 682]; <em>Kammer, supra, </em>535 A.2d at p. 942.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">We need not enter into this quagmire because this precise point is not raised on appeal. But it emphasizes the importance of understanding expert testimony cannot supplant evidence of access; expert testimony must be viewed through the lens provided by the soft evidence.  Accordingly, an expert \u201cis unqualified to state that any single figure is the accused\u2019s \u2018probability of paternity\u2019 . . . [because] such a statement requires an estimation of the strength of the other evidence presented in the case . . . , an estimation that the expert is in no better position to make than the trier of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">With this understanding of the testing nomenclature, we consider the effect of a statute on the meaning of the scientific testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\n<em>Presumption of Paternity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The usual paternity suit involves a man, hereafter referred to as the defendant, who does not wish to be declared the father of the child. Because of the accuracy and statistical significance of modem blood testing, the California Legislature has adopted a statutory presumption of paternity. If the defendant\u2019s blood test results in a particular numerical score, he is presumed to be the father. Family Code section 7555 (former Evid. Code, \u00a7 895.5) provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) There is a rebuttable presumption, affecting the burden of proof, of paternity, if the court finds that the paternity index, as calculated by the experts qualified as examiners of genetic markers, is 100 or greater. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The express legislative intent was \u201cto standardize the process by which paternity is established in order to achieve a greater degree of equity and consistency in paternity determinations. The Legislature finds that the science of genetic testing has advanced to the degree that paternity determinations resulting from such testing are so reliable that the burden of proof can be shifted to the putative father.\" (Stats. 1986, ch. 629, \u00a7 1, pp. 2136-2137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\n<em>Rebutting the Presumption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">A. <em>The Required Quantity of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">The defendant is entitled to introduce other expert testimony. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7557.) Once the statutory presumption is triggered, the court must consider all of the evidence, including any blood test evidence. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7554, subd. (b).) The statutory presumption \u201cmay be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7555, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The Attorney General argues the statutory presumption is not only triggered by a paternity index of 100, the presumption is strengthened as the index rises. In his view, the degree of proof needed to rebut the presumption rises with the index, requiring a defendant with a very high index to produce \u201cunusually strong contradictory evidence\u201d or \u201ctruly extraordinarily strong and reliable evidence.\u201d This can be pictured as a line curving asymptotically toward another\u2014ever closer but never reaching. The Attorney General\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>picture is out of focus: The Legislature has stated the requisite standard of proof in the statute: preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">B. <em>The Required Quality of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The statute, Family Code section 7555, does not specify what classes of evidence may be used to rebut the presumption. In our view, the defendant may avail himself, inter alia, of impeachment and rebuttal of expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">First, if the defendant introduces evidence the expert testing was conducted improperly, or the wrong gene frequency table was used, or the opposing expert is biased, the defendant may demonstrate his paternity index is not 100 or more. For example, a defendant may prove he is excluded genetically by a test performed by his expert but not considered by the opposing expert or that his paternity index is only 99 or less. Such evidence, if believed, undermines the presumption itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Second, the defendant may prove he is infertile or otherwise had no access to the mother during the period of conception. (See <em>Matter of CM.C. </em>(1990) 155 Wis.2d 331 [455 N.W.2d 248, 249, 250] [fact finder could find birth control during intercourse established nonaccess].) Such evidence establishes the defendant\u2019s prior probability of paternity is zero and, hence, shows nonpaternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Third, a defendant might prove another man who had access to the mother also has a high paternity index, which would raise a competing or \u201cinconsistent\u201d presumption. (See 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) Burden of Proof and Presumptions, \u00a7 274, p. 234.) For example, two related men could have access to the mother. (See 1 McCormick on Evidence (4th ed. 1992) Experimental and Scientific Evidence, \u00a7211, pp. 959-960 [Talmudic problem of widow marrying brother in-law too soon and giving birth six months later].) Or a woman may not know with which of two related men she had intercourse. (See, e.g., D. Cronenberg, Dead Ringers (U.C.L.A. Film-T.V. 1988).) The so-called \u201chard\u201d scientific testing could result in competing presumptions of paternity which canceled each other out, relegating the trier of fact to the \u201csoft\u201d evidence. (See Teraski, <em>Resolution by HLA Testing of 1000 Paternity Cases Not Excluded by ABO Testing </em>(1977-1978) 16 J. Fam. L. 543 , 549.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">But what if the other man is dead, missing, or unknown? Except in the rare case where he left behind a blood or tissue sample, his paternity index <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>is unknown and hence, no different from the random man\u2019s index. For this reason, evidence of access by one untested man does nothing to rebut the statutory presumption. Such evidence does not alter the defendant\u2019s paternity index. (See <em>Proving Paternity, supra, </em>24 Willamette L.Rev. at p. 882.) Nor does it change his prior or posterior probabilities of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The value of \u201cother man\u201d evidence is limited. Tested and excluded \u201cother men\u201d fall out of the equation. A tested, included man may raise a competing presumption if his paternity index is high enough. But in most cases which involve a high paternity index, testimony about an untested man or untested men will not be very important because proof of access by several untested men may not alter significantly the probability of paternity. (See fn. 2, \u00b6 3, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Our conclusion is in accord with <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Crawford </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1989) 552 So.2d 926, wherein the mother testified she had sex with Crawford and another man during the period of conception. The other man was not tested, but Crawford\u2019s test showed a 98.23 percent probability of paternity. Under the Florida statute, this created a rebuttable presumption of paternity. \u201cThe trial court recognized the [statutory presumption] but found that [the mother\u2019s] credibility was questionable and that [she] received a military allotment from the other man while he was in the service. On these findings, the court ruled that [Crawford] had rebutted the statutory presumption.\u201d (552 So.2d at p. 927, fn. omitted.) The Florida appellate court reversed: \u201cIn the instant case, [Crawford] failed to meet the burden of overcoming the presumption. [He] did not demonstrate that the HLA test results were erroneous, did not avail himself of the procedures for retesting . . . and did not submit evidence tending to prove that, for any reason (such as sterility or total lack of access), he <em>could not </em>have been the father. Absent such evidence, [his] bare denial and testimony that someone other than [himself] had sexual relations with the mother did not overcome the presumption established by the HLA test results and Section 742.12(1), Florida Statutes (1987).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 928.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">We do not imply that under California law a defendant\u2019s \u201cbare denial\u201d of intercourse would be insufficient, even if believed by the trier of fact. But <em>Jones </em>is correct insofar as it establishes a defendant must produce some sort of evidence which rebuts the presumption, and in the usual case, \u201cother man\u201d evidence is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\n<em>Factual Showing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Of course, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling. \u201cTo be considered substantial, evidence must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u2018 \u201cof ponderable legal significance . . . reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value. . . \u2019 \u201d <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Zuckerman </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1113, 1134 [234 Cal.Rptr. 630], citations and internal quotation marks omitted.) All reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303-304 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 562 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255]; <em>Overton </em>v. <em>Vita-Food Corp. </em>(1949) 94 Cal.App.2d 367, 370 [210 P.2d 757].)

We disregard the Attorney General\u2019s editorial comments about the facts, such as the repeated reference to the child as \u201cyoung Johnny,\u201d the unsupported claim the mother was badgered in the trial court, and the assumption the defendant must be the father because he opposed DNA testing of his person. We previously denied the Attorney General\u2019s request to consider evidence not introduced at trial. In a supplemental brief, the Attorney General makes further factual assertions which we disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The mother had engaged in intercourse with Bill Krueger in December 1981, but could not remember the last time. Until recently she thought John Utley was the father of the child, \u201c[a]nd the only other person that I had been with at all was Bill Misura, and our first date was the Pig Bowl.\u201d She first had sex with defendant the evening of the Pig Bowl.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She testified this was around January 22, 1982. She had intercourse with him on one other evening, for a total of five times on two evenings. She had thought she might already be pregnant by Utley, but despite this belief, she later told defendant she was pregnant and he offered to pay for one-half of the abortion costs. After she decided not to abort the child, the mother continued to have intercourse with Utley. She changed her belief about paternity when she received a laboratory report which excluded Utley as the father. In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>1982 child support document, she claimed one \u201cSteve\u201d was the father, but she testified this was a lie. In other documents she claimed Utley was the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">To the extent the Attorney General believes no reasonable inference could be drawn the mother had intercourse with other untested men, he is mistaken. From the evidence presented, the trial court could find the mother had intercourse with defendant, Krueger, \u201cSteve\u201d and Utley.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">An expert, Dr. Julita Fong, testified Utley was not the father. Defendant had a paternity index, as defined by statute, of 970. \u201c[Pjatemity is practically proved.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When comparing defendant to a \u201crandom man,\u201d there was a 99.69 percent relative chance defendant was the father, even assuming the mother had three other sexual partners. Assuming but one other partner, the relative chance was 99.90 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Defendant did try to prove through cross-examination that he was missing a particular gene which the father had to have, but the evidence included testimony explaining one of the tests was invalid and Dr. Fong opined defendant did have the gene in question, as reflected on two other runs of the same test.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Although defendant was permitted to produce other expert testimony (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7557), he did not. Accordingly, the question of paternity was \u201csubmitted upon all the evidence, including evidence based upon the tests\u201d in accordance with Family Code section 7554, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">On appeal, the parties disagree about the strength of the medical testimony, but the trial court\u2019s findings state: \u201cThe testimony of Dr. Fong established a rebuttable presumption of paternity regarding the defendant. Her findings are found to be valid and well established in scientific methodology. Her testimony is entirely believable.\u201d This finding stands unassailed and, therefore, with one exception we need not delve further into the complexities of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Defendant\u2019s principal argument on appeal relates to a snippet of Dr. Fong\u2019s testimony: \u201cThe trial court stated it found Dr. Fong\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>entirely believable. Dr. Fong specifically testified that there was only a 46.28 percent likelihood that respondent had the necessary genes to be capable of fathering this child. . . . This testimony alone is sufficient to uphold the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">We disagree. The trial court\u2019s statement that it found Dr. Fong\u2019s testimony credible works to defendant\u2019s disadvantage, because that testimony, taken as a whole, establishes the requisite paternity index, which the trial court found had been established. The portion of the testimony defendant points to is taken out of context. Dr. Fong testified this 46.28 percent \u201clikelihood that [defendant] contributed the necessary genes to be the father\u201d must be combined with \u201chow likely it is that a \u2018random man\u2019 would contribute the necessary genes to be the father [in order] to achieve the combined paternity index and the relative chance of paternity.\u201d That is consistent with our previous explanation of the need to use a \u201crandom man.\u201d (See p. 79 &amp; fn. 2, \u00b6 2, <em>ante.) </em>The trial court specifically asked whether this figure meant there was less than a 50 percent chance \u201cthat [defendant] was in fact the person that contributed the genes,\u201d to which Dr. Fong replied no. If and only if Dr. Fong ignored the \u201crandom man,\u201d which accounts for the frequency of genes in the relevant population, would the number bear the meaning defendant attributes to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Because Utley is excluded by the medical evidence, which the trial court accepted, we are concerned only with the other two men, \u201cSteve\u201d and Krueger, plus a \u201crandom\u201d man. When Dr. Fong testified defendant has a 99.69 percent chance of being the father, she assumed it was equally likely all four men (defendant, \u201cSteve,\u201d Krueger and the random man) were the father. The paternity index, divided by the paternity index plus three (\u201cSteve,\u201d Krueger and the random man) equals the (posterior) probability of paternity. (See fn. 2, \u00b6 2, <em>ante.) </em>In this case, 970 divided by 973 equals 99.69 percent, as Dr. Fong testified. Thus, given that the trial court credited the medical testimony, the presence of other, untested men does not aid in rebutting the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The trial court found \u201cthe testimony of and documentary evidence presented through [the mother] causes the court to find that the presumption of paternity has been rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. [H Significant factors considered were the great number of conflicting statements regarding sexual partners by [mother] and the great passage of time which contributed to failure of memory and conflicting statements about dates and times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">We do not construe the court\u2019s findings to mean it disbelieved the mother\u2019s testimony she had intercourse with defendant during the period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>conception. The court stated at the outset the mother had had \u201ccasual relations\u201d (i.e., sexual congress) with defendant, Utley, and Krueger, but that she was imprecise about when. Unless the court believed defendant had access to the mother, it had no cause to invoke the presumption. (See pp. 78-79, <em>ante.) </em>Moreover, as stated earlier, defendant concedes he did have intercourse with the mother during the period of conception. We infer the court found \u201cSteve\u201d existed. Assuming Utley is excluded as the father, the record shows the father could be Bill Krueger, \u201cSteve,\u201d or defendant. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, each of these men had sexual congress with the mother around the time of conception.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The trial court took the view the mother\u2019s conflicting statements and poor memory of dates means it is <em>equally likely </em>any of these men could be the father, and therefore the presumption was rebutted. However, the putative father bore the burden to rebut the presumption of paternity. Therefore as a matter of law it was not equally likely any of the men could be the father. Due to the results of the genetic testing, which established a paternity index of 970, defendant was presumed the father. Defendant produced no evidence of impotence or sterility, no evidence he did not have sexual congress with the mother (in fact, he concedes that he did), and no expert evidence controverting the \u201cmatch\u201d found by Dr. Fong. He produced no evidence that any other man who had access to the mother during the period of conception had been tested and found to have a \u201cmatch.\u201d The <em>evidence </em>left is that the mother had sex with two untested, unexcluded, men during the period of conception. This evidence is insufficient to rebut by a preponderance of the evidence the statutory presumption of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The trial court\u2019s finding is irreconcilable with the facts. Defendant had intercourse with the mother during the period of conception and has more than the necessary blood characteristics to trigger the statutory presumption of paternity. The trial court accepted the medical evidence. The trial court\u2019s conclusion the existence of other, untested men rebutted the presumption is not correct. Although the mother had difficulty remembering when she had intercourse with which men, that does not affect the fact she had intercourse with defendant during the period of conception and does not rebut the presumption. The statutory presumption stands unrebutted. Defendant is the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to enter a judgment of paternity.

We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\"><em>(Plemel, supra, </em>735 P.2d at p. 1217.) An example will help illustrate these concepts. In <em>Plemel, </em>the tests showed a prior probability of exclusion of 97.5 percent. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1211.) The putative father (Walter) had a paternity index of 178. This means \u201cthat it is 178 times more likely that a union of Plemel and Walter would produce a child with the observed [genetic] markers than would a union of Plemel and a set of [paired genes] picked at random from men of Walter\u2019s race.\u201d <em>(Proving Paternity, supra, </em>24 Willamette L.Rev. at p. 874.) This is converted into a chance of paternity of 99.4 percent (178 divided by 1 + 178 = .9944). <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>Plemel, supra, </em>735 P.2d at p. 1214.) Although the expert did not express a probability of paternity as such, by inference he assumed a prior probability of paternity of 50 percent, and the (posterior) probability of paternity was 99.4 percent. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1215.)</p>\n<p id=\"Amv\">\u201cIt can be mathematically shown [sic] that the index of a random man is one. Since one random man is equally as likely as another random man to have fathered the child, this conclusion is also intuitively clear. It can also be shown that if more than one man is possibly the father, and if each man is equally as likely to have fathered the child as any other, then the probability that any one of the men is the father is equal to his paternity index divided by the sum of the indices of all of the possible fathers.\u201d (Peterson, <em>supra, </em>22 Santa Clara L.Rev. at p. 686, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"ArA\">A probability of paternity for Walter of 99.4 percent is determined by dividing his paternity index by the sum of his index plus the random man\u2019s index, or 178/ (178+1) or .9944. If it were certain two men had access to Plemel besides Walter, Walter\u2019s paternity index would still be 178. But the probability of paternity would be 178 divided by 178 plus 2. That would be .9888 or 98.9 percent. Therefore, in Walter\u2019s case, proof of access by two untested other men would not indicate nonpaternity. Even if Plemel had intercourse with five untested men besides Walter, his posterior probability of paternity would still be 97.3 percent (178/ (183) = .9726).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The \u201cevening of\u2019 the game would be January 22, 1982, as she estimated.
