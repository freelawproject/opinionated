Defendant argues his convictions should be reversed because, as to each victim, he committed at most the crime of attempted extortion, not attempted robbery, and he was the victim of misconduct by the prosecutor and ineffective assistance of counsel. We reject these arguments and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Defendant was a \u201crent\" collector for the 18th Street gang in Los Angeles. His duty was to collect payments, referred to by the gang as \u201crent,\u201d from drug dealers in the gang\u2019s territory for the privilege of doing business there. As we describe more fully below, one night defendant\u2019s rent collecting activities went too far and he shot and killed Jose Argueta, one of the drug dealers from whom he was attempting to collect rent. The same night, defendant also attempted to obtain money at gunpoint from Jose Gonzales, who was not a drug dealer, but simply a passerby on his way to his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">At the trial Officer John Thacker, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s gang unit, was allowed to testify without objection as to his interpretation of the crimes of robbery and extortion. He also testified, without objection, defendant had engaged in attempts to rob Argueta and Gonzales.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The jury found defendant guilty of the first degree murder of Argueta and found, as a special circumstance, the murder occurred in the perpetration of an attempted robbery. The jury also found defendant guilty of the attempted robbery of Argueta and Gonzales. Defendant was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole for the murder of Argueta and given additional sentences for the robberies and various enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Although we find counsel for defendant was deficient in permitting Officer Thacker to express opinions about the law, what crimes were committed, and defendant\u2019s guilt of those crimes, we conclude this deficiency did not affect the outcome of the trial and thus we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">I. A <em>Witness May Not Express Opinions on the Definition of Crimes, Whether a Crime Has Been Committed, or on the Defendant\u2019s Guilt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Officer Thacker of the Los Angeles Police Department was an expert witness for the prosecution. He testified he was familiar with street gangs in general and the 18th Street gang in particular, and that defendant was a member of the 18th Street gang. He also testified he was familiar with the term \u201ccollecting rent\u201d as used by members of the 18th Street gang. Asked what that term meant, Thacker testified, \u201c[T]he individuals who want to come into their area and sell narcotics, they must pay a certain amount of rent to the 18th Street gang in order to sell their narcotics in that neighborhood.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Thacker was then asked to describe how \u201ccollecting rent\u201d worked. He responded: \u201c[Certain gang members] are given a particular area. They are given responsibility of collecting money from the narcotics dealers in that particular area. That individual would then go out, confront these individuals and have [the dealers] pay that individual for the purpose for allowing them to sell narcotics in that neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">As to why the drug dealers would give money to the gang members, Thacker testified: \u201cI can answer that by giving an example. If I were [dealing drugs], if somebody pointed a gun to me and said give me your money if you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>want to deal here, I am going to kill you, I would do that, because I am afraid for my life, afraid for my safety. . . . It\u2019s a matter of staying alive. It\u2019s exactly the matter of staying alive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">On cross-examination, the following colloquy took place between defense counsel and Officer Thacker.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cQ. And this \u2018collecting rent,\u2019 would you describe that as basically extortion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">\u201cA. Not entirely, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">No error is assigned to the evidence up to this point. However, on redirect examination, without objection from defense counsel, the following colloquy took place between the prosecutor and Officer Thacker.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">\u201cQ. You just had a question which is, would you consider this \u2018collecting of rent\u2019 basically extortion. You said not exactly. How would you describe it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">\u201cA. Well, I would describe it as a robbery. My definition of robbery is taking of someone\u2019s personal property through force or fear with the immediate danger of something happening to you. I know that is taking place. That is what happened in this particular case. Then when you get extortion, yes, that is happening also, but it\u2019s a two-fold issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">\u201cQ. What\u2019s extortion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-11\">\u201cA. Extortion is taking of somebody\u2019s personal property with a fear of a later threat against yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-12\">\u201cQ. In other words, if I have a gun on you right now and demand your money, what is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">\u201cA. It\u2019s a robbery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">On appeal, defendant contends a witness\u2019s opinion about the meaning of a statute is an improper subject of expert opinion and, therefore, it was improper for Officer Thacker to define the offenses of robbery and extortion for the jury. It was also improper, he contends, to allow the witness to testify a robbery \u201cis what happened in this particular case\u201d because this was an improper subject for opinion testimony and was the equivalent of expressing an opinion the defendant was guilty as charged. Defendant acknowledges his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>counsel did not object to this testimony but argues in failing to object and ask for a curative instruction to the jury his trial attorney deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel. Leaving aside for the moment the issue of effective assistance of counsel, we agree with defendant the foregoing testimony was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Opinion testimony is generally <em>inadmissible </em>at trial. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 800, 801.) Opinion testimony may be admitted in circumstances where it will assist the jury to understand the evidence or a concept beyond common experience. Thus, expert opinion is admissible if it is \u201c[r]elated to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience [and] would assist the trier of fact.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (a).) Expert opinion is not admissible if it consists of inferences and conclusions which can be drawn as easily and intelligently by the trier of fact as by the witness. <em>(In re Cheryl H. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1098, 1121 [200 Cal.Rptr. 789] [expert opinion about who molested child not admissible].) In an often quoted statement of the rule, Chief Justice Gibson of our Supreme Court explained: \u201c[T]he decisive consideration in determining the admissibility of expert opinion evidence is whether the subject of inquiry is one of such common knowledge that men of ordinary education could reach a conclusion as intelligently as the witness or whether, on the other hand, the matter is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 99, 103 [301 P.2d 854, 56 A.L.R.2d 1435].) As Judge Learned Hand explained, in more colorful language, expert opinion testimony must ordinarily relate to \u201ccertain propositions of general applicability, or laws of nature, which are not the heritage of the ordinary man whom the jury, like the Greek chorus, heroically shadow forth.\u201d (Hand, <em>Historical and Practical Considerations Regarding Expert Testimony </em>(1901) 15 Harv. L.Rev. 40, 55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">With these principles in mind we turn to the opinions expressed by Officer Thacker in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">A. A <em>Witness May Not Express an Opinion as to the Definition of a Crime.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Early in our state\u2019s judicial history our Supreme Court held the definition of a statutory term is a matter of law on which the court should instruct the jury; it is not a subject for opinion testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carroll </em>(1889) 80 Cal. 153, 158 [22 P. 129]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rose </em>(1890) 85 Cal. 378, 382 [24 P. 817]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gosset </em>(1892) 93 Cal. 641, 645-646 [29 P. 246].) As an appellate court has more recently noted, \u201cIt is the court and not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>witness which must declare what the law is, it not being within the province of a witness, for example, to testify as to what constitutes larceny or burglary.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clay </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 87, 98 [38 Cal.Rptr. 431, 100 A.L.R.2d 1421].)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">There are two reasons why opinion evidence on the meaning of a statute is inadmissible. First, as noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Carroll, supra, </em>80 Cal. 153, leaving the definition of statutory terms to be proved or disproved in every case \u201cwould lead to great uncertainty in the administration of justice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 158.) Second, it is the duty of the trial judge to instruct the jurors on the general principles of law pertinent to the case <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 885 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906]); therefore the jury has no need for such opinion evidence from the witness. As Wigmore explains, \u201cThe exclusion of testimonial opinion rests here on a ground slightly different from that of all the other instances. The general principle ... is exemplified, to be sure, that the tribunal does not need the witness\u2019 judgment and hence will insist on dispensing with it. But here it is not that the <em>jury </em>can of themselves determine equally well; it is that the <em>judge </em>(or the jury as instructed by the judge) can determine equally well. The principle is the same; but the peculiarity is that a different member of the tribunal is relied upon as equipped with the data. It is not the common knowledge of the jury which renders the witness\u2019 opinion unnecessary, but the special legal knowledge of the judge.\u201d (7 Wigmore on Evidence (1978) \u00a7 1952, p. 103, italics in original, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In the present case, Officer Thacker\u2019s definitions of robbery and extortion were wide of the mark. (See discussion of robbery and extortion, <em>post, </em>pp. 49-50.) However, the issue is not whether the witness\u2019s definition was substantially correct but whether it was admissible as evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carroll, supra, </em>80 Cal. at pp. 157-158.) For the reasons explained above, it is for the court to instruct the jury as to what constitutes an offense, not the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">B. A <em>Witness May Not Express an Opinion as to the Guilt or Innocence of the Defendant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">A consistent line of authority in California as well as other jurisdictions holds a witness cannot express an opinion concerning the guilt or innocence of the defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 820, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>829 [172 Cal.Rptr. 221]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clay, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.2d at pp. 98-99, citing cases.) As explained in <em>Brown </em>and <em>Clay </em>the reason for employing this rule is not because guilt is the \u201cultimate issue of fact\u201d to be decided by the jury. Opinion testimony often goes to the ultimate issue in the case. (See <em>Brown, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d at pp. 827-828, and cases cited.) Rather, opinions on guilt or innocence are inadmissible because they are of no assistance to the trier of fact. To put it another way, the trier of fact is as competent as the witness to weigh the evidence and draw a conclusion on the issue of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">C. A <em>Witness May Not Express an Opinion as to Whether a Crime Has Been Committed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Although we have found no California case directly on point, we believe the same rationale which prohibits the witness from expressing an opinion on the meaning of statutory terms or the guilt of the defendant also prohibits the witness from expressing an opinion as to whether a crime has been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">As discussed above, the rationale for admitting opinion testimony is that it will assist the jury in reaching a conclusion called for by the case. \u201cWhere the jury is just as competent as the expert to consider and weigh the evidence and draw the necessary conclusions, then the need for expert testimony evaporates.\u201d <em>(Lampkins </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C.App. 1979) 401 A.2d 966, 969 [police officer could not express opinion as to whether a robbery had occurred].)  There are some crimes a jury could not determine had occurred without the assistance of expert opinion as to an <em>element </em>of the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Robbery and extortion, however, are not among them. Neither, unfortunately, is \u201csufficiently beyond common experience\u201d that the jury needs an expert to determine whether they have been committed. The jury clearly was competent to determine from the evidence and the court\u2019s instructions whether defendant intended to rob or extort Argueta and Gonzales.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we conclude it was improper for Officer Thacker to testify as to the meaning of the terms robbery and extortion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>to express the opinion the crimes committed in this case were robberies. Furthermore, under the facts of this case, expressing the opinion the crimes were robberies was tantamount to expressing the opinion defendant was guilty of robbery and the first degree felony murder of Argueta.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">We turn now to the question whether failure to object to Thacker\u2019s testimony constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and, if so, whether it was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">II. <em>Defense Counsel Was Deficient in Allowing Officer Thacker\u2019s Opinion Testimony to Go Unchallenged But This Deficiency Did Not Affect the Outcome of the Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Both the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 15, of the California Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant a right to the assistance of counsel. This right encompasses the right to <em>effective </em>assistance of counsel, without which the right to a trial itself would be \u201cof little avail.\u201d <em>(Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1932) 287 U.S. 45, 68 [77 L.Ed. 158, 170, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 215 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839].) Effective assistance of counsel means assistance which meets \u201can objective standard of reasonableness . . . [\u00b6] . . . under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 688 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693-694, 104 S.Ct. 2052]; <em>Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Generally, the failure to make objections is a matter of trial tactics which appellate courts will not second-guess. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 814, 828 [163 Cal.Rptr. 601, 608 P.2d 689].) Occasionally, however, a case arises in which there simply could be no satisfactory explanation for counsel not objecting to the proffered evidence. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Nation </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 169, 179 [161 Cal.Rptr. 299, 604 P.2d 1051] [failure to object to impermissibly suggestive pretrial identifications]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sundlee </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d <em>477, </em>482-483 [138 Cal.Rptr. 834] [failure to object to hearsay evidence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">As we have discussed above, the opinions of Officer Thacker as to the definitions of robbery and extortion, the nature of the crime committed here, and his inferential opinion as to defendant\u2019s guilt were all improper. Trial counsel should have objected to the questions asking Thacker to define robbery and extortion for the jury. As to Thacker\u2019s volunteered opinion robbery \u201cis what happened in this particular case,\u201d counsel should have moved to strike and requested a curative instruction to the jury that they, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Officer Thacker, must determine what crimes were committed and whether defendant was guilty of those crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We perceive no tactical advantage to defendant in allowing Thacker\u2019s testimony to go unchallenged. The People suggest defense counsel may have kept silent because Thacker\u2019s testimony was partially favorable to the defense in stating extortion \u201cis happening also.\u201d Read in the context of the entire statement, however, (see p. 44, <em>ante), </em>Thacker\u2019s testimony was that the 18th Street gang engaged in both robbery and extortion but \u201c[robbery] is what happened in this particular case.\u201d Whether Argueta was killed in the course of an attempted robbery or an attempted extortion was a crucial issue in this case. A killing in the course of an attempted robbery would constitute a special circumstance and would also support a first degree felony-murder verdict, a killing in the course of an attempted extortion would not support either. Given the importance of the jury\u2019s determination on this issue, we cannot believe competent counsel would not object to Thacker\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In addition to showing counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, defendant must also show \u201c \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 217-218, quoting from <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 695 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 698].) As we explain below, the properly admitted evidence supported every element of attempted robbery. Therefore, we conclude defendant has failed to meet the burden of establishing his counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Thacker\u2019s improper opinion testimony affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Robbery is defined as \u201cthe felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211.) Extortion is defined in relevant part as \u201cthe obtaining of property from another, with his consent, . . . induced by a wrongful use of force or fear . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u201cThe crime of extortion is related to and sometimes difficult to distinguish from the crime of robbery.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hesslink </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 781, 790 [213 Cal.Rptr. 465].) Both crimes have their roots in the common law crime of larceny.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both crimes share the element of an acquisition by means of force or fear. One distinction between robbery and extortion frequently noted by courts and commentators is that in robbery property is taken from another by force or fear \u201cagainst his will\u201d while in extortion property is taken from another by force or fear \u201cwith his consent.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The two crimes, however, have other distinctions. Robbery requires a \u201cfelonious taking\u201d which means a specific intent to permanently deprive the victim of the property. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 772, 792 [36 Cal.Rptr. 620, 388 P.2d 892].) Robbery also requires the property be taken from the victim\u2019s \u201cperson or immediate presence.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7211.) Extortion does not require proof of either of these elements. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peck </em>(1919) 43 Cal.App. 638, 645 [185 P. 88] [defendant convicted of extortion even though the property was to be returned to the victim]; <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cadman </em>(1881) 57 Cal. 562, 563 [threat to expose victim to disgrace unless he dropped an appeal constituted intent to extort property]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>(1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 708, 709 [233 P.2d 948] [based on defendant\u2019s threats, victim went to bank, withdrew money, and gave it to defendant].) Extortion does, however, require the specific intent of inducing the victim to consent to part with his or her property. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hesslink, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d at p. 789.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">An attempt to commit a crime requires a specific intent to commit the crime and a direct but ineffectual act done toward its commission. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 452-453 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697] [felony murder based on attempted robbery].)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Here, the undisputed evidence showed defendant was a collector of \u201crent\u201d for the 18th Street gang and his territory included the area where Argueta and Gonzales lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In the afternoon of March 21st, defendant approached Argueta as he was getting into a car with some friends and asked him for money. Argueta responded he had no money and told defendant, \u201cYou come back later, \u2018cause I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cYou are not giving me any money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>then? Well, if you are not giving me any money you will see.\u201d Defendant did not attempt to prevent Argueta from leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Later that evening, defendant approached a group of men standing on a street comer. Defendant told the men he was collecting money for the 18th Street gang. Angry words were exchanged. Defendant forced the men up against a wall and began hitting one of the men with a gun. Defendant demanded $40 from each man then increased his demand to $200. He told the men he wanted the money that night. The men told defendant they had no money. Defendant told the men he did not believe they had no money because he knew they were selling marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">While this confrontation was taking place, Jose Gonzales walked by on the way to move his car. Defendant pointed his gun at Gonzales and ordered him up against the wall with the other men. Gonzales testified, \u201c[Defendant] asked me about money\u201d and he replied he had no money. Defendant then asked Gonzales what he was doing there to which Gonzales responded he was going to move his car. Defendant ran his hands over Gonzales\u2019s pockets but did not put them inside Gonzales\u2019s pockets. Gonzales was then told by defendant to stay there against the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">At this point, Argueta approached the street comer where defendant, Gonzales and the other men were standing. Defendant stopped Argueta and asked him, \u201cWhere is the money?\u201d Argueta denied having any money and told defendant, \u201cIt is late. Come back, [I] will give you some.\u201d Defendant, still holding a gun, began pushing Argueta. Defendant told Argueta this was \u201cnot a game\u201d and that he wanted the money \u201cnow.\u201d Defendant then grabbed Argueta by the hair and put his gun to Argueta\u2019s head. Defendant told Argueta, \u201cJust give me [the money] now or I put your brains out.\u201d Argueta replied, \u201cGo ahead if you want.\u201d Defendant then shot Argueta in the head at point-blank range and fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The evidence described above satisfies all the elements of an attempted robbery of Argueta and Gonzales.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">There can be no doubt defendant intended to permanently deprive Argueta and Gonzales of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">The intent to take property from Argueta\u2019s person is shown by the fact that, unlike their confrontation earlier in the day, this time defendant did not accept Argueta\u2019s statement he would give the defendant money later. Defendant told Argueta he was not playing games and to give him the money \u201cnow\u201d or \u201cI [blow] your brains out.\u201d To emphasize his point defendant grabbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Argueta by the hair and placed a gun to his head.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This evidence also establishes defendant\u2019s intent to take Argueta\u2019s money by force or fear against his will. At the same time, this evidence negates the specific intent to obtain Argueta\u2019s money through consent, a necessary element of extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The intent to take property from Gonzales\u2019s person is demonstrated by the fact defendant stopped Gonzales at gunpoint and indicated he wanted money from Gonzales. When Gonzales stated he had no money defendant patted Gonzales\u2019s pockets while continuing to train his gun on Gonzales, thereby demonstrating an intent to take Gonzales\u2019s money through force against his will rather than with his consent induced by fear. Defendant argues Gonzales was treated the same as the other men from whom defendant was attempting to extort money when Gonzales appeared on the scene and therefore the jury could have concluded defendant was attempting to extort money from Gonzales too. We do not necessarily agree defendant\u2019s conduct toward the other men was attempted extortion but even if it was defendant did not treat Gonzales the same as the other men. Defendant did not demand a specific amount of \u201crent\u201d money from Gonzales, as he did with the other men, and defendant patted Gonzales\u2019s pockets for money, which he did not do with the other men.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Our harmless error analysis in this case is analogous to that employed in cases challenging the failure to give a lesser-included-offense instruction. Those cases hold an instruction on a lesser included offense is only appropriate \u201cwhen the evidence raises a question as to whether all the elements of the charged offense were present... but not where there is no evidence that the offense was less than charged.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 323-324 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311], (citation omitted).) Here, the evidence supported a finding on all the elements of robbery and negated a necessary element of extortion. Therefore, we do not believe the jury could reasonably have reached any other conclusion than defendant\u2019s acts constituted attempted robbery of Argueta and Gonzales.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Lillie, P.

However, it is interesting to note the similarity between \u201ccollecting rent\u201d as practiced by the 18th Street gang and \u201cblack-mail,\u201d meaning \u201cblack rents\u201d as practiced by freebooting chiefs in the north of England and in Scotland in the 16th Century who collected tributes (rents) in the form of crops, work, goods or a metal baser than silver for protection from pillage.

L.Rev. 670, 674, fn. 24.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\">We recognize there may be limited circumstances where an expert\u2019s testimony will assist the jury, such as where the terms used in the statute are not within the common experience of the ordinary person. This case does not fall within such an exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-10\">For example, in cases charging rape of a person who, through mental disorder, is incapable of giving consent (Pen. Code \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(1)), expert testimony is admissible to establish a necessary element of the crime\u2014that the victim was incapable of giving consent due to a mental disorder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 513, 518-519 [142 Cal.Rptr. 218]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dolly </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 143, 145-146 [48 Cal.Rptr. 478].) There are also circumstances in which a police officer\u2019s expert testimony on the modus operand! involved in certain crimes may assist the jury to determine a factual issue such as the defendant\u2019s intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 322, 327-328 [76 Cal.Rptr. 557].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\">We find no prosecutor misconduct in this case. Defense counsel asked Thacker on cross-examination if he would describe \u201ccollecting rent\u201d as extortion, to which Thacker answered, \u201cNot entirely, no.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s question to Thacker asking how he would describe \u201ccollecting rent\u201d came just moments later on redirect. Clearly, the prosecutor could not have planned this line of questioning in advance. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bentley </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 687, 690 [281 P.2d 1].) Rather, he saw an unexpected opportunity and took it. We cannot fault the prosecutor for following the cross-examination with such an obvious question on redirect, especially when it came on the heels of the cross-examination without the opportunity to reflect on the legal issues lurking in the question. Furthermore, even if the question constituted misconduct, defense counsel failed to object or ask for a curative instruction. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Carrera </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 291, 321 [261 Cal.Rptr. 348, <em>777 </em>P.2d 121].)
