He challenges the conditions of his grant of probation requiring restitution. We conclude that the court could properly order a restitution fine equaling the statutory minimum despite its finding that defendant lacked the ability to pay and, in the published portion of the opinion, that the court could not order restitution to a third party insurer whose only \u201cinjury\u201d resulted from payments to the victim under a contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">On July 21, 1993, defendant pleaded guilty to charges of auto theft (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851) and failure to appear (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1320, subd. (b)). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>court admonished defendant that as a result of the plea he could \u201cbe liable for up to a $10,000 fine and restitution if it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The probation officer reported that the charges arose on April 9, 1993, when deputies saw a speeding 1987 Toyota Camry with a burned-out taillight. They stopped the vehicle. Its two occupants attempted to flee. One of them, defendant, was apprehended. He admitted stealing the car in Oregon. He failed to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 27, and a bench warrant issued. He surrendered to authorities on July 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The probation report noted the car owner\u2019s statement that \u201cthere was extensive damage done to the interior of her car, and the car has numerous scratches. Her deductible was $350.00. The remainder was paid by her insurance company.\u201d The report indicated that defendant, who was 18 years old, had an 11th grade education. Under \u201cEmployment Record,\u201d the officer wrote, \u201cThe defendant states he is a boat detailer, has worked at a tire shop, and has cleaned lots and horse stalls.\u201d His \u201ccurrent income\u201d was listed as \u201cnone.\u201d The report stated, \u201cThe defendant\u2019s parents provide him with room and board. He does own a 1974 Scout, which is non-operable.\u201d The report recommended that defendant be placed on probation on the conditions, among others, that he pay $350 restitution to the victim, based on the deductible under her insurance policy, and $200 to the victims\u2019 restitution fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">At the sentencing hearing on August 13, the court suspended imposition of sentence and granted three years\u2019 probation on substantially the terms recommended, including orders that defendant pay $200 to the victims\u2019 fund, $350 to the victim, a $225 presentence investigation fee, and a monthly $25 supervision fee. Defense counsel stated, however, that defendant \u201cdispute[d] any damage to the vehicle,\u201d and requested a \u201crestitution hearing.\u201d The court scheduled a restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">At the September 10 restitution hearing the prosecution relied upon the owner\u2019s responses to a form questionnaire prepared by the deputy probation officer. The owner stated $3,317.95 as her \u201c[d]ollar amount of loss and/or medical expenses.\u201d She indicated that she had been insured by Allstate Insurance Company, that the amount of her deductible was $350, and that she had incurred an estimated $25 in other unreimbursed expenses. Attached to the report was a handwritten tabulation of the damages suffered and the amount paid by Allstate. The largest items were $1,714.32 for \u201c[c]ost to repair damage done to car,\u201d $704.85 for \u201cReplacement cost for car content,\u201d and $393.50 for \u201c[c]ost to transport car back to West Linn &amp; buy new license plates &amp; register car.\u201d The owner noted that she had prepared her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>response while away from home and without access to all of her records. She advised the probation department that they could contact Allstate directly to obtain the insurance records of the damages paid. The only independent documentation included was an invoice from a car dealership indicating a charge of $76.70 to \u201cchk out vechicle and make estimate\u201d and \u201creplace nec fuses.\u201d <em>(Sic.) </em>The invoice reflected a \u201cpreliminary estimate\u201d of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Defendant testified that when he first got into the car, \u201c[t]he gear shift looked like it was chewed on, and in the back seat there was a blanket, and it had dog hairs all over it.\u201d When he left the car, its condition was unchanged, \u201c[j]ust with a few more miles.\u201d He also testified that he was not employed, was not receiving any government assistance, and had been living with his mother. In his last job about four months previously he cleaned horse stalls at a fair earning \u201cabout a hundred dollars\u201d in about two weeks. About a year earlier he earned \u201cabout $300\u201d by \u201ccleaning lots.\u201d Asked if he had any disabilities, he testified that he was \u201cpartly blind in one eye,\u201d and that he couldn\u2019t \u201cthink so fast\u201d because, at the age of six, he was hit by a truck \u201cand half my skull got shattered.\u201d On cross-examination he admitted that he helped switch the Oregon plates on the car for California plates, and that he smoked.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The prosecution cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 939 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 1], review denied, for the proposition that \u201cinsurance companies may be considered victims for the purpose of . . . restitution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 948-954.) Defense counsel did not contest this point, but challenged the supporting documentation as unreliable hearsay. He questioned certain specific items and added, \u201cwithout a breakdown and some kind of accurate assessment, these bills could be for existing damages. It doesn\u2019t even say that these were damages which occurred during the offense.\u201d Counsel contended that given the participation of the codefendant, defendant should be ordered to pay only half of the total sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Defense counsel further asserted that the evidence established that defendant \u201cdoes not have the ability to pay.\u201d The prosecutor replied that \u201cability to pay is separate and distinct from how much restitution,\u201d urging the court to \u201cset the amount of restitution and bring this matter back\u201d for review \u201capproximately two months after his release date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">After taking the matter under submission, the court issued a written order fixing a \u201crestitution sum\u201d of $3,317.95, payable in stated amounts to the victim and her insurance carrier, in installments to be determined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>probation officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s notice of appeal was filed December 10, 1993.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">A. <em>Ability to Pay</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">B. <em>Restitution to Insurer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Appellant contends the trial court could not properly order payment of restitution to the victim\u2019s insurer.  We first address respondent\u2019s claim that any objection of this nature was waived by appellant\u2019s failure to raise it in the trial court. In support of this contention respondent cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Zito </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 736, 742-743 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 491], review denied. The objection there, however, was that the court failed to consider the victim\u2019s possible receipt of insurance proceeds in determining restitution due <em>to the victim. </em>In contrast, an objection may be raised for the first time on appeal where it concerns an \u201cunauthorized\u201d sentence, i.e., one which \u201ccould not lawfully be imposed under any circumstance in the particular case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 354 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040] [\u201cclaims deemed waived on appeal involve sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>which, though otherwise permitted by law, were imposed in a procedurally or factually flawed manner\u201d].) Applying this principle in the context presented here, courts have concluded that a defendant may object for the first time on appeal to a restitution order in favor of an insurance carrier. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1520 [255 Cal.Rptr. 778] [order was beyond sentencing court\u2019s jurisdiction]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at p. 949 [upholding order, but rejecting waiver argument]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Franco </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 175, 183, fn. 16 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 475], review den. [factual issues subject to waiver rule but the power to order restitution is not].) We conclude that the objection was not waived by failure to assert it below. We therefore turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The cases are divided on the question whether a sentencing court can order the defendant to pay restitution to a victim\u2019s insurer. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at pp. 948-954 [upholding order]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Calhoun </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 568, 572-573 [193 Cal.Rptr. 394] [same]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 281, 292-293 [6 Cal.Rptr. 153] [same]; but see <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d 1520 [restitution order under Gov. Code, former \u00a7 13697, subd. (c) in favor of victim\u2019s insurer was in effect an unauthorized civil judgment for subrogation]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blankenship </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 992, 999 [262 Cal.Rptr. 141] [agreeing with <em>Williams; </em>\u201can insurance company is not a victim\u201d for purposes of restitution under Gov. Code, former \u00a7 13967, subd. (c)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wardlow </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 360, 368-371 [278 Cal.Rptr. 1] [following <em>Williams </em>in probation context, refusing to uphold order of restitution in favor of indirect victims]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Franco, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 175, 182-185 [workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to victim police officer not subject to restitution under former \u00a7 13967, subd. (c)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We need not take sides in this controversy because, during the pendency of this appeal, the Legislature enacted amendments to the relevant statutes which we find to be dispositive. (Stats. 1994, ch. 1106, No. 11 West\u2019s Cal. Legis. Service, pp. 5446-5455.) In particular, Penal Code section 1203.04, subdivision (j), now provides, \u201cNothing in this section shall prevent a court from ordering restitution to any . . . legal or commercial entity <em>when that entity is a direct victim of a crime.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Italics added.) We conclude the clear implication of the italicized phrase is that the statutes do <em>not </em>contemplate restitution to an \u201cindirect\u201d victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The Legislature\u2019s reference to \u201cdirect\u201d victims manifestly incorporates the well-established dichotomy existing in the law which distinguishes between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d victims for purposes of restitution. A \u201cdirect\u201d victim is the \u201cobject\u201d of the crime committed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Crow </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 952, 957-958 and fn. 4 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 864 P.2d 80].) By authorizing restitution orders limited to entities which are \u201cdirect\u201d victims, the Legislature necessarily intended to exclude entities which are \u201cindirect\u201d victims from such authorization. As the <em>Franco </em>court observed, \u201c[T]he Legislature knows how to define and include indirect victims if it chooses to do so.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Franco, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 184, fn. 17.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, an insurer who has incurred expenses solely by virtue of a contractual duty to indemnify the direct victim is not itself an \u201cobject\u201d of the crime and hence not a direct victim. It cannot, therefore, be the recipient of a section 1203.04 restitution order unless it is itself a direct victim of criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We also conclude appellant is entitled to the benefit of the legislative removal of the uncertainty as to the power of a court to order restitution paid to an insurer of a direct victim. \u201c[I]n the absence of a savings clause or some other indication of legislative intent to the contrary, when a criminal statute is amended to reduce the possible punishment for a prohibited act, the defendant in any case not yet final is entitled to the benefit of the lower punishment.\u201d <em>(Henry </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 721, 724 [214 Cal.Rptr. 726], review den., citing <em>In re Estrada </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740, 744 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948].) For purposes of this rule, a case is \u201cfinal\u201d when the judgment is immune from direct review. <em>(In re Pine </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 593, 595-596 [136 Cal.Rptr. 718].) Therefore, \u201c[a]bsent a savings clause, a criminal defendant is entitled to the benefit of a change in the law that occurs during the pendency of his or her appeal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Figueroa </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 65, 70 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 368], review den.) Thus, even if we were to conclude that the cases upholding restitution to insurers are the correct interpretation, we find appellant is entitled to the ameliorative effects of the 1994 amendments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Our conclusion that the insurer in this case cannot be the beneficiary of a restitution order does not mean that appellant gains a windfall. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>agree with the Attorney General that it makes no sense to excuse a defendant from paying restitution simply because of the fortuity that the victim has insurance coverage. A trial court, in its discretion, may still order the restitution paid to the victim and leave it to the insurer and the victim-insured to work out repayment under the terms of their insurance contract. In the event the insurer pursues its subrogation rights and obtains a judgment against appellant for the indemnified loss he would be entitled to a credit for any payments made to the insured-victim against the judgment for the \u201csame\u201d loss. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.04, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Alternatively, the trial court may conclude it is appropriate to impose a restitution fine commensurate with the amount of Allstate\u2019s payment under Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (a)(3)(A). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Blankenship, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 1000, fn. 10; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 758, 763 [265 Cal.Rptr. 77].) Unlike <em>Blankenship, </em>this is not a case where it is \u201cjudicially uneconomical\u201d to remand because of the \u201csmall financial benefit\u201d to be gained by the restitution fund. The amount at issue here is substantial ($2,942.95). Thus, we conclude remand to the trial court is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The order directing payment of restitution to Allstate Insurance Company is vacated and the cause is remanded to the sentencing court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, the order admitting appellant to probation is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Kline, P. J., and Haerle, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The owner\u2019s itemization of damages included a payment of $50 \u201cto clean [car] (to [get] rid of smoke smell.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The order states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Azq\">\u201cThe evidence presented establishes that as a result of the acts of the defendant and others the Allstate Insurance Company was damaged in the sum of $2942.95 and the owner of the vehicle . . . was damaged in the sum of $375.00.</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">\u201cThe restitution sum is fixed at $3317.95.</p>\n<p id=\"AEI\">\u201cThe defendant is presently in custody and has no immediate ability to pay restitution. The defendant, however, shall upon his release from custody make payments toward the restitution sum in installments at such times and amounts as may be set by the probation officer. If the defendant is dissatisfied with the terms of payments established by the probation officer he may return to court for a review thereof by the court. The probation officer shall file an annual report with the court so long as the defendant remains on probation setting forth the amount of restitution paid and the defendant\u2019s then present ability to pay restitution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b93-13\">Respondent suggests the notice of appeal was untimely under California Rules of Court, rule 31(a), which provides that an appeal from an order in a criminal case must be filed within 60 days after \u201cthe making of the order.\u201d The question is what was the date of \u201cmaking\u201d of the restitution order for purposes of beginning defendant\u2019s time to appeal. The order bears no filing date, but indicates that it was signed on October 9, 1993, a Saturday. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 135, Saturday is a holiday. Therefore the court could not conduct business on that day <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 133) unless the judges of the court so \u201cprescribe^]\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 134, subd. (c)). Even assuming they had done so, Saturday could not be counted \u201cfor purposes of computing the time required for the conduct of any proceeding nor for the performance of any act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).) The following Monday, October 11, was Columbus Day, also a judicial holiday. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6700, subd. (k).) Accordingly, the order must be deemed made no earlier than Tuesday, October 12. The notice of appeal was filed on December 10, the 59th day after October 12. The appeal was therefore filed within the 60-day limit of rule 31(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b93-14\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The amendments were enacted as an urgency measure and became effective when approved by the Governor on September 28, 1994.
