Amber was charged with burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459), and a referee found the allegation to be true. The referee adjudged Amber a ward of the court and placed her on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Amber correctly contends the structure at issue is not within the scope of Penal Code section 459, which applies to \u201cany house, room, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>apartment, tenement, shop, warehouse, store, mill, bam, stable, outhouse or other building\u201d and certain enumerated nonbuildings not relevant here. It has long been the rule that a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of California\u2019s burglary statute \u201cis any structure which has walls on all sides and is covered by a roof.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stickman </em>(1867) 34 Cal. 242, 245; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Gibbons </em>(1928) 206 Cal. 112, 114 [273 P. 32]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 200, 204 [183 Cal.Rptr. 773]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coffee </em>(1921) 52 Cal.App. 118, 120 [198 P. 213].) The walls can take various forms and need not reach the roof <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at pp. 203-204), but they must \u201cact as a significant barrier to entrance without cutting or breaking.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 206.) \u201cThe proper question is whether the nature of a structure\u2019s composition is such that a reasonable person would expect some protection from unauthorized intrusions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nible </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 838, 844 [246 Cal.Rptr. 119].) The open pole bam described by the owner in the present case does not meet this test, for lack of any walls whatsoever. There was no significant barrier to entrance, no protection from unauthorized intrusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The Attorney General argues Penal Code section 459 encompasses this structure because it is a \u201cbarn,\u201d which is specifically enumerated in the statute. But the list of structures in which \u201cbam\u201d appears ends with the phrase \u201cor <em>other </em>building.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459, italics added.) Thus, the statute treats a bam as a type of building, making it subject to the requirement of walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Everyday knowledge is consistent with the applicable law here. We have all heard that it is pointless to close the bam door after the horse has gotten out. But if there are no walls, there is no bam door, and the horse is free to leave anytime. This venerable aphorism is not just a metaphor, but tells us something practical about bams: they must have walls and a door to keep the horse in. If there are no walls, there is no bam.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">We conclude this structure is not within the scope of the burglary statute. Amber might have committed a theft or trespass offense, but she did not commit burglary. She was charged with the wrong offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Peterson, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
