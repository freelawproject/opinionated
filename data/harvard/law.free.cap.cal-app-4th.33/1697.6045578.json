J.</p>\n<p id=\"ACk\">Plaintiff Edward L. Taggart (Taggart), a police officer, was thrown from his motorcycle during training. Afterwards, he developed symptoms which were eventually diagnosed as epilepsy. Taggart and his wife Sarah (collectively plaintiffs) then filed this action against Super Seer Corporation (Super Seer),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the manufacturer of the helmet Taggart had been wearing when he fell from the motorcycle, alleging causes of action for products liability, negligence, and loss of consortium. The jury found for Super Seer. Plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or new trial, which was denied. Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">On appeal, plaintiffs contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-11\">1. Reports on tests conducted by Southwest Research Institute (Southwest) which showed that the helmet failed to comply with the federal motor vehicle safety standard applicable to motorcycle helmets were erroneously excluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1700\">*1700</page-number>2. The trial court erroneously ruled that Mr. Thom, plaintiffs\u2019 helmet expert, was not qualified to testify that other helmets were available which would have prevented Taggart\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-4\">3. The testimony of Dr. Newman, Super Seer\u2019s helmet expert, should have been excluded because Super Seer failed to disclose in discovery the fact that Dr. Newman had conducted tests of the helmet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-5\">4. Dr. Newman\u2019s testimony that he conducted tests of the helmet should have been excluded because it lacked a trustworthy basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-6\">5. Dr. Newman\u2019s testimony that Southwest\u2019s test results were unreliable should have been excluded because it was based on impermissible experimental scientific evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-7\">6. Evidence that plaintiffs had commenced certain other litigation should have been excluded as more prejudicial than probative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-8\">7. Letters from the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) should have been excluded as hearsay, irrelevant, and more prejudicial than probative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-9\">8. The jury should have been instructed to find that the helmet was -defective if plaintiffs proved that the helmet\u2019s design caused Taggart\u2019s injuries, and if Super Seer failed to prove that the benefits of the design outweighed the resulting risk of danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-10\">9. The jury should have been instructed on the federal motor vehicle safety standard applicable to motorcycle helmets, and on how to apply the doctrine of negligence per se if the helmet violated this standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">We find no prejudicial error, and we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-14\">In 1976 or 1977, Taggart joined the San Bernardino police force. In 1985, he transferred from patrol to the motorcycle division. On Wednesday, June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1701\">*1701</page-number>12,1985, as part of his motorcycle training, Taggart was practicing a \u201cdecel\u201d (rapid deceleration) maneuver. On one attempt, he braked too hard and was thrown, rolling or tumbling, off the motorcycle. He struck the ground with his right hip, then rolled or slid along the pavement, shredding his shirt and scraping skin from his back, shoulders, and arms. He ended up in a sitting position. Taggart did not remember hitting his head; the back of his helmet, however, was scraped.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Taggart was taken to a doctor\u2019s office, examined, and treated. He did not think he was seriously injured. He went back to work the following Monday and completed his motorcycle training. In the days and weeks following, however, he experienced headaches, confusion, forgetfulness, and irritability. Muscles in his right leg twitched.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">On July 2, 1985, Taggart consulted an orthopedist because he thought a bone in one hand might be broken. When he told the orthopedist about his other symptoms, however, the orthopedist referred him to a neurologist. The neurologist placed him on a medical leave of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">On August 30, 1985, Taggart got into an argument with two of his supervisors, Lieutenant Thomas and Sergeant Selles. Taggart tried to leave, but Thomas shoved him backward; Taggart fell into a chair and banged his head on the wall behind him. Taggart had begun feeling better, but the shoving incident made him feel like he \u201chad had the accident very recently again.\u201d His headaches became more frequent and more severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">Some months after the accident, Taggart\u2019s twitching turned into involuntary muscular contractions involving his whole body. On October 17, 1985, the neurologist told Taggart he could never resume work as a policeman. Around December 1985 or January 1986, Taggart learned from other doctors that he had brain damage. They agreed that he could not resume police work. In May 1986, he was involuntarily retired on medical grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">On June 24, 1986, Taggart was given an electroencephalogram. As a result, he was diagnosed as having epilepsy. His involuntary muscular contractions were deemed seizures. He had to take both anticonvulsive medication and pain medication. Medication, however, did not completely prevent him from having seizures. There was evidence that his epilepsy was caused by the motorcycle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">Even Super Seer\u2019s neurological expert, Dr. Peacher, concluded that Taggart had epilepsy or \u201cpost-traumatic seizure disorder\u201d as a result of the motorcycle accident, although he felt some of Taggart\u2019s symptoms were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1702\">*1702</page-number>more likely due to stress or other psychological factors. Super Seer\u2019s psychiatric expert, Dr. Naftulin, however, found no signs that Taggart had any head injury, but did find indications that he was, consciously or unconsciously, faking his symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">The motorcycle helmet Taggart was wearing when his accident occurred had been manufactured by defendant Super Seer in 1981. It consisted of a fiberglass outer shell and a polyurethane energy-absorbing liner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 218, promulgated by the DOT, prescribes performance standards for motorcycle helmets. (See generally, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.218 (1993).) Helmet manufacturers must comply with FMVSS 218. Under FMVSS 218, helmet performance is measured by, among other things, an \u201cimpact attenuation test\u201d: a helmet, mounted on a \u201cheadform\u201d containing instrumentation, is repeatedly dropped onto a hard surface under controlled conditions. A helmet fails the impact attenuation test if the instrumentation registers any of the following: (1) more than 400 g\u2019s of acceleration; (2) acceleration of more than 200 g\u2019s for more than 2 milliseconds; and (3) acceleration of more than 150 g\u2019s for more than 4 milliseconds. A helmet\u2019s performance in an impact attenuation test is related to how well it protects against head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">In 1981 and 1984, Southwest performed impact attenuation tests on Super Seer helmet model 1602. Taggart\u2019s helmet was model 1608. Model 1602 and model 1608 differed only as to harness shape and visor; they had the same outer shell and polyurethane liner. The helmet failed every time. Sixteen drops onto a flat surface were required in every test; it failed on at least three out of sixteen and as many as eight out of sixteen drops.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 helmet expert, David Thom, testified that the helmet was defective in at least four respects. First, the inner liner was made from polyurethane rather than polystyrene (i.e., styrofoam). According to Mr. Thom, polyurethane does not absorb an impact as well as polystyrene. The vast majority of helmets manufactured since the mid-1970\u2019s have used polystyrene. Second, the liner was only three-quarters of an inch thick. Helmets manufactured in 1981 typically had liners at least one inch thick. Mr. Thom testified that a helmet needed a liner at least one inch thick in order to be certain to pass an impact attenuation test. Third, the liner was too dense, which made it hard\u2014\u201clike a rock.\u201d Fourth, the outer shell was excessively thick, heavy and strong. Mr. Thom concluded that the helmet did not provide as much protection as a helmet which complied with FMVSS 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">Mr. Thom noted that Taggart\u2019s helmet had sustained merely cosmetic damage. He testified that a helmet which has received an impact in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1703\">*1703</page-number>accident should be \u201csquashed\u201d: the shell should be delaminated or even fractured, and the liner should be crushed. He also opined that \u201c[t]he typical result from an accident like this is no head injury whatsoever, and there was a head injury ... as a result of this accidental . . . [T]he obvious conclusion is that [the] helmet did not do what it was supposed to do . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Super Seer\u2019s helmet expert, Dr. James Newman, testified that the helmet was \u201ccompatible with the state of the art.\u201d It had sound basic design principles, a good, solid, strong shell, and an energy-absorbing liner. He agreed that 90 percent of helmets used a polystyrene liner, but explained \u201c[t]he main reason for that is it\u2019s cheap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">Dr. Newman had found Southwest\u2019s test data to be unreliable. Dr. Newman himself had performed impact attenuation tests on Super Seer helmets \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to Taggart\u2019s about two or three years before he testified. The helmets passed the tests; there were no failures. Dr. Newman concluded, based on his tests and based on the fact that the helmet was \u201ctypical,\u201d that it complied with FMVSS 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">Finally, Dr. Newman testified, based on summaries of Taggart\u2019s medical records, that Taggart did not have the type of injuries that would indicate a helmet failure. He concluded, \u201ceither [Taggart] didn\u2019t hit his head or the helmet worked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">Robert Smith, the president of Super Seer, testified that Taggart\u2019s helmet was consistent with the state of the art in 1981. He also testified that no other type of helmet available in 1981 provided better protection. He considered polystyrene no more energy-absorbing than polyurethane. Super Seer had continued to use polyurethane liners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">Smith also testified that in 1981, the DOT had sent Southwest\u2019s test reports to Super Seer. The DOT indicated that it was considering recalling Super Seer\u2019s helmets, and asked Super Seer to respond. Later in 1981, Super Seer sent the DOT additional information, including results of tests performed by an independent testing laboratory, Hauser Research Laboratories, which indicated that its helmets complied with FMVSS 218. In response, the DOT told Super Seer it was closing its files with respect to Super Seer helmet models 1602, 1604, and 1608.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">Admissibility of The Southwest Test Reports</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-12\">Counsel for plaintiffs stated that Southwest had refused to respond to a subpoena calling for its test reports. He had asked the DOT to produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1704\">*1704</page-number>records pertinent to the helmet; in response, the DOT had sent copies of the Southwest test reports. Once the DOT produced the copies, Southwest agreed to have its custodian of records look at the DOT\u2019S copies, confirm that they were true copies of its reports, and supply a declaration to that effect. Southwest duly returned such a declaration, together with the copies, in a sealed envelope, pursuant to sections 1560 and 1561 of the Evidence Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Super Seer then moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude any evidence that the helmet was defective due to failure to comply with FMVSS 218. It noted that plaintiffs\u2019 helmet expert had never tested the helmet himself; any opinion on his part that the helmet had failed to pass impact attenuation tests would be based entirely on the Southwest reports, which, it argued, were inadmissible hearsay. Plaintiffs filed a written opposition in which they argued that the Southwest reports were admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule (\u00a71271).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">In connection with the hearing on the motions <em>in limine, </em>the trial court opened the sealed envelope. It reviewed the Southwest reports and the custodian\u2019s declaration. Super Seer then objected that the custodian\u2019s declaration failed to demonstrate that the reports were admissible under the business records exception, because the custodian did not testify to the identity or mode of preparation of the documents. The trial court overruled this objection; it found that the \u201cdeclaration meets the requirements of Evidence Code [s]ection 1271.\u201d It therefore held that one page of each report, showing the numerical test results, was admissible under the business records exception, and that plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness could \u201cus[e] those numbers as a basis of his opinion.\u201d It held the remainder of the reports inadmissible because they contained opinions that were not admissible under the business records exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 helmet expert, Mr. Thom, then testified that he had reviewed the pages of test results. He identified them as the results of tests conducted by Southwest in 1981 and 1984 to determine whether Super Seer helmets similar to Taggart\u2019s complied with FMVSS 218. He stated that the test results showed \u201ca significant number of failures.\u201d Mr. Thom concluded that the Southwest test results supported his opinion that the helmet was \u201coutdated\u201d and would have difficulty complying with FMVSS 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">At the close of trial, Super Seer objected to admission of the numerical test results. The trial court reversed its earlier ruling that they were admissible. It explained: \u201cI have admitted reference to them in Thom\u2019s testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1705\">*1705</page-number>but in my own mind, I think it\u2019s not fair for them to have the records themselves back there. I think that gives the plaintiffs unfair advantage, that with respect to the defense experts, all they have got is oral testimony; with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, they\u2019re going to have the written testimony; and I think that makes it unfair. It should be oral on oral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the Southwest reports were admissible in their entirety under the business records exception to the hearsay rule;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> thus, the trial court erred at the beginning of trial, when it excluded all but a single page of each report, and at the end of trial, when it excluded even those pages. We disagree. The Southwest reports were inadmissible in their entirety, because they were hearsay and the custodian\u2019s declaration failed to lay a sufficient foundation for their admission under the business records exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">In section 1560 et seq., the Legislature has provided a streamlined method for the production of the records of a business in response to a subpoena duces tecum. Unless the subpoena provides otherwise (\u00a7\u00a7 1560, subds. (a), (e), 1564), the custodian or other qualified witness may send a copy of the records by mail in a sealed envelope (\u00a7 1560, subd. (b)). If the subpoena is for attendance in court, the custodian mails the sealed envelope to the court. (\u00a7 1560, subd. (c)(1).) If the subpoena is for attendance at a deposition, the custodian mails the sealed envelope to the deposition officer. (\u00a7 1560, subd. (c)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">Along with the records, the custodian must also send an affidavit which states that: (1) \u201c[t]he affiant is the duly authorized custodian of the records or otherwise qualified witness and has authority to certify the records,\u201d (2) \u201c[t]he copy is a true copy of all the records described in the subpoena . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) \u201c[t]he records were prepared by the personnel of the business in the ordinary course of business at or near the time of the act, condition, or event.\u201d (\u00a71561, subd. (a).) The affidavit is admissible as evidence of these matters. (\u00a7 1562.) Moreover, \u201c[i]f the original records would be admissible in evidence if the custodian had been present and testified to the matters stated in the affidavit, and if the requirements of Section 1271 have been met, the copy of the records is admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">Section 1271 embodies the business records exception to the hearsay rule. It provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1706\">*1706</page-number>\u201cEvidence of a writing made as a record of an act, condition, or event is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered to prove the act, condition, or event if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-4\">\u201c(a) The writing was made in the regular course of a business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-5\">\u201c(b) The writing was made at or near the time of the act, condition, or event;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-6\">\u201c(c) The custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-7\">\u201c(d) The sources of information and method and time of preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">It will readily be seen that a custodian\u2019s declaration may state all the matters it is required to state under section 1561, yet fail to provide a sufficient foundation for admission of the records under section 1271. (1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 1982) Business Records, \u00a7 4.1, pp. 212-213 [hereafter Jefferson]; 2 Wegner et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Trials and Evidence (The Rutter Group 1994) ^[ 8:1637, pp. 8D-133 to 8D-134.) Most significantly, the custodian\u2019s declaration is not required to state the \u201cidentity\u201d or \u201cmode of preparation\u201d of the records. As a result, it will usually fail to show that \u201c[t]he \u201csources of information and method and time of preparation\u201d of the records indicate their trustworthiness. \u201cTherefore, in the face of a hearsay objection, the affidavit of the custodian, made pursuant to [section] 1561, does not satisfy the requirements of the business-records exception to the hearsay rule set forth in [section] 1271(c)-(d), and the copy of the business record, produced pursuant to [sections] 1560-1561, is inadmissible hearsay.\u201d (Jefferson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.1, p. 213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">Here, the custodian\u2019s declaration conformed meticulously to section 1561. However, it contained no evidence as to what the Southwest reports were, how they were prepared, or what sources of information they were based on. It offered no evidence that the Southwest reports were trustworthy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The reports therefore failed to qualify for admission as business records under section 1271. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 105, 131 [32 Cal.Rptr. 4, 383 P.2d 412] [decided under Uniform Business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1707\">*1707</page-number>Records as Evidence Act, former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1953e-1953h, predecessor to \u00a7 1271], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 866 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 631, 649 [36 Cal.Rptr. 201, 388 P.2d 33, 12 A.L.R.3d 810]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Matthews </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 930, 939-940 [280 Cal.Rptr. 134].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">Plaintiffs cite <em>In re Troy D. </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 889 [263 Cal.Rptr. 869], which held that a custodian\u2019s declaration in compliance with section 1561 provided sufficient foundation for admission of the underlying records. (215 Cal.App.3d at p. 903 &amp; fn. 16.) <em>Troy D. </em>specifically rejected the view Justice Jefferson takes in his benchbook, upon which we rely. At the time, however, section 1562 stated merely that \u201c[t]he copy of the records is admissible in evidence to the same extent as though the original thereof were offered and the custodian had been present and testified to the matters stated in the affidavit.\u201d (Former \u00a7 1562, Stats. 1965, ch. 299, \u00a7 1562, p. 1354; <em>In re Troy D., supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at p. 903.) The <em>Troy D. </em>court appears to have construed this as a hearsay exception separate and distinct from section 1271. Thus, it stated, \u201cWe decline to hold that Evidence Code section 1561 does not satisfy the business records exception. <em>The Legislature has the prerogative of fashioning exceptions to the hearsay rule. The exception it has provided here </em>does not appear to us to conflict with the requirements of the business records exception.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (215 Cal.App.3d at p. 903, fn. 16, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">In 1989, however, even as <em>Troy D. </em>was being written, the Legislature amended section 1562, effective January 1, 1990. The amendment added a provision that the copy of the records is admissible based on the custodian\u2019s declaration only \u201cif the requirements of Section 1271 have been met.\u201d (\u00a7 1562, Stats. 1989, ch. 1416, \u00a7 31.) This new language makes it clear that section 1562 is not a hearsay exception. The fact that section 1562 provides no assurances of competency, reliability, or trustworthiness further militates against regarding it as a hearsay exception. <em>(Daniels </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 532, 538-539 [189 Cal.Rptr. 512, 658 P.2d 1313] [Veh. Code, \u00a7 14108 is not a hearsay exception].) Thus, a declaration in compliance with sections 1560 and 1561 is insufficient to guarantee that the records produced will be admissible. The proponent also must comply with the additional requirements of section 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1708\">*1708</page-number>We are aware that this construction of section 1560 et seq. lessens their usefulness as a low-cost way to obtain documentary evidence for use at trial. Nevertheless, our construction is compelled by the fact that the Legislature has expressly made admissibility under section 1562 conditional on satisfying the business records exception of section 1271. We conclude that the Legislature did so intentionally, to prevent the wholesale admission of hearsay lacking any guarantees of reliability or trustworthiness. A contrary construction would create a hole in the business records exception big enough to drive a truckload of hearsay through; the proponent of a business record who could not show how it was prepared, or who knew that the way it was prepared would indicate that it was untrustworthy, could nevertheless introduce the record into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">The Legislature\u2019s wisdom is demonstrated by what occurred in this case: not only did plaintiffs fail to show that the records were trustworthy, but Super Seer had no opportunity to show that the records were \u00ab\u00abtrustworthy, or \u00ab\u00abreliable. Normally, where the proponent of evidence invokes the business records exception, the opponent can test the applicability of the exception by cross-examining the custodian of the records. Here, however, Super Seer had no opportunity to depose and cross-examine either the custodian or the Southwest employees who actually prepared the reports.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> More importantly, as Southwest was not within the jurisdictional range of the subpoena power (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1989), Super Seer had no opportunity to subpoena the custodian for trial. The custodian\u2019s declaration enjoyed an irrebuttable and conclusive effect on the admissibility of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">The trial court was on the right track when it recognized that, despite the custodian\u2019s declaration, the Southwest reports had to satisfy the requirements of the business records exception. Thus, it refused to admit those portions of the Southwest reports which it found constituted opinion rather than \u201ca record of an act, condition, or event.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Reyes </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 486, 503 [116 Cal.Rptr. 217,526 P.2d 225].) It erred, however, when, over Super Seer\u2019s objection, it held that the custodian\u2019s declaration satisfied all the other prerequisites of the business records exception and ruled that numerical test results in the reports would be admissible. It corrected its own error by reversing itself at the close of trial and refusing to admit the numerical test results. Even assuming that its reason for doing so was erroneous, the result was not. We review only the trial court\u2019s ruling, not its reasoning. <em>(Belair </em>v. <em>Riverside County Flood Control Dist. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 550, 568 [253 Cal.Rptr. 693, 764 P.2d 1070]; <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1709\">*1709</page-number><em>Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 19 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10]; <em>Bro </em>v. <em>Glaser </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1398, 1405 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 894].) Because plaintiffs failed to lay a foundation for the admission of the Southwest reports under the business records exception, the trial court properly excluded the reports in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">IH.-X.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">The judgment is affirmed in its entirety.

Because plaintiffs failed to raise this argument in their opening brief, however, Super Seer has been deprived of an opportunity to respond to it. We therefore need not\u2014and we do not\u2014consider it. <em>(Varjabedian </em>v. <em>City of Madera </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 285, 295, fn. 11 [142 Cal.Rptr. 429, 572 P.2d 43]; <em>Stoll </em>v. <em>Shuff (1994) </em>22 Cal.App.4th 22, 25, fn. 1 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 249]; see generally, 9 Witkin, Cal.
