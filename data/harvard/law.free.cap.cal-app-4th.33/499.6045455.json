J.</author>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Defendant, John Swain, appeals his conviction of second degree murder and raises the following issues: (1) his trial before a municipal court judge violated articles II, section 1, and VI, section 4 of the state Constitution, as well as the separation of powers doctrine; (2) the denial of his motion to represent himself violated his constitutional right to self-representation; (3) it was reversible error to fail to instruct the jury with CALJIC No. 2.83 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ed. 1988<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>); (4) it was prejudicial error to refuse to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter; and (5) it was reversible error to give CALJIC No. 2.03. Finding each of these issues without merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Karen Haywood\u2019s body was discovered in Silverwood Lake on October 4, 1991. She died as a result of 14 intentional blows to her skull with some sort of tool such as a hammer, tire iron, or other metal object having a circular edge. The investigation of Karen\u2019s death led the San Bernardino Sheriff\u2019s Department to suspect defendant was the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">A witness had seen Karen with a man, who looked like defendant, on the afternoon of September 28, 1991, driving Karen around in a pickup truck. Defendant drove an old Chevy pickup truck. On that same afternoon, defendant had told his family that he was going on a picnic with a woman named Karen. He lived with his mother and stepfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Around 3 a.m., September 29, 1991, defendant\u2019s stepfather awoke to the sound of defendant taking a shower. Later that morning, defendant had washed the clothes he had been wearing on September 28 and left his sneakers in the planter. Defendant further washed the pickup truck, hosing down the interior floor. On the next day, defendant left a note for his parents that informed them that things just did not work out and thus he had to leave. He did not return until the end of the week.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">When defendant learned that he was a suspect in Karen\u2019s death, he told his mother that he was being framed and that he had to leave town. His mother gave him some money and took him to the bus station. Finding the bus station closed, defendant returned home. There, he commented, \u201cWhat if I hit her and I hit her and after the second hit I could tell she was dead? . . . What if I got so mad I beat her to death. ... I had four years of anger built up inside me that I beat her to death. You see, no one saw me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\"><em>Were Defendant\u2019s Constitutional Rights Violated by Having His Felony Charges Tried Before a Municipal Court Judge Sitting as Judge of the Superior </em>Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">On December 29, 1992, the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court issued a blanket assignment appointing Judge Roberta McPeters, along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>23 other municipal court judges, to sit as superior court judges of San Bernardino County from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993, and until completion and disposition of all causes and matters heard pursuant to the assignment. Accordingly, trial of defendant\u2019s case was assigned to Judge McPeters and defendant moved to have his case transferred to the superior court. Judge McPeters denied defendant\u2019s request explaining, \u201cThe Supreme Court [Cjhief [Jjustice of this state has the authority and has exercised that authority for quite some[]time to appoint judges to sit in Superior Court and act accordingly . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Defendant appeals from the denial of his motion to transfer claiming that (1) the blanket assignment by the Chief Justice violated our state Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine, and (2) any assignment of Judge McPeters pursuant to the trial court coordination plan (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 68112 and 69753) was invalid because it was without defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Trial commenced on January 5, 1993. The Attorney General contends, and we agree, that Judge McPeters was acting pursuant to the blanket assignment of December 29, 1992, and not any trial court coordination plan.  Thus, the only issue to be decided in this appeal is whether the blanket assignment violates our state Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we find that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Defendant argues that the blanket assignment violates article II, section l<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and article VI, section 4<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of our state Constitution. In addition to these sections, he points to article VI, section 5 which authorizes only the Legislature to \u201cprescribe\u201d the jurisdiction of the municipal and justice courts, article VI, section 10 which vests in the superior courts original jurisdiction in all causes except those given by statute to other trial courts, and Penal Code section 1462 which grants municipal and justice courts jurisdiction over misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>While acknowledging that article VI, section 15 empowers the Chief Justice to provide for the assignment of any judge to another court, he argues that the language of that section is not susceptible to an interpretation that the Chief Justice is empowered to authorize all the judges of the municipal court to sit as superior court judges \u201cuntil completion of all causes and matters.\u201d Instead, defendant suggests that this provision is limited to the assignment of \u201cany\u201d particular \u201cjudge\u201d to hear a particular case. Any other interpretation \u201ccircumvents the need for the Legislature to \u2018prescribe\u2019 the number of judges, as well as the power of the people to elect superior court judges based upon the appropriate qualifications and experience.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">This same issue was addressed by our colleagues in the Second District in <em>People </em>v. <em>Najera </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 930 [152 Cal.Rptr. 124]. In <em>Najera, </em>the defendant challenged the Chief Justice\u2019s authority to make a \u201cblanket\u201d assignment of all the judges of the municipal court, asserting that such authority was limited to individual judges by name. The appellate court rejected defendant\u2019s challenge citing to article VI, sections 6 and 15 of the California Constitution. Section 6 provides that \u201c[t]he Chief Justice shall seek to expedite judicial business and to equalize the work of judges. The Chief Justice may provide for the assignment of any judge to another court but only with the judge\u2019s consent if the court is of lower jurisdiction.\u201d Section 15 states that \u201c[a] judge eligible for municipal court service may be assigned by the Chief Justice to serve on any court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We agree with the Second District\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]he forerunner of article VI, section 6, was flexibly construed to effectuate its purposes to expedite judicial business and equalize the work of judges. [Citations.] [f] . . . Flexibility in administration on a day-to-day basis is needed and permitted by the constitutional provision. [Citations.] The express language of the provision is not limited as urged by [defendant] but rather is broad: the Chief Justice <em>\u2018may provide </em>for\u2019 the assignment of any judge to another court.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Najera, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.3d 930, 933-934; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th 1248, 1256 and <em>Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 474, 481-482 [159 Cal.Rptr. 494, 601 P.2d 1030].)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">In this case, the language in the blanket assignment exemplifies the flexibility found in California Constitution, article VI, section 6. In addition to identifying each of the municipal court judges to be assigned to sit in the superior court, the assignment limits the period of time in which it will be effective. Although defendant has attempted to characterize the blanket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>assignment as an indefinite blanket assignment, we find such characterization to be incorrect. The assignment states that it is effective for the calendar year of 1993 \u201cand until completion and disposition of all causes and matters heard pursuant to this assignment.\u201d Such language takes into account the fact that some causes may continue past December 31, 1993. Thus, for those causes in progress, the municipal court judge may continue to hear the matter until its completion. Contrary to defendant\u2019s interpretation of this language, we find that the blanket assignment was for a limited duration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">We also find that the blanket assignment accomplishes the purpose of expediting judicial business and equalizing the work of judges. The court, counsel, litigants, and the public (who pay for the justice system) have an interest in cost effective and expeditious process of court matters. Today\u2019s superior courts are faced with heavy case loads and the judges are chronically overburdened. Thus, litigants, defendants, and the public are prejudiced by delays in bringing criminal cases to trial. For example, delays causing a defendant to remain in custody affect his liberty interests, while the public unnecessarily may have to pay the added cost of incarceration. As time goes by, memories of witnesses fade. Therefore, Penal Code section 1050, subdivision (a) provides that \u201ccriminal cases shall be given precedence over, and set for trial and heard without regard to the pendency of, any civil matters or proceedings.\u201d This leads to a frustration of the expeditious handling of civil cases. Accordingly, there is great need for flexibility in administration of the court system on a day-to-day basis. In our view, the blanket assignment is one tool which has and can be used to keep the system \u201crunning on time\u201d by making additional judicial resources available to an overtaxed system.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, it facilitates a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">For the above reasons, we find that the use of the blanket assignment by the Chief Justice does not violate our state Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">IV-VII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Anh\">McKinster, J., and Richli, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 15, 1995.

Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, we do not find that these statutes or the rules of court contemplate the need for a defendant\u2019s consent to validate the judicial assignment, except for a change in location under rule 245.5(b). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1248 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 3].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\">This section provides that \u201cAll political power is inherent in the people.
