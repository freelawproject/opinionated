On one side of the scale is a plaintiff\u2019s right to pursue a sexual harassment lawsuit uninhibited by concerns that her former employer will retaliate against other employees who are willing to help prove her case. On the other side is the employer\u2019s right to discover the identity of a presently unnamed person who stole evidence related to the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit from the employer\u2019s files and gave it to the plaintiff. We hold that the plaintiff, to tip the scales in her favor, must present some evidence (not mere speculation) that her fear of retaliation is justified. In this case, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to present any proof at all compels a decision in favor of the employer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Kimberly Gonzalez worked for the City of San Fernando Police Department as a radio dispatcher. After she left, she sued the City, its chief of police and others employed by its police department, alleging sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">According to the complaint, the \u201charassment arose out of the display . . . in the men\u2019s locker room of the police station of photographs of a semi-nude woman. . . .\u201d The woman in the photographs bore a \u201cstriking resemblance to\u201d Gonzalez and an officer asked Gonzalez why photographs of her were hanging in the men\u2019s locker room. Several days later, other officers commented to Gonzalez about the pictures and about the woman\u2019s resemblance to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Gonzalez asked the officers to get the pictures for her. They declined but a few days later she was told the photographs had been removed. \u201cSome time after the photographs were taken down, [Gonzalez] received an envelope containing the two pictures.\u201d Gonzalez then filed a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing and notified her employer. No response was forthcoming, she alleges\u2014no investigation was conducted and no one was disciplined. Instead, she was questioned about the identity of the person who had given her the photographs and complaints were lodged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>about her refusal to provide the requested information. Ultimately, she was given \u201can incomplete and adverse performance evaluation\u201d because she refused to identify the person who gave her the photographs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Gonzalez challenged the evaluation, she was again questioned about the identity of her assistant and, again, threatened with disciplinary action if she did not reveal his identity. \u201cUltimately, she was compelled to leave her job on a stress disability when the department began to construct an effort to terminate and/or discipline her for failure to do her job properly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">Based on these allegations, Gonzalez sought general, special and punitive damages for sexual harassment in violation of various constitutional and statutory provisions and for the intentional infliction of emotional distress. Defendants answered the complaint and thereafter served Gonzalez with interrogatories which asked, among other things, for the identity of the assistant who handed her \u201c \u2018an envelope containing the two photographs\u2019 as alleged\u201d in her complaint. Gonzalez objected and refused to answer this interrogatory on the grounds that it sought \u201cinformation which is privileged under the California Constitution, Article I, sec[tion] 1 (privacy), that the disclosure of such information would be contrary to the public policy of this state in that it would lead to retaliation for the disclosure of unlawful discrimination and that the information is not likely to lead to the discovery [of] relevant evidence, is cumulative and not necessary to the resolution of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Defendants moved to compel an answer, explaining that the interrogatory properly sought the identity of a person who had knowledge of the facts giving rise to Gonzalez\u2019s claims and that Gonzalez\u2019s apparent concern that the other person might \u201cbe retaliated against\u201d was pure speculation. Gonzalez opposed the motion and asked the trial court to protect the identity of her assistant for the same reasons stated in her objection to the interrogatory. In support of her opposition, Gonzalez submitted a memorandum (which she had obtained through her own discovery efforts) from the patrol commander to the chief of police (the contents of which are undisputed). As pertinent, the memo states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>\u201cOn Monday, January 18, 1993, Desk Officer Kimberly Gonzalez was given a direct order by myself to answer a question relevant to an investigation concerning a theft that had occurred from a file cabinet assigned to Sergeant David Harvey . . . . At the time Gonzalez did not want to answer the question and asked for time to seek legal assistance before answering the question. I gave Gonzalez until . . . today [January 22] to respond to the question or be subject to disciplinary action for failing to obey an order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-4\">\u201c[Today,] Gonzalez came into my office and [said] she wanted to tape record the conversation. While she was getting a tape recorder, I also got a tape recorder and recorded the conversation. [^Q . . .1 summarized what had led to this point, and again told her that I was giving her an order to answer the question, \u2018Who took the photographs from Sergeant Dave Harvey\u2019s file cabinet and gave these photographs to you?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\">\u201cGonzalez replied, \u2018The answer\u2019s the same. I\u2019m not going to tell you who gave them to me.\u2019 . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-6\">\u201cI asked her if she understood that she was refusing to obey an order, and she said, T understand perfectly.\u2019 . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-7\">\u201cConclusion</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-8\">\u201cIn the course of [a] conversation with . . . Gonzalez ... I became aware that she had photographs that had been taken from the file cabinet assigned to Sergeant David Harvey in the Watch Commander\u2019s office; further, that Gonzalez knew who had taken the photographs from the file cabinet and who gave the photographs to her. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-9\">\u201cThe sergeants assigned to the Patrol Division share a common office, the Watch Commander\u2019s Office, with each sergeant having a file cabinet assigned for the purpose of maintaining their correspondence necessary to perform their job. In this instance, a supervisor had gone into the file cabinet of another supervisor and, in effect, stole evidence.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] Not only did a theft occur, but the sergeant violated a basic trust that must exist among the sergeants that share the office. This is intolerable behavior. Gonzalez has direct knowledge of this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-10\">\u201cSan Fernando Police Department Manual of Policies and Procedures Section 10020.35, Compliance with Lawful Orders, states, [*]0 The Department has [a] clearly defined hierarchy of authority. An officer must not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>question a superior\u2019s command. Such obedience is necessary for the safe and expeditious performance of law enforcement operations. The most desirable methods of obtaining compliance are recognition, reward, and positive encouragement; however, discipline may be imposed where orders, commands or directives are disregarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-4\">\u201cBecause she failed to obey an order, she is in violation of San Fernando Manual of Policies and Procedures Section 2-430.25, Legitimate Reasons for Disciplinary Action, subsection b) Failure to obey any order or directive, and Section 2-430.25, subsection gg) Failure to comply with all rules and regulations, general and specific orders, policies and procedures of the Department, written or verbal orders of a superior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-5\">\u201cRecommendation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-6\">\u201cThat Desk Officer Kimberly Gonzalez be disciplined for violation of section 2-430.25, subsections b) and gg).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Gonzalez\u2019s opposition papers were not, however, supported by a declaration from her or from her assistant or anyone else (other than her attorney, whose declaration did no more than authenticate the memorandum quoted above) and there is no explanation for the basis of her concern about retaliation against her assistant if his identity is disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion and ordered Gonzalez to answer the interrogatory. These writ proceedings followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Gonzalez claims she should not be required to disclose the identity of her assistant because his privacy as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d must be protected and because California\u2019s public policy against sexual harassment in the workplace overrides defendants\u2019 right to discover the informant\u2019s identity. For several reasons, we disagree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">\u201cUnless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with [the discovery statutes], any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action ... if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Discovery may relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action. Discovery may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2017, subd. (a); see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 6, 11-12 [11 Cal.Rptr. 165, 88 A.L.R.2d 650].)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">We begin, therefore, with relevancy.  For discovery purposes, information is relevant if it \u201cmight reasonably assist a party in <em>evaluating </em>the case, <em>preparing </em>for trial, or <em>facilitating </em>settlement . . . .\u201d (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 1994) Discovery, \u00b6 8:66.1, p. 8C-1.) Admissibility is <em>not </em>the test and information, unless privileged, is discoverable if it might reasonably <em>lead </em>to admissible evidence. <em>(Davies </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 291, 301 [204 Cal.Rptr. 154, 682 P.2d 349].) These rules are applied liberally in favor of discovery <em>(Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 785, 790 [183 Cal.Rptr. 810, 647 P.2d 86]), and (contrary to popular belief), fishing expeditions <em>are </em>permissible in some cases. <em>(Greyhound Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 385 [15 Cal.Rptr. 90, 364 P.2d 266] [although fishing may be improper or abused in some cases, that \u201cis not of itself an indictment of the fishing expedition <em>per s\u00e9\"}.) </em>More specifically, the identity of witnesses must be disclosed if the witness has \u201cknowledge of any discoverable matter,\u201d including fact, opinion and any information regarding the credibility of a witness (including bias and other grounds for impeachment). (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2017, subd. (a); Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8:82-8:83, pp. 8C to 4-5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">On the record before us, the relevancy of the assistant\u2019s identity is clear. First, the \u201cassistant\u201d may not exist at all\u2014Gonzalez may have invented him so she would not have to admit that <em>she </em>took the photographs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number>from Sergeant Harvey\u2019s file. Second, although defendants are assuming the assistant is not only an employee but, more specifically, a supervisor, we have no evidence one way or the other. If Gonzalez arranged for an outsider to have access to defendants\u2019 files, defendants are entitled to know who it was. Third, the assistant is the only person (other than Gonzalez) who can say whether it was his idea to take the photographs from Detective Harvey\u2019s file or whether Gonzalez put him up to it. At a minimum, this information is relevant to Gonzalez\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">Moreover, if she establishes sexual harassment, evidence of Gonzalez\u2019s misconduct (by her own theft or by encouraging her assistant\u2019s theft) would be admissible to limit the kind and quantity of damages recoverable in this action. <em>(McKennon </em>v. <em>Nashville Banner Pub. Co. </em>(1995) 513 U.S._[130 L.Ed.2d 852, 115 S.Ct. 879] [although an employee\u2019s wrongdoing will not bar her action when her suit \u201cserves important public purposes,\u201d her wrongdoing does bear on the specific remedy to be ordered and the amount of damages she may recover]; on damages in sexual harassment actions generally, see <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, 215, 221 [185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912]; <em>Kelly-Zurian </em>v. <em>Wahl Shoe Co. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 397, 409-410 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 457]; <em>Bihun </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Information Systems, Inc. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 995-997 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 787], disapproved on another point in <em>Lakin </em>v. <em>Watkins Associated Industries </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 863 P.2d 179].)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">No recognized privilege applies to this case.  As used in Code of Civil Procedure section 2017, subdivision (a), \u201cprivileged\u201d means the constitutional and statutory privileges (self-incrimination [Evid. Code, \u00a7 940], attorney-client <em>[id., </em>\u00a7 950 et seq.], spousal communication <em>[id., </em>\u00a7 980], doctor-patient <em>[id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 990 et seq., 1010 et seq.], clergyman-penitent <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1030 et seq.), sexual assault victim-counselor <em>[id., </em>\u00a7 1035 et seq.], and official information <em>[id., </em>\u00a7 1040]) and the \u201cqualified privileges\u201d for such things as trade secrets <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1060 et seq.), police personnel files <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1043) and tax returns <em>(Webb </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 509 [319 P.2d 621]), none of which apply in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">The result is the same if we treat Gonzalez\u2019s assistant as a \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d\u2014because there is no such thing as a \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s privilege.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>When confidentiality is provided to a whistleblower, it is not on the basis of a privacy privilege but rather as a matter of public policy, usually according to standards best described as an undefined conditional privilege. (See e.g., <em>John Z. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 789 [relying on Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2025, subd. (i), which authorizes a protective order to prevent unwarranted embarrassment or oppression of a deponent]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Garde </em>(D.D.C. 1987) 673 F.Supp. 604, 606 [relying on the First Amendment\u2019s protection of associational rights to protect the identity of whistleblowers]; see also <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. </em>v. <em>U.S. E.P.A. </em>(1988) 856 F.2d 309, 311-313 [272 App.D.C. 355] [applying a similar analysis to documents used in an investigation].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In our case, the assistant\u2019s identity is protected, if at all, as a matter of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Where there is a prima facie showing of relevance, the party opposing disclosure on the basis of a conditional privilege has the burden to establish the preliminary facts essential to the claim of privilege. (Cf. <em>Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1391 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 709] [a party relying on the qualified privilege afforded to trade secrets who refuses to respond to a discovery request must establish the existence of a trade secret and his ownership thereof, at which point the burden shifts to the party seeking disclosure to show why the information is necessary to a fair resolution of the lawsuit].)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Gonzalez\u2019s reliance on <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at page 859, is misplaced. In <em>Britt, </em>where the defendant\u2019s right to discovery of the plaintiffs\u2019 political affiliations turned on an implied waiver of the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cconstitutional right of associational privacy,\u201d the court imposed upon the defendant the burden to show the information sought was \u201cdirectly relevant\u201d to the case. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In our case, we are not dealing with a constitutional right to privacy. And, of course, in <em>Britt </em>the question itself demonstrated the existence of the right to privacy. Stated differently, to ask for a party\u2019s political affiliation is, necessarily, to implicate that party\u2019s First Amendment associational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">But where, as here, the question calls for information which may or may not be privileged, the party asserting the privilege must establish its application <em>before </em>the interrogator is required to show more than basic discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>relevance. (See <em>Alpha Beta Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 818, 824-825 [203 Cal.Rptr. 752] [party claiming the attorney-client privilege must prove the attorney-client relationship existed at the time the requested information was communicated and, only after that showing is made, does the burden shift to the other party to show waiver or some other exception]; see also <em>Brotsky </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 287, 302-303 [19 Cal.Rptr. 153, 368 P.2d 697, 94 A.L.R.2d 1310] [when discovery is sought of confidential files, \u201ca declaration that public interest would suffer by disclosure is of no avail when [the] prerequisite [that the particular communication was made in confidence] does not exist[, and s]ince the claim of privilege is an affirmative objection to a request for material otherwise discoverable, the burden of proving the same is on the party making that claim\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Gonzalez, of course, offered no evidence at all to support her claim of privilege. Instead, she simply argues that, because Defendants took disciplinary action against her, we must assume they will retaliate against her assistant because he helped her by giving her the photographs. She conveniently ignores the fact that she has presented no evidence at all to establish her assistant\u2019s status (as noted, we do not know if he is a coworker), nor does she ever say what sort of retaliation she fears. There is not even any evidence that the photographs were given to her in confidence, with the expectation that the assistant\u2019s identity would not be disclosed. (Cf. Evid. Code, \u00a7 1041, subds. (b), (c).) The most that can be said based upon evidence (rather than mere speculation) is that, at about the same time Gonzalez began making complaints about sexual harassment but before she filed suit, defendants asked her for information about a theft from a police department file. She refused to answer, discipline was recommended and she was \u201ccompelled\u201d to quit because of stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">It does not help Gonzalez if we assume her assistant is a former coworker still employed by defendants, because her arguments fail to distinguish between (a) defendants\u2019 recognized legitimate interests in protecting themselves from a dishonest employee and (b) the possibility of their improper retaliatory discipline or discharge of the same employee. We are not the first ones to note this distinction. As the United States Supreme Court recently explained in <em>McKennon </em>v. <em>Nashville Banner Pub. Co., supra, </em>513 U.S._ [130 L.Ed.2d 852, 862, 115 S.Ct. 879, 886], \u201c. . . we must recognize the duality between the legitimate interests of the employer and the important claims of the employee\u201d and \u201ctake due account of the lawful prerogatives of the employer in the usual course of its business and the corresponding equities that it has arising from the employee\u2019s wrongdoing. [*][]... Once an employer learns about employee wrongdoing that would lead to a legitimate discharge, we cannot require the employer to ignore the information</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>Indeed, even where a statute protects a whistleblower from retaliation (e.g., title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq.), the employee\u2019s action in opposition to discrimination \u201cmust be lawful and reasonable. For example, employers may discipline or discharge an employee who copies the employer\u2019s confidential documents even though the copies are to be used in opposing the employer\u2019s discriminatory practices. Employees\u2019 statutory rights to oppose discrimination are not to be construed as a general license to be insubordinate.\u201d (Malin, <em>Protecting the Whistleblower From Retaliatory Discharge </em>(1982) 16 U. Mich. J. L. Ref. 277, 292-295, citing <em>Silver </em>v. <em>KCA, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1978) 586 F.2d 138 [employer may fire an employee who forced a coworker to apologize to another employee for a racial slur]; <em>Jefferies </em>v. <em>Harris Cty.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Gonzalez\u2019s generalities are beyond dispute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n                   It is true, as she points out, that California has a strong public policy against sexual harassment. <em>(Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 90 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 12920 et seq.) In some situations, it is also true, as Gonzalez claims, that it is against public policy for an employer to retaliate against an employee for lending assistance to a coworker\u2019s efforts to stop sexual harassment. <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1096 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680] [it is against public policy for an employer to constructively discharge an employee in retaliation for his refusal to testify untruthfully in favor of the employer in proceedings involving a coworker\u2019s sexual harassment claim because this is, in effect, a discharge based upon the employee\u2019s refusal to commit a criminal act to further the employer\u2019s interests]; <em>Flait </em>v. <em>North American Watch Corp. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 467, 477 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 522] [an employer may not fire an employee because he opposed discrimination against a fellow employee, even if he was mistaken and there was no discrimination].)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>These cases do not support Gonzalez\u2019s claim. Assuming the existence of sexual harassment, no case has ever held that a plaintiff who sues her former employer to vindicate public policy has a right to keep confidential the identity of a coworker (or anyone else) who, by theft from the employer, provides information to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Gantt, </em>the employer constructively discharged the plaintiff after he refused the employer\u2019s request to change his testimony at a hearing involving a coworker\u2019s claim of sexual harassment. <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1088.) In <em>Flait, </em>the employer discharged the plaintiff after he attempted to stop one subordinate from sexually harassing another subordinate. <em>(Flait </em>v. <em>North American Watch Corp., supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at p. 472.) These cases do not involve illegal conduct or the violation of rules and regulations by the employees who came to the aid of their colleagues. And, of course, there is no issue in either case about the identity of the coworker.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Gonzalez\u2019s reliance on <em>John Z. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 789, is misplaced. In <em>John Z., </em>an informant told Pacific Gas and Electric Company that some of its contractors were receiving payment for services not actually performed. The informant had no direct proof of his allegations but PG&amp;E conducted an investigation, confirmed the tip and then sued the contractors for fraud. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 791.) During discovery, the contractors learned about the informant and asked for his identity. PG&amp;E refused to answer. On the motion of one of the contractors, the trial court ordered disclosure. The Court of Appeal disagreed and, on the facts of that case, protected the informant\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Without reference to any privilege or public policy, Division Three of the First District relied on the general authority of the trial court \u201cto protect [a witness] from \u2018unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression.\u2019\u201d <em>(John Z. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at p. 791.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After noting that <em>the informant had filed a sealed declaration </em>describing the <em>threat to his life, </em>the court went on: \u201cThis authority necessarily includes the authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>protect the identity of an <em>informant whose safety would be jeopardized </em>by disclosure. But the informant\u2019s interests must be balanced against the litigant\u2019s need for the information. Thus, the question before us is whether the court abused its discretion when it impliedly found that [the contractor\u2019s] showing of [his] need to know [the] informant\u2019s identity outweighed [the] informant\u2019s showing of danger from disclosure. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">\u201cIn a sealed . . . brief, [the contractor] presents his reasons for disclosure of [the] informant\u2019s identity. Briefly, [the contractor] suggests that [the] informant may know something negative about PG&amp;E, such as that it failed to fully mitigate damage or that it expressed a desire to put one or more of the contractors out of business. . . . [The informant might have evidence to support the libel allegations in [the contractor\u2019s] cross-complaint, or [the contractor\u2019s] action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. [50 We . . . find [the contractor\u2019s reasons] far from compelling. . . . <em>[The </em>contractor] <em>merely seeks a short cut through normal discovery procedures. Had PG&amp;E investigated without a tip or had [the] informant presented his/her tip anonymously, [the contractor] would be no worse off than he is now. </em>He has no compelling need to learn who blew the whistle.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\"><em>\u201c[The informant presented a four-page declaration reciting the threat he/she received from one of the contractors and his/her reason for treating the threat as serious. </em>The court\u2019s memorandum of decision gave reasons for finding that the declaration did not make the prerequisite showing of good cause for a protective order [but t]he court did not find that the threat was not made or was inherently unbelievable. Rather, the court merely discounted the seriousness of the danger. [50 The factors mentioned by the court, which do undercut somewhat the danger, might have tipped the balance for disclosure had [the contractor] presented a compelling reason for disclosure. But with [the contractor\u2019s] meager showing, the court abused its discretion in failing to protect [the] informant from the danger inherent in disclosing his/her identity. The danger, though somewhat speculative, was based on a communicated threat which was taken seriously by its recipient. The court was in no position to totally discount it. . . .\u201d <em>(John Z. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at pp. 791-792, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">There are three significant differences between <em>John Z. </em>and our case. <em>First, </em>the informant in <em>John Z. </em>was a traditional whistleblower\u2014he notified PG&amp;E that some of its contractors were being paid for work they had not performed. As we have explained, Gonzalez\u2019s assistant was not a whistle-blower. <em>Second, </em>there is not a hint that the informant in <em>John Z. </em>was guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1553\">*1553</page-number>any wrongdoing of any kind. In our case, it is undisputed that Gonzalez\u2019s assistant stole the photographs from Sergeant Harvey\u2019s file and there are, therefore, \u201ccompelling reasons for disclosure.\u201d <em>Third, </em>the informant in <em>John Z. </em>filed a lengthy declaration detailing the threats to his life. In our case, Gonzalez did not file a declaration from her assistant or even her own declaration. Instead, she simply speculates that her assistant, if identified, will be disciplined. For these reasons, <em>John Z. </em>lends no support to Gonzalez\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Gonzalez did not satisfy her burden of proof. We reject her claimed concern about what will happen to her assistant if his identity is disclosed, on the ground that mere speculation is insufficient to invoke a conditional privilege where, as here, the person whose identity is sought (1) may or may not be a former coworker still employed by defendants but, even assuming he is, (2) he is not someone who has spoken out about improper practices, either to an employer or to a regulatory agency but (3) is, instead, someone who has wrongfully appropriated evidence from his employer\u2019s files and turned it over to a coworker and (4) is not, therefore, a true whistleblower.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">Ortega, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b957-9\">SPENCER, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWUG\">I reluctantly concur in the result. I agree generally with the substance of the lead opinion, which is that the identity of petitioner\u2019s \u201cassistant\u201d is discoverable and petitioner has failed to provide sufficient information to permit this court to ascertain that there is a real threat of improper retaliation to her source. While the identity of petitioner\u2019s \u201cassistant\u201d is not itself relevant to her charges, an opportunity to depose that individual could lead to evidence relevant to petitioner\u2019s credibility. That is enough\u2014barely\u2014to make it discoverable. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2017, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">I do feel, however, that the lead opinion makes some unwarranted conclusions, i.e., that department property was stolen from Sergeant Harvey\u2019s file and petitioner\u2019s \u201cassistant\u201d therefore \u201cwrongfully appropriated evidence from his employer\u2019s files and turned it over to a coworker.\u201d (Maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>at p. 1553.) It is equally possible that the photographs are not evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>anything but petitioner\u2019s sexual harassment, do not belong to the department or Sergeant Harvey and were being hidden in the files to protect someone else until Sergeant Harvey or this other person had a chance to destroy them. If the \u201cassistant\u201d rescued these photographs from certain or likely destruction and the photographs belonged neither to the department nor to Sergeant Harvey, then their removal was not necessarily wrongful. (See maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>at p. 1550.)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">I stress that petitioner has not presented any evidence which would establish the foregoing scenario. My concern is that the lead opinion uses terms such as \u201ctheft of the employer\u2019s property\u201d and \u201cwrongfully appropriated evidence\u201d without couching them in the language of possibilities rather than absolutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">As long as there is a reasonable possibility that a fellow departmental employee stole departmental property from a file and as long as questioning of petitioner\u2019s \u201cassistant\u201d might produce admissible evidence relevant to petitioner\u2019s credibility, real parties have a fairly compelling reason for seeking the disclosure of the \u201cassistant\u2019s\u201d identity. Accordingly, in order to prevail, petitioner needed to produce sealed evidence which would show real parties\u2019 interests to be something less than compelling and/or to establish a genuine threat of unwarranted oppression if that person\u2019s identity is revealed. <em>(John </em>Z. v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 789, 791-792 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 556].)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Petitioner has not established the existence of her \u201cassistant,\u201d let alone that this person is an employee of the police department. Moreover, she has not presented any evidence which would support the conclusion that this person could not be punished legitimately for theft of department property and would, instead, be subjected to wrongful retaliation for aiding petitioner in establishing her harassment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">The internal memorandum upon which petitioner relies simply demonstrates that the department assumes it not only was a departmental employee who removed the photographs but was a supervisory employee, and that the department views this as theft of its property and an extreme breach of trust. Punishment of a theft and a breach of trust would be appropriate. The memorandum therefore does not establish either the existence of an \u201cassistant\u201d or that the department would engage in <em>improper </em>retaliation/punishment of the person who took the photographs from the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Petitioner might have provided sealed declarations to the trial court to establish that removal of the photographs was not a wrongful act and/or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>severe and improper retaliation against the \u201cassistant\u201d (whose identity should be revealed under seal) was substantially likely. (See, e.g., <em>John Z. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at pp. 791-792.) That is, she might have sought to establish that the department would not be punishing a theft from its files but would be punishing sympathetic alliance with petitioner\u2019s antiharassment cause by jeopardizing the \u201cassistant\u2019s\u201d safety or subjecting him/her to unwarranted oppression. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Regrettably, she failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">Inasmuch as petitioner failed to carry her burden of proof, I have no choice other than to concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-9\">This case is before us on the employee\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate filed after the trial court ordered her to disclose the identity of the person who assisted her. When the petition was first filed, we summarily denied it, after which a petition for review was presented to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted review, then transferred the matter to us with directions to issue an alternative writ. We complied and have now received further briefing and heard oral argument. Our opinion remains unchanged, however, and we once again deny the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-6\">The person who gave the photographs to Gonzalez is not an \u201cinformant\u201d or a \u201cwhistle-blower.\u201d He (or she) did not provide information about another person\u2019s wrongdoing to anyone\u2014not to Gonzalez (who already knew about the photographs) or her employer or a public agency or anyone else. As will appear, what he (or she) did was to steal the photographs from a detective\u2019s file and turn them over to Gonzalez. As will also appear, Gonzalez\u2019s failure to provide any evidence in support of her position means we do not even know if the person who gave her the photographs actually exists or, if the person does exist, whether he (or she) is a coworker or an outsider. For a shorthand designation, therefore, we refer to the person simply as Gonzalez\u2019s \u201cassistant\u201d and, for simplicity\u2019s sake, use the masculine when a personal pronoun is required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b948-11\">We have no idea why the author of this memorandum assumes the photographs were taken by a supervisor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b949-11\">As noted above (fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>the assistant is not a \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d A whistleblower is either (a) an employee who is asked by his superior to commit a violation of statutory policy and not only refuses but also discloses the request to his employer or a governmental agency (e.g., <em>Petermann </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 184 [344 P.2d 25]; <em>Tameny </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 167 [164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330, 9 A.L.R.4th 314]) or (b) an employee who has been discharged for reporting to his employer or a government agency that other employees or his employer are violating the law <em>(John Z. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 789 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 556]; <em>Harless </em>v. <em>First Nat.

Gonzalez\u2019s assistant did not speak out to anyone. He stole evidence and gave it to Gonzalez.

Whose idea was it to take the photographs from the file? If it was your idea, did you tell Gonzalez what you were going to do before you did it? If so, what was her response? If not, what did she say when you gave her the pictures? What is your relationship to Gonzalez? How did you know where to find the photographs?
