Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Terrell Javon Reed is a \u201csecond strike\u201d defendant under California\u2019s new \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law: he has been convicted of robbery (his second strike), and he has a prior conviction for residential burglary (his first strike). He contends the court erred in employing the Three Strikes law to impose twice the base term for the robbery because his first strike predated the law\u2019s enactment. We hold that the Three Strikes law applies to prior felony convictions predating its enactment, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">A jury convicted Reed of first degree robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5) and unauthorized entry (Pen. Code, \u00a7 602.5) committed on March 14, 1994. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1610\">*1610</page-number>In addition, he pleaded guilty to second degree burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460) committed on February 12, 1994. The court found he had a 1992 conviction for residential burglary, which was alleged as an enhancement under the provisions of the Three Strikes law subjecting a second strike defendant to twice the base term. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (e); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1995)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (Cal.App.).) The court imposed the middle term of eight years for the robbery\u2014that is, a four-year term doubled under the Three Strikes law\u2014plus concurrent sentences for the other offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">This case presents another issue arising from one of the many ambiguities in the Three Strikes law, on which we have previously commented. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra.) </em>The legislative version of the Three Strikes law states, \u201cThe determination of whether a prior conviction is a prior felony conviction for purposes of subdivisions (b) to (i), inclusive, <em>shall be made upon the date of that prior conviction </em>and is not affected by the sentence imposed unless the sentence automatically, upon the initial sentencing, converts the felony to a misdemeanor.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1), italics added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Reed argues that because this determination was not (and could not have been) made <em>at the time </em>of the prior conviction, the Three Strikes law cannot apply\u2014that is, the law does not apply to prior felony convictions predating the law\u2019s enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">The ambiguity here is in the law\u2019s use of the word \u201cupon.\u201d Does this mean that the determination whether an offense is a \u201cstrike\u201d must be made <em>at the time </em>of the prior conviction\u2014which cannot have occurred with convictions predating the Three Strikes law\u2014or does it mean something else that permits application of the law to such convictions?</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">The word \u201cupon\u201d is synonymous with (and often an unnecessarily formal version of) the word \u201con.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1961) p. 2517; Garner, A Dict. of Modern Legal Usage (1987) p. 558; Bryson, The Facts on File Dict, of Troublesome Words (rev. ed. 1987) p. 120.) The word \u201con\u201d has many meanings, two of which are pertinent here. One meaning is \u201coccurrence at the same time\u201d as something. (Webster\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at p. 1574.) That is the meaning Reed ascribes to the Three Strikes law. Another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1611\">*1611</page-number>meaning, however, is \u201cwith reference\u201d to something. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1575.) In the present context, this would mean simply that the determination whether an offense is a \u201cstrike\u201d must be made <em>with reference to </em>the date of the prior conviction, and not with reference to the sentence subsequently imposed for the prior (unless the sentence converts the offense to a misdemeanor).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">We ascribe the latter meaning, which does not require the \u201cstrike\u201d determination to be made at the time of the prior conviction and thus permits application of the Three Strikes law to convictions predating its enactment, for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">First, the lists of prior felonies invoking the Three Strikes law, set forth, in Penal Code sections 667.5 and 1192.7 and incorporated into subdivision (d)(1) of section 667, include several former felonies that were repealed before enactment of the Three Strikes law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Construction of the Three Strikes law to preclude its application to convictions predating its enactment would make meaningless its references to these former felonies, which can <em>only </em>have occurred prior to enactment, and is thus disfavored. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 832.)</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Second, such construction would be contrary to the statutorily expressed legislative intent behind the Three Strikes law, which is to \u201censure longer prison sentences and greater punishment\u201d for serious and violent recidivists. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (b).) The basic purpose of such legislation\u2014the deterrence of recidivism\u2014would be frustrated by a construction which did not take account of prior criminal conduct predating the legislation\u2019s enactment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 833.)</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Third, such construction would create an unacceptable anomaly with regard to Proposition 184, the initiative version of the Three Strikes law (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.12). The ballot argument in favor of the initiative, which became effective eight months after the Three Strikes legislation, plainly stated, \u201cConvictions before 1994 ... are counted as strikes.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., argument in favor of Prop. 184, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1994) p. 36.) Clearly, that is what the electorate had in mind when it passed Proposition 184, which must therefore be construed accordingly. The legislative language at issue here (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1)) is essentially the same as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1612\">*1612</page-number>correlative language of the initiative (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.12, subd. (b)(1)). It would be anomalous to conclude that the Legislature and the electorate intended different meanings for essentially identical provisions. And it would be absurd to sentence pre- and post-Proposition 184 defendants differently under those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">We conclude that subdivision (d)(1) of Penal Code section 667 does not require the determination whether a prior conviction is a \u201cstrike\u201d to be made <em>at the time </em>of the prior conviction, but simply <em>by reference to </em>the date of the prior conviction, and thus the Three Strikes law applies to prior felony convictions predating its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">IV. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Peterson, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 13, 1995.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Opinion (A066299) deleted upon direction of Supreme Court by order dated June 1, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-9\">The information did not allege, and the judge did not impose, a five-year enhancement for the prior serious felony conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b992-10\">The initiative version of the Three Strikes law (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.12) became effective on November 8, 1994, and thus does not apply to the present case. However, its pertinent correlative provisions (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.12, subd. (b)(1)) are essentially the same as those at issue here (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b993-9\">These include assault by a life prisoner on a noninmate (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(12)), which is based on Penal Code section 4500 before its amendment in 1977; assault with intent to commit robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(10)), which was deleted from Penal Code section 220 in 1978; and any felony in which the defendant inflicted great bodily injury as specified in former Penal Code sections 213, 264 and 461 before July 1, 1977 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(7)). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 832, &amp; fn. 7 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
