The victim telephoned the police, who arrested the defendant in approximately 15 minutes. We hold that in these circumstances, the victim\u2019s fear lasted long enough to satisfy the statutory element of \u201csustained fear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Carl Frank Allen (Allen) appeals a judgment entered following a trial by the court resulting in Allen\u2019s conviction for two counts of terrorist threats (Pen. Code, \u00a7 422), three counts of stalking (Pen. Code, \u00a7 646.9, subd. (b)), first degree residential burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459), and assault likely to produce great bodily injury and with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The trial court sentenced Allen as follows. Count two (terrorist threats), to the high term of three years for the base term, plus four years pursuant to Penal Code section 12022.5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counts three, six, and seven (stalking), to one-third the midterm of two years, for a total of eight months as to each count, with execution of sentence stayed as to each count pursuant to section 654. Count four (first degree residential burglary), to one-third the midterm of four years, to run consecutive to count two. Count five (terrorist threats), to one-third the midterm of two years, to run consecutive to count two. Count eight (assault likely to produce great bodily injury and with a deadly weapon), to one-third the midterm of three years, to run consecutive to count two. The total sentence was 10 years, less 225 days of preconviction credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">As to counts three, six, and seven, we modify and correct the judgment to reflect a conviction for violating section 646.9, subdivision (a). Execution of sentence for these three counts remains stayed pursuant to section 654. In all other respects we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">After dating for two or three years, Allen and Barbara Irons broke up before January 12, 1992. On that date about 8 p.m., Irons was on her way to a friend\u2019s house near 105th Street and Compton Avenue. Suddenly Allen was \u201cin Irons\u2019s face,\u201d arguing with her, saying he was tired of her playing games with him. Carrying two screwdrivers, one in each hand, with the ends pointed at Irons, Allen came at her, gripping the screwdrivers and lunging at Irons. The tips of the screwdrivers came within approximately one foot of Irons\u2019s body. Irons continued to back away. A man named Joe Gray, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>known as \u201cJoe Boy,\u201d heard the argument and intervened. Irons got behind Joe Boy, who walked her to her mother\u2019s house. The incident left her paranoid and afraid Allen would do something to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">On May 8,1992, Irons again saw Allen about 8 or 9 p.m. at her Van Nuys apartment. She had never given him her address since moving there five or six months earlier. Allen was outside her second floor apartment, on a porch or walkway. Peeking out from inside, Irons saw Allen take his coat, wrap it around his hand, and break her front window, which was closed and locked and covered by a curtain. Then he ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">On May 19, 1992, Irons again saw Allen, inside her Van Nuys apartment. A man named \u201cTreetop\u201d was downstairs working on his car. Irons had been taking a shower, and then saw Allen at her bathroom door. Allen hit her, injuring Irons with a gash over her right eyebrow, which bled. Allen then fled. Crying and screaming, Irons ran behind him and tried to have Treetop stop Allen, but Allen escaped. After Treetop took Irons to her mother\u2019s house at 106th and Compton Avenue, Irons made a police report of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Later that evening, at her mother\u2019s house, Irons again saw Allen. Irons\u2019s mother was home, but asleep. Allen was outside the house. As he moved back and forth, Allen loudly described how he had tom up Irons\u2019s clothing and apartment, and threatened to throw a cocktail bomb at her mother\u2019s house. Irons interpreted this reference to mean that Allen intended to put gasoline in a bottle, light it, and throw it inside so it would blow up. She believed Allen might do that. Allen\u2019s statements frightened Irons, who made her son get on the floor because she was afraid Allen was going to throw a bomb inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The same evening Irons returned to her Van Nuys apartment. Severely vandalized, it had holes in every wall. A sink was pulled out of the wall, and faucets were pulled out of the sink. The sliding door on her front room was broken, as were her bedroom set and dresser. Jars were thrown everywhere. All her clothes were gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">On July 24,1992, Irons was at the house of a friend, Femita Ephrian, near her mother\u2019s house. About 1 p.m., Irons, who had been sleeping on a couch, woke up to find Allen beating on her in the front room. Irons hit back. Ephrian, emerging from the bathroom after a shower, heard Irons screaming. Ephrian knew defendant Allen; they grew up together. She saw Allen hitting Irons, who although she was sitting down, fought back, kicking, screaming, and hitting Allen. When Ephrian grabbed a knife, Allen stopped hitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>Irons. Irons grabbed some iron implements from the stove to use as weapons to hit Allen with, but Allen had already run out the front door. Irons was injured; her face was swollen and her eye was sticking out. The incident left her feeling paranoid and afraid for her life; she still felt that way at the time of trial. Ephrian had not given Allen permission to be inside her apartment that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Irons filed police reports on all of these incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">At 8 or 9 a.m. on October 25,1992, Irons\u2019s mother, Shirley Williams, saw defendant Allen outside her home as she was picking grass out of a flower bed. Riding a bicycle, Allen came and went about four times, returning about midday. Williams saw him talking to a neighbor named Charles near Williams\u2019s back door. Williams approached the door. Allen used profanity first and then said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you. I\u2019m gonna kill you and your daughter.\u201d As he said this, Allen took an eight- or nine-inch black handgun from his trousers and pointed it at Williams, his arm extended and the weapon pointed at her. Shaking and in fear, Williams called 911. She had called the police several times before regarding Allen. Allen left before the police arrived, but 15 minutes later Williams saw the police had taken Allen into custody. She identified Allen for the police at a location less than a block from her house. Williams testified that she had called the police to report earlier incidents involving Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Admitted as People\u2019s exhibit 1 was a certified docket computer printout of a case (People v. Allen (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1990, No. 90-R-31374)) showing Allen\u2019s misdemeanor conviction on April 9, 1991, in Los Angeles for assault with a deadly weapon in violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(1). As a condition of probation, Allen was ordered to stay away from and not annoy, harass or molest any person or witness involved in the prosecution, especially Barbara Irons. Protective orders signed as a condition of probation prevented Allen from having contact with or disturbing the peace of Irons, required him to stay away from her and ordered him not to commit a similar offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Allen testified in his own behalf as follows: On January 12, 1992, Irons approached Allen in a parking lot as he talked with another woman. Irons carried a screwdriver, which Allen took away from her. He denied lunging at Irons with the screwdriver.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Allen denied that on May 19, 1992, he threatened to cocktail bomb the house of Irons\u2019s mother. He denied he threatened Irons.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>As to the July 24, 1992, incident, Allen testified he had known Femita Ephrian a long time and had visited her apartment many times. On July 24, he knocked on Ephrian\u2019s closed door. Irons let him in and asked for some cash to \u201cbuy a rock.\u201d Allen\u2019s refusal angered Irons, who stuck Allen with a knife. He hit her back\u2014\u201cI tapped her on the arm\u201d\u2014and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">As to the October 25, 1992, incident, Allen denied pointing a gun at Shirley Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Allen testified that the ongoing problem between himself and Irons was due to Irons\u2019s drug use. Irons wanted money and Allen gave it to her. When he refused on one occasion, Irons became angry and cut him across the lip. He hit her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Allen lived in Irons\u2019s Van Nuys apartment for three months, although he had moved out before the damage to the apartment occurred. May 8, 1992, Allen arrived to pick up some of his clothing. The window to Irons\u2019s apartment broke because Irons herself threw a flower pot at Allen and he ducked.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Defendant claims on appeal that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-10\">1.

The evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction for count seven because there was no showing of defendant\u2019s repeated following or harassment of Irons as required by section 646.9, subdivisions (a) and (b); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>6. The evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction for count four because there was no showing of defendant\u2019s intent to commit a felony when he entered Ephrian\u2019s apartment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">1. <em>Constitutionality of Section 422</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATT\">a. <em>Count Two: \u201cSustained Fear\u201d and Section 422</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Defendant claims on appeal that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain a conviction for count two. Because the police arrested him within 15 minutes, defendant argues that there was no showing that the victim, Shirley Williams, experienced the \u201csustained fear\u201d required by section 422.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Pursuant to the substantial evidence rule <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 489, 514 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 199, 828 P.2d 101]), we review Williams\u2019s testimony concerning the October 25, 1992, threats. Williams, the mother of Barbara Irons, knew Allen had formerly been her daughter\u2019s boyfriend. She had called the police about Allen on prior occasions. On October 25, 1992, Williams had seen Allen around her house earlier in the morning; Allen had left and returned, and Williams had seen him four times. About 12:30 p.m., riding a bicycle, Allen stopped in front of Williams\u2019s back door and had a conversation with a neighbor. Williams came up to the door. Allen turned around and talked to Williams. First he used profanity. Then he declared: \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you. I\u2019m gonna kill you and your daughter.\u201d As he spoke he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>took a black, eight- or nine-inch gun from his trousers and pointed it at Williams, in front of her chest, with his arm extended. Shaking, Williams felt fear because Allen had been coming by her house and peeking in her windows. Allen left the scene. Williams called the police, who arrested Allen within \u201cabout fifteen minutes or so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Section 422 requires the person threatened \u201creasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety [.]\u201d The prosecution must prove that the defendant had the specific intent that his statement would be taken as a threat, whether or not he actually intended to carry it out. Besides requiring this showing of defendant\u2019s mental element, the statute also requires proof of a mental element in the victim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garrett </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 962, 966 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 33]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Salvato </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 872, 883 [285 Cal.Rptr. 837]; cf. section 76, many of whose elements resemble those of section 422 but which lacks the element of \u201csustained\u201d fear.) The statute, however, does not define \u201csustained\u201d fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Defining the word \u201csustained\u201d by its opposites, we find that it means a period of time that extends beyond what is momentary, fleeting, or transitory. Williams knew that Allen had made a practice of looking inside her home, and had reported Allen\u2019s conduct to the police on previous occasions. The victim\u2019s knowledge of defendant\u2019s prior conduct is relevant in establishing that the victim was in a state of sustained fear. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garrett, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th 962, 967.)  Fifteen minutes of fear of a defendant who is armed, mobile, and at large, and who has threatened to kill the victim and her daughter, is more than sufficient to constitute \u201csustained\u201d fear for purposes of this element of section 422.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports Allen\u2019s conviction for count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">b.-d.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The sentence imposed for three counts of violating section 646.9, subdivision (b) is vacated, the judgment of conviction is modified to reflect a conviction in counts three, six, and seven for section 646.9, subdivision (a), and the judgment is further modified by imposing the misdemeanor sentence for the three section 646.9, subdivision (a) counts, execution of which sentence is stayed pursuant to section 654. In all other respects the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Klein, P. J., and Collins, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 14, 1995.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-11\">Unless otherwise specified, all references to statutes in this opinion will refer to the California Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b769-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1149.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Section 422 states: \u201cAny person who willfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person, with the specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out, which, on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made, is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat, and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family\u2019s safety, shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by imprisonment in the state prison. fiD For the purposes of this section, \u2018immediate family\u2019 means any spouse, whether by marriage or not, parent, child, any person related by consanguinity or affinity within the second degree, or any other person who regularly resides in the household, or who, within the prior six months, regularly resided in the household.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">In the admittedly different context of the element of premeditation and deliberation required for homicide, no specific minimum time is required; the test is not the duration of time so much as the extent of the reflection; thoughts may follow one another with rapidity and a defendant may arrive at calculated judgment quickly. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 931, 956 [275 Cal.Rptr. 160, 800 P.2d 516].)
