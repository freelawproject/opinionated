J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACd\">In this mandamus proceeding, we decide a venue question where an individual is joined as a defendant on an alter ego theory in a breach of contract action against a corporation. May the individual defendant transfer the action to the county of his or her residence when the action has been properly laid in a different county as to the corporate defendant? We decide for the purposes of venue, the alter ego allegation places the individual in the same position as the corporation, as a party to the contract. Venue is then proper where the action could be laid for breach of contract against an individual or corporate defendant. We conclude the court here correctly denied the motion to transfer, leaving the breach of contract action against the individual and corporate defendants in San Diego County where the contract was allegedly executed, to be performed and breached. Accordingly, we deny the petition and vacate the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Poway Wal-Mart Plaza (Poway) filed an action for breach of a commercial real property lease against Chubby\u2019s, Inc. (Chubby\u2019s) and Steven Lebastchi (Lebastchi) in San Diego County on October 21, 1994. The complaint alleged Chubby\u2019s is a California corporation and Lebastchi is Chubby\u2019s alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>ego.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lebastchi\u2019s place of residence was alleged to be in Fair Oaks, Sacramento County. Poway attached a copy of the lease to the complaint, which showed Lebastchi executed the lease for Chubby\u2019s in his capacity as president.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Lebastchi moved to transfer the action to Placer County under Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 396b<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the grounds venue was improper in San Diego County because it is not a county of a defendant\u2019s residence as required in section 395, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In support of the motion, Lebastchi\u2019s attorney declared Chubby\u2019s principal place of business was Sacramento County and Lebastchi\u2019s residence was Placer County. Lebastchi claimed because the action named both a corporation and an individual as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>defendants, it was a \u201cmixed venue\u201d action with conflicting venue provisions and he was entitled to move the action to the county of his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Poway opposed the change of venue, arguing the action was properly in San Diego County under section 395.5<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because the lease was entered into, performed and breached by the corporation in San Diego, supported by the declaration of Poway\u2019s general manager. Poway argued as Chubby\u2019s alter ego, Lebastchi should be subject to the same venue provision as the corporation for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The court denied the motion for change of venue on December 16, 1994, on the basis the acts giving rise to the complaint occurred in San Diego where the commercial property was located. The court noted the lease was entered into and was to be performed in San Diego. Lebastchi petitioned for mandamus.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We issued a stay and calendared argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Venue, the county in which an action takes place, is statutorily governed by the type or form of the particular action. (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Actions, \u00a7 554, p. 580.)  \u201cVenue is determined based on the complaint on file at the time the motion to change venue is made. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 477, 482 [208 Cal.Rptr. 724, 691 P.2d 272].)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">A defendant may challenge the venue by affidavits dealing with the type or nature of the action, and the plaintiff may bolster his or her choice of venue with counteraffidavits consistent with the complaint\u2019s theory of the type of action but amplifying the allegations relied upon for venue. (See 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Actions, \u00a7 556, pp. 582-583.) Because the law favors the right of trial at the defendant\u2019s residence, a plaintiff who lays venue elsewhere must be able to show the action is either local or is a transitory action triable outside the county of the defendant\u2019s residence. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00a7 557, p. 583; <em>see Ah Fong </em>v. <em>Stearnes </em>(1889) 79 Cal. 30, 33 [21 P. 381].)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Actions on contract are generally transitory and are triable at the defendant\u2019s residence, the place of contracting, or the place of performance. (\u00a7 395, subd. (a).) An action against a corporation for breach of contract is triable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>\u201cin the county where the contract is made or is to be performed, or where the obligation or liability arises, or the breach occurs; or in the county where the principal place of business of such corporation is situated . . . (\u00a7 395.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Here, Poway\u2019s complaint against Chubby\u2019s and Lebastchi contains only one cause of action, for breach of lease. Poway seeks one form of relief, money damages for unpaid rent, expenses, interest, and attorney fees and costs under the terms of the lease. As such, the action is transitory and is subject to the specific venue provisions for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Lebastchi is incorrect this action is a \u201cmixed action\u201d which would allow him to transfer it to the county of his residence. A mixed action is one in which the complaint contains two or more causes of action, each of which might have been separately filed, and one of which is local and another transitory. (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Actions, \u00a7 637, pp. 656-657.) Here Poway joined two defendants, one natural and one corporate, with different residences in a single transitory action. Poway seeks to hold Chubby\u2019s and/or Lebastchi liable for the same breach and damages; Chubby\u2019s as the contracting corporation and Lebastchi as Chubby\u2019s alter ego.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The alter ego doctrine arises when a plaintiff claims the opposing party is using the corporate form unjustly and in derogation of the plaintiff\u2019s interests. <em>(Mesler </em>v. <em>Bragg Management Co. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 300 [216 Cal.Rptr. 443, 702 P.2d 601].) \u201c[T]he issue is not whether the corporate entity should be disregarded for all purposes, nor whether its very purpose was to defraud the plaintiff. Rather, the issue is \u2018whether in the particular case presented and for the purpose of such case justice and equity can best be accomplished and fraud and unfairness defeated by a disregard of the distinct entity of the corporate form.\u2019 \u201d (9 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1989) Corporations, \u00a7 12, pp. 524-525, citing <em>Kohn </em>v. <em>Kohn </em>(1950) 95 Cal.App.2d 708, 718 [214 P.2d 71], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Here, Poway alleged any separateness between Chubby\u2019s and Lebastchi ceased to exist because Lebastchi exercised complete control of the corporation, he failed to observe corporate formalities, inadequately capitalized the corporation and used corporate assets for personal benefit, to constitute an abuse of the corporate privilege. The effect of the alter ego allegations placed Lebastchi in the same position as Chubby\u2019s, responsible under the contract. Lebastchi did not declare otherwise or claim improper joinder. We conclude the expanded venue provisions for breach of contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>under sections 395.5 and 395, subdivision (a), were properly applied to Lebastchi.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Petition denied.

In <em>Meadows, </em>plaintiff sued in San Francisco for breach of contract to pay money. Defendants were residents of Los Angeles and moved to transfer the action there. The complaint alleged plaintiff entered into a contract in San Francisco with a Los Angeles corporation, the corporation dissolved and assigned all its assets and liabilities to the defendant partnership. In resisting the change of venue, plaintiff argued he was suing on the alter ego theory to hold the individual defendants liable for the corporation\u2019s contract. On appeal, the court concluded the plaintiff had not included sufficient facts in the complaint to rely on the alter ego theory, commenting \u201c[plaintiff] must plead them in order to take from such defendants their statutory right of trial in the county of their residence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 499.) Although <em>Meadows </em>anticipated the scenario before us, it did not reach the issue whether a properly pleaded alter ego allegation would necessarily defeat an individual\u2019s right of trial in the county of his or her residence. As such, <em>Meadows </em>is not instructive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
