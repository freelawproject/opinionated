J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoM\">Following a contested jurisdictional hearing, the juvenile court found that the minor Romeo C., along with co-accuseds James C. and Low Ching S., had committed a felony violation of Penal Code section 246 (unlawfully and maliciously discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court also found in enhancement that a principal in the offense was armed with a shotgun (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)) and that the offenses were committed by and for the benefit of a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">At the dispositional hearing the juvenile court found the minor to be a ward of the court and ordered him committed to the California Youth Authority (CYA) for a total of eleven years, based on a seven-year term for the main offense, a one-year enhancement pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (a)(1), and a three-year enhancement pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b). The minor was also ordered to pay a $250 restitution fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-10\">On appeal the minor contends: (1) no substantial evidence supports the minor\u2019s adjudication; (2) his statement to the police should have been excluded because it was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda;</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(3) evidence was improperly admitted against him under the \u201ccoconspirator exception\u201d to the hearsay rule; (4) the juvenile court\u2019s refusal to permit the minor to present the minor\u2019s full statement to the police in evidence caused him prejudice; (5) no substantial evidence supports the street gang enhancement; (6) the firearm enhancement must be stricken because the use of a firearm is an element of the offense the minor committed; (7) the juvenile court improperly denied the minor the opportunity to obtain the testimony of the probation officer at the dispositional hearing; (8) the juvenile court abused its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1842\">*1842</page-number>committing the minor to CYA; and (9) the juvenile court improperly imposed the restitution f\u00edne without determining the minor\u2019s ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">In this published portion of the opinion we conclude the juvenile court properly exercised its discretion to preclude cross-examination of the probation officer at the dispositional hearing. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we agree with the minor that both enhancements must be stricken, but reject his other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">I-VI*</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-9\">The minor contends the juvenile court erred prejudicially at the dispositional hearing by refusing to allow him to cross-examine the probation officer who prepared the dispositional social study. According to the minor, both statutory right and due process entitled him to obtain the probation officer\u2019s testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-10\">Our first task is to identify the appropriate rules of evidence to be applied at a dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-11\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 701 governs the conduct of <em>jurisdictional </em>hearings. That statute provides in relevant part: \u201cThe admission and exclusion of evidence shall be pursuant to the rules of evidence established by the Evidence Code and by judicial decision.\u201d (See rule 1488(b) of Cal. Rules of Court; <em>In re Antonio A. </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 700, 704 [275 Cal.Rptr. 482].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-12\">There is no correlative statute making the Evidence Code generally applicable to a dispositional hearing. Rather, Welfare and Institutions Code section 706 provides: \u201cAfter finding that a minor is a person described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1843\">*1843</page-number>Section 601 or 602, the court shall hear evidence on the question of the proper disposition to be made of the minor. <em>The court shall receive in evidence the social study of the minor made by the probation officer and such other relevant and material evidence as may be offered, </em>and in any judgment and order of disposition, shall state the social study made by the probation officer has been read and considered by the court.\u201d (Italics added; see <em>In re Michael V. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 159, 169-170 [223 Cal.Rptr. 503].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">The minor asserts that the directive of Welfare and Institutions Code section 706 for the court to receive \u201cthe social study of the minor made by the probation officer <em>and </em>such other relevant and material evidence as may be offered\u201d (italics added) means that the court must grant the minor the right to cross-examine the probation officer on request. We cannot subscribe to the view that Welfare and Institutions Code section 706 mandates without qualification the presentation of all relevant evidence at a dispositional hearing. Rather, as we shall explain, such a literal construction of the statute would lead to absurdity. We shall conclude the provisions of Evidence Code section 352<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (allowing the court to limit relevant evidence if it is cumulative, time wasting, or likely to confuse the issues) are necessarily implied in Welfare and Institutions Code section 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">A literal reading of Welfare and Institutions Code section 706 requires a juvenile court to receive in evidence such relevant evidence as may be offered. Relevant evidence is defined in Evidence Code section 210 to mean (in pertinent part) \u201c. . . evidence . . . having any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">This definition of relevant evidence is manifestly broad. Evidence is relevant when no matter how weak it is it tends to prove a disputed issue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hess </em>(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 642, 676 [234 P.2d 65].) Evidence may be relevant even though it is cumulative; thus, the only ban on cumulative evidence is found in Evidence Code section 352. <em>(People </em>v. <em>House </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 756, 773 [90 Cal.Rptr. 831] (conc. opn. of Kaus, P.J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-8\">It has sometimes been said that evidence that is unduly time consuming is irrelevant; however, in his treatise on \u201cEvidence,\u201d Witkin persuasively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1844\">*1844</page-number>argues that consumption of time is not properly a part of ascertaining relevance: \u201cThere are occasional expressions to the effect that. . . evidence, though logically relevant (tending to prove a material matter), is so remote or conjectural, i.e., of so slight persuasive value, as to be legally irrelevant. And sometimes the exclusion of evidence for the policy reason of undue prejudice is placed on the ground of irrelevancy. [ID This splitting of the relevancy doctrine into \u2018logical\u2019 and \u2018legal\u2019 phases has been strongly criticized as useless and misleading. The better view seems to be to consider relevancy a single concept, and to treat all exclusions of logically relevant evidence as exceptions based on policy; e.g., remote or conjectural matter may be relevant but is excluded because it would result in an undue consumption of time. [Citations.]\u201d (1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) Circumstantial Evidence, \u00a7 287, pp. 257-258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">From the foregoing it should be evident that if Welfare and Institutions Code section 706 were construed literally to mandate the admission of all relevant evidence, the result would be to sanction an enormous waste of time in dispositional hearings, where juvenile court judges would be powerless to exclude cumulative evidence or time-consuming evidence of marginal probative value. In this age of fiscal restraint and of overburdened courts, we cannot believe the Legislature intended such a result, which, in our view, would be absurd. The language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 477, 485 [208 Cal.Rptr. 724, 691 P.2d 272]; <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 102, 113 [145 Cal.Rptr. 674, 577 P.2d 1014]; see <em>California School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Governing Board </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 333, 340 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 878 P.2d 1321].) Rather, whatever is necessarily implied in a statute is as much a part of it as that which is expressed. <em>(Welfare Rights Organization </em>v. <em>Crisan </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 766, 771 [190 Cal.Rptr. 919, 661 P.2d 1073, 31 A.L.R.4th 1214].) We shall conclude Welfare and Institutions Code section 706 impliedly incorporates Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">\u201cBy enacting Evidence Code section 352, the Legislature gave the court the means to facilitate judicial economy. This section expressly gives the trial court discretion to exclude evidence *. . . if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of . . . confusing the issues . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(DePalma </em>v. <em>Westland Software House </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1534, 1544 [276 CaLRptr. 214].) Evidence Code section 352 applies \u201cacross the board\u201d to all criminal proceedings, even after the enactment of article I, section 28, of the California Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301, 306-313 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1845\">*1845</page-number>696 P.2d 111].) Evidence Code section 352 is perhaps the most valuable day-to-day tool available to our busy trial courts. From the viewpoint of the juvenile court judge, conducting a dispositional hearing without Evidence Code section 352 would be like driving a bus without brakes. We shall not presume the Legislature stripped the juvenile court of this crucial tool in the conduct of dispositional hearings. Rather, Evidence Code section 352, reasonably implied in Welfare and Institutions Code section 706, was available to the juvenile court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">To be sure, the juvenile court did not expressly cite Evidence Code section 352 in its ruling precluding cross-examination of the probation officer, but that fact is immaterial.  The trial judge need not expressly weigh prejudice against probative value or even expressly state that he or she has done so. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 135 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887].) No \u201cmagic words\u201d are necessary to show an appropriate exercise of discretion under Evidence Code section 352. <em>(Burns </em>v. <em>20th Century Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1666, 1674 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 462].) What is important is that the record manifest the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion available under Evidence Code section 352. <em>(Burns, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1674; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrett </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 795, 801 [241 Cal.Rptr. 10]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1570, 1577 [239 Cal.Rptr. 190].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">Here, the record shows an appropriate exercise of discretion for two reasons. First, the court engaged in a lengthy colloquy with counsel over the propriety of putting the probation officer on the stand. Second, the juvenile court had \u201chere in front of me\u201d the opinion of our Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 749 [150 Cal.Rptr. 778, 587 P.2d 220, 3 A.L.R.4th 1171]. That case held an adult criminal court had <em>discretion </em>to deny cross-examination of a governmental employee who had prepared a diagnostic report. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 756.) \u201cSince the <em>Arbuckle </em>decision was the crucial case to control the issue before the court, it is reasonable to assume that the court read all applicable portions of the case, including page 756 which set forth the discretionary language.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Campo </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1423, 1432-1433 [239 Cal.Rptr. 44].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">We conclude the juvenile court properly exercised its discretion to prohibit cross-examination of the probation officer. The minor has shown no violation of statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-8\">The minor also contends preclusion of cross-examination of the probation officer denied him due process of law. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1846\">*1846</page-number>As the minor acknowledges, courts that have considered claims analogous to the minor\u2019s in the context of adult criminal proceedings have uniformly rejected them. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 945, 960 [216 Cal.Rptr. 98, 702 P.2d 180]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 753-756; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Campo, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1425-1433 [CYA commitment of juvenile tried as adult].) The minor maintains that these authorities are distinguishable because they construe sections 1203, subdivision (b), and 1204, which differ materially from Welfare and Institutions Code section 706.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He also maintains that the policy considerations on which these authorities rely are inapplicable to juvenile proceedings. We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">As we have explained, we cannot read Welfare and Institutions Code section 706 so as to compel admission of all \u201crelevant and material evidence\u201d without regard to Evidence Code section 352; therefore we are not persuaded that the differences in wording between Welfare and Institutions Code section 706 and the corresponding Penal Code provisions construed in <em>Arbuckle, Smith, </em>and <em>Campo, supra, </em>render those authorities inapposite. Accordingly, we look to the rationales underlying the holdings of <em>Arbuckle </em>and <em>Campo </em>and consider whether the minor has shown any good reason to find those rationales inapplicable in the juvenile context.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">In <em>Arbuckle, supra, </em>our Supreme Court held that neither the Penal Code provisions at issue nor the federal and state Constitutions grant a defendant the right to compel the testimony at a sentencing hearing of a government official who has prepared a diagnostic report to assist the trial court. The right of confrontation, on which the defendant sought to rely, is sufficiently protected by the trial court\u2019s required scrutiny of the report\u2019s written diagnosis and recommendation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 753-754.) Such a report is inherently reliable despite its inclusion of hearsay, because it is \u201cmade pursuant to a court order by expert, objective government personnel in pursuit of their official duties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 755.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">The court further held that \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d does not entitle a defendant to cross-examine the author of a diagnostic report as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1847\">*1847</page-number>due process. A defendant may challenge factual statements in such a report by \u201cpresenting his own evidence,\u201d but to allow him to do so by cross-examining the author of the report or by challenging the methods used therein would produce \u201ca full hearing on collateral issues emanating in an ever-widening circle from the central issue\u2014the proper sentence to be imposed . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 755.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">Finally, the court noted that to give a defendant the right to cross-examine the authors of diagnostic reports would impose a \u201cdrain on time and public resources\u201d: if every defendant could subpoena all persons involved in preparing such reports, they would have little time to do anything but travel to and from courts and appear in court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 756.) Therefore, \u201c[ajbsent a contrary legislative command, it should be within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine those instances when in-court testimony is required to provide a fundamentally fair proceeding.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 755-756.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">In <em>Campo, supra, </em>the defendant, committed to CYA, sought to distinguish <em>Arbuckle, </em>arguing: (1) reports prepared to determine amenability to CYA are different from those prepared for adult sentencing, and (2) the burden on the government would not be so great as in an adult sentencing proceeding because the Youth Authority is smaller than the Department of Corrections and has a different philosophy. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Campo, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d at p. 1428.) The trial court was not persuaded. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">The appellate court held that the rationale and holding of <em>Arbuckle </em>applied here. Like the diagnostic report in <em>Arbuckle, </em>the CYA amenability study was performed by expert, objective government personnel pursuant to their official duties. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Campo, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d at p. 1432.) And despite the differences in size and philosophy between the juvenile and adult systems, the juvenile system would be just as severely burdened by granting juvenile defendants automatic subpoena powers over personnel who prepare CYA amenability studies as the adult system would have been by a similar holding in <em>Arbuckle. (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">Here, as in <em>Arbuckle </em>and <em>Campo, </em>the report (or social study) at issue is inherently reliable because it was prepared by an objective, expert government employee in the course of her duties. A minor in a Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 dispositional proceeding has the same right to challenge factual statements in a report by presenting his own witnesses as did the defendant in <em>Arbuckle. </em>And, as noted in <em>Arbuckle, </em>to allow a minor the right to cross-examine the officer who prepared the report could easily produce \u201ca full hearing on collateral issues emanating in an ever-widening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1848\">*1848</page-number>circle from the central issue[,] the proper sentence to be imposed\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 755)\u2014a concern which is at the heart of the trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude evidence under Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">The minor attempts to distinguish <em>Arbuckle </em>and <em>Campo </em>as to the burden imposed on the government by compelling the testimony of probation officers: he points out that the reports discussed in those cases were diagnostic studies by teams of experts who would all have had to be subpoenaed, whereas here we have an investigative report by a single person who was already present in the courtroom. These differences do not yield a principled basis for evading the logic of <em>Arbuckle </em>and <em>Campo. </em>The probation officer will not necessarily be present at every Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 dispositional hearing, and probation officers, like the experts responsible for the reports discussed in <em>Arbuckle </em>and <em>Campo, </em>have heavy caseloads on which their capacity to work would be compromised if they were subject to subpoena and cross-examination in every case where they have filed a social study. Thus, even if the burden on the government from adopting the minor\u2019s proposed rule might be less than in the <em>Arbuckle </em>or <em>Campo </em>situation, this difference would not be so great as to require a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">The minor also asserts that \u201cgeneral principles of due process require cross-examination be made available upon request,\u201d relying on <em>In re Malinda S. </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 368 [272 Cal.Rptr. 787, 795 P.2d 1244], <em>Malinda S. </em>is inapposite because it discusses jurisdictional hearings under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300. As we have explained, the evidentiary rules applicable to jurisdictional hearings in juvenile cases differ substantially from those applicable to dispositional hearings.  By the same token, due process requirements for the two types of hearing also differ. They are necessarily most stringent at the jurisdictional phase of a juvenile proceeding, whether under section 300 or Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, because the liberty interests of the minor (and of the minor\u2019s parent or guardian) are strongest in this phase of the proceeding. Once the juvenile court has determined that the minor comes within section 300 or section 602, the minor no longer has a protectable interest in being free from the court\u2019s jurisdiction; due process then requires only that the court properly consider all factors relevant to its dispositional choice.  Thus it does not help the minor\u2019s due process argument that parents or guardians have the right to cross-examine a probation officer or social worker who submits a report to the juvenile court in a section 300 jurisdictional hearing. <em>(In re Malinda S., supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 376; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1450(c).)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">Finally, the minor asserts that even if there is no general due process right to cross-examine the probation officer under Welfare and Institutions Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1849\">*1849</page-number>section 706, \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d required that he be allowed to do so here because the social study contained substantial inaccuracies and appeared to have been based on little if any investigation. We are not persuaded. The juvenile court struck portions of the social study shown to be inaccurate. As the minor acknowledges, he was allowed to call as witnesses two of the key persons relied on by the probation officer in writing her report, the minor\u2019s mother and the vice-principal of his school. Under <em>Arbuckle, </em>this is all the due process required. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 756.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">The juvenile court did not err in precluding cross-examination of the probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">VIII, IX<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">The enhancements imposed pursuant to sections 186.22 and 12022 are hereby stricken.
