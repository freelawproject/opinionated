We find no error and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">There being no insufficiency of evidence claim, the facts may be stated simply. Our perspective favors the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303-304 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>On the night of September 6, 1991, Matt Cruz (the victim) and his cousin Richard Calderon went to visit Gwendolyn Davidson and others at Ms. Davidson\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s house on Savannah Street in Los Angeles. When Cruz and Calderon arrived they were accosted by a group of about seven young men who asked them where they were from and what they wanted. An altercation was avoided and Cruz and Calderon entered the Davidson residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Later Cruz and Calderon went outside to get beer from Calderon\u2019s car. Calderon noticed a pickup truck had arrived with a few more young men. Appellant emerged from behind the pickup, fired three or four shots in the air from a handgun, approached Cruz and Calderon and said, \u201cWhere you F\u2019ing dudes from?\u201d Appellant pointed the gun at Cruz and Calderon and kept pulling the trigger\u2014as they tried to dodge out of the way\u2014but it was \u201ceither jacked, nothing coming out, or if he fired his last one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Appellant went back to the pickup truck while others in his group kept Cruz and Calderon from leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Ms. Davidson heard the noise, opened her back door and saw appellant, whom she knew as \u201cCapone,\u201d sitting in a chair in her backyard. She had often seen him there drinking, shooting guns in the air, and forcing her friends away.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">When appellant jumped up from his chair Ms. Davidson ran to the front door, opened it, and saw appellant with a double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun. Calderon, now on the porch of the Davidson house, yelled to his cousin to get in the house but Cruz remained outside. Calderon saw appellant walk around the side of the house carrying a shotgun. Ms. Davidson yelled at the top of her voice, \u201cCapone, please don\u2019t kill him because that\u2019s our friend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Appellant approached to within about 35 feet of Cruz and both Calderon and Ms. Davidson ran into the house. They heard three or four gunshots. It was about 11:35 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Later, the police arrived and found Cruz dead from multiple shotgun wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">Within two weeks of the murder both Ms. Davidson and Calderon identified appellant, by photograph, as the person who had murdered Cruz.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">1. <em>Appellant contends it was error to admit the preliminary hearing testimony of Gwendolyn Davidson because the prosecution failed to exercise reasonable diligence to procure her attendance at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The trial court admitted the preliminary hearing testimony of eyewitness Gwendolyn Davidson because she was unavailable (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1291) and the People had \u201cexercised reasonable diligence\u201d in trying to procure her trial attendance. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 240, subd. (a)(5).) Appellant contends the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">a. <em>Standard of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">In 1904 our Supreme Court stated due diligence was a question addressed to the discretion of the trial court and an appellate court would not \u201cinterfere\u201d in the determination unless that discretion had been abused. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewandowski </em>(1904) 143 Cal. 574, 576 [77 P. 467].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">This rule, abuse of discretion\u2014substantial evidence, became the settled standard of review for due diligence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cavazos </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 198, 200-201 [153 P.2d 177]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Enriquez </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 221, 235 [137 Cal.Rptr. 171, 561 P.2d 261, 3 A.L.R.4th 73]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 264, 311-312 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P.2d 149]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McDonald </em>(1944) 66 Cal.App.2d 504, 509 [152 P.2d 448]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Horn </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 1, 5 [36 Cal.Rptr. 898]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 71, 78 [80 Cal.Rptr. 648]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Benjamin </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 687, 698 [83 Cal.Rptr. 764]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 793, 797 [96 Cal.Rptr. 162]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 25, 32 [99 Cal.Rptr. 171]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ventura </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 784, 793 [220 Cal.Rptr. 269] [Second Dist., Div. Seven].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Then in 1986 Justice Mosk (with Justices Bird, Broussard, and Reynoso concurring) stated, \u201cit <em>appears . . . </em>due diligence ... is subject to independent review .... [but] <em>we need not resolve the issue </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Louis </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 969, 988-989 [232 Cal.Rptr. 110, 728 P.2d 180], italics added.) Justices Panelli and Lucas, in dissent, were unpersuaded \u201cwe should abandon or depart from our settled and long established standard of review . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 998.) Justice Grodin, concurring and dissenting, hedged. He was \u201cmore persuaded than Justice Panelli [who was not persuaded <em>at </em>all] that there <em>may </em>be merit in the majority\u2019s <em>suggestion </em>that. . . \u2018due diligence\u2019 is a question to be decided de novo by the appellate court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 995, italics added.) Justice Grodin was apparently <em>less </em>persuaded than Justice Mosk.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>Two years later, when the Supreme Court revisited Justice Mosk\u2019s dictum \u201csuggestion,\u201d Chief Justice Lucas wrote: \u201cWe have <em>held </em>that the question of due diligence is a factual one depending on the circumstances in each case, and that the trial court\u2019s determination of the issue will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing of an abuse of discretion <em>(People </em>v. <em>Enriquez </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 221, 235 [137 Cal.Rptr. 171, 561 P.2d 261 3 A.L.R.4th 73]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 311-312.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Louis </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 969, 984-989 [232 Cal.Rptr. 110, 728 P.2d 180], we <em>suggested </em>(but did not decide) that an appellate court should independently review the record on the due diligence issue.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 563 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776], italics added.) <em>Hovey </em>also stated the trial court\u2019s due diligence finding was \u201csupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\"><em>Hovey\u2019s </em>evisceration of the <em>Louis </em>dictum-suggestion was noted by the next Court of Appeal to consider the issue which stated: \u201cWe conclude, based on subsequent pronouncements of the California Supreme Court and a careful review of <em>Louis, </em>the traditional standard of review (i.e., \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019) remains the governing standard of review.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McElroy </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1415, 1425 [256 Cal.Rptr. 853] [Fourth Dist., Div. One].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Since <em>Hovey </em>and <em>McElroy, </em>every Court of Appeal, except one, which has taken a position,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has concluded that the appropriate \u201creasonable diligence\u201d review standard is abuse of discretion, not independent review. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1214 [268 Cal.Rptr. 686] [Second Dist., Div. One]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1004, 1006-1007 [272 Cal.Rptr. 219] [Fifth Dist.]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiterrez </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1624, 1641 [284 CaLRptr. 230] [First Dist., Div. Two]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1581, 1585 [277 Cal.Rptr. 504] [Sixth Dist.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The one is <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 446 [261 Cal.Rptr. 635] (Second Dist., Div. Six). Although <em>Watson </em>was decided after both <em>Hovey </em>and <em>McElroy </em>it failed to cite either. And although Louis\u2019s reference to an independent review standard for due diligence was merely a dictum-suggestion, this nuance apparently escaped <em>Watson. </em>The reference to a due diligence review standard in <em>Watson </em>entirely consists of the following sentence: \u201cIn reviewing the trial court\u2019s determination of the unavailability of a witness, the appellate court exercises its independent judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Louis, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 984-988.)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">As Justice Ortega observed, \u201cWe agree with <em>People </em>v. <em>McElroy </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1415 [256 Cal.Rptr. 853] which, after a lengthy analysis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>the <em>Louis </em>dicta and <em>Hovey </em>clarification <em>(id. </em>at pp. 1425-1426), concluded that \u2018the most recent Supreme Court guidance on this issue both reaffirmed the vitality of prior cases applying the \u201c \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d standard, and cautioned that any contrary analysis or suggestions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Louis, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 969 were dicta. We adhere to the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance, and therefore apply the abuse of discretion standard to this case.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1426.) Even were we free to endorse either rule, we would on policy grounds adopt the abuse of discretion standard for review of such rulings.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1214.) For these same reasons, we apply the abuse of discretion review standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">b. <em>Reasonable diligence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Appellant does not fault the prosecution for <em>what </em>it did in trying to locate and procure the attendance of Ms. Davidson. Appellant characterizes the effort as a \u201cflurry of activity.\u201d It is <em>when </em>the prosecution made its effort to locate Ms. Davidson that appellant faults. Accordingly, we consider whether or not the trial court abused it discretion in determining the prosecution began its search for Ms. Davidson at a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The trial court presided over this case from its March 26, 1992, arraignment through its September 1992 trial. It was intimately familiar with its own calendar, local subpoena custom and efficacy, the trial commitments and proclivities of counsel, the practicality or impracticality of witness surveillance, available law enforcement resources, the frequency or infrequency of fearful witnesses, and the significance of the pending suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The trial court was entitled to consider that on August 24,1992, eight days before trial, the originally assigned prosecutor caused subpoenas to be generated; that on August 25, 1992, a secretary sent those subpoenas to Detective Martinez; that receipt of the subpoenas was slightly delayed because Detective Martinez had recently changed his address; that on September 1, 1992, the suppression motion was denied; that on September 1, 1992, a search for Gwendolyn Davidson began; and that the search for her diligently continued until September 8, 1992, when her preliminary hearing testimony was offered and received into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">As noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Forgason </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 356, 363 [160 Cal.Rptr. 263]: \u201cIt is commonly known that trial dates in criminal cases are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>often tentative, with little likelihood that the trial will then commence. Competent and experienced trial lawyers will keep in touch on such matters with their prosecutorial adversary, and the court and its attaches, and plan accordingly. Here, for instance, trial dates were set, and reset, six times over a six-month period before Forgason\u2019s case finally came on for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In the instant case, the trial date was tentative due to the pendency of a suppression motion. (\u00a7 1538.5.) The hearing on the motion began June 26, 1992, but did not conclude until September 1,1992, when it was denied. The trial began that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">It was the pendency of this suppression motion \u201cthat changes the situation,\u201d the trial court stated. \u201cThis was a serious motion, and it had to be resolved pre-trial . . . .\u201d Normally, potentially dispositive pretrial motions are heard well before trial. But in this case the ruling was delayed until the trial date. It was this belated ruling which made uncertain the trial date. Had the motion been granted the People had 10 days in which to file a notice of intention to file a petition for a writ of mandate or prohibition. (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (o).) Had such a notice been filed the trial would have been continued. Had a writ petition been filed the continuance might have been protracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">As Justice Froehlich wisely observed: \u201cA determination of the reasonableness of efforts to procure attendance of a witness at trial cannot be assessed by reference to rigid rules of law; it depends upon analysis of practical human experience and contemporary community standards. For instance, an element to be evaluated is whether the search for the witness was \u2018timely begun.\u2019 [Citation.] The trial court, unlike the appellate court, is conversant with the general congestion of its docket, and with the obstacles which might delay the trial of a particular criminal case. Such \u2018delay\u2019 factors could influence the trial court\u2019s decision as to whether the subpoena process for a particular case was \u2018timely commenced.\u2019 However, the cold record which the appellate court would rely upon to conduct an independent review of \u2018due diligence\u2019 would rarely reflect such \u2018delay\u2019 factors and, hence, any appellate evaluation of \u2018timely commencement\u2019 would incorporate a propensity to disregard these practical realities. Additionally, trial courts have experience with local subpoena practice and procedure: what efforts are customary; are those customary procedures generally successful in securing witnesses\u2019 attendance; and were there exigencies in a particular case which required more, or which justified less, stringent efforts than normally employed? This familiarity with accepted local procedures will influence a trial court\u2019s determination of whether efforts undertaken in a particular case were \u2018reasonable under the circumstances.\u2019 The appellate court, which lacks access to or experience with such practical data, is ill-equipped to account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>for these factors when independently evaluating whether efforts in a particular case were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">\u201cThe deferential \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 standard properly assigns the trial court, with its reservoir of practical knowledge, the responsibility to evaluate the efforts in light of the circumstances and realities confronting prosecutors and law enforcement agencies.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McElroy, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d 1415, 1426-1427, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Although a witness search was begun shortly before or <em>during </em>trial, the following cases have upheld a trial court\u2019s finding of reasonable diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.3d 25 the first effort to procure a witness was made a week before trial. It consisted of sending a subpoena to authorities in San Francisco who might serve the witness at his Red Bluff address. The remainder of the effort was this: \u201cThe day prior to trial, teletypes had been sent to San Francisco to ascertain whether service had been effected. Efforts were made to locate [the witness] at his Red Bluff address and three telephone calls were made to San Francisco.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 32.) The reasonable diligence finding was upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 793 a district attorney investigator began trying to locate the witness on May 20, six days before the May 26 trial. The reasonable diligence finding was upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Benjamin, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d 687, 697 the search began four days before trial. The court stated, \u201cHere, although the People first knew on July 5 that the trial was set for July 29, they did not attempt to locate Guthrie until July 31, about four days before August 5, the date to which the trial had been postponed.\u201d The reasonable diligence finding was upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Linder </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 342 [96 Cal.Rptr. 26, 486 P.2d 1226], one day before trial, the defendant gave a deputy sheriff a subpoena for his former wife. The deputy sheriff could not effect service. Defendant\u2019s attorney also attempted to have \u201ca detective somebody\u201d try to locate her, to no avail. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 346.) Defendant\u2019s attorney also telephoned relatives of the witness, also to no avail. The trial court <em>excluded </em>the former wife\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony because reasonable diligence had not been established. <em>Linder </em>disagreed and reversed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 543 the search for defendant\u2019s former cellmate (Lee) almost certainly began <em>after </em>the trial had begun. Being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>a death penalty case begun in September 1981, counsel would have spent at least two weeks, probably much longer, selecting a jury. Next would have come opening statements, <em>in limine </em>motions, and other inevitable time-consuming matters. Further, from the court\u2019s factual description it appears that the prosecution called at least 10 witnesses before seeking to introduce Lee\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony (a detailed confession by defendant). As to when the prosecution began its search for Lee, <em>Hovey </em>only and carefully states: \u201cMore than one month <em>before Lee\u2019s trial testimony was </em>needed, investigators from the district attorney\u2019s office attempted to locate him.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 562, italics added.) The delay in starting the search for Lee is especially significant because two and one-half years had elapsed since Lee testified at the preliminary hearing. Yet <em>Hovey </em>upheld the trial court\u2019s reasonable diligence finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In our view, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding reasonable diligence had been exercised to procure the attendance of Gwendolyn Davidson. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wise, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th 339, 344; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, 226 </em>Cal.App.3d 1581, 1585-1587.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">2. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erroneously denied his suppression motion (\u00a7 1538.5).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Appellant moved to suppress the identification tetimony of Richard Calderon and Ms. Davidson as the product of his illegal detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">On September 12, 1991, six days after the murder, Officer Borunda arrested appellant on suspicion he had an outstanding traffic warrant. Appellant was transported to the police station where, upon further checking, Officer Borunda determined the traffic warrant was not for appellant. Officer Borunda took a photograph of appellant and that photograph (among a group of other photographs) was shown to and identified by Richard Calderon and Ms. Davidson.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">On August 31, 1992, when the trial court was shown a traffic warrant for a person similar to appellant, the trial court determined Officer Borunda had a reasonable, good faith belief that there had been an oustanding traffic warrant for appellant. The trial court denied the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">We apply the following standard of review and uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling: \u201cA proceeding under section 1538.5 to suppress evidence is a full hearing on the issues before the superior court sitting as finder of fact. [Citations.] The power to judge credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, weigh evidence and draw factual inferences, is vested in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>court. On appeal all presumptions favor proper exercise of that power, and the trial court\u2019s findings\u2014whether express or implied\u2014must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Keithley) (1975) 13 Cal.3d 406, 410 [118 Cal.Rptr. 617, 530 P.2d 585].) Our review is confined to the correctness or incorrectness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, not the reasons for its ruling. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 260, p. 267; see also <em>Philip Chang &amp; Sons Associates </em>v. <em>LaCasa Novato </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 159, 173 [222 Cal.Rptr. 800].)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">3. <em>Appellant contends the trial court improperly admitted \u201cgang\u201d evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">As appellant accurately notes, \u201cduring the course of the trial, evidence was elicited that appellant Saucedo had a nickname of \u2018Capone\u2019 and that he was a member of the M.C. Force Gang.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting this evidence, when defense counsel objected, and defense counsel was ineffective when he did not object to this evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">As the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-8\">\u201cLook how this crime occurred. It is a gang-related case, however you want to call it.
