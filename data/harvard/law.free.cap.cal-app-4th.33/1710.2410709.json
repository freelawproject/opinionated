The physician did not repeat the year. She filed an administrative claim in July 1993 and sued the chairman and the school in August 1993 for sex discrimination. The question before us is whether her action is barred by the applicable one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">We hold the suit is barred. The statute of limitations began to run on the physician\u2019s claims at the time the adverse employment decision was communicated to her, not when it took effect. <em>(Delaware State College </em>v. <em>Ricks </em>(1980) 449 U.S. 250 [66 L.Ed.2d 431, 101 S.Ct. 498].) The physician may not prolong the life of her causes of action absent some other discriminatory act taken against her within the limitations period. Nor may she resuscitate the causes of action by recharacterizing her termination as a resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">The University of California at San Diego (UCSD) offers a residency in general surgery, a five-year clinical training program after a student has graduated from medical school. Dr. Ellen Steinsapir (Steinsapir) attended medical school at UCSD from 1985 to 1989. She began a residency in general surgery at UCSD in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">Steinsapir asserts, at the end of medical school in 1988, the UCSD chair of Surgery, Dr. Abdool Moossa (Moossa), was late providing a recommendation for her application to the residency program because he had a practice of delaying letters for women seeking surgery placements. Steinsapir adds, before starting her residency, she went to dinner with Moossa and several female students and listened as Moossa expressed his view women should not become surgeons because it interfered with their more important roles as wives and mothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">Steinsapir maintains, in the fall of 1989, Moossa brushed against her breasts while they were performing surgery. As Steinsapir describes it, Moossa ordered her to stand next to him in the operating room, rubbed his elbow against her breast and, when she moved away, Moossa directed her to \u201clean forward,\u201d adding, \u201cSurgery is a contact sport.\u201d When Steinsapir told him she did not want that kind of \u201ccontact,\u201d Moossa began rapping her knuckles with the surgical instruments as he passed them to the scrub nurse. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1714\">*1714</page-number>Moossa did not make physical contact with Steinsapir on any other occasion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">In March 1992, Moossa informed Steinsapir her performance was unsatisfactory and she would have to repeat her third year or leave the program. Moossa confirmed the conversation in a letter dated April 27, 1992, which stated Steinsapir would not be promoted to the fourth year and added: \u201cI have no objection if you spend the next academic year working in the laboratory with the plastic surgeons. However, if you return to the general surgery program following this elective year, you will have to repeat the third year of your general surgery training.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">At no time after receiving the letter did Steinsapir ever contact Moossa to see if he would reverse his decision that she repeat her third clinical year. Nor was she ever advised by anyone that Moossa had changed his mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">Instead of repeating her third year, Steinsapir worked in the laboratory the next academic year (July 1992-June 1993) as indicated in Moossa\u2019s letter. Midway through the year, in January 1993, Steinsapir testified before a committee of surgeons evaluating Moossa\u2019s reappointment as chair of surgery for another five years. Steinsapir told the committee about the incident in the operating room in 1989 but complains there was no further investigation. Although the committee recommended Moossa not be reappointed as chair, the chancellor nevertheless reappointed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">Steinsapir left the residency program on June 30, 1993, when the academic year ended rather than repeat her third year. On July 12, 1993, she filed a claim with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (Department) and requested a right to sue letter. Steinsapir filed suit against Moossa and the Regents on August 23, 1993. Her complaint presently contains causes of action for (1) sexual harassment (Gov. Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 12940, subds. (a), (h)); (2) sex discrimination (\u00a7 12940, subds. (a), (h)); (3) failure to prevent discrimination and harassment (\u00a7 12940, subd. (i)); (4) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (5) tortious constructive discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1715\">*1715</page-number>from employment due to discrimination and harassment; (6) negligent retention; and (7) injunctive and declaratory relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Moossa and the Regents moved for summary judgment, asserting the claims were barred by one-year statutes of limitations. The trial court denied the motion. On the statutory Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) causes of action (sexual harassment, sex discrimination, failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, and injunctive and declaratory relief), the trial court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s argument that plaintiff\u2019s claims are barred fails as a matter of law fails under the continuing violation doctrine as set forth in <em>Accardi </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 341 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 292]; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Department of Rehabilitation </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1271 [261 Cal.Rptr. 204]; <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Commission </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 976 [236 Cal.Rptr. 716] and <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc., </em>665 F.2d 918 (1982 9th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">\u201cThere is a triable issue of material fact as to whether the enforcement of the repeat requirement for plaintiff in June of 1993 was an act in furtherance of a policy or practice of sex discrimination. If so, the alleged course of conduct would remain actionable \u2018even if some or all of the events evidencing its inception occurred prior to the limitations period.\u2019 <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>191 Cal.App.3d at 983; <em>Accardi, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at 351.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">As to the common law termination causes of action (wrongful discharge in violation of public policy and tortious constructive discharge), the court added: \u201cDefendants have rejected plaintiff\u2019s asserted reasons for deciding to \u2018weather the storm.\u2019 [f| However, under <em>Turner [Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238 (32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022)], the reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s decision to wait governs both the merits of the claim for constructive discharge and the effective outer limit beyond which plaintiff may claim constructive discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">Finally, the trial court dealt with the cause of action for negligently retaining Moossa when the Regents allegedly knew he engaged in inappropriate conduct toward women, stating: \u201cHaving found a triable issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff was harmed by the acts of defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1716\">*1716</page-number>Moossa after the commencement of the statute of limitations period, the cause of action for negligent retention against the Regents is not time barred as a matter of law.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">Moossa and the Regents (collectively defendants) filed petitions for writ of mandate challenging the ruling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We issued an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">All of Steinsapir\u2019s causes of action are subject to a one-year statute of limitations. A person who files suit for sex discrimination under FEHA must file a claim with the Department within one year from the date the alleged act of discrimination occurred. (\u00a7 12960.) Steinsapir concedes wrongful termination in violation of public policy is a tort action governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3) which requires suit within one year.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As such, the only question before us on this petition is when the cause of action accrues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">\n<em>Statutory Causes of Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">Defendants argue the statute of limitations begins to run on FEHA claims when the adverse employment decision is communicated to plaintiff, not when it takes effect. <em>(Delaware State College </em>v. <em>Ricks, supra, </em>449 U.S. 250.) In line with <em>Ricks, </em>they contend the FEHA causes of action are barred because Steinsapir was informed in April 1992 that she would have to repeat her third clinical year to stay on the program\u2014i.e., she was notified more than a year before she filed her administrative claim in July 1993 and/or complaint in August 1993. Defendants add where, as here, the sexual harassment involving Steinsapir occurred in 1989, she had no contact with Moossa after receiving the April 1992 letter and she alleges no further acts of discrimination, the continuing violation doctrine does not make the course of conduct actionable because none of the events occurred within the limitations period. <em>(Accardi </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 341, 345 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 292].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1717\">*1717</page-number>Steinsapir counters by attempting to bring herself within the discriminatory promotion cases, specifically <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1043, 1053 [282 Cal.Rptr. 726], and <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 976, 983 [236 Cal.Rptr. 716], applying the continuing violation doctrine to allow suit if there is a \u201cpolicy of discrimination\u201d even though some events occurred outside the limitations period. Steinsapir chides defendants for \u201cmisciting\u201d <em>Accardi </em>v. <em>Supreme Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th 341, which she reads as eliminating any need for a violation in the limitations period where a discriminatory promotion policy is involved. She also attempts to distinguish <em>Delaware State College </em>v. <em>Ricks, supra, </em>449 U.S. 250, pointing out the case does not involve discriminatory promotional practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">In <em>Delaware State College </em>v. <em>Ricks, supra, </em>449 U.S. 250, a faculty member alleged the college denied him tenure on the basis of racial discrimination. Although the college had a policy of offering a professor who did not receive tenure a contract for one additional year rather than discharging him immediately, the Supreme Court held the limitations period for title VII and Civil Rights Acts claims began to run at the time that the tenure decision was made and communicated to the teacher. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 257-258 [66 L.Ed.2d at p. 439].) Even though the actual loss of job came later, the court determined: \u201c \u2018[T]he proper focus is upon the time of the <em>discriminatory acts, </em>not upon the time at which the <em>consequences </em>of the acts became most painful.\u2019 [Citations.] It is simply insufficient for Ricks to allege that his termination \u2018gives present effect to the past illegal act and therefore perpetuates the consequences of forbidden discrimination.\u2019 [Citation.] The emphasis is not upon the effects of earlier employment decisions; rather, it \u2018is [upon] whether any present <em>violation </em>exists.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 258 [66 L.Ed.2d at p. 440], original italics.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">We believe the situation here is analogous to the failure to qualify for tenure in <em>Ricks. </em>Steinsapir failed to qualify for fourth year residency and her employment at UCSD was scheduled to end at the close of the next academic year if Steinsapir did not repeat her third year: termination of employment was a \u201cdelayed, but inevitable, consequence\u201d of not graduating from\u2014and not repeating a year in\u2014the residency program. <em>(Delaware State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1718\">*1718</page-number><em>College </em>v. <em>Ricks, supra, </em>449 U.S. at p. 258 [66 L.Ed.2d at pp. 439-440].) The statute thus began to run at the time Steinsapir received notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\"><em>Accardi </em>is not of much help to Steinsapir in revitalizing her causes of action. The opinion may mouth words from the discriminatory promotion cases\u2014i.e., \u201ca . . . \u2018systematic policy of discrimination is actionable even if some or all of the events evidencing its inception occurred prior to the limitations period\u2019 \u201d <em>(Accardi </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 349, citing <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Department of Rehabilitation </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1271, 1290-1291 [261 Cal.Rptr. 204])\u2014but, contrary to Steinsapir\u2019s interpretation, the case still requires discriminatory practices within the limitations period. The <em>Accardi </em>court read the complaint to allege a pattern of conduct creating a hostile work environment\u2014conduct that began 10 years ago and <em>extended </em>into the limitations period.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, the court expressly held \u201c[a] claim for sexual harassment is not time-barred when there are continuous acts of discrimination over a period of time <em>provided that some of those acts fall within the limitations period.\u201d (Accardi </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 345, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">We also find Steinsapir\u2019s attempt to come within <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d 1043, and <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d 976, unavailing. In <em>Valdez, </em>plaintiff asserted the city\u2019s use of rankings on an oral examination for determining eligibility for promotions was discriminatory toward Hispanic police officers. Similarly, <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>concerned use of an allegedly discriminatory written examination for determining firefighter promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">Steinsapir\u2019s case is \u201ca square peg\u201d in the \u201cround hole\u201d of the discriminatory promotion cases. Steinsapir may be a salaried employee of UCSD but, unlike the employees in <em>Valdez </em>or <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>her \u201cemployment\u201d is more accurately a five-year \u201ctraining school.\u201d In further contrast to <em>Valdez </em>or <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>Steinsapir is not challenging a formalized testing procedure as discriminatory to women or contesting her placement on an eligibility list for promotions: she is not complaining about a \u201cpromotion\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the ordinary sense of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">Unlike the promotions at issue in <em>Valdez </em>or <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>Steinsapir did not have the choice of climbing the employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1719\">*1719</page-number>ladder or remaining in her old job: she could not keep her old position. Steinsapir failed her third year and had to repeat it or she would be terminated in another year like the professor in <em>Ricks </em>who failed to get tenure and would be terminated a year later. Steinsapir stated she had been \u201cterminated\u201d from the residency program in the FEHA claim filed with the Department. She called the personnel action a \u201ctermination\u201d in her complaint. We see no reason to depart from this characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">We are not finished with the analysis until we evaluate, in contrast to <em>Ricks </em>where the Supreme Court rejected the continuing violation argument because the professor had not alleged discrete discriminatory acts which continued until the actual termination of his employment, whether Steinsapir has identified such acts. <em>(Delaware State College </em>v. <em>Ricks, supra, </em>449 U.S. at p. 257 [66 L.Ed.2d at p. 439].) Steinsapir charges: (1) during her year in the lab, she told several faculty members she wanted to be promoted but was repeatedly refused promotion; (2) Moossa\u2019s receipt of progress reports on Steinsapir from the head of the lab where she was working indicates Moossa was gathering evidence to support his discriminatory practices; and (3) UCSD failed to take action against Moossa. Steinsapir also suggests the differential between men and women who were not promoted (which she maintains is 13.5 percent and 44.4 percent, respectively) during the 1983-1993 period Moossa chaired the surgery department shows a \u201cpolicy of discrimination\u201d which violated her rights because other residents advanced to their fourth year on July 1, 1993, and she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">Unfortunately, none of these purportedly discriminatory acts qualifies. There is no evidence of repeated refusals to promote Steinsapir.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The references to which we have been directed fail to show any request by Steinsapir to be promoted to her fourth year. To the contrary, they amount to little more than missed phone calls during Steinsapir\u2019s last days on the job.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">As far as Steinsapir\u2019s other arguments are concerned, we note, aside from the pure speculation that Moossa was gathering evidence on Steinsapir, the lab progress reports were not raised below and are not properly before us. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1720\">*1720</page-number>The alleged failure to act is no different from the negligent retention cause of action, discussed <em>post. </em>Finally, with respect to the statistical variation for male and female repeaters, there is no evidence in the record what rate was in effect during the limitations period or whether the difference, if any, was in fact gender related.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">In short, Steinsapir has not presented cognizable evidence of discriminatory acts continuing into the limitations period. We are left with only one act in the limitations period\u2014implementation of the decision which was made and communicated to Steinsapir in April 1992\u2014but no present violation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">\n<em>Common Law Termination Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">Before discussing the arguments in this section, we set out our understanding of the wrongful termination claims in this case. Steinsapir had a cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy from the inception of the suit: essentially restating the statutory causes of action, she alleges defendants violated public policy by terminating her employment because she was a woman and would not submit to Moossa\u2019s physical and verbal harassment of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">Steinsapir also belatedly inserted a constructive discharge claim in the action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Her cause of action alleges: (1) in spring 1992, defendants informed Steinsapir they would not let her continue in the surgery program unless she repeated her third year; (2) defendants imposed this requirement to sexually discriminate against Steinsapir and make her work environment so intolerable she would resign; (3) Steinsapir worked in the lab from June 1992 to June 1993 but not as a resident; and (4) even if she had received a written offer of employment as a resident, Steinsapir would not have accepted it because the discrimination and harassment created such an offensive working atmosphere that a reasonable woman would have resigned from the residency program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">Moving from the complaint to the summary judgment motion, Steinsapir shifted gears slightly and argued, under <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 1238, she was constructively discharged on the date she resigned (June 30, 1993). Steinsapir added that <em>Turner </em>makes a factual issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1721\">*1721</page-number>of the question whether it was reasonable for her to postpone her resignation from the residency program for more than a year on the basis that Moossa was being reevaluated in early 1993 and her feeling he might not be reappointed or his decision might be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">In their petition, defendants take the position the trial court improperly applied <em>Turner </em>to create an issue of fact on the common law termination causes of action where none existed. They point out, in <em>Turner, </em>there was no wrongful termination cause of action, no statute of limitations issue and no express statement the statute begins to run when the employee resigns. Steinsapir counters that defendants conceded her wrongful termination in violation of public policy cause of action encompassed a claim for constructive discharge, the rule that the statute starts running on the date the employee resigns is implicit in the holding in <em>Turner </em>and where, as here, suit was filed two months after she resigned, her constructive discharge claims are timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">First, we turn to <em>Turner, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 1238. Briefly summarized, in <em>Turner, </em>the employee resigned his job and sued for constructive discharge, alleging he was forced to quit because he had been subjected to intolerable conditions after he complained about allegedly illegal conduct. Notably, the employee\u2019s reports of illegal activity preceded his resignation by four years. Although the Supreme Court found no merit in the constructive discharge allegations, it nevertheless refused to endorse a rule that would set the statute of limitations as an \u201couter limit\u201d beyond which an employee may not remain on the job after the onset of intolerable conditions and still be able to sue for constructive discharge. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">We agree that <em>Turner </em>has no direct application to the facts here: the case does not tell us when the statute of limitations begins to run. Further, as defendants point out, in light of the employee\u2019s contention that one \u201cintolerable condition\u201d was he received a negative performance review a week before he resigned, <em>Turner </em>can hardly be said to eliminate the requirement that an employee demonstrate he was subjected to intolerable conditions within the limitations period. <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 1238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\"><em>Turner </em>is more properly concerned with how events which occur after the onset of the allegedly intolerable conditions might be considered in evaluating whether the employee was forced to resign. As the court explained: \u201cAlthough we agree with <em>Panopulos [Panopulos </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 660 (264 Cal.Rptr. 810)] that there is an \u2018outer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1722\">*1722</page-number>limit\u2019 beyond which an employee cannot remain on the job after intolerable conditions arise and still claim constructive discharge, reliance on the applicable limitations period to define that limit is unduly arbitrary. Consistent with our discussion . . . above, the relevant question is what a reasonable employee would have done under the circumstances. The length of time the plaintiff remained on the job may be <em>one </em>relevant factor in determining the intolerability of employment conditions from the standpoint of a reasonable person. Neither logic nor precedent suggests it should always be dispositive. [Citation.] Insofar as it prescribes the statute of limitations as an outer limit on an employee\u2019s decision to \u2018weather the storm,\u2019 we disapprove <em>Panopulos.\u201d (Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1254, original italics, fn. omitted.) We add, considering the court\u2019s staunch refusal to adhere to so \u201cunduly arbitrary\u201d a benchmark as a statute of limitations to define the \u201couter limit\u201d on a claim, we believe the court would be disinclined to endorse such an equally arbitrary date\u2014and notably one solely within the employee\u2019s control\u2014as the date of resignation for the start of a constructive discharge claim. As such, we reject Steinsapir\u2019s argument that <em>Turner </em>implicitly compels the conclusion the statute did not begin to run until she resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">We also have difficulty with the concept of constructive discharge in this case. When we examine Steinsapir\u2019s constructive discharge claims under the microscope, they take on the classic proportions of an employer firing an employee and the employee insisting, \u201cYou can\u2019t fire me because I quit.\u201d Constructive discharge must be something more than semantics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">As <em>Turner </em>describes it, \u201cConstructive discharge occurs when the employer\u2019s conduct effectively forces an employee to resign.\u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, 7 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1244.) It \u201cconverts] what is ostensibly a voluntary quit into a discharge . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1245.) For such a conversion, \u201c. . . \u2018the adverse working conditions must be so intolerable that any reasonable employee would resign rather than endure [them].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>atp. 1247, quoting <em>Slack </em>v. <em>Kanawha County Housing </em>(1992) 188 W.Va. 144 [423 S.E.2d 547, 556].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">If constructive discharge means adverse working conditions are so intolerable any reasonable employee would resign rather than endure them, Steinsapir was not constructively discharged. As Steinsapir conceded in both her brief below and her response to the petition, she was not exposed to adverse conditions working in the lab at the time she resigned on June 30, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">Nor can we accept the notion that Steinsapir was \u201cconstructively discharged\u201d in June 1993 by virtue of postponing her \u201cresignation\u201d from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1723\">*1723</page-number>residency program for more than a year after Moossa informed her she would be \u201cterminated.\u201d Moossa did not give Steinsapir a choice in the matter: he told her in April 1992 she would have to repeat her third year to stay on as a resident. Steinsapir\u2019s recently added constructive discharge cause of action acknowledges as much: it states that Steinsapir received notice in 1992 \u201c[defendants] would not permit her to continue\u201d the program unless she repeated the year, and \u201c[fjrom June 1992 to June 1993, [Steinsapir] worked in a laboratory, and <em>not as a </em>resident. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">Clearly, Steinsapir was terminated. She may not bypass the effect of an \u201cexpress termination\u201d by characterizing it as a \u201cconstructive discharge\u201d or \u201cresignation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">\n<em>Negligent Retention Cause of Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">As noted above, the trial court found the negligent retention cause of action viable based on the conclusion Steinsapir was harmed by the acts of Moossa after the start of the limitations period. Having determined the only act within the limitations period was implementation of the April 1992 decision, but there was no present violation, we hold there is no basis for the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate its order of October 7, 1994, denying summary judgment, and enter an order consistent with this opinion. The stay order issued on November 28, 1994, is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-10\">Work, Acting P. J., and Froehlich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 8,1995, and the petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme was denied July 20, 1995.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">Although Steinsapir also asserts that Moossa made disparaging remarks about women to other residency program applicants, subjected pregnant residents to disparate treatment and harassed other women at various times, these incidents were not directed at Steinsapir and may not be considered. (See <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>San Pedro Peninsula Hospital </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 611-613 [262 Cal.Rptr. 842].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">All statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">In August 1994, after the motion for summary judgment was filed, Steinsapir dismissed six causes of action: two were for alleged retaliation against Steinsapir for testifying before the committee; the other four were battery and emotional distress claims. At approximately the same time, Steinsapir also amended her complaint to add a cause of action for constructive discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1098-10\">We consolidated the two petitions for writ of mandate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1098-11\">It appears to be an open question whether a one-year statute (Code Civ.
