Upon a trial before a jury he was given a term of fifteen days in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\">There are no bills of exceptions in the record, and the statement of facts clearly substantiate the allegations in the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Appellant is exercised over the failure of the county attorney to read the complaint to the jury, although he had previously read the information to such jury.
