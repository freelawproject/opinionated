In the first place, the record before us shows that some procedure was had in the county in vacation. This appears to be a motion in arrest of judgment which was not presented at the time and manner provided by law \u2014 Article 2232 Vernon\u2019s Ann. Civ. S. with annotations. Again it is shown that the record was mailed to this court by the attorney representing the appellant. This court will receive records only from the clerk of the trial court, consequently the case is not properly before us for consideration \u2014 Vernon\u2019s Ann. C. C. P. Art. 843 and annotations thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">The State has filed motion to dismiss the appeal which, for the foregoing reasons, will be granted. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
