They found the address of a friend in Knoxville, Tennessee, and correctly surmised that he had gone there.

He was returned to Texas and made a voluntary confession which, as stated, comports with the physical facts revealed by the discovery of Dype\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Appellant did not testify and offered no evidence in his case.
