It will be noted that it was charged in the information, which followed the language of the complaint, that on or about the 1st day of May, 1943, appellant, in the County of San Patricio and State of Texas, did act as an employment or labor agent, etc., without stating any act which he did that would bring him within the scope or category of such employment agency. The averment that he acted as an employment or labor agent was but the statement of a conclusion and not a fact. The pleader should have gone further and stated the act or acts which the accused did so that he would be apprised of the nature of the accusation against him, otherwise-he would not know what he would be required to meet upon his trial. Article 414, C. C. P., requires that the offense be set forth in the information in plain and intelligible words. The rules relating to allegations in indictments .and the certainty required are also applicable to informations. See Weinberger v. State, 131 Tex. Cr. R. 308; Reeves v. State, 162 S. W. (2d) 705; Jennings v. State, 88 Tex. Cr. R. 640; Cremillion v. State, 131 Tex. Cr. R. 492; Middleton v. State, 114 Tex. Cr. R. 263, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">For the error herein pointed out, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
