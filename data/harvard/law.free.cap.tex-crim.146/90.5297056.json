In such an absence we are unable to say whether there was error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to charge on certain omissions complained of by appellant in his objections to the court\u2019s charge. As we are able to view such charge, the same appears to be a proper charge under the allegations in the indictment, and without a statement of facts we can go no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-18\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
