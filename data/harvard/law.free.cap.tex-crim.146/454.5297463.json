However, to rebut appellant\u2019s testimony, and especially that part relative to previous notice of the day of trial, the county judge before whom the case was being tried testified: \u201cthat he had just talked to Brink Poore of Bridgeport, Texas over the telephone long distance and that Brink Poore told him in such conversation that he had informed the defendant that his case was set for trial a week before the date same was tried, and that what the defendant said about not being informed it was set was not true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Appellant objected to this testimony for the reason, among others, that same was hearsay. That the testimony was hearsay is not debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">We note also that the bill of exception presenting this matter certifies that the county judge, in giving this testimony, was not sworn as a witness. A judge presiding at a trial may testify as a witness in the case; but, to be eligible to do so, he must be sworn as any other witness. Valentine v. State, 6 Tex. App. 439; 44 Tex. Jur. 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">For the errors pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
