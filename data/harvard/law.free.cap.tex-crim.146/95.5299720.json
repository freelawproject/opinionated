The right of an accused to be relieved of an invalid judgment in a criminal case in this State is by appeal to this court, where allowed, or by resort to the writ of habeas corpus. Moreover, the order overruling the motion is not such a final judgment in a criminal case of which this court has jurisdiction upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
