(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 583.310.) Plaintiff contends that the five-year statute was tolled by two separate periods during the pendency of the case, and that the trial court therefore erred in concluding the five-year statute had run. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Plaintiff is in the business of making and installing cabinets. As an employer, plaintiff is required to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Plaintiff purchased its workers\u2019 compensation insurance from defendant and respondent State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">SCIF is a \u201cpublic enterprise fund created for the purpose of transacting workers\u2019 compensation insurance. (Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11770, 11773.) It was established to ensure that affordable workers\u2019 compensation insurance would be available to employers when coverage became mandatory. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Tudor Ranches, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1425 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 574].) Under the statutory scheme, SCIF is intended to be competitive with other insurers, and to be \u201cself-supporting,\u201d but it is not intended to accumulate and hold assets over and above the amounts needed for liabilities, necessary reserves, and a reasonable surplus. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11775.) Otherwise, the statutory scheme provides for SCIF to return excess moneys to its insureds as a dividend or credit. The amount of reserves affects the insured\u2019s premiums and dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">On December 23, 1991, plaintiff filed an action against SCIF, alleging that SCIF had employed improper practices concerning the reserves on plaintiffs account, adversely affecting plaintiff\u2019s premiums and dividends. Numerous other employer-insureds had also filed similar lawsuits against SCIF. (See, e.g., <em>Tudor Ranches, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 1422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">On May 9, 1994, SCIF filed a petition for coordination of plaintiff\u2019s action and several other lawsuits alleging similar misconduct by SCIF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>concerning the insureds\u2019 accounts. The coordination judge denied SCIF\u2019s petition for coordination on July 6, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">On March 15, 1995, Judge Kaiser was assigned as the trial judge. On April 12, 1995, Judge Kaiser scheduled a trial management conference for January 12, 1996, and set the trial date for January 16, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">On December 15, 1995, counsel for both sides appeared before Judge Kaiser to argue SCIF\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of some of the causes of action in plaintiff\u2019s complaint. After hearing on the motion, plaintiff\u2019s counsel inquired \u201cas to what\u2019s going to happen to our trial date. I understand [the court is] engaged [in trial] . . . .\u201d Judge Kaiser indicated, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to try to get it out. If not, it will be transferred to another judge, because in February I have a different assignment. . . . The case that I\u2019m presently trying, they\u2019ve indicated they have a couple more weeks. If it\u2019s only a couple more weeks, we should be close to the 16th. If it goes longer than that, I\u2019ll have to transfer it, but I\u2019d like to get it out because it\u2019s a four-year case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Ultimately, Judge Kaiser apparently was unable to complete the case he was already trying in time for the scheduled trial date in plaintiff\u2019s case. Accordingly, on December 29, 1995, Judge Kaiser issued a minute order on the court\u2019s own motion, reassigning plaintiff\u2019s case for trial \u201cdue to the fact this Court is currently in trial and will be in trial during the starting date set for trial in this matter. The Trial Management Conference set on 1-12-96 and jury trial on 1-16-96 are vacated. . . . [\u00b6] Case re-assigned to Honorable Commissioner Gloria Connor Trask in Dept. 02 for Trial. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">On February 22, 1996, Commissioner Trask set another trial date, May 20, 1996. However, in April of 1996, the parties were in disagreement over discovery matters, namely, the deposition of plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, Samuel Smith (Smith).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 25, 1996, SCIF brought a motion for an order shortening time on a motion to compel Smith to produce insurance company manuals he had reviewed and to complete his deposition. SCIF\u2019s counsel proposed that a shortened briefing schedule on the motion to compel might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>not be necessary \u201cif your Honor doesn\u2019t hold us to the May 20th trial date. . . .\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem with continuing the trial date to allow enough time for a notice motion[,] just, you know, ten days, fifteen days, whatever it is. [\u00b6] . . . [W]e would only request a very brief continuance just to allow this noticed motion to be heard.\u201d SCIF\u2019s counsel suggested continuing the matter for 30 days, to June 30, 1996. The court inquired whether \u201ceveryone here . . . can agree that this matter isn\u2019t ready to proceed to trial on May 20th?\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not reply audibly, but neither did he object. The trial court ordered, \u201cThe trial date will be vacated. I can\u2019t promise you when it will be put back on.\u201d Again, plaintiff\u2019s counsel voiced no objection to the court\u2019s statement. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked whether the court would give notice of a new trial date; the court stated that, after the hearing on SCIF\u2019s motion to compel, set for May 28, \u201cthen we can reset the trial date if in fact it\u2019s ready.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">On May 28, 1996, the court heard SCIF\u2019s motion to compel Smith to produce the manuals at his deposition. The court granted SCIF\u2019s motion and ordered Smith to produce the documents. After ruling on the motion, the court held a status conference. As SCIF had not yet fully deposed Smith, SCIF was not ready for trial. SCIF requested another status conference in 60 days. The court set a new status conference date of July 29, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">At the status conference on July 29, 1996, SCIF informed the court that it intended to bring a number of motions <em>in limine. </em>The court discussed setting a date in November of 1996 for hearing on the motions <em>in limine. </em>Plaintiff\u2019s counsel was concerned about the late date for the hearing on the motions <em>in limine: </em>\u201cThe only concern I have, the five-year statute, as I understand it, runs on December 11th [sic]. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . If you want to set it in November\u2014That\u2019s my concern, if we set a trial date in conjunction with that, I guess.\u201d SCIF\u2019s counsel was also concerned that, if the motions <em>in limine </em>were heard in November, SCIF would not be able to depose Smith until after the hearing. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel suggested setting hearing for motions <em>in limine </em>and any hearing concerning the Smith\u2019s deposition for the same day, and requested a date in September. The court set September 27 for hearing on the motions <em>in limine, </em>and on any motion concerning Smith\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On September 27, 1996, the court ruled on motions <em>in limine </em>brought by each party. Among other things, the court ruled that Smith\u2019s testimony would be excluded at trial, apparently for failure to produce all the insurance manuals at his deposition. At that point, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the court to set a trial date. The parties estimated five weeks for trial. The court tentatively suggested setting the trial for March. SCIF\u2019s counsel said, \u201cThat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>month is clear for us, Your Honor.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel concurred: \u201cSame with Plaintiff.\u201d The court set March 3, 1997, as the date for trial. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel voiced no objection to the proposed March trial date at the September 27 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">On December 3, 1996, plaintiff filed an ex parte application to shorten time on a motion to specially set the matter for trial. The court ordered a hearing for December 6, 1996, to consider the motion to specially set the matter for trial. On December 6, 1996, the court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Plaintiff filed a request for stay and a petition for writ of mandate with this court on December 10, 1996; this court summarily denied the petition on December 20, 1996. <em>(Gordon\u2019s Cabinet Shop </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Dec. 20, 1996) E019522 [nonpub.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On January 9, 1997, the trial court granted SCIF\u2019s motion to dismiss the suit for failure to bring it'to trial within five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">After entry of the judgment of dismissal, SCIF moved the court for an award of attorney fees and costs, in part under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.1, permitting recovery of attorney fees and costs against a party who has refused a settlement offer under Code of Civil Procedure section 998, and then failed to obtain a more favorable judgment at trial. The trial court awarded SCIF $82,267.19 in costs and attorney fees against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Plaintiff appealed both the original judgment of dismissal and the amendment to the judgment adding the award of fees and costs to SCIF. This court ordered the two appeals consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">I. <em>The Coordination Petition Did Not Toll the Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">The resolution of the question of tolling while the coordination petition was pending concerns the construction of statutory matter (e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1514).  As to pure questions of law, such as procedural matters or interpretations of rules or statutes, we exercise our independent judgment. <em>(Bostean </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(1998) 63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Cal.App.4th 95, 107-108 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 523]; <em>Mohilef v. Janovici </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 267, 285 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 721].)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">B. <em>Rule 1514 Tolls the Five-year Statute Only When a Stay Has Been Granted in a Coordination Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">California Rules of Court, rule 1510 et seq., deals with procedural rules for coordination proceedings. SCIF here applied for coordination, as a number of its insureds had filed similar lawsuits alleging overaccumulation of reserves. Ultimately, the judge ruling on the coordination motion denied SCIF\u2019s petition in this case. At no time did plaintiff, or any other party, apply for or obtain a stay order while the coordination petition was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">California Rules of Court, rule 1514 concerns stay orders in coordination proceedings. The text of the rule is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For our purposes, the critical provisions are rule 1514(d) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Plaintiff points out that the five-year statute provides that it shall be tolled whenever \u201c[t]he jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 583.340, subd. (a).) Plaintiff urges in turn that California Rules of Court, rule 1514(d) operated to suspend the jurisdiction of the trial court to try the action while the coordination application was pending. That is, rule 1514(d), provides: \u201cIn the absence of a stay order, a court receiving an order assigning a coordination motion judge may continue to exercise jurisdiction over the included action for purposes of all pretrial and discovery proceedings, <em>but no trial shall be commenced </em>and no judgment shall be entered in that action unless trial of the action had commenced prior to the assignment of the coordination motion judge.\u201d (Italics added.) Focusing exclusively on the italicized language quoted above, plaintiff suggests that the rule\u2019s provision that trial shall not be commenced while the petition is pending is the equivalent of a suspension of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to try the action, within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.340.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">We do not agree. California Rules of Court, rule 1514(f) expressly states that, \u201cThe time during which any <em>stay of proceedings </em>is <em>in effect pursuant to these rules </em>shall not be included in determining whether the action stayed, should be dismissed for lack of prosecution . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, in the rule concerning stay orders for coordination proceedings, express provision is made to toll the five-year statute <em>when a stay is granted. </em>By implication, no tolling should be imputed to coordination proceedings unless a stay is granted. No stay was ever issued in connection with SCIF\u2019s petition for coordination. Rule 1514(d) by its terms applies only \u201cIn the <em>absence </em>of a stay order.\u201d (Italics added.) It would be absurd to hold that the five-year statute is tolled only when a stay has been granted, but nevertheless to hold that the statute is also tolled under a provision that applies only in the absence of a stay order.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Moreover, we do not believe that California Rules of Court, rule 1514(d) operated to suspend the <em>jurisdiction </em>of the court to try the case in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>fundamental sense. Indeed, rule 1514(d) expressly states that the trial court \u201cmay continue to <em>exercise jurisdiction </em>over the included action for purposes of all pretrial and discovery proceedings.\u201d (Italics added.) In addition, if a trial has already begun, the trial court may proceed to try the case even while the coordination petition is pending. Thus, a coordination petition does not preclude the parties from diligently preparing the case for trial, if it is not yet ready to be tried, and nothing in a coordination petition necessarily divests the trial court of the power to try the case if trial has already begun. We therefore do not perceive any manner in which the filing of a coordination petition divests the trial court of fundamental jurisdiction over the subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Plaintiff cites <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1000 [246 Cal.Rptr. 521], in support of its argument that California Rules of Court, rule 1514(d) operates as a suspension of the jurisdiction of the trial court to \u201ctry\u201d an action. <em>Bank of America </em>is not controlling on this point. First, as the <em>Bank of America </em>court noted, \u201crule 1514(f) provides, by clear implication, that <em>where no stay has been issued in the coordination proceedings, </em>the statutory five-year rule applies to the coordinated actions.\u201d <em>(Bank of America </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 1010, italics added.) Second, the <em>Bank of America </em>parties \u201cconcede[d] that the period while the petition for coordination was pending may be excluded under rule 1514(d) . . . .\u201d (200 Cal.App.3d at p. 1011.) SCIF made no such concession here. Third, to the extent the <em>Bank of America </em>court purported to hold that the provision of rule 1514(d), precluding the commencement of a trial while the coordination petition was pending acted as a suspension of jurisdiction to try the case, or made it impossible, impracticable or futile to bring the case to trial, its pronouncements in that regard were dicta. The ultimate result in <em>Bank of America </em>was that the Court of Appeal ordered the trial court to vacate its order specially setting the case for trial, and directed the trial court to enter an order dismissing the case for failure to prosecute within five years. (200 Cal.App.3d at p. 1016.) Even if the <em>Bank of America </em>court considered the five-year statute tolled during the pendency of a coordination petition, under rule 1514(d), the action was still untimely. Thus, the <em>Bank of America </em>court\u2019s construction of rule 1514(d) has no precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In light of the express provision in California Rules of Court, rule 1514(f), that only that time when a stay has actually been granted is excluded from the time in which a case must be brought to trial, we hold that the coordination petition did not operate to toll the five-year statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>H.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Hollenhorst, Acting P. J., and McKinster, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The gist of the discovery problem was that Smith, in forming his opinion, apparently intended to rely on claims procedures manuals of numerous insurance companies. SCIF\u2019s notice of deposition asked Smith to produce all the insurance manuals on which Smith intended to rely in forming his opinion. Smith apparently had agreements with some of those insurance companies, however, to keep their materials confidential. He therefore declined to produce all the manuals in his possession. Smith apparently had possession of some of the manuals for purposes not related to plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit with SCIF; in some instances, Smith was under court order in other cases to return insurance company manuals to their owners. Smith\u2019s reluctance to produce all the manuals he had reviewed was the subject of ongoing dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u201c(a) An application to an assigned judge for an order pursuant to Section 404.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure staying the proceedings in any action may be included with a petition for coordination or may be served and submitted by any party at any time prior to the determination of such petition.
