A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>complicating factor is that, for all practical purposes, there are only two actors in that market.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">An unbroken line of decisional authority holds that just what constitutes an economic actor\u2019s \u201ccost\u201d is an issue of fact to be decided by the trier of fact. In this case, however, the trial court decided the cost issue as a matter of law in circumstances that virtually ensured a verdict for the plaintiff. We therefore shall reverse the judgment for plaintiff together with an ensuing order awarding attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The dispute between the parties, and the extensive record generated by that dispute, reveal a mountain of detail, not all of which warrants recapitulation here. For present purposes, the following abbreviated narrative will suffice;</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">For a number of years the City and County of San Francisco let an annual contract for its \u201cofficial newspaper\u201d publishing public notice of matters as required by state and municipal law. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 6000 et seq.; S.F. Admin. Code, \u00a7 2.81.) The contract became an issue of bitter contention between two competitors for the contract, the San Francisco Examiner and the San Francisco Independent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">By 1993, the Examiner had lost out in the bidding process for this contract to the Independent for three years\u2019 running. The last time out prior to the year in controversy here, the Independent\u2019s winning bid was approximately 35 cents per line less than the Examiner\u2019s.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This time, the Examiner dropped its bid from $2.28 per line to $1.40 per line. The Independent\u2019s final bid increased from $2.35 to $2.67 per line. After the Examiner won the contract, the Independent brought suit for compensatory and punitive damages, attorney fees, and a permanent injunction. Although various causes of action were alleged in the Independent\u2019s complaint, its case against the Examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>came to trial on a single theory\u2014that the Examiner\u2019s winning bid was less than the costs incurred and thus in violation of the statutory prohibition against \u201cbelow cost\u201d sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">From the outset, both sides recognized that the issue of cost was crucial. No sooner had the case been called for trial than both sides submitted <em>in limine </em>motions attacking and requesting exclusion of the other party\u2019s \u201ccost study evidence\u201d or \u201ccost allocation model.\u201d Because the Examiner and the Independent agreed that \u201cthe fundamental legal dispute ... on the proper cost method should be resolved by the Court \u2018before the presentation of any argument or evidence to the trier of fact,\u2019 \u201d the court conducted an extensive evidentiary hearing pursuant to Evidence Code section 402. (See fn. 11, <em>post.) </em>Based on the evidence it had heard, the court ruled that the Examiner \u201cproduces two relevant products\u201d\u2014the actual \u201cphysical newspapers\u201d and advertising space\u2014for purposes of this action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Independent\u2019s \u201ccost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>allocation method\u201d recognized the existence of the two products and allocated costs between them; the Examiner\u2019s motion to exclude the Independent\u2019s cost determination study was therefore denied. On the other hand, because the Examiner\u2019s method did not allocate costs between these two products, the Independent\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of this method was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In line with this ruling, the Examiner\u2019s expert, Dr. Crichfield, prepared a new study that allocated costs between newspapers and advertising. The Independent moved to exclude all evidence of this new study. Following a second Evidence Code section 402 hearing, the court denied the Independent\u2019s motion and ruled that the study could be used at trial. Each side would be permitted, the trial court ruled, to produce its own cost determination study, despite difference in their methodologies. The Independent\u2019s method of determining cost was based on a \u201crevenue allocation,\u201d the Examiner\u2019s on allocation according to the amount of space dedicated to advertising, as opposed to news or editorial coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Trial then commenced. The first witness was Earl Pierson, who testified about the newspaper business in general and the state of that business in San Francisco in the early 1990\u2019s. The Independent\u2019s next witness was its economic expert, Dr. McLeod. He testified that the Examiner\u2019s winning bid of $1.40 was well below its actual per line cost of $1.82. The major purpose of Dr. McLeod\u2019s testimony was to attack the validity of the Crichfield model. He accused Dr. Crichfield of employing \u201caccounting tricks\u201d that \u201cdistort\u201d the real picture of the Examiner\u2019s costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The Independent\u2019s next witness was accounting expert Dr. Maher, who had reviewed McLeod\u2019s findings and endorsed them. Dr. Maher specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>agreed with McLeod that the Examiner\u2019s costs had to be determined using the \u201crevenue basis of allocation.\u201d He also criticized Crichfield\u2019s model. Dr. Maher\u2019s testimony ended the fourth day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Prior to the start of the fifth day of the trial, while discussing another matter with counsel in chambers, the court announced that \u201cI have something to talk about.\u201d The court then explained that it had reexamined the issue of the cost studies prepared by the parties\u2019 experts and concluded that \u201c[T]he only model that\u2019s appropriate is a revenue allocation model for allocating costs in this case.\u201d The Independent\u2019s experts, Drs. McLeod and Maher, endorsed a revenue allocation model. The Examiner, by contrast, relied on Dr. Crichfield\u2019s allocation of division between advertising and editorial/newsgathering functions according to the unit of measure of inches of the Examiner devoted to one or the other of these tasks. The court told counsel: \u201c[T]he only model that\u2019s appropriate is a revenue allocation model for allocating costs in this case. You cannot use this physical unit allocation model approach in this context. You can\u2019t do it. [\u00b6] . . . This is not a fully-allocated cost model, the one that Dr. Crichfield made. It just isn\u2019t.\u201d The court repeatedly called Dr. Crichfield\u2019s approach \u201cirrational.\u201d The court denied the Examiner\u2019s motion for a mistrial and trial proceeded for approximately six weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The Independent\u2019s expert, Dr. McLeod, testified at length about the revenue allocation methodology utilized in his cost study. Dr. McLeod\u2019s testimony will be discussed in more detail <em>post, </em>but its general import was to allocate cost according to revenue generated by those costs. His bottom line was that the Examiner\u2019s genuine cost per line was $1.92, far above the $1.40 bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In accordance with the court\u2019s most recent ruling, the Examiner\u2019s expert, Dr. Crichfield, was not allowed to testify about his cost model, but he did testify as to methodological defects he perceived in Dr. McLeod\u2019s model. After both Crichfield and McLeod had testified, and shortly before the case was sent to the jury, the court granted the Independent\u2019s motion to strike portions of Crichfield\u2019s testimony that were critical of McLeod\u2019s methods and conclusions; the theory was that allowing Crichfield to criticize McLeod\u2019s methods and conclusions would permit the Examiner to circumvent the court\u2019s ruling excluding substantive affirmative testimony from Crichfield. During the course of discussing instructions, the court granted the Independent\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the Examiner\u2019s \u201cmeeting competition\u201d affirmative defense. (See \u00a7 17050, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The court instructed the jury in effect that the only relevant evidence on the issue of cost had come from the Independent, a point the court reiterated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>when expressly asked by the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Three days after the case was sent to them the jury sent a note to the court asking \u201c[W]hat do we do when we have come to an impasse?\u201d The court questioned the jury, determined that there was not a true deadlock, and sent them back to continue the deliberations. Three days later the jury, by a vote of nine to three, returned a \u201cgeneral\u201d (i.e., liability only) verdict in favor of the Independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">After a brief damages phase, the jury returned a unanimous \u201cspecial\u201d verdict for the Independent in the amount of $348,981\u2014the amount requested\u2014together with interest. After this amount was trebled (\u00a7 17082), and prejudgment interest was added, a judgment for $1,149,636 was entered. Almost twice this amount\u2014$2,230,051\u2014was awarded for costs and attorney fees. The Examiner\u2019s motions for a new trial and for judgment not withstanding the verdict were denied. The Examiner appeals from the judgment, the attorney fee order, and the order denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">I. <em>Determination of Cost Under the Unfair Practices Act Is an Issue of Fact to Be Determined by the Jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\n<em>A. Applicable Law.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The purpose of the Unfair Practices Act (UPA) is \u201cto safeguard the public against the creation or perpetuation of monopolies and to foster and</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>encourage competition, by prohibiting unfair, dishonest, deceptive, destructive, fraudulent and discriminatory practices by which fair and honest competition is destroyed or prevented.\u201d (\u00a7 17001.) It forbids most locality discriminations (\u00a7\u00a7 17040-17041, 17049-17050), the use of loss leaders (\u00a7 17044), gifts (\u00a7 17043), secret rebates (\u00a7 17045), boycotts (\u00a7 17046), and \u201cdeceptive, untrue or misleading advertising\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 17200, 17500). It also prohibits the sale of goods and services below cost (\u00a7\u00a7 17043, 17048.5, 17049). This last was the violation the Independent alleged it had suffered at the hands of the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Proof that a defendant sold or distributed articles or products below cost will be \u201cpresumptive evidence of the purpose or intent to injure competitors or destroy competition\u201d (\u00a7 17071). The UPA provides definitions for \u201ccost\u201d in various settings (e.g., production and distribution) (\u00a7\u00a7 17026, 17029). A number of UPA provisions specify what sort of evidence may be used to demonstrate cost (\u00a7\u00a7 17027, 17071.5-17077).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">This case involved production, for which the UPA defines cost to include \u201cthe cost of raw materials, labor and all overhead expenses\u201d (\u00a7 17026). The separate definition of overhead expenses is given as \u201clabor (including salaries of executives and officers), rent, interest on borrowed capital, depreciation, selling cost, maintenance of equipment, delivery costs, credit losses, all types of licenses, taxes, insurance and advertising\u201d (\u00a7 17029).  These statutes embody California\u2019s fully allocated cost standard, that is, a fair allocation of all fixed or variable costs associated with production of the article or product.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See <em>Turnbull &amp; Turnbull </em>v. <em>ARA Transportation, Inc. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 811, 820 [268 Cal.Rptr. 856]; <em>G.H.I.I. </em>v. <em>MTS, Inc. </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 256, 275 [195 Cal.Rptr, 211, 41 A.L.R.4th 653].) Fixed costs are those that do not vary with changes in output, while variable costs are those that do vary with changes in output. \u201c[F]ully allocated cost has been equated with average total cost, which \u2018reflects that portion of the firm\u2019s total costs\u2014both fixed and variable\u2014attributable on an average basis to each unit of output.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Turnbull &amp; Turnbull </em>v. <em>ARA Transportation, Inc., supra </em>at p. 820.) Thus, cost has been described as the initial expense of producing the article together with \u201cits share of the load of carrying on the business through which it is sold.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kahn </em>(1936) 19 Cal.App.2d Supp. 758, 765 [60 P.2d 596].) Cost has also been treated as \u201cthe burden\u201d imposed upon the producer\u2019s \u201coverall cost of doing business.\u201d <em>(Turnbull &amp; Turnbull </em>v. <em>ARA Transportation, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Determination of the defendant\u2019s cost has always been treated as an issue of fact. One of the earliest decisions construing the UPA found our Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Court stating that \u201c. . . any difficulty in computing cost is a factual one\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pay Less Drug Store </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 108, 118 [153 P.2d 9]; accord, <em>Turnbull &amp; Turnbull </em>v. <em>ARA Transportation, Inc., supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 811, 820; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kahn, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.2d Supp. 758, 765). That principle remains true. (See <em>Western Union Financial Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>First Data Corp. </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1539 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 341].)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">An issue of fact is one where the evidence introduced will support a decision on either side, that is to say, reasonable minds could fairly differ as to the answer to the question posed. (E.g., <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pacific Elec. Ry. Co. </em>(1939) 12 Cal.2d 598, 603 [86 P.2d 829]; <em>Greyhound Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 356, 260 [83 Cal.Rptr. 343].) An issue of fact can become an issue of law when reasonable minds can draw only one conclusion from the evidence. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Wild </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 829, 832 [131 Cal.Rptr. 713]; <em>Wozniak </em>v. <em>Peninsula Hospital </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 716, 725 [82 Cal.Rptr. 84].) An issue of fact cannot be taken from a jury by the trial court and treated as an issue of law unless only one conclusion is legally deducible and any other conclusion cannot command the support of substantial evidence that will survive appellate review. (E.g., <em>Seneris </em>v. <em>Haas </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 811, 821 [291 P.2d 915, 53 A.L.R.2d 124]; <em>Serian Brothers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agri-Sun Nursery </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 306, 311-312 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 382].)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Several reported decisions are helpful in demonstrating the minimal quantum of evidence necessary to qualify the issue of cost as one which must be determined by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\"><em>Tri-Q, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sta-Hi Corp. </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 199 [45 Cal.Rptr. 878, 404 P.2d 486] involved competing manufacturers of equipment and machinery used in the printing of newspapers. Tri-Q sued Sta-Hi for selling a specific product below cost, in violation of section 17043. During the relevant time period Sta-Hi had no formal cost accounting system in place. Sta-Hi\u2019s president testified that he fixed the price of the product using a rough estimate of the labor and materials involved. The opposing evidence was in the form of an accounting report showing that the \u201crange of estimated probable unit costs\u201d was above the prices charged by Sta-Hi. The trial court, acting as the trier of fact, found that Sta-Hi had not sold its products below cost. This determination was upheld by the Supreme Court, which held that \u201cSince there was substantial support in the record for the trial court\u2019s resolution of the issue as to whether the product was sold below cost, the finding of fact with respect thereto cannot be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 203-207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">At issue in <em>Western Union Financial Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>First Data Corp., supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th 1530 was the cost of money orders. Relying on what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>is described as \u201ca single document created by a nonmanagement First Data employee,\u201d Western Union presented expert testimony that First Data charged $9 for a money order whose cost could range from $20.80 to as much as $26.60. First Data\u2019s evidence was that its cost per transaction was $16.26, but it realized revenue of about $17.31 per transaction. The trial court, acting as the trier of fact, found that First Data was making a profit on the transactions and therefore was not selling its products below cost. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1533-1535.) The Court of Appeal held that \u201c. . . there is a factual dispute about the manner in which costs were computed . . . and what that means is that we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1539, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">For present purposes, <em>Turnbull &amp; Turnbull </em>v. <em>ARA Transportation, Inc., supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 811, is perhaps most instructive. Turnbull and ARA operated bus transportation services and were competing bidders for annual contracts to bus children within the San Joaquin County school system. After repeatedly losing out to ARA, Turnbull brought suit, claiming that ARA\u2019s bids were below its costs. ARA\u2019s routine destruction of documentation meant that Grundig, Turnbull\u2019s economic expert, was unable to recreate precise cost figures. \u201cGrundig used four different methods in calculating whether ARA\u2019s bid was below its costs. The first method involved comparing the revenue per mile received by ARA on the San Joaquin County contract with the revenue per mile it received on other bus transportation contracts in other counties, after having made adjustments for cost differentials between the counties. The second method compared the revenue per mile ARA received on the San Joaquin County contract with the revenue per mile it received on its Delta College contract in San Joaquin County. In the third method, Grundig calculated ARA\u2019s costs based on two national cost surveys regarding operating costs of private passenger vans. Grundig\u2019s fourth method entailed an analysis of ARA\u2019s operating statements and an allocation of ARA\u2019s operating expenses per mile traveled. ARA\u2019s total operating costs for the year were divided by the total miles traveled to yield an average cost per mile. This figure was then multiplied by the contract mileage to determine the contract cost. In each year in question, ARA\u2019s bid was below its costs of providing the contract services.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 816.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">ARA provided no testimony or documentation concerning projected or actual costs for performing the contracts. One ARA financial officer testified that \u201c. . . ARA was concerned with making a profit on each contract and would not bid under cost. Jack Gottsman, the president of ARA\u2019s transportation group, testified .... ARA was concerned that each contract make a profit and bids were reviewed to make sure ARA was going into a contract on a profitable basis, [\u00b6] Robert Griffiths, the area controller who was in charge of the bidding process . . . , testified concerning ARA\u2019s method of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>allocating costs. It appears that variable costs were allocated per bus, per day. Fixed or overhead costs were allocated on the basis of bus days and revenue generated by each contract. The overhead would first be allocated among the various divisions based on the number of bus days generated by each division. Then each division would allocate the overhead per contract in proportion to the percentage of revenue generated by each contract. According to Griffiths, the San Joaquin County bids covered ARA\u2019s costs and generated a profit.\u201d (219 Cal.App.3d at pp. 818-819.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The jury returned a verdict for Turnbull. ARA appealed, contending inter alia that the UPA was unconstitutional \u201cbecause the method for determining whether a service is sold below cost is arbitrary and irrational.\u201d <em>(Turnbull &amp; Turnbull </em>v. <em>ARA Transportation, Inc, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 811, 819.) In the course of rejecting this claim, the Court of Appeal stated: \u201cARA claims the fully allocated cost method is arbitrary because there are many ways of allocating costs (for example, in the present case per mile, per bus or per student) each of which may result in significantly different cost profiles. <em>While we agree there are many </em>ways <em>of fully allocating costs, the possibilities are not without limitation. To be legally acceptable, the allocation of indirect or fixed overhead costs to a particular product or service must be reasonably related to the burden such product or service imposes on the overall cost of doing business. </em>[Citations.] <em>Moreover, a defendant is free to demonstrate to the trier of fact that its fully allocated cost, using another reasonable allocation method other than that used by the plaintiff, is actually lower </em>than the plaintiff alleges and lower than defendant\u2019s sales or bid price. [Citation.] ARA did not do so. It merely presented witnesses who testified ARA always bid above cost or always sought to make a profit. In fact, ARA did not even demonstrate it sold its services above its average variable cost or long-run incremental cost, the methods it espouses. As such, defendant failed to demonstrate that the use of the fully allocated cost method was arbitrary or irrational as applied to the facts of this case.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at. pp. 822-823, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Several conclusions are obvious. First, the concept of cost may appear simple, but can often prove deceptively hard to grasp in the real world. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kahn, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.2d Supp. 758, 765 [\u201cIt must be conceded that in many cases it is going to be extremely difficult to determine what cost of an article is.\u201d]; <em>Transamerica Computer Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>IBM Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 698 F.2d 1377, 1387 [noting \u201cthe uncertainty and imprecision inherent in determining \u2018costs\u2019 \u201d].) Authorities in the field argue passionately over the many possible models and approaches. (See, e.g., 3 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law (1996 rev. ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 722-724d, 739-742, pp. 221-244, 367-426.) Second, and as a corollary, the determination of cost is best approached on a case-by-case basis. The provisions of the UPA and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>various judicial glosses reflect an appreciation that no single formulation will ever be broad enough to encompass all possibilities. The principle may be fixed and constant, but the application is prey to the infinite permutations of the question\u2014what did it cost a particular defendant to produce or sell a given article at a specific point in time? Third, California appears to have adopted a very expansive approach to the evidence that may be used to establish- cost; no formula has been expressly sustained or denounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">With this background, we turn to the Examiner\u2019s first contention\u2014that the trial court committed reversible error when it precluded the Examiner from presenting its version of how it calculated cost for purposes of bidding for the City\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">B. <em>Application of Law in This Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The parties continue the intransigence they displayed throughout the trial, each insisting that its economic model is the only acceptable method for determining cost, and that the other side\u2019s model is worthless and erroneous as a: matter of law. The Examiner insists not only must the judgment be reversed, there must be no retrial, and it is entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Independent is equally adamant that the trial court was correct in excluding evidence of Crichfield\u2019s analysis because \u201crevenue allocation the <em>only </em>rational way to determine the Examiner\u2019s cost.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The revenue allocation adopted by Dr. McLeod, and to a lesser extent by Dr. Maher, appears to be an allocation approach used if the standard cost allocation (see \u00a7 17026 [\u201ccost of raw materials, labor and all overhead expenses\u201d]) either will not work or is inappropriate for some reason. McLeod believed it was inappropriate in this case to use the standard cost allocation (\u00a7 17026 [\u201ccost of raw materials, labor, and all overhead expenses\u201d]) because there is not a common physical unit of measurement, and because \u201cyou have two products that are intertwined and therefore there is no rational way of simply allocating the costs.\u201d (The latter premise obviously ties in to the trial court\u2019s \u201ctwo-product\u201d ruling; see fn. 4 and accompanying text, <em>ante.) </em>Using the revenue allocation method, McLeod assigns costs to the two products \u201c[b]ased on an approximation of the value received from the sales of those two products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Dr. Crichfield\u2019s opinion was that revenue allocation was not appropriate because there was a common physical unit of measurement\u2014the inches of space devoted to the advertising and \u201ceditorial\u201d (i.e., news gathering and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>reporting) functions, which could be used to allocate the cost of production of the Examiner. He allocated 55 percent of the Examiner\u2019s total costs to the editorial side, and 45 percent to advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The difference in result between the two approaches is gaping. Working from the conceded figure of approximately $60.5 million for the Examiner\u2019s total costs, McLeod allocated only $11,228,000 to \u201cnon-advertising revenues,\u201d resulting in $49,250,000 of costs allocated to advertising; that figure was then divided by the number of \u201cadvertising inches\u201d to produce a \u201ccost per classified ad line\u201d of $1.85.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Dr. Crichfield found $23.8 million of advertising costs divided by the same number of advertising inches to produce a per line cost of 89 cents for advertising. Where Crichfield assigned 45 percent of the Examiner\u2019s total costs to the \u201cadvertising product,\u201d McLeod allocated almost 85 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Each side can and does point to flaws in the other\u2019s model. This, we believe, illuminates the fundamental point missed by both parties and by the trial court. The hyperbole obscures the fact that each approach has its relative merits and demerits. Neither is entitled to prevail as a matter of law. Neither is so strong that it can banish the other. In short, both approaches are sufficiently reasonable that both ought to have been put before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">When the Examiner condemns McLeod for using \u201can irrational \u2018revenue allocation\u2019 methodology that is not sanctioned by California law,\u201d it overstates its case. The revenue allocation method may lack an express sanction in California, but so does the Examiner\u2019s approach. And while no reported California decision explicitly sanctions or endorses any approach to determining cost, the revenue allocation method was mentioned in <em>Turnbull &amp; Turnbull </em>without a hint that it was inappropriate. Moreover, the Examiner never suggested that the revenue allocation approach was new, unscientific, or unaccepted in the fields of economics and cost accounting. (Cf. <em>In re IBM Peripheral EDP Devices, etc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1979) 481 F.Supp. 965, 998 [\u201cRevenue apportionment is a generally accepted and commonly used method of . . . cost allocation.\u201d].) Certainly with the record so undeveloped on this point, we cannot hold as a matter of law that the revenue allocation approach could not be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">On the other hand, the advantage of measuring the cost of an item backwards from the revenue generated by that item is not immediately self-obvious and can seem incompatible with common sense. This approach appears to have no connection with the traditional tests of \u201cinitial cost,\u201d or the item\u2019s \u201cshare of the load of carrying on the business through which it is sold\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kahn, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.2d Supp. 758, 765), or \u201cthe burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>. . . impose[d] on the overall cost of doing business.\u201d <em>(Turnbull &amp; Turnbull </em>v. <em>ARA Transportation, Inc., supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 811, 822.) It further appears that there are distinct logical flaws in the approach as developed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">According to Dr. McLeod, the revenue allocation approach should be used only in a joint cost situation where there is no common unit of measurement. In this situation, however, as the Examiner repeatedly urged, there was a common unit of measurement, specifically the literal inches of the Examiner. It is not irrational to divide the Examiner by the inches of space devoted to the editorial and advertising products.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the other hand, as Dr. McLeod testified, one may buy X number of inches of advertising space, but \u201cYou can\u2019t go to the newsstand and say, \u2018I\u2019d like to buy 25 inches of news copy today.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, as the Examiner points out in its opening brief, McLeod\u2019s model treats more than $23 million of the Examiner\u2019s total costs, those for \u201ceditorial costs\u201d plus ink and newsprint, as joint costs when in fact they are obviously and easily segregated as part of the \u201ceditorial product.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They would therefore not be subject to the revenue allocation percentages and would almost certainly require a recalculation of those percentages. This suggests that Dr. McLeod\u2019s analysis was perhaps too ambitious in its scope and its application of deductive revenue allocation; in effect it made all Costs joint costs. These flaws are not, however, of sufficient magnitude to condemn the revenue allocation approach per se and make it inadmissible as a matter of law. These and other imperfections would go to the weight the jury ought to give McLeod\u2019s testimony, but they do not make it wholly illegitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We conclude that neither of the parties\u2019 cost models was irrational or insufficiently allocated to comply with the UPA\u2019s requirement. Neither model is so persuasive that it alone would attract all reasonable minds, allowing the issue to be resolved as a question of law. (See <em>Seneris </em>v. <em>Haas, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 811, 821; <em>Serian Brothers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agri-Sun Nursery, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th 306, 311-312.) The issue of the Examiner\u2019s cost remained a question of fact on which the parties could introduce conflicting evidence. It was therefore error to exclude evidence of the Examiner\u2019s model from being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>presented to the jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (E.g., <em>Western Union Financial Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>First Data Corp., supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1539; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kahn, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.2d Supp. 758, 765.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">C. <em>Taking Issue of Determination of Cost From Jury Requires Reversal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The error clearly requires reversal because of its importance and its manifold consequences. Cost was <em>the </em>issue of this litigation as it went to trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Dr. Crichfield\u2019s testimony would therefore be crucial for the Examiner. Although both sides in opening statements made reference to Crichfield\u2019s anticipated testimony, the comments of counsel for the Independent were far more numerous and pointed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The preemptive attacks on Crichfield continued virtually from the start of the actual jury trial, with the Independent\u2019s second and third witnesses (Drs. McLeod and Maher) spending almost as much time attacking the as-yet-unheard Crichfield conclusions as explaining their own. The court\u2019s sua sponte overturning of its ruling could not help but cause confusion and consternation for the jury. The thing they had heard so much about would now not be produced, and they were told to forget all about it. For the Examiner, whose counsel had featured Crichfield prominently in his opening statement, the inability to call that witness was unquestionably damaging. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Corona </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 684, 725-726 [145 Cal.Rptr. 894] [defense counsel dealt \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to client when he failed to present evidence promised in opening statement].) The jury did finally get to hear Dr. Crichfield, but he was only allowed to present negative testimony, which is to say, testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>about the defects in the Independent\u2019s case. Even then, a good part of his testimony was stricken. It is hardly surprising that the jury initially had trouble remembering what part of Crichfield\u2019s testimony was available to them. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>Counsel for the Independent told the jury that the only relevant evidence on the dispositive issue of cost favored the Independent, and the trial court twice told the jury that the Independent\u2019s cost model was the sole legal method for determining cost. <em>(Ibid.) </em>This was tantamount to the court directing a verdict against the Examiner. In light of the six days it took the jury to return a nine-to-three verdict in favor of the Independent, there is more than a reasonable probability of a more favorable result; the error thus compels reversal. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]; Code Civ.

The Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle, a non-Hearst morning paper, produce a joint Sunday edition; they share facilities and noneditorial business functions pursuant to a joint operating agreement authorized by the Newspaper Preservation Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801-1804; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 48.1-48.16 (1998)). The overlap between the two papers is the responsibility of the San Francisco Newspaper Printing Company, Inc.

The Examiner concedes, however, that technical factors such as differing type size and line count means that \u201cthe dollar amounts of the respective bids ... are not directly comparable. To derive directly comparable bids, the dollar amount of the <em>Independent\u2019s </em>bid must be reduced by approximately 15% . . . which reduces the <em>Independent\u2019s </em>bid of $2.35 per line to approximately $2.00 per line for purposes of comparison.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In its opening brief, the Examiner states: \u201cAlthough Defendants continue to believe that the Examiner can be viewed as constituting a single \u2018product\u2019 with multiple revenue streams\u2014a newspaper containing both editorial material and paid advertisements\u2014the distinction is academic in the circumstances of this case. Whether the Examiner is viewed as a single, integrated product, or as two distinct products\u2014a newspaper and advertising, Defendants did not engage in below-cost pricing. Nor would Defendants be found to have engaged in below-cost pricing if one separately calculated the costs of classified advertisements. For that reason, Defendants\u2019 arguments in this brief are addressed to other rulings of the trial court, and assume\u2014solely for purposes of this appeal, and arguendo\u2014that there are indeed two \u2018products\u2019: a daily \u2018newspaper product\u2019 which consumers purchase from a newsstand or by subscription, and an \u2018advertising product.\u2019 Defendants reserve the right to contend in the future, should the occasion arise, that their \u2018product\u2019 or \u2018products\u2019 should be defined differently, [\u00b6] It should be noted, however, that Plaintiff\u2019s two-product theory\u2014which is a fundamental premise of Plaintiff\u2019s claim in this case\u2014is inconsistent with Plaintiff\u2019s rationale for the \u2018revenue allocation\u2019 methodology that the trial court approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The Independent treated this as a \u201cconcession\u201d that the Examiner was not contesting the trial court\u2019s ruling that two products were at issue. The Examiner responded in its reply brief that no such concession had been made; it also made the first developed argument attacking the two-product ruling as a grounds for reversal. Three days after the Examiner\u2019s reply brief was filed, a number of publishers filed an amicus curiae brief supporting the Examiner, in which they passionately contend that the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue was error. This mutual desire of the Examiner and amici curiae to now litigate the two-product ruling on appeal will not be indulged.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">As did the Independent, we too read the language in the Examiner\u2019s opening brief as a concession that it will not be contesting the correctness of the trial court\u2019s two-product ruling. The operative language of the footnote\u2014\u201cthe distinction is academic <em>in the circumstances </em>of this case,\u201d \u201cDefendants\u2019 arguments in this brief are addressed to <em>other </em>rulings,\u201d \u201cassume\u2014 <em>solely for purposes of this appeal. . . </em>\u2014that there are indeed two \u2018products,\u2019 \u201d \u201cDefendants <em>reserve the right to contend in the future, should the occasion arise\u201d </em>(italics added)\u2014cannot be reasonably read as other than a concession. Nor does the reference to page 32 at the end of the footnote assist the Examiner. Page 32 finds the Examiner stating: \u201cIf, as Plaintiff urged and the trial court ruled, the \u2018newspaper product\u2019 and the \u2018advertising product\u2019 are indeed separate products for purposes of the UPA, then the cost of each such \u2018product\u2019 must be measured separately and accurately.\u201d A footnote at this point goes on: \u201cConversely, if Plaintiff persists in arguing that the pricing of advertising and newspapers are inseparably intertwined, it will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>be necessary for the Court to examine the trial court\u2019s ruling that they are, indeed, two separate \u2018products\u2019 for purposes of the UPA\u2019s below-cost pricing statute.\u201d These 10 lines do not constitute a developed argument with supporting authority and appropriate references to the record. The opening brief will therefore not be regarded as raising the issue of the two-product ruling for review. (See, e.g., <em>Troensegaard </em>v. <em>Silvercrest Industries, Inc. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 218, 228 [220 Cal.Rptr. 712].) There being no reason why the issue could not have been developed in the opening brief, the Examiner\u2019s attempt to raise it in the reply brief will not be indulged. (See, e.g., <em>Scott </em>v. <em>CIBA Vision Corp. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 307, 322 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 902]; <em>Neighbours </em>v. <em>Buzz Oates Enterprises </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 325, 335, fn. 8 [265 Cal.Rptr. 788].) The amicus curiae brief cannot remedy this defect because amici curiae are not allowed to expand the issues raised by the parties. (See, e.g., <em>California Assn. for Safety Education </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1274-1275 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 404] and decisions cited.) Exceptions are allowed on points of jurisdiction or issues that will result in affirmance (see <em>E. L. White, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 497, 511 [146 Cal.Rptr. 614, 579 P.2d 505]), but amici curiae are attempting to argue a nonjurisdictional evidentiary error they view as requiring reversal. The ordinary rule of party issue selection and preclusion therefore applies to this and the other evidentiary error claimed only by amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The Examiner will of course be able to ask the trial court to reconsider this ruling if there is a retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The jury was instructed that \u201cthe evidence in this case has been that the <em>only </em>method for allocating costs to these two products [i.e., the newspaper product and advertising space product] is the so-called \u2018revenue method\u2019 of allocating joint costs. The revenue method of allocating joint costs is a method based on the assumption that the ratio between the amounts of revenue earned by the products involved is the same as the ratio of the costs incurred in producing these products.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Two days into their deliberations the jury asked the court \u201cIs the revenue method the only legal method to consider in determining if the cost of advertising is below cost in this case?\u201d The court responded that \u201cThe answer to that question is yes.\u201d Counsel for the Independent had forcefully made the same point during his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">The court drove the same point home by telling the jury what they could <em>not </em>consider: \u201cDuring the trial of this action, there has been evidence of methods of cost allocation defendants used before [the date of their winning bid] to determine their costs. I instruct you that you are to consider those methods only as they may bear on the defendants\u2019 state of mind, and not as methods which you may apply to determine the defendants\u2019 advertising costs in this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">One other point must be mentioned. The Examiner states in its brief that \u201c[D]uring its deliberations the jury inquired as to which portions of Dr. Crichfield\u2019s testimony were in evidence . . . but the trial court never clarified the issue.\u201d The clear implication of this passage is that the trial court was, to use the mildest term, derelict in its duty. The Examiner\u2019s statement is literally (rue but almost slanderous in its innuendo. What actually happened, and what clearly appears on page 7354 of the reporter\u2019s transcript, is that the jury foreman told the court \u201cThe jury has decided we no longer need the information that we requested.\u201d The court then verified \u201cyou are telling me that you no longer need this information; is that right?\u201d The jury foreman answered, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Cost is to be measured as \u201cthe fair average cost of production over a reasonable time, rather than the cost of one item on a particular occasion.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Farmer </em>(1940) 41 Cal.App.2d 874, 882 [107 P.2d 959].)

Public notice advertising takes up physical space in the newspaper, thereby consuming newsprint and ink, is sold in physical units known as column-inches, and is delivered to readers in such physical form.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The difficulty with the revenue approach is perhaps best illustrated with a specific example: Dr. McLeod identified $15,863,613 as \u201ceditorial costs,\u201d yet his approach allocates almost all of these costs to the \u201cadvertising product.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\">We reject the Independent\u2019s argument that this issue amounts to invited error and was waived by the Examiner\u2019s counsel when he asked the court to decide the reasonableness of the respective cost models as a matter of law. First, that request was made in connection with the first model submitted by Dr. Crichfield, which the court found was unallocated, resulting in its order that a new model be prepared. The Examiner\u2019s request was not renewed with respect to the second Crichfield model, the one at issue here. The second Evidence Code section 402 hearing was conducted at the Independent\u2019s request, based on its motion to exclude Dr. Crichfield\u2019s second cost determination study. Second, the trial court obviously did not deem the Examiner\u2019s request applicable to the second model, as evident from its initial decision that neither it nor the McLeod model was \u201cunreasonable\u201d and the choice between them would be left to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\">As the Independent\u2019s attorney told the jury in his opening statement: \u201c[W]hat this case is all about is the allegation on the part of The Independent that when The Independent competed with The Examiner ... to get the public notice contract . . . The Examiner bid below cost, below their fully allocated cost.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\">E.g., \u201cAnd so what they chose to do was to hire Dr. Crichfield. They will say that Dr. Crichfield is an independent accountant who gave them independent advice with regard to their costs. [\u00b6] But the evidence will show that, in fact, Dr. Crichfield\u2019s primary career role is the creation of litigation cost models, and that this cost model is really a cost model designed to defend The Examiner in a lawsuit. . . . There are some other accounting tricks . . . which Dr. McLeod [the Independent\u2019s expert] will say makes this allocation study by Dr. Crichfield completely useless.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In its petition for rehearing, the Independent contends that we \u201cmistakenly decided the \u2018cost\u2019 issue under Evidence Code section 403 instead of Evidence Code section 405.\u201d We were not mistaken, because we decided no such issue, and the Independent\u2019s belated presentation of this claim will not avert reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The Independent\u2019s argument is apparently based on this statement from <em>Turnbull: </em>\u201cTo be legally acceptable, the allocation of . . . costs to a particular product or service must be reasonably related to the burden such product or service imposes on the overall cost of doing business.\u201d <em>(Turnbull &amp; Turnbull </em>v. <em>ARA Transportation, Inc., supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 811, 822.) The Independent reasons that whether Dr. Crichfield\u2019s model complied with this standard is a preliminary fact, one that Evidence Code section 405 vests with the trial court to decide. Evidence Code section 403, by contrast, allows the jury to decide whether the preliminary fact exists if \u201cthe court finds that there is evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the existence of the preliminary fact\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 403, subd. (a)). In fact, the latter statute requires the issue of preliminary fact determination to be submitted to the jury but \u201cSection 405 requires the judge to determine the existence or nonexistence of disputed preliminary facts except in certain situations covered by Section[] 403 .... Section 405 deals with evidentiary rules designed to withhold evidence from the jury because it is too unreliable to be evaluated properly or because public policy requires its exclusion.\u201d (See Assem. Com. on Judiciary, corns, to Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 403, 405, 29B West\u2019s Ann. Cal. Evid. Code (1995 ed.) pp. 361, 374; Deering\u2019s Ann. Cal. Evid. Code (1986) pp. 142, 150-151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Whether the economic models\u2019 compatibility with section 17026 and the <em>Turnbull </em>standard is properly handled under Evidence Code section 403 or Evidence Code section 405 is an intriguing question, but one we cannot, and need not, decide. There is undoubtedly a case to be made for viewing the admissibility of evidence dependent upon its compliance with an established legal standard as one involving both reliability and public policy, and therefore governed by Evidence Code section 405. On the other hand, it is not fanciful to view the problem as relevance, that is to say, a model that did not comport with <em>Turnbull </em>would not be relevant on the issue of cost. This approach would make the problem subject to Evidence Code section 403, subdivision (a)(1). Certainly this was the trial court\u2019s initial view of the matter: In its written order deciding that the McLeod model could be used but Crichfield\u2019s initial model could not (see <em>ante </em>at pp. 428-429), the court made these decisions \u201cpursuant to Evidence Code section 403 (a)(1).\u201d Although the court did not enter a written order when it ruled that Crichfield\u2019s revised model was not \u201cunreasonable in the context of . . . the <em>Turnbull </em>case\u201d and not \u201cunreasonable to the extent that it\u2019s something that should be precluded from being presented to the Jury altogether,\u201d it is difficult to believe the court would have shifted the statutory basis it had been employing up to that point. The blizzard of paper generated by the parties\u2019 motions to exclude the other\u2019s economic model demonstrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>that neither party was entirely consistent in invoking either section 403 or 405 of the Evidence Code. Unfortunately, when the trial court reversed course it became impossible to determine if the court would have continued to treat the issue as an Evidence Code section 403 subject. It was because of this uncertainty that we said nothing more specific than that the court had conducted the pretrial hearings \u201cpursuant to Evidence Code section 402.\u201d (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 428-429.) It is therefore inaccurate for the Independent to believe we \u201cdecided the \u2018cost\u2019 issue under Evidence Code section 403.\u201d We did no such thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">The issue is also immaterial because.there is little practical consequence to which statute the trial court used. With or without special instructions (see Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 403, subd. (c), 405, subd. (b)(2)), the essential duty of the jury would have been pretty much the same\u2014 judge the evidence against the <em>Turnbull </em>standard given in the court\u2019s instructions. With <em>Turnbull </em>as the benchmark, the jury would decide which party\u2019s evidence it found to reflect the Examiner\u2019s cost. If the jury had accepted Crichfield\u2019s model, it would in effect have decided that his evidence was compatible with the preliminary fact of compliance with the <em>Turnbull </em>standard and the McLeod model was not. On the other hand, if the jury had accepted the McLeod/Maher testimony, it would have reached the opposite conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Such speculation aside, the Independent\u2019s contention is ultimately doomed because it does not matter which provision of the Evidence Code the trial court did or ought to have used. Even if (as the Independent assumes) the trial court did use Evidence Code section 405, the court erred when it determined that the Crichfield model was \u201cirrational\u201d and therefore presumably not fully allocated as required by section 17026 and <em>Turnbull </em>as a preliminary fact. Alternatively if the trial court did follow through on its initial ruling and continue to apply Evidence Code section 403 when it excluded Crichfield\u2019s evidence, the court would also be in error because \u201cthere [was] evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the existence of the preliminary fact\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 403, subd. (a)), i.e., that it was fully allocated in compliance with governing legal criteria. Both of these possibilities are encompassed by our analysis and our conclusion that reversible error occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-11\">See footnote, ante, page 424.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
