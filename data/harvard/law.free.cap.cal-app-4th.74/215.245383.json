Hanson suffered a hand injury while on the job as a meatcutter and took a series of leaves of absence from work to recuperate. Sixteen months after Hanson sustained his injury, his doctor finally released him to return to work, with physical restrictions against heavy lifting, pulling, pushing and prolonged standing. Lucky offered Hanson an alternate position as a part-time meat clerk. Hanson rejected the offer and Lucky terminated his employment. In his complaint, Hanson seeks damages for, inter alia, discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq., hereinafter FEHA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and wrongful termination in violation of public policy. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Reviewing the filings in support of and in opposition to the summary judgment motion, we conclude in the unpublished portion of this opinion that Lucky carried its burden by demonstrating that its reason for terminating Hanson\u2019s employment was legitimate and not discriminatory. We conclude further, in the published portion of this opinion, that in any event, Lucky provided Hanson with two reasonable accommodations. In opposing the motion, Hanson failed to raise a triable issue of material fact as to Lucky\u2019s prima facie showing. Accordingly, we affirm the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Hanson was a journeyman meatcutter with Lucky. In December 1993, Hanson broke his hand and injured his wrist while at work. Earlier, Hanson had suffered a back injury while on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">As a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Hanson\u2019s employment was governed by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with Lucky. The CBA provided for up to nine months of leave for an employee injured while on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Hanson took three weeks off from work between December 1993 and January 1994. Hanson then worked until April 19, 1994, when, continuing to feel pain in his hand, he took a leave of absence to undergo therapy. Surgery to fuse Hanson\u2019s wrist was performed on December 14, 1994. From the time of the accident, Lucky extended Hanson\u2019s leave at least eight times spanning sixteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Hanson\u2019s doctor, Jamshid J. Hekmat, M.D., issued a return-to-work order allowing Hanson to work as of May 15, 1995, with the limitation that he was not to engage in \u201cheavy lifting, pulling, pushing with his right hand.\u201d  In his ensuing permanent and stationary evaluation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of Hanson\u2019s industrial injury, Dr. Hekmat explained that Hanson had lost 50 percent of the grip and strength in his right arm for any activity, and would have \u201cdifficulty with activities involving lifting over 25 pounds, carrying, pushing and pulling at this time.\u201d Dr. Hekmat issued an amended report on July 21, 1995, clarifying that Hanson had sustained \u201cmultiple work-related injuries\u201d to his wrist and back. While Hanson was capable of returning to work, Dr. Hekmat precluded Hanson from heavy lifting, repeated bending, pulling, pushing and prolonged periods of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Hanson commenced vocational rehabilitation in July 1995, and began considering employment elsewhere. In early August 1995, Lucky offered Hanson the position of a part-time meat clerk<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at approximately 50 percent of his meatcutter\u2019s pay, and with none of the benefits received by full-time union meatcutters. Hanson refused the offer. After Hanson failed to report to work in the meat clerk position, Lucky terminated his employment as of August 31, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Hanson\u2019s lawsuit ensued. At issue here are the third and fourth causes of action, in which Hanson alleged his employment was terminated because of his history of work-related injuries and because Lucky perceived him as an individual with a permanent physical disability. Hanson alleged Lucky did not accommodate him to enable him to perform the essential functions of his job. Based on these allegations, Hanson charged his employment termination constituted an unlawful employment practice in violation of FEHA and a wrongful termination in violation of public policy embodied in article I, section 8 of the California Constitution and FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">A. <em>Lucky\u2019s summary judgment motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">With the case at issue, Lucky moved for summary judgment on the ground that, there being no issues of material fact, Hanson\u2019s third cause of action lacked merit as a matter of law, because, inter alia, (1) Hanson was not denied reasonable accommodation where Lucky (a) extended his leave to allow him to recuperate, and (b) offered him an alternative job in a vacant position; and (2) Hanson cannot demonstrate that Lucky\u2019s legitimate business reasons for terminating his employment were pretextual. With respect to the fourth cause of action, Lucky contended that, as a matter of law, Hanson could not demonstrate that any public policy was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In support of its motion, Lucky submitted evidence under the authenticating affidavit of its counsel, showing that Hanson had taken a total of 16 months of medical leave to undergo surgery and therapy, and to recuperate from his injury. The CBA allowed nine months of leave. After expiration of the nine-month period under the CBA, Lucky\u2019s representatives testified, Lucky was free to follow its own internal procedures with respect to the employee\u2019s leave. In Hanson\u2019s case, Lucky extended his leave three times after the initial nine months, for a total of sixteen months or nearly twice that provided for by the CBA. Hanson\u2019s doctor cleared him to return to work finally on May 15, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The CBA provides in article 9, part A, paragraph 2, that where the employee is physically unable to return to the job within nine months, \u201cthe employee shall be given <em>preference </em>for employment <em>when a vacancy occurs in a position for which he can qualify </em>if he applies for reemployment within six (6) months from the expiration of his leave of absence.\u201d (Italics added.) At the end of the leave of absence, the CBA further provides, the employee shall be returned to a position \u201ccomparable to the one held prior to this leave <em>provided that the employee is physically able to efficiently perform work </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>comparable to that which he performed prior to such leave of </em>absence.\u201d (Italics added.) Hanson admits that to perform his job as a meatcutter he must be able to lift heavy carcasses, repeatedly bend, pull, and push heavy objects, and stand for prolonged periods of time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lucky decided, because of Hanson\u2019s doctor\u2019s restrictions, it could not return Hanson to his meatcutter job.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Faced with the work restrictions placed on Hanson by his doctor, Lucky\u2019s human resources manager for the Southern California region, Bruce Frazier, met with Lucky\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation supervisor, Diana Sinclare, to ascertain whether Hanson could perform in another position. Frazier and Sinclare reviewed the job descriptions for Lucky and consulted with the vocational and rehabilitation provider, administered through Lucky\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation insurer, about Hanson\u2019s work limitations and the positions available at Lucky. Sinclare testified that in identifying the jobs for which Hanson would qualify, she considered (1) Hanson\u2019s restrictions, (2) Hanson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, (3) Hanson\u2019s expressed desire to continue as a meatcutter, and (4) whether Lucky could modify the meat-cutter position. While Sinclare did not discuss Hanson\u2019s desires with him, the vocational and rehabilitation provider had \u201cmade it very clear\u201d that Hanson wanted to remain in the meat department. After receiving Dr. Hekmat\u2019s July 21, 1995, amended permanent and stationary report, Frazier and Sinclare concluded the only available job at Lucky that Hanson could perform was as a part-time meat clerk. Lucky\u2019s clerical staff was moving out of California, there was no other work available \u201cwithin the industry,\u201d and no other jobs could be modified because of Hanson\u2019s restriction against prolonged standing. Lucky offered Hanson the meat clerk post in early August 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Lucky also demonstrated that Hanson refused this offer. Then, Lucky terminated his employment. The termination letter states, \u201cYou were granted a medical leave of absence which expired April 19, 1995. You did not return to work, and no further extension of this leave is available. We must, therefore, consider you as having terminated your employment with Lucky Stores, Inc., and are setting the effective date of the termination of your employment as of August 31, 1995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">B. <em>Hanson\u2019s opposition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\"> In opposition to the summary judgment motion, Hanson undertook to dispute that he was precluded from performing the essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>functions of his job and that he was not a qualified \u201cindividual with a disability.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, Hanson attempted to dispute Lucky\u2019s factual predicates, and submitted his own statement of facts, in an effort to challenge Lucky\u2019s proffered reason for terminating his employment and its assertion that it had reasonably accommodated his disability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The trial court granted Lucky\u2019s summary judgment motion on the grounds, among others, that (1) Hanson failed to demonstrate the proffered reasons for his termination were pretextual, and (2) Hanson failed to dispute that Lucky could not have made accommodations which would have allowed Hanson to return to his meatcutter job. Hanson\u2019s timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">1. <em>Standard of review and burdens of proof in defense motions for summary judgment in employment discrimination actions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">\u201c ' \u201cSummary judgment is granted when there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

[\u00b6] (2) Job <em>restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, </em>acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, <em>and other similar accommodations </em>for individuals with disabilities.\u201d (\u00a7 12926, subd. (m), italics added; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7293.9, subd. (a).) However, FEHA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>list of accommodation measures, by its terms, is incomplete <em>(ibid.), </em>and so we may look to its federal cognates for guidance. <em>(Prilliman </em>v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 948.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Turning to the federal statutes, in appropriate circumstances, reasonable accommodation can include providing the employee accrued paid leave or additional unpaid leave for treatment. <em>(Schmidt </em>v. <em>Safeway Inc. </em>(D.Or. 1994) 864 F.Supp. 991, 996, citing 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, appen.; <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>National Products Co. </em>(E.D.Pa. 1995) 4 A.D. Cases 987, 990.) As one court explained, \u201c. . . the ADA may require an employer to provide a leave of absence to an employee with an alcohol problem, particularly if the employer would provide that accommodation to an employee with cancer or some other illness requiring medical treatment.\u201d <em>(Schmidt </em>v. <em>Safeway Inc., supra, </em>864 F. Supp. at p. 996.) However, the <em>Schmidt </em>court explained, \u201c[a]n employer is not required to offer an accommodation that is likely to be futile because, even with accommodation, the employee could not safely and efficiently perform the essential functions of the job. Thus an employer would not be required to provide repeated leaves of absence (or perhaps even a single leave of absence) for an alcoholic employee with a poor prognosis for recovery. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 997.) Hence, the leave accommodation is qualified. \u201cAs long as a reasonable accommodation available to the employer could have plausibly enabled a handicapped employee to adequately perform his job, an employer is liable for failing to attempt that accommodation.\u201d <em>(Kimbro </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 889 F.2d 869, 879, cert. den. <em>sub nom. Atlantic Richfield Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Kimbro </em>(1990) 498 U.S. 814 [111 S.Ct. 53, 112 L.Ed.2d 28].) In sum, a finite leave of absence has been considered to be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, provided it is likely that following the leave the employee would be able to perform his or her duties. <em>(Kimbro </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>889 F.2d at pp. 878-879; <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Safeway Inc., supra, </em>864 F. Supp. at pp. 996-997; <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>National Products, Co., supra, 4 </em>A.D. Cases at p. 990.)  We hold that a finite leave can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA, provided it is likely that at the end of the leave, the employee would be able to perform his or her duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Here, the undisputed evidence shows that Lucky attempted to reasonably accommodate Hanson, not once, but twice. While Hanson was entitled under the CBA to nine months of leave, he actually enjoyed sixteen <em>months </em>of leave, nearly twice the allowable period. Indeed, Hanson asserted as his own fact that he was terminated <em>seven </em>months after expiration of his medical leave of absence. There is no showing that at the time he began his leave, Hanson\u2019s prognosis for recovery was not good.  \u201cReasonable accommodation does not require the employer to wait <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>indefinitely for an employee\u2019s medical condition to be corrected. . . .\u201d <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Wilson Sporting Goods Co., supra, </em>143 F.3d at p. 1047, citation omitted.)  Indubitably, the seven extra months of leave beyond the CBA period that Lucky granted Hanson for the purpose of recuperation constitutes a reasonable accommodation in this case. The fact that at the end of his leave, Hanson was restricted from engaging in certain activities, does not render the leave accommodation itself unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In any event, when Hanson returned with restrictions, Lucky further attempted to assist his reentry into the workplace. FEHA lists as reasonable accommodations reassignment to a vacant position and a part-time or modified work schedule. (\u00a7 12926, subd. (m); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7293.9, subd. (a).) The CBA also delineates such accommodations, provided that the alternative offered position is vacant and the employee qualifies for it. Here, Dr. Hekmat\u2019s retum-to-work release restricted Hanson from performing as a meatcutter and so Lucky then endeavored to identify an alternate, vacant position. Lucky ultimately offered Hanson the job of meat clerk. Sinclare testified that Hanson could perform most of the duties of the clerk position, and that the part-time nature of that position was in response to Dr. Hekmat\u2019s restriction against prolonged standing. The evidence shows there was no other available position for which Hanson qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Notwithstanding these two accommodations, Hanson contends that Lucky discriminatorily failed to accommodate his disability. Hanson would have Lucky acquire or modify equipment or devices (\u00a7 12926, subd. (m)(2)), by (1) providing him a hand brace, or (2) assigning him to a shift in which receiving meat was not involved, and (3) by providing him with \u201cergonomic knives,\u201d and (4) \u201cchanging his [Hanson\u2019s] hand dominance,\u201d all in an effort to return him to his meatcutter job. This contention fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">First, the report of Dr. Sanford Komblum, submitted in support of this contention, does not support Hanson\u2019s insistence that \u201c[b]racing would be [Reasonable.\u201d Dr. Komblum, the qualified medical examiner retained in connection with Hanson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation case, actually opined in his report filed two months after Hanson was discharged, that \u201cbracing would be reasonable <em>if he [Hanson\\ had to perform a great deal of hand </em>[/]wrist activities.\u201d (Italics added.) But Komblum did not state that bracing would enable Hanson to return to his meatcutter job. To the contrary, the doctor stated of the surgery on Hanson\u2019s right wrist \u201c/ <em>do not believe, however, that it will allow him to return to his regular work </em>activities.\u201d (Italics added.) Continuing, Komblum opined that \u201c[Hanson\u2019s] disability with respect to the right wrist/hand is that of no heavy types of lifting, pushing, pulling or torquing motions. <em>Because of the stability of the wrist he will not be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>aWe <em>to perform jobs that require a great deal of dexterity of the wrist.\u201d </em>Therefore, this report does not support Hanson\u2019s contention that a hand brace would have been a reasonable accommodation, nor does it support Hanson\u2019s own after-the-fact, self-serving deposition testimony that hand bracing would have been a reasonable accommodation. In fact, Dr. Komblum\u2019s report only serves to confirm Lucky\u2019s earlier conclusion that Hanson could <em>not </em>be returned to the meatcutter position.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Second, Hanson cannot be heard to complain that Lucky did not provide these measures because Lucky made <em>two other reasonable and effective accommodations </em>available to Hanson.  The employer is not obligated to choose the best accommodation or the accommodation the employee seeks. <em>(Soldinger </em>v. <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc. </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 345, 370 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 747].) Rather, \u201cThe Appendix to the ADA regulations explains that \u2018the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to' choose between effective accommodations, and may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide.\u2019 [Citation.] As the Supreme Court has held in analogous circumstances, an employee cannot make his employer provide a specific accommodation if another reasonable accommodation is instead provided.

However, Hanson acknowledges that the EEOC guidelines are merely recommendations; they do not set forth statutory requirements.  As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held, \u201c[t]he ADA and its regulations do not . . . create independent liability for the employer .for failing to engage in ritualized discussions with the employee to find a reasonable accommodation.

They consulted <em>Hanson\u2019s </em>doctor\u2019s permanent and stationary report and then asked <em>Hanson\u2019s </em>doctor for clarification of his report. \u201cThe [ADA] guidelines, and logic, indicate that an employer may use the opinions of physicians and others to gauge the employee\u2019s abilities and limitations. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Puckett </em>v. <em>Porsche Cars of North America, Inc. </em>(D.Nev. 1997) 976 F.Supp. 957, 965, affd. 165 F.3d 917.) Not stopping there, Frazier and Sinclare compared <em>Hanson\u2019s </em>doctor\u2019s work restrictions to the job descriptions, and consulted more than once with <em>Hanson\u2019s </em>vocational and rehabilitation specialist. The rehabilitation specialist emphatically told Sinclare that <em>Hanson </em>wanted to return to the meat department. Given that Lucky consulted with so many of <em>Hanson\u2019s own representatives, </em>identified the only available alternative position and offered it to Hanson, a reversal for the sole purpose of requiring Lucky to discuss the same issues with Hanson himself would unreasonably laud form over substance. We see no reason why this employer should be subjected to liability for failing to engage in the interactive process where the employee was reasonably accommodated <em>not once but twice, </em>particularly because Lucky acted in conformity with the CBA. (Cf. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Phoenixville School Dist. </em>(3d Cir. 1999) 174 F.3d 142, 164, fn. 10 [responding to concerns expressed in <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>U.S. Air, Inc., supra, </em>157 F.3d at page 753, and concluding in dicta where employer successfully makes reasonable accommodations as matter of law the employer did not act in bad faith].) All told, Hanson has raised no triable issue of material fact that Lucky provided him with no' reasonable accommodation. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence that Lucky discriminated against Hanson because of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">3. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Summary judgment was properly granted in this case because, regardless of whether Hanson can perform the essential functions of his job, Lucky carried its burden to show a nondiscriminatory business reason for terminating Hanson. Hanson has not demonstrated factual evidence or legal argument why Lucky\u2019s reason was pretextual. Furthermore, where Lucky made two reasonable accommodations, Hanson cannot demonstrate that Lucky discriminated against him by failing to accommodate his disability. Finally, because Hanson\u2019s FEHA claim fails, his claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The judgment is affirmed.
