We conclude that the termination did not violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">In September 1993, plaintiff Donald Lagatree, a legal secretary, commenced temporary employment with the law firm of Keesal, Young &amp; Logan (Keesal Young) in Long Beach. On March 14, 1994, Lagatree became a full-time employee of the firm. Throughout his employment with Keesal Young, Lagatree\u2019s job performance was rated satisfactory or better. He received pay raises and bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">In early June 1997, Keesal Young asked Lagatree to sign an arbitration agreement, which stated: \u201cI agree that any claims arising out of or relating to my employment or the termination of my employment with Keesal, Young &amp; Logan (\u2018KY&amp;L\u2019) that KY&amp;L may have against me or that I may have against KY&amp;L or its present or former employees or agents shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration .... Notwithstanding the above, I understand that I am not required to arbitrate the following claims: discrimination claims, wage and hour claims, and other related statutory claims.\u201d The agreement provided that disputes would be heard by a panel of three retired superior court judges and that the arbitration would be conducted pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The agreement also provided that \u201cthe entire cost of the arbitration, including legal fees, shall be borne by the losing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">Lagatree informed Keesal Young\u2019s managing partner that he did not want to submit disputes to arbitration. On or about June 30, 1997, Lagatree was discharged for refusing to sign the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Lagatree searched for another secretarial job. On September 12, 1997, he was offered a full-time position at the law firm of Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps LLP (Luce Forward). He accepted the offer. On September 16, 1997, Lagatree reported to Luce Forward\u2019s Los Angeles office for his first day of work. Later that day, Lagatree was given a \u201cLetter of Employment,\u201d which purported to \u201cconfirm[] our offer of employment to you in the position as a non-exempt legal secretary . . . , should you accept.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>letter further stated: \u201cIn the event of any dispute or claim between you and the firm (including employees, partners, agents, successors and assigns), including, but not limited to claims arising from or related to your employment or the termination of your employment, we jointly agree to submit all such disputes or claims to confidential binding arbitration, under the Federal Arbitration Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">On September 18, 1997, his third day at Luce Forward, Lagatree told his superiors that he would not agree to arbitrate disputes. Lagatree was advised that the arbitration provision was \u201cnot negotiable\u201d and that his continued employment was contingent upon signing the agreement. Lagatree declined to sign the agreement and was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">On February 13, 1998, Lagatree filed separate actions against Keesal Young and Luce Forward. Both complaints alleged that Lagatree had been terminated in violation of public policy for refusing to waive his constitutional rights to a jury trial and a judicial forum (U.S. Const., 1st &amp; 7th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 16). Lagatree also alleged that his discharge violated the California Unfair Competition Law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17200-17209)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Civil Code section 1668.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The law firms demurred to the complaints, arguing that an employer does not violate public policy by discharging employees who refuse to sign a predispute arbitration agreement as a condition of employment. The demurrers were sustained without leave to amend. Lagatree filed timely appeals from the dismissals. We ordered the cases consolidated for purposes of appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">In reviewing the ruling on a demurrer, \u201cwe are guided by long-settled rules. \u2018We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u2019 . . . Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. . . . When a demurrer is sustained, we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. . . . And when it is sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm. . . . The burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.\u201d (B<em>lank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">A. <em>Overview of Wrongful Termination Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">\u201cLabor Code section 2922 provides in relevant part, \u2018An employment, having no specified term, may be terminated at the will of either party on notice to the other. . . .\u2019 This presumption may be superseded by a contract, express or implied, limiting the employer\u2019s right to discharge the employee. . . . Absent any contract, however, the employment is \u2018at will,\u2019 and the employee can be fired with or without good cause. But the employer\u2019s right to discharge an \u2018at will\u2019 employee is still subject to limits imposed by public policy, since otherwise the threat of discharge could be used to coerce employees into committing crimes, concealing wrongdoing, or taking other action harmful to the public weal.\u201d <em>(Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654, 665 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373], citations and fn. omitted <em>(Foley).) </em>\u201cAccordingly, while an at-will employee may be terminated for no reason, or for an arbitrary or irrational reason, there can be no right to terminate for an unlawful reason or a purpose that contravenes fundamental public policy.\u201d <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1094 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680], overruled on other grounds in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ralee Engineering Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 66, 80, fn. 6 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Our Supreme Court \u201c[has] established a set of requirements that a policy must satisfy to support a tortious discharge claim. First, the policy must be supported by either constitutional or statutory provisions [or regulations enacted under statutory authority]. Second, the policy must be \u2018public\u2019 in the sense that it \u2018inures to the benefit of the public\u2019 rather than serving merely the interests of the individual. Third, the policy must have been articulated at the time of the discharge. Fourth, the policy must be \u2018fundamental\u2019 and \u2018substantial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 880, 889-890 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157]; see <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ralee Engineering Co., supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 75-76, 79-80, 89-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>\u201cThe cases in which California courts have recognized a separate tort cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy generally fall into four categories, where the employee is discharged for: (1) refusal to violate a statute (2) performing a statutory obligation . . . ; (3) exercising (or refusing to waive) a statutory or constitutional right or privilege . . . ; or (4) reporting an alleged violation of a statute of public importance . . . <em>(Pettus </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 402, 454 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 46], citations and fn. omitted; accord, <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ralee Engineering Co., supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 76.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">\u201c \u2018Yet despite its broad acceptance, the principle underlying the public policy exception is more easily stated than applied. The difficulty, of course, lies in determining where and how to draw the line between claims that genuinely involve matters of public policy, and those that concern merely ordinary disputes between employer and employee.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 889.) Unfortunately, \u201c \u2018[t]he term \u201cpublic policy\u201d is inherently not subject to precise definition. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1094.) Thus, \u201c. . . it is generally agreed that. . . courts should venture into this area, if at all, with great care and due deference to the judgment of the legislative branch, Test they mistake their own predilections for public policy . . . .\u2019 ... [C]ourts \u2018should proceed cautiously\u2019 if called upon to declare public policy absent some prior legislative expression on the subject.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1095.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">A claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy must be based on a \u201csubstantial public\u201d policy. (See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ralee Engineering Co., supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 75-76, 89-90.) In determining whether such a policy has been violated, the courts consider whether an employer and employee could circumvent the policy by way of agreement. Plainly, not all of an employer\u2019s duties nor all of an employee\u2019s rights \u201cinure to the benefit of the public at large rather than to a particular employer or employee.\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, 47 </em>Cal.3d at p. 669.) The fact that a duty or right can be modified or waived by agreement suggests that it does not confer a substantial benefit on the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">In <em>Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, the plaintiff learned that his immediate supervisor was being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for embezzlement in connection with his prior employment. The plaintiff told a company officer about the investigation. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff was terminated. In his wrongful termination action, the plaintiff asserted that his discharge violated the \u201cpublic policy that imposes a legal duty on employees to report relevant business information to management.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 669.) The Supreme Court disagreed, finding that the plaintiff\u2019s termination did not</p>\n<p id=\"b993-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>violate a substantial public policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 670.) As the court explained in footnote 12 of its opinion: \u201cThe absence of a distinctly \u2018public\u2019 interest in this case is apparent when we consider that if an employer and employee were <em>expressly </em>to agree that the employee has no obligation to, and should not, inform the employer of any adverse information the employee learns about a fellow employee\u2019s background, nothing in the state\u2019s public policy would render such an agreement void. By contrast, in the previous cases asserting a discharge in violation of public policy, the public interest at stake was invariably one which could not properly be circumvented by agreement of the parties. For example, in <em>Tameny[ </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1980)] 27 Cal.3d 167 [164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330, 9 A.L.R.4th 314], a contract provision purporting to obligate the employee to comply with an order of the employer directing the employee to violate the antitrust laws would clearly have been void as against public policy, and in <em>Petermann </em>[v. <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>(1959)] 174 Cal.App.2d 184 [344 P.2d 25], a contract provision which purported to obligate the employee to commit perjury at the employer\u2019s behest would just as obviously have been invalid. Because here the employer and employee could have agreed that the employee had no duty to disclose such information, it cannot be said that an employer, in discharging an employee on this basis, violates a fundamental duty imposed on all employers for the protection of the public interest.\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 670, fn. 12, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">Similarly, in <em>Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 1083, the court noted that \u201c[t]he obligation to refrain from . . . conduct [that violates public policy] is a \u2018duty imposed by law upon all employers to implement the fundamental public policies\u2019 of the state <em>... \\ it cannot be bargained away </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1100, citing <em>Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 670, fn. 12, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">More recently, in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ralee Engineering Co., supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 66, the plaintiff, a quality control inspector for a manufacturer of aircraft parts, alleged that he had been discharged for complaining internally that his employer was shipping defective parts to aircraft assembly companies. Relying on footnote 12 in <em>Foley, </em>the employer argued that the employee\u2019s claim did not concern a public benefit or interest. (19 Cal.4th at p. 84.) The Supreme Court rejected that argument, stating: \u201cThe critical distinction between the facts here and those at issue in <em>Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at pages 670-671, footnote 12, is that there the violations of internal practices affected only the employer\u2019s interest, while here defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct potentially jeopardized airline passenger safety. Protecting airline passengers, therefore, is the relevant fundamental public policy at issue. Promoting airline safety\u2014the subject of the federal regulations\u2014constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>a policy of sufficient public importance. As plaintiff points out, travel by any common carrier inevitably concerns the public, because a common carrier\u2019s mistake or a manufacturer\u2019s defective part can cause multiple casualties.\u201d (19 Cal.4th at p. 85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\"><em>Post-Foley </em>decisions of the Courts of Appeal have been faithful to the analysis in <em>Foley's </em>footnote 12. In <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1117 [279 Cal.Rptr. 453], the plaintiff alleged that he had been discharged for notifying upper management that other employees were possibly engaged in illegal conduct on the job, including bribery, embezzlement, tax evasion, drug trafficking, and violations of federal antitrust laws. In holding that the employee had adequately pleaded a public policy claim, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">\u201cThe public nature of the interest at stake in this case becomes apparent under the hypothetical test suggested in the margin of the <em>Foley </em>decision. (47 Cal.3d at p. 670, fn. 12.) In explaining why there was no public interest in the case before it, the court [in <em>Foley] </em>noted that if an employer and employee expressly agreed that the employee had no obligation to, and should not, inform the employer of any adverse information the employee learned about a fellow employee\u2019s background, nothing in the state\u2019s public policy would render such an agreement void. . . . This is because the adverse information in <em>Foley </em>served only the employer\u2019s interest, not the public\u2019s interest, and thus there was no public interest at stake in preventing such report.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">\u201cThat is a critical distinction between the facts alleged in <em>Foley </em>and those in this case. . . . [T]he burden of suspected misconduct in this case was not confined to the interests of the employer alone. An agreement prohibiting an employee from informing anyone in the employer\u2019s organization about reasonably based suspicions of ongoing criminal conduct by coworkers would be a disservice not only to the employer\u2019s interests, but also to the interests of the public and would therefore present serious public policy concerns not present in <em>Foley.\u201d (Collier </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1124-1125, followed in <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1149-1150 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 718] [employer violates public policy by terminating employee for reporting to management that company was violating wage and hour laws].)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">In <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1418 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 172], the plaintiff, who worked for a defense contractor, informed his superiors that the company was overbilling the government. Despite a commendable work record, the plaintiff was discharged. He sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>for wrongful termination, alleging that he had been discharged for reporting violations of the federal False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001), which prohibits the making of knowingly false statements to any federal department or agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">In affirming a jury verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, the Court of Appeal acknowledged that, in <em>Foley, </em>\u201c. <em>. . </em>the court explained [that] the absence of a substantial public interest was \u2018apparent\u2019 because the employer and employee could have properly agreed the employee should not inform the employer of any such adverse information about a co-employee\u2019s background. . . . Here, by contrast, it would be clearly improper for [the employer] to prohibit employees, particularly employees such as [the plaintiff,] whose job was to monitor contract performance, from reporting or disclosing suspected violations of governmental contracts.\u201d (17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1433.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Finally, in a pair of cases addressing whether workplace drug-testing programs violate an employee\u2019s right of privacy under the state Constitution (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1), two Courts of Appeal, although reaching opposite conclusions, are noteworthy because they both applied the analysis set forth in <em>Foley's </em>footnote 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">In <em>Semore </em>v. <em>Pool </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1087 [266 Cal.Rptr. 280], the plaintiff was discharged for refusing to take a random drug test (a pupillary reaction eye test). He filed suit for wrongful termination, alleging a violation of his right of privacy. The trial court sustained the employer\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the employer had a compelling interest in a drug-free workplace, that the drug test at issue was nonintrusive, and that employees should expect to be tested in such a manner to determine their fitness for work. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1093.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed. In doing so, the court found that the employer and employee could not have entered into a valid contract, obligating the employee to take a drug test. The court stated: \u201cWhile plaintiff could contractually agree not to assert his right to privacy, we think it clear that the employer could not use such an agreement to circumvent the public policy favoring privacy, and the employer could not successfully enforce such a contractual agreement if it intruded on plaintiff\u2019s right to privacy. ... If the intrusion violates the right to privacy, it is illegal whether or not it is pursuant to an agreement. If pursuant to such an agreement, the agreement would be unenforceable because it would be against public policy.\u201d (217 Cal.App.3d at p. 1097, citation and fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">In <em>Luck </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1 [267 Cal.Rptr. 618], the plaintiff was terminated for refusing to submit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>urine sample as part of an unannounced drug test. She, too, based her public policy claim on the state constitutional right of privacy. A jury returned a verdict in her favor, and the employer appealed. The First District Court of Appeal held that the public policy claim was without merit. The court relied in part on <em>Foley\u2019s </em>footnote 12, as follows: \u201cMeasured against the <em>Foley </em>standard, [the plaintiff] did not state a cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. The right to privacy is, by its very name, a private right, not a public one. The parties could have lawfully agreed that [the plaintiff] would submit to urinalysis without violating any public interest. Such an agreement between [the plaintiff] and [the employer] would not have been against public policy. . . . Therefore, under <em>Foley, </em>there was no violation of <em>public </em>policy.\u201d (218 Cal.App.3d at p. 28, italics in original.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In accordance with the foregoing authorities, we first identify the alleged rights underlying Lagatree\u2019s wrongful termination claim. We then determine whether those rights can be \u201cbargained away\u201d <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1100) or \u201ccircumvented by agreement of the parties\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 670, fn. 12). If so, we consider other factors, if any, bearing on whether Lagatree\u2019s claim is supported by a substantial public policy. Applying that analysis here, we ultimately conclude that the rights at issue are subject to waiver by agreement and that additional factors weigh against the recognition of a public policy claim. As a result, the demurrers were properly sustained without leave to amend. (See <em>Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 670 &amp; fn. 12; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ralee Engineering Co., supra, 19 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 75-76, 89-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The rights underlying Lagatree\u2019s claim are easily identified: an individual\u2019s constitutional rights to a jury trial and a judicial forum for the resolution of disputes. The question thus becomes whether those rights can be waived by agreement. As a general rule, they are subject to waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">With respect to the right to trial by jury, our Constitution provides: \u201cA jury may be waived in a criminal cause by the consent of both parties expressed in open court by the defendant and the defendant\u2019s counsel. In a civil cause a jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as prescribed by statute.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16.) Under the Code of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>Procedure, \u201c[t]rial by jury may be waived . . . by the . . . parties to an issue of fact in any of [several] ways.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 631, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">Indeed, in criminal cases, even where the defendant\u2019s life is at stake, a jury can be waived. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188, 1207-1210 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 240, 939 P.2d 354].) As for waiver in civil actions, one court has noted: \u201c[T]he California Constitution cannot be read to prohibit individuals from waiving, in advance of any pending action, the right to trial by jury in a civil case. ff[] Our conclusion is supported by those cases upholding the validity of arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>(Trizec Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1616, 1618 [280 Cal.Rptr. 885].) It therefore appears that, as a general matter, the right to a jury trial can be bargained away.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Similarly, the right to a judicial forum can generally be waived by contract: \u201c[I]t has always been understood without question that parties could eschew [a] jury trial ... by agreeing to a method of resolving [a] controversy, such as arbitration, which does not invoke a judicial forum. ...

More specifically, we examine whether a predispute arbitration agreement is valid where (1) an employer insists on such an agreement as a condition of employment, and (2) an employee signs the agreement to avoid being discharged. That question, in turn, requires an understanding of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) and its California counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">B. <em>Enforcement of Arbitration Agreements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">\u201cThe FAA was designed \u2018to overrule the judiciary\u2019s long-standing refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate,\u2019 . . . and to place such agreements \u2018 \u201cupon the same footing as other contracts[.]\u201d \u2019 . . . While Congress was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>doubt aware that the Act would encourage the expeditious resolution of disputes, its passage \u2018was motivated, first and foremost, by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties had entered.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Volt Info.

The words \u201cinvolving commerce\u201d are to be interpreted broadly since the FAA \u201cembodies Congress\u2019 intent to provide for the enforcement of arbitration agreements within the full reach of the Commerce Clause.\u201d <em>(Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 483, 490 [107 S.Ct. 2520, 2526, 96 L.Ed.2d 426]; accord, <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. </em>v. <em>Dobson </em>(1995) 513 U.S. 265, 273-275 [115 S.Ct. 834, 839-840, 130 L.Ed.2d 753].)

(See, e.g., <em>Mitsubishi Motors </em>v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 614, 625-626 [105 S.Ct. 3346, 3353-3354, 87 L.Ed.2d 444]; <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 1, 10-16 &amp; fn. 9 [104 S.Ct. 852, 855-861, 862-864, 79 L.Ed.2d 1]; <em>id. </em>at pp. 19-21 (conc., and dis. opn. of Stevens, J.); <em>Moses H. Cone Hospital </em>v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp., supra, </em>460 U.S. at pp. 24-25 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 941-942.) More recently, however, the court has stated that \u201c[w]hen deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter . . . , courts generally . . . should apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.\u201d <em>(First Options of Chicago, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 938, 944 [115 S.Ct. 1920, 1924, 131 L.Ed.2d 985].) But the applicability of state law is not without limits: \u201cWe note ... the choice-of-law issue that arises when defenses such as . . . unconscionability ... are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>asserted. In instances such as these, the text of \u00a7 2 [of the FAA] provides the touchstone for choosing between state-law principles and the principles of federal common law envisioned by the passage of that statute: An agreement to arbitrate is valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, as a matter of federal law . . . , \u2018save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u2019 . . . Thus state law, whether of legislative or judicial origin, is applicable if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally. A state-law principle that takes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue does not comport with this requirement of \u00a7 2. . . .A court may not, then, in assessing the rights of litigants to enforce an arbitration agreement, construe that agreement in a manner different from that in which it otherwise construes nonarbitration agreements under state law. Nor may a court rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law holding that enforcement would be unconscionable . . . .\u201d <em>(Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>482 U.S. at p. 492, fn. 9 [107 S.Ct. at p. 2527], citations and italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">\u201c[I]n applying general state-law principles of contract interpretation to the interpretation of an arbitration agreement within the scope of the Act . . . , due regard must be given to the federal policy favoring arbitration, and ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration.\u201d <em>(Volt Info.

Typically, courts look to the parties\u2019 contract and business operations in determining whether the contract falls within the scope of the FAA. <em>(Ideal Unlimited Services </em>v. <em>Swift-Eckrich, Inc. </em>(D.P.R. 1989) 727 F.Supp. 75, 76.) Here, \u201c[t]here is no showing that [Lagatree,] while performing his duties under the employment contract[,] was working \u2018in\u2019 commerce, was producing goods for commerce, or was engaging in activity that affected commerce, within the meaning of [the FAA].\u201d <em>(Bernhardt </em>v. <em>Polygraphic Co. </em>(1956) 350 U.S. 198, 200-201 [76 S.Ct. 273, 275, 100 L.Ed. 199].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the parties in this case have relied on decisions construing the FAA and so shall we.

As one court has recognized: \u201c[I]t is unclear what difference it would make if this case were deemed to be outside the scope of the FAA. The parties\u2019 agreement would still be a contract that waives [the employee\u2019s] right to a judicial forum for employment-related claims and agrees to submit those claims to arbitration. [The employer] would still have the right to seek enforcement of that contract. Although the applicability of the FAA may be significant in the sense that the statute prescribes certain procedural rules that might not otherwise obtain, we have little doubt that, even if an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>arbitration agreement is outside the FAA, the agreement still may be enforced . . . .\u201d <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Burns Intern. Security Services </em>(D.C.Cir. 1997) 105 F.3d 1465, 1472 [323 App.D.C. 133].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">Assuming arguendo that the FAA does not apply, we would assess the validity of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreements under the California Arbitration Act (CAA) (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1280-1294.2). Like the FAA, the CAA provides: \u201cA written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cCalifornia law incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the Federal Arbitration Act, including a presumption in favor of arbitrability . . . and a requirement that an arbitration agreement must be enforced on the basis of state law standards that apply to contracts in general. . . .\u201d <em>(Engalla </em>v. <em>Permanente Medical Group, Inc., supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 971-972, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Consequently, we need not decide whether the FAA applies. Even if it does not, we would reach the same result under the virtually identical provision of the CAA. \u201cIn most important respects, the California statutory scheme on enforcement of private arbitration agreements is similar to the [FAA]; the similarity is not surprising, as the two share origins in the earlier statutes of New York and New Jersey. . . . Code of Civil Procedure section 1281, like section 2 of the [FAA], provides that predispute arbitration agreements are \u2018valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Great Western Fin.

As noted, if they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>enforceable, then an employee\u2019s rights to a jury trial and a judicial forum can be bargained away. And if a right or duty can be waived by agreement, it is not rooted in a substantial public policy, absent other factors to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">In <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 20 [111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26] <em>(Gilmer), </em>the plaintiff was required by his employer to register as a securities representative with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). His registration application, entitled \u201cUniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer,\u201d commonly known as a \u201cForm U-4,\u201d provided for the arbitration of disputes in accordance with the rules of the NYSE. Those rules mandated the arbitration of \u201c \u2018[a]ny controversy between a registered representative and any member or member organization arising out of the employment or termination of employment of such registered representative.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 23 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 1650-1651].) A Form U-4 is a standardized form, and its execution is a condition of employment for securities broker-dealers. <em>(Ibid.; Halligan </em>v. <em>Piper Jaffray, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1998) 148 F.3d 197, 198 &amp; fn. 1; <em>Seus </em>v. <em>John Nuveen &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(3d Cir. 1998) 146 F.3d 175, 177-178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">The plaintiff in <em>Gilmer </em>was discharged at age 62. He filed an action in United States District Court, alleging a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq.). The Supreme Court held that, despite the compulsory nature of the Form U-4, the plaintiff could not pursue a civil action and was required to arbitrate his ADEA claim. As the court stated: \u201cMere inequality in bargaining power ... is not a sufficient reason to hold that arbitration agreements are never enforceable in the employment context. . . . [T]he FAA\u2019s purpose was to place arbitration agreements on the same footing as other contracts. Thus, arbitration agreements are enforceable \u2018save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u2019 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. \u2018Of course, courts should remain attuned to well-supported claims that the agreement to arbitrate resulted from the sort of fraud or overwhelming economic power that would provide grounds \u201cfor the revocation of any contract.\u201d \u2019 . . . There is no indication in this case, however, that [the plaintiff,] an experienced businessman, was coerced or defrauded into agreeing to the arbitration clause in his registration application. . . . [T]his claim of unequal bargaining power is best left for resolution in specific cases.\u201d (500 U.S. at p. 33 [11 S.Ct. at pp. 1655-1656], citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">As we read <em>Gilmer, </em>a predispute arbitration agreement is not invalid merely because it is imposed as a condition of employment. By directing that claims of economic coercion be decided on a case-by-case basis, the court in <em>Gilmer </em>necessarily concluded that compulsory arbitration agreements are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>invalid per se. Put another way, under <em>Gilmer, </em>the mandatory nature of an arbitration agreement does not, by itself, render the agreement unenforceable. This conclusion finds support in <em>post-Gilmer </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">In <em>Seus </em>v. <em>John Nuveen &amp; Co., Inc., supra, </em>146 F.3d 175, the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that a Form U-4 is an invalid contract of adhesion. As the court put it, \u201cThis very argument was rejected in <em>Gilmer </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 184.) The court continued: \u201cIn order for a contract to be invalidated as a contract of adhesion, the plaintiff \u2018must allege both a lack of meaningful choice about whether to accept the provision in question, and that the disputed provisions were so onesided as to be oppressive.\u2019 . . . The district court found . . . that the terms of [the] Form U-4 were neither oppressive nor unconscionable. . . . We agree.\u201d (Ibid.; accord, <em>Koveleskie </em>v. <em>SBC Capital Markets, Inc., supra, </em>167 F.3d at pp. 366-367 [Form U-4 not an unconscionable contract of adhesion where it was offered on \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis]; <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith </em>(1st Cir. 1999) 170 F.3d 1, 17 [Form U-4 not invalid even though arbitration provision was nonnegotiable, and employer would not hire person who refused to sign form].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Similarly, in <em>Beauchamp </em>v. <em>Great West Life Assur. Co. </em>(E.D.Mich. 1996) 918 F.Supp. 1091, the court held that a Form U-4 was not an invalid contract of adhesion. Citing <em>Gilmer, </em>the court concluded that the form was not unconscionable. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1098-1099.) The court also commented that \u201c[u]nder plaintiff\u2019s theory, practically every condition of employment would be an \u2018adhesion contract\u2019 which could not be enforced because it would have been presented to the employee by the employer in a situation of unequal bargaining power on a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 basis.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1098.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Nor is <em>Gilmer </em>limited to employment in the securities industry. In <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>UHC Management Co., Inc. </em>(N.D.Ala. 1997) 967 F.Supp. 1240, the plaintiff employees, who worked for United Healthcare Corporation, signed an acknowledgment form and received an employee handbook mandating the arbitration of employment-related disputes. When the employees filed an action alleging race discrimination, the employer moved to stay the proceedings so that the parties could proceed with arbitration. In attempting to avoid arbitration, the employees asserted that the arbitration provisions had been offered on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1257.) They also claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>that \u201cthe arbitration policy was a mandatory condition of employment [since] an employee\u2019s choice was to accept the agreement to arbitrate employment disputes or discontinue his or her employment. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1257, fn. 17.) The court enforced the arbitration clause, stating: \u201c[A]ssuming <em>arguendo </em>that the arbitration agreements are adhesive\u2014i.e., that they were offered on a take it or leave it basis with no opportunity for bargaining on the part of the plaintiffs\u2014the agreements to arbitrate are nonetheless valid and enforceable. . . . \u2018[T]here is nothing inherently unfair or oppressive about arbitration clauses.\u2019 ... In fact, . . . the FAA shows a strong federal policy in favor of arbitration. . . . Second, nothing about the present agreement is unconscionable or overbearing. It simply requires the plaintiffs to submit their employment claims to arbitration rather than sue in court. In light of the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration, this agreement is not unconscionable.\u201d (967 F.Supp. at p. 1257, citations and fn. omitted; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 1250-1251 [discussing Gilmer]; accord, <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>(D.Minn. 1993) 835 F.Supp. 1104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">And in <em>Rhode </em>v. <em>E &amp; T Investments, Inc. </em>(M.D.Ala. 1998) 6 F.Supp.2d 1322, the court applied <em>Gilmer </em>to a dispute involving the purchase of a mobilehome. There, the purchase agreement contained an arbitration clause, and the parties also executed a separate arbitration agreement. The buyer filed a civil action against the seller and the manufacturer of the home, alleging breach of contract, among other things. The defendants moved to compel arbitration. In response, the buyer argued that the arbitration provisions were unconscionable. He predicted that \u201c \u2018if all manufacturers and dealers [of mobilehomes] require the execution [of an arbitration agreement] as a condition precedent to closing the sale, the consumer is put into the unenviable position of either having to acquiesce to the seller\u2019s will or live in a tent.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1328.) The court rejected the unconscionability argument, concluding that the buyer \u201cfail[ed] to allege any facts to support the finding that arbitration would preclude [him] from bringing his claims against Defendants or that an arbitrator could not award [the] full panoply of relief available [under the] law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Turning our attention to California case law, we find the same trend. In <em>24 Hour Fitness, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1199 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 533], the plaintiff employee signed an arbitration agreement and certified that she had read the employer\u2019s personnel handbook, which described the arbitration process in detail. The employee later filed suit, alleging that she had been constructively discharged as a result of sexual harassment. In an effort to avoid arbitration, she relied on the CAA, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court found the agreement to be valid, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-4\">\u201c[U]nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element .... The procedural element focuses on the unequal bargaining positions and hidden terms common in the context of adhesion contracts. . . .

After they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>discharged, they each filed a civil action alleging wrongful termination under state law. The courts held that the FAA required the claims to be arbitrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">California courts have also addressed the enforceability of arbitration agreements between securities brokers and their clients. <em>(Macaulay </em>v. <em>Norlander </em>(1992) 12 Cal.App.4th 1 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 204]; <em>Strotz </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 208 [272 Cal.Rptr. 680], overruled on other grounds in <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Great Western Fin.

Two clients, who had signed the agreement, filed civil actions alleging that they had been defrauded. The firm petitioned the superior court to compel arbitration of the disputes. The superior court denied the petition. The Court of Appeal reversed, noting that \u201c \u2018[i]n the context of adhesion contracts, the courts have held that the inclusion of an arbitration provision is not per se unconscionable, particularly in a commercial transaction. . . \u201d (12 Cal.App.4th at p. 6, citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">In <em>Strotz, </em>another broker/client case, the court stated: \u201cWhere an agreement to arbitrate exists, the parties\u2019 mutual promises to forego a judicial determination and to arbitrate their disputes provide consideration for each other. Both parties give up the same rights and thus neither gains an advantage over the other.\u201d (223 Cal.App.3d at p. 216.)

In those cases, however, it is not the requirement of arbitration alone which makes the provision unfair but rather the place or manner in which the arbitration is to occur.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 216, fn. 7. ) Consequently, \u201c. . . the fact that one party later seeks to avoid his agreement to arbitrate cannot alone preclude enforcement of the agreement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Finally, in <em>Izzi </em>v. <em>Mesquite Country Club </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1309 [231 Cal.Rptr. 315], the court enforced an arbitration clause contained in a purchase agreement for a condominium, stating: \u201cEven assuming arguendo the purchase agreement was adhesive in nature, we would still view it as enforceable. There is nothing in the circumstances of this case from which it appears the arbitration provision conflicts with the reasonable expectations of an ordinary person or is unduly oppressive or unconscionable. . . . The rules of the American Arbitration Association specified by the clause as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>governing the resolution of disputes are generally regarded to be neutral and fair.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] In other words, even if defendants did have bargaining power superior to that of plaintiffs, the application of the arbitration clause to this dispute does not engender any unjust advantage to defendants. The invocation of the adhesion doctrine is unwarranted on these facts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1318, citation and fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">D. <em>Validity of the Arbitration Agreements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">As we have seen, the cases uniformly agree that a compulsory predispute arbitration agreement is not rendered unenforceable just because it is required as a condition of employment or offered on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis. An employee who signs such an agreement is obligated to submit employment-related disputes to arbitration; if he refuses to do so, the courts stand ready to compel arbitration.  Yet, as Lagatree would have it, he can refuse to sign an arbitration agreement, be discharged, and strike gold with a wrongful termination suit. The law does not permit such an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">As stated, if a claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy is based on a right or duty that can be bargained away, the claim is not rooted in a substantial public policy, absent other factors to the contrary. As one commentator has noted: \u201cThe pertinent question is whether, in the overall mix, the nature of the forum for future disputes is a subject that may be determined by contract or whether this term belongs to the nonwaivable, nonmodifiable category and, hence, is outside of the realm of contract.\u201d (Estreicher, <em>Predispute Agreements to Arbitrate Statutory Employment Claims </em>(1997) 72 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1344, 1354.) We think it plain that, under both federal and state law, an employee\u2019s rights to a jury trial and a judicial forum can be validly waived by agreement, even where the waiver is required as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>condition of employment. As a result, those rights do not implicate a substantial public policy, absent other factors to the contrary. Here, we find that other factors reinforce the conclusion that a public policy claim should not be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">To date, wrongful termination cases involving public policy violations have typically concerned employer conduct that burdened the public good with an actual detriment and conferred absolutely no benefit on the public. By way of example, in <em>Tameny </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 167 [164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330, 9 A.L.R.4th 314], the employer insisted that an employee participate in an illegal price-fixing scheme; in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ralee Engineering Co., supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 66, the employer retaliated against an employee for complaining to management that the company was making defective aircraft parts; in <em>Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 65 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373], the employer was accused of sex discrimination; in <em>Petermann </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 184 [344 P.2d 25], the employer instructed an employee to perjure himself before a state legislative committee; and in <em>Hentzel </em>v. <em>Singer Co. </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 290 [188 Cal.Rptr. 159, 35 A.L.R.4th 1015], the employer discharged an employee for protesting unsafe working conditions. In all of these cases, \u201cgeneral social policies [were] advanced\u201d by permitting a wrongful termination claim in violation of public policy. <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Ralee Engineering Co., supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Here, general social policies will be advanced by <em>not </em>allowing a wrongful termination claim. This is so because public policy favors the resolution of disputes through arbitration. To impose liability in a case such as this would thwart that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">By enacting the CAA, \u201cthe Legislature has expressed a \u2018strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Moncharsh </em>v. <em>Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 9 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899].) \u201cBecause of the relatively low cost and efficiency of the arbitration process, an individual [employee] involved in a typical [employment] dispute frequently will find an arbitral forum more accessible than the more expensive and cumbersome court system.\u201d <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>Conliffe </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 657 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 152, 871 P.2d 204].) \u201c[Arbitration has become an accepted and favored method of resolving disputes . . . , praised by the courts as an expeditious and economical method of relieving overburdened civil calendars . . . .\u201d <em>(Madden </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at pp. 706-707.) In short, arbitration is viewed as a \u201ccommon, expeditious, and judicially favored method [of resolving disputes].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 707; accord, <em>Mitsubishi Motors </em>v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 633 [105 S.Ct. at p. 3357].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>Lagatree points out that, although courts often laud the benefits of arbitration, \u201c \u2018the policy favoring arbitration cannot displace the necessity for a <em>voluntary </em>agreement to arbitrat\u00e9.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Victoria </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 734, 739 [222 Cal.Rptr. 1, 710 P.2d 833], italics added and omitted; accord, <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Walzer &amp; Gabrielson </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1501, 1505 [256 Cal.Rptr. 6].) \u201cArbitration ... is a matter of consent, not coercion . . . .\u201d <em>(Volt Info. Sciences </em>v. <em>Leland Stanford Jr. U., supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 479 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1256].) But, as <em>Gilmer </em>and its progeny make clear, the compulsory nature of a predispute arbitration agreement does not render the agreement unenforceable on grounds of coercion or for lack of voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">In <em>Seus </em>v. <em>John Nuveen &amp; Co., Inc., supra, </em>146 F.3d 175, the court addressed the question of whether the plaintiff had knowingly and voluntarily agreed to arbitrate her statutory discrimination claims arising under federal law. The court said: \u201cBy \u2018knowing\u2019 and \u2018voluntary,\u2019 [the plaintiff] means more than with an understanding that a binding agreement is being entered and without fraud or duress. Determining whether an agreement to arbitrate is \u2018knowing\u2019 and \u2018voluntary,\u2019 in her view, requires an inquiry into such matters as the specificity of the language of the agreement, the plaintiff\u2019s education and experience, plaintiff\u2019s opportunity for deliberation and negotiation, and whether plaintiff was encouraged to consult counsel. She does not contend that this heightened \u2018knowing and voluntary\u2019 standard is a <em>generally applicable principle of contract law. . . . </em>Applying that standard here would be inconsistent with the FAA and <em>Gilmer. </em>Nothing short of a showing of fraud, duress, mistake or some other ground recognized by the law <em>applicable to contracts generally </em>would have excused the district court from enforcing [the plaintiff\u2019s] agreement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 183-184, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">As one federal court has accurately noted: \u201cArbitration clauses such as the one in <em>Gilmer </em>are, for the average employee, not the product of bargaining but a non-negotiable adhesion contract. Consent to the arbitration clause is the price for obtaining or retaining employment.\u201d <em>(Krahel </em>v. <em>Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. </em>(D.Or. 1997) 971 F.Supp. 440, 448.) Even so, the courts have characterized the arbitration agreement in Gilmer\u2014despite its compulsory nature\u2014as consensual and voluntary. (See, e.g., <em>Penny </em>v. <em>United Parcel Service </em>(6th Cir. 1997) 128 F.3d 408, 412; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>General Motors Co. </em>(S.D.Ohio 1997) 978 F.Supp. 743, 748; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Toshiba America Consumer Products, Inc. </em>(M.D.Tenn. 1997) 959 F.Supp. 805, 809; see also <em>Securities Industry Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Connolly </em>(D.Mass. 1988) 703 F.Supp. 146, 152-153 [holding, <em>pre-Gilmer, </em>that state law requirement of voluntariness cannot interfere with validity of mandatory arbitration agreement] affd. (1st Cir. 1989) 883 F.2d 1114.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>Of significance, our own Supreme Court has observed: \u201cIn <em>Gilmer, </em>a securities representative had been <em>required </em>by his employer to register with the New York Stock Exchange. The registration application included an agreement to arbitrate any dispute arising out of the employment or termination of the employment . . . [\u00b6] The court reasoned that the plaintiff had agreed <em>voluntarily </em>to arbitrate his statutory claim . ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... In <em>Gilmer, </em>the court emphasized that <em>by agreeing </em>to arbitrate^] the plaintiff had traded the more extensive procedures available in the federal court for the simplicity, informality, and expedition of arbitration.\u201d <em>(Brosterhous </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 315, 331-332 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 87, 906 P.2d 1242], italics added.) Accordingly, we reject Lagatree\u2019s assertion that a compulsory arbitration agreement is invalid for lack of consent or voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Finally, Lagatree argues that an employee cannot be terminated for refusing to sign an unenforceable agreement. Specifically, he argues that the Keesal Young arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it made arbitration so costly that employees could not afford to pursue a claim.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> His argument focuses on two provisions in the Keesal Young agreement. We address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">First, the agreement stated that arbitration would be conducted in accordance with the rules of the AAA. (See fn. 18, <em>ante.) </em>Lagatree argues that the administrative fees imposed by the AAA are so high that they effectively preclude an employee from initiating arbitration. We disagree. Although the AAA rules do establish administrative fees (which include filing fees, hearing fees, and hearing room rental fees), rule 35 provides that \u201c[t]he AAA may, in the event of extreme hardship on any party, defer or reduce the administrative fees.\u201d (National Arbitration Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes, <em>supra, </em>rule 35, at p. 27.) Consequently, we perceive no unfairness with regard to the AAA administrative fees.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Second, Lagatree takes issue with the provision in the Keesal Young agreement that \u201cthe entire cost of the arbitration . . . shall be borne by the losing party.\u201d Because the agreement called for a panel of three retired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>superior court judges, so the argument goes, a claimant had to be prepared to pay $1,500 an hour in arbitrator fees if he ultimately lost the arbitration. As Lagatree sees it, Keesal Young required its employees to agree to arbitration, but failed to provide an affordable forum in which they could seek relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">In support of that contention, Lagatree relies on <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Burns Intern. Security Services, supra, </em>105 F.3d 1465. There, the District of Columbia Circuit held that, in an employment-related arbitration, an employer cannot require an employee to pay any portion of the arbitrator fees. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1483-1486.) The court stated: \u201cThese fees would be prohibitively expensive for an employee . . . , especially after being fired from his job, and it is unacceptable to require [him] to pay arbitrators\u2019 fees, because such fees are unlike anything that he would have to pay to pursue his statutory claims in court. . . . [H] Arbitration will occur in this case only because it has been mandated by the employer as a condition of employment. Absent this requirement, the employee would be free to pursue his claims in court without having to pay for the services of a judge. In such a circumstance\u2014 where arbitration has been imposed by the employer and occurs only at the option of the employer\u2014arbitrators\u2019 fees should be borne solely by the employer.\u201d (105 F.3d at p. 1484.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Of course, the question before us is not whether a particular provision in the Keesal Young arbitration agreement would be enforceable today. Rather, the question is whether Keesal Young violated a public policy that was \u201cnot only \u2018fundamental\u2019 and \u2018substantial,\u2019 but also <em>'well established\u2019 at the time of [Lagatree\u2019s] discharge.\u201d (Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 889, italics added; accord, <em>Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 668.) The public policy at issue must be \u201c \u2018. . . tether[ed] ... to specific constitutional or statutory provisions ... to ensure that employers have <em>adequate notice </em>of the conduct that will subject them to tort liability to the employees they discharge ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 889, italics added.) \u201c . . Th[e] determination [of whether an employer has violated public policy] depends in large part on whether the public policy alleged is <em>sufficiently clear </em>to provide the basis for such a potent remedy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Here, in order to make that determination, we look to the state of the law as it existed in June 1997, when Keesal. Young discharged Lagatree. (See <em>Luck </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co., supra, </em>218 Cal.App.3d at p. 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>Our survey of arbitration cases convinces us that, as of June 1997, there was not a well-established policy in California against imposing arbitrator fees on the losing party in an employment-related arbitration. On the contrary, the law authorized the use of such cost-shifting measures. Since 1961, with the enactment of the CAA (see Stats. 1961, ch. 461, \u00a7 2, pp. 1540-1552), the payment of arbitrator fees has been governed by section 1284.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1812, 1815 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 56]). That statute states: \u201cUnless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides or the parties to the arbitration otherwise agree, each party to the arbitration shall pay his pro rata share of the expenses and fees of the neutral arbitrator, together with other expenses of the arbitration incurred or approved by the neutral arbitrator, not including counsel fees or witness fees or other expenses incurred by a party for his own benefit.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1284.2 (section 1284.2), added by Stats. 1961, ch. 461, \u00a7 2, p. 1545.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">In <em>Tipton </em>v. <em>Systron Donner Corp. </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 501 [160 Cal.Rptr. 303], the court applied section 1284.2 in the context of an employment dispute. There, an employee had been discharged, and he challenged his termination through arbitration. The dispute was heard by a panel of three arbitrators.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 agreement stated that \u201call costs, including those incurred in the court proceedings, shall be assessed against and borne by the disaffirming party.\u201d (99 Cal.App.3d at p. 507.) In a two-to-one decision, the arbitrators found that there was good cause for the termination. In confirming the arbitration award, the trial court awarded costs to the employer for both the arbitration and the court proceedings. The trial court also ruled that the employee was liable for all of the neutral arbitrator\u2019s fees. On appeal, the employee challenged the award of costs, arguing that the fees of the neutral arbitrator\u2014approximately $10,000\u2014should have been split between the parties. The Court of Appeal rejected that argument, finding that, under section 1284.2 and the parties\u2019 agreement, the trial court had properly imposed the entire cost of the neutral arbitrator , on the employee. (99 Cal.App.3d at pp. 507-508.)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">In <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 952 [169 Cal.Rptr. 493], the claimant brought a medical malpractice claim against a hospital. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, the dispute was submitted to arbitration. The arbitration panel, consisting of three arbitrators, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>awarded the claimant $655,200 in damages but directed that the parties bear their own costs. In confirmation proceedings before the trial court, the claimant requested that the award be \u201ccorrected\u201d to reflect that he was entitled to costs of approximately $9,000. The trial court rejected the request and entered judgment on the award. The Court of Appeal affirmed, stating that, under the CAA (\u00a7 1284.2), the parties were to bear their own costs unless they had agreed otherwise. Because there was no such agreement, the claimant was not entitled to costs. (112 Cal.App.3d at p. 954; see also <em>Kauffman </em>v. <em>Shearson Hayden Stone, Inc. </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 809 [180 Cal.Rptr. 566] [affirming order awarding half of arbitrator fees to prevailing party].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">Thus, by enacting section 1284.2, \u201c[t]he Legislature has . . . established a policy that arbitration costs are to be paid by the party incurring them [unless the parties agree otherwise]. Under this statutory scheme, [a party] is not entitled to the costs [he or] she incurred in arbitration [absent an agreement to the contrary]. We recognize that there will be instances of unavoidably high arbitration expenses disproportionate to the amount recoverable . . . , resulting in inadequate compensation to the claimants, and are sympathetic to those finding themselves in that position. We believe however, that any relief in this regard must be provided by the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Austin </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 1817.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Against this backdrop of state law, we have the February 1997 decision of the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Burns Intern. Security Services, supra, </em>105 F.3d 1465, which was handed down approximately five months before Lagatree was terminated at Keesal Young. As far as we can tell, <em>Cole </em>was the first decision to hold that arbitrator fees in an employment-related arbitration cannot be imposed on an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Assuming that <em>Cole </em>made its way to California in five months, we doubt that employers here would have viewed it as a source of well-established public policy. For one thing, the language in <em>Cole </em>did not readily lend itself to common law claims for wrongful termination. By way of example, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number><em>Cole </em>court stated: \u201c[I]n <em>Gilmer[, supra, </em>500 U.S. 20,] the Supreme Court endorsed a system of arbitration in which employees are not required to pay for the arbitrator assigned to hear their statutory claims. . . . Under <em>Gilmer, </em>arbitration is supposed to be a reasonable substitute for a judicial forum. Therefore, it would undermine Congress\u2019s intent to prevent employees who are seeking to vindicate statutory rights from gaining access to a judicial forum and then require them to pay for the services of an arbitrator when they would never be required to pay for a judge in court.\u201d <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Burns Intern. Security Services, supra, </em>105 F.3d at p. 1484.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\"> Further, we question whether Cole\u2014a nonbinding decision from another jurisdiction\u2014could support a well-established public policy under California law.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The subsequent judicial treatment of <em>Cole </em>illustrates the pitfalls of relying on a single non-California case in attempting to determine state public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">At least two federal circuits, the Tenth and Eleventh, have followed <em>Cole. (Shankle </em>v. <em>B-G Maintenance Management of Colorado </em>(10th Cir. 1999) 163 F.3d 1230, 1234-1235; <em>Paladino </em>v. <em>Avnet Computer Technologies, Inc. </em>(11th Cir. 1998) 134 F.3d 1054, 1062). However, in a more recent decision, the Eleventh Circuit strongly suggested that <em>Cole </em>might not apply where, as here, the arbitration agreement requires that all fees and costs be paid by the losing party (as opposed to imposing all or a portion of them on the employee even if he prevails). <em>(Randolph </em>v. <em>Green Tree Financial </em>Corp.\u2014 <em>Alabama </em>(11th Cir. 1999) 178 F.3d 1149, 1158; see also <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, supra, </em>170 F.3d at pp. 15-16 [arbitration agreement may be valid if it mandates award of fees and costs to prevailing party].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The First and Seventh Circuits have also discussed <em>Cole, </em>but have concluded that a challenge to arbitrator fees should not be made unless and until such expenses have actually been imposed on a claimant. <em>(Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, supra, </em>170 F.3d at pp. 15-16; <em>Koveleskie </em>v. <em>SBC Capital Markets, Inc., supra, </em>167 F.3d at p. 366.) In those circuits, \u201c. . . the <em>possibility </em>that a plaintiff may be required to pay arbitration fees is not, by itself, a sufficient reason to invalidate an agreement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>arbitrate . . . because the arbitral panel may not in fact require the plaintiff to pay fees and, if a plaintiff believes that excessive fees have been levied against him or her, judicial review of the imposition of the fees is available after arbitration.\u201d <em>(Arakawa </em>v. <em>Japan Network Group </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1999) 56 F.Supp.2d 349, 354, italics added; see <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1999) 36 F.Supp.2d 183, 186-187.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">So, we state the obvious. As the post <em>-Cole </em>decisions indicate, a rule of law announced in one case may be modified, limited, or distinguished in later cases. For our purposes, it is sufficient to point out that the holding in <em>Cole, </em>as subsequently applied by the First and Seventh Circuits and as suggested by the Eleventh Circuit, would not support a public policy claim against Keesal Young.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Moreover, in light of California law on the subject of arbitrator fees (i.e., section 1284.2 and the cases construing it), employers did not have \u201cadequate notice\u201d in June 1997 that a cost-shifting provision would violate a \u201cclear\u201d public policy. <em>(Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 889.) Indeed, in <em>Tipton </em>v. <em>Systron Donner Corp., supra, </em>99 Cal.App.3d 501, the court enforced just such a provision. In addition, the provision in the Keesal Young agreement was mutual: It imposed arbitrator fees on the \u201closing party,\u201d be it the employer or the employee. In that sense, the provision was indistinguishable from a clause requiring the losing party to pay the prevailing party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u2014a clause that was undeniably valid. (See <em>DiMarco </em>v. <em>Chaney </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1809 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 558]; Knight et al., Cal.

There, the court held that, under the due process clause, a public school teacher threatened with suspension or dismissal cannot be required to pay half the cost of the administrative law judge (ALJ) who hears the teacher\u2019s challenge to the proposed action. The court found unconstitutional section 44944, subdivision (e), of the Education Code, which imposed half the cost of the ALJ on a \"teacher who did not prevail in the administrative proceeding or who prevailed at the administrative level but lost in a subsequent judicial challenge to the ALJ\u2019s decision. In reaching that conclusion, the four-member majority relied in part on <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Burns Intern. Security Services, supra, </em>105 F.3d 1465. (See <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 333, 355-356.) Assuming arguendo that the high court now views <em>Cole </em>as the law in California, we note that the issue of liability here is governed by public policy as it existed two years ago.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">E. <em>Remaining Theories of Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Lagatree argues that predispute arbitration provisions imposed as a condition of employment have the purpose and effect of lessening an employer\u2019s liability for its future wrongful conduct, thereby violating Civil Code section 1668\u2019s prohibition on exculpatory clauses. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">As one court has commented: \u201c \u2018Traditionally, the law has looked carefully and with some skepticism at those who attempt to contract away their legal liability for the commission of torts. This general policy of the common law found legislative expression early in California history with the enactment of Civil Code section 1668. This section made it clear a party could not contract away liability for his fraudulent or intentional acts or for his negligent violations of statutory law. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Baker Pacific Corp. </em>v. <em>Suttles </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1148, 1153 [269 Cal.Rptr. 709].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Lagatree\u2019s contention that a compulsory arbitration provision ipso facto constitutes an invalid exculpatory clause is foreclosed as a matter of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>\u201cSuch generalized attacks on arbitration \u2018res[t] on suspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to would-be complainants,\u2019 and as such, they are \u2018far out of step with our current strong endorsement of . . . this method of resolving disputes.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gilmer, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 30 [111 S.Ct. at p. 1654].) \u201c \u2018[B]y agreeing to arbitrate \u00e1 . . . claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the [cause of action]; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 26 [111 S.Ct. at p. 1652].) It follows that a compulsory arbitration provision does not affect an employer\u2019s liability for future wrongdoing. Potential liability remains the same; only the forum is changed.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">Lastly, Lagatree acknowledges that his claim under the Unfair Competition Law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17200-17209) rests on the same alleged violation of public policy that supports the wrongful termination claim. Because we have concluded that there was no violation of public policy, the unfair competition, claim fails as well.</p>\n<p id=\"A_N\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Spencer, P.

(218 Cal.App.3d at pp. 17-24 &amp; fn. 13.) The California Supreme Court subsequently disapproved <em>Luck </em>on that point. (See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 56-57 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b997-9\">Section 631, subdivision (a), of the Code of Civil Procedure lists the ways in which a jury trial can be waived, including the filing of a written consent with the court, the making of an oral statement in open court which is entered in the minutes or docket, the failure to appear at trial, the failure to announce in a timely manner that a jury is required, and the failure to make a timely deposit of jury fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Inherent in an arbitration agreement is a waiver of trial by jury\u2014a waiver that is not precluded by the Constitution or the Code of Civil Procedure.

Lagatree argues that this exemption covers <em>all </em>types of employment, such that the FAA does not apply to <em>any </em>employment contracts. That position is not without support. The Ninth Circuit recently adopted it. <em>(Craft </em>v. <em>Campbell Soup Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 161 F.3d 1199.) However, nine other circuits have construed the exemption narrowly, finding that it applies only to employees actually engaged in the transportation of goods in commerce. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 1202, fn. 5 [listing circuits]; <em>Koveleskie </em>v. <em>SBC Capital Markets, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1999) 167 F.3d 361, 363-364 [same].) Under the majority view, Lagatree would not be exempt from the FAA (assuming he satisfies the commerce requirement). In any event, given the basis for our decision, we need not construe or apply the section 1 exemption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">As our Supreme Court has commented, the phrase \u201crevocation of any contract\u201d is \u201csomething of a misnomer. \u2018Offers are \u201crevoked.\u201d . . .

The Assembly did not concur in the Senate amendments and sent the bill to a conference committee on the last day of the 1999 legislative calendar.
