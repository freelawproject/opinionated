By the act .of 1831, ch. 281, sec. 8, the levy courts or commissioners were authorized annually to levy a certain amount on each county, and on Charles county the sum levied was $446.66, and it was provided that this amount shall be collected in the \u201csame manner and by the same collector or collectors as county charges are collected. The levy courts or commissioners, as the case may be, respectively <em>taking bond </em>with sufficient security from <em>each </em>collector, for the faithful collection and payment of the money in the treasury of the eastern or western shore, as the case may be, at the time of paying other public moneys to and for the use of the State.\u201d According to the case of <em>State vs. Waters, et al., </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>302, a <em>specific </em>bond was necessary, and this money could not be collected on the general bond of the collector. The declaration in this case avers the proper appointment of the commissioners, and of the collector, the failure of the former to take the bond, as required by the act of 1831, ch. 281, sec. 8, and of the latter to collect and pay over the money as it was levied and placed in his hands for collection. The defendants demurred generally, and therebjr admitted the facts as averred in the declaration, and the question now arises, are the commissioners responsible for the amount of the money lost to the State through neglect in not taking bond? have they so far disregarded the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the law, and been so far guilty of oflicial negligence and misfeasance as to make them liable for this tax?</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-5\">In 1 <em>Ev. Harris, </em>358 to 370, the court will find precedents of declarations against officers for official negligence and misfeasance, and among them are actions against a sheriff for not collecting fees, and for levying more fees than the law allows on writ of execution, for bringing <em>fi. fa. </em>on more goods than necessary, and for various other cases of official misconduct, either wilfully or through neglect. In 1 <em>Saund. Pl. </em>&amp; <em>Ev., </em>337, under the title <em>\u201cCase,\u201d </em>it is said: \u201cCase affords a most extensive remedy for all <em>breaches of duty ex quare contractu; </em>and from a given state of facts the law raises an obligation to do a particular act, and there is a breach of that obligation, and a consequential damage, an action on the case founded in tort is the proper form.\u201d In this case the commissioners were duly elected or appointed by the popular power, and they proffered to become the officers or agents of the people, and there was a contract to perform a duty and receive compensation. In this position there was a legal obligation upon them to perform a positive duty, as specified and required by the law, and it seems to me, if, through negligence or mismanagement, they caused a loss to the State, the employer, they are clearly liable. On the same page of <em>Saunders </em>it is said: \u201cCase often lies as a concurrent remedy with <em>assumpsit, </em>.... it by no means follows, that because a promise may be implied by law, the action on the case, which is in terms founded on the <em>breach </em>of that <em>duty from ivhich </em>the law implies a promise, may not also be maintainable.\u201d Either <em>case or assumpsit </em>maybe maintained against one when a legal duty rests upon him, and he violates that duty. But, on the same page of the same book, we find language, it seems to me, clearly embracing this case. The author says: \u201cAnd in <em>Govett vs. Radnidge, </em>3 <em>East., </em>70, Lord Ellenborough observes, there is no inconvenience in suffering the plaintiff to allege his gravamen as consisting in a breach of duty arising out of an employment for hire, and to consider that breach of duty as tortious, instead of considering the same circumstances as forming a breach of promise implied from the same consideration of hire.\u201d And the author upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>this remarks: \u201cBut not only in the case of implied, but in express contracts, if they create a duty, case will lie; for although there be an express contract, a party is not bound to resort to that contract, but he may declare on the tort, and say that the party has neglected to perform his duty.\u201d Under the title <em>\u201cAssumpsit,\u201d page </em>110 of the same work, it is said: <em>\u201cAssumpsit </em>will lie for non-feasance, misfeasance, or malfeasance, for where a defendant has been guilty of a tortious neglect of his <em>duty, </em>the plaintiff may waive the tort and rely on the circumstances as forming a breach of promise implied from some consideration of reward.\u201d In <em>Angel on Lim., </em>43, it will be seen that the United States maintained an action of <em>assumpsit; </em>and on page 147, it is said, an action of <em>assumpsit </em>may be maintained for malfeasance, misfeasance, and non-feasance, and on page 89, the doctrine is still more distinctly'' stated, that <em>assumpsit </em>lies to recover damages for consequential wrongs or torts, which, though they are <em>ex delicto, </em>are <em>quare ex contractu; </em>and they arise from malfeasance, or doing what the defendant ought not to do; or non-feasance, or not doing what he ought to do; and misfeasance, or doing improperly what he ought to do properly. \u201e</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-5\">In this case there was, I suppose, an express promise to perform a legal duty, and for the performance of that duty the parties were to receive a reward. The}' were under an obligation to the State of making the levy, appointing the collector, and taking a bond with approved security, and for these services they were to be paid. They failed to perform their duty, and a loss has ensued to the State, and it seems to me, they are not only liable to the State, by which they were emploj'ed in their official character, but that an action may be maintained either in <em>assumpsit </em>or in <em>case. </em>If this money cannot be recovered out of the defendants, from whom can it be recovered? It has been decided the State cannot recover it out of the collector. 4 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>McH., </em>422, <em>State vs. Stewart. </em>Is the money then to be lost, when it was manifestly by the negligent conduct of the commissioners that the Stale cannot receive, or has not received it? There must be a remedy for a violation of a right or duty.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>Alex. B. Hagner </em>and <em>Alex. Randall </em>for the appellees:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-5\">1st. The defendants are not individually liable in an action by the State for an alleged neglect of duty. The duty of the commissioners of the tax, in taking bond from the collectors, is not merely ministerial, but is one <em>ciia </em>relation to which it is their duty to exercise judgment and discretion.\u201d In all such cases a public officer is not liable to an action, even though an individual may suffer by the mistake. <em>3 How., </em>98, <em>Kendall vs. Stockton, et al. </em>3 <em>Bouv. Inst., </em>181, and 2 <em>Do., </em>325, 502. 2 <em>Term Rep., </em>667, <em>Russell, et al., vs. Men of Devon. </em>20 <em>Maine, </em>246, <em>Reed vs. Belfast. </em>9 <em>Mass., </em>247, <em>Mower vs. Leicester. </em>17 <em>Conn., </em>478, <em>Chidsey vs. Canton. </em>8 <em>Barb., </em>649, <em>Morey vs. Town of Newfane. </em>Such an action as this by the <em>State </em>against the officers of a county, to render them <em>individually </em>liable, is unprecedented. If there is any responsibility, it is by <em>the county </em>to the State, and not by these <em>individuals. </em>And if the State could sue the county <em>at all </em>in such a form of action, the suit should be against <em>the commissioners </em>in their official, corporate capacity. <em>Act of </em>1839, <em>ch. </em>73. 6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>468, <em>Commissioners of Washington Co. vs. Nesbitt. </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>50, <em>Barrickman vs. Commissioners of Harford Co. </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>382, <em>Commissioners of Female Seminary vs. State. </em>But no action lies against the commissioners, even in their official capacity. 11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>50. The board of commissioners is an inferior jurisdiction, and the way to render them responsible as such inferior jurisdiction, is by a <em>mandamus </em>to compel them to take the bond with sufficient security, or to proceed by <em>indictment, </em>as in the acts of 1843, ch. 307, sec. 6; 1845, ch. 203, secs. 1, 2; and 1845, ch. 254. 3 <em>Wat. Arch., </em>463. But the State reserved to itself a special remedy for a failure to pay the colonization tax by the counties. By the act of 1834, ch. 197, it directed the Treasurer to deduct from the school fund belonging to each county in default the amount so uncollected. Was not this intended as a relinquishment of any other remedy she might have had, and is it not ample? This court will presume this to have been done, as all public officers are presumed to have discharged their duty, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the State has actually received from the school fund this tax. Of course <em>the State </em>has no cause to complain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-5\">2nd. But even if the commissioners, individually, are liable in such a case, and if their duties were purely ministerial, still the judgment below was correct, because there was no averment in the declaration that the omission to take bond was <em>wilful, </em>or <em>malicious, </em>or <em>illegal, </em>or <em>corrupt. </em>3 <em>How., </em>87. 13 <em>Adol. &amp; Ellis, N. S. 245, Linford vs. Fitzroy. 2 Nott &amp; McCord, </em>168, <em>Reid vs. Hood. Ibid., </em>172, <em>Young vs. Herbert. </em>2 <em>McCord, </em>107.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-7\">.. 3rd. If the averment in the declaration is intended to assert that the commissioners took a bond, but that the security was insufficient, then no action can lie, for it was, a mere matter of <em>discretion; </em>and if they honestly approved a bond which might have been good at the time, but <em>proved </em>insufficient, there can be no pretence that they are responsible, nor if the bond never was <em>sufficient, </em>if they honestly believed it sufficient. If the averment means that they <em>took no bond at all, </em>then there must he an averment of <em>corrupt </em>motive in neglecting to do so. They could not <em>compel the </em>collector to give bond. <em>They </em>are to <em>take </em>it when offered; but they could not <em>make </em>him <em>give </em>bond. The collector died, as <em>the nar states. </em>Suppose be died <em>just after his appointment, </em>are the commissioners to be held responsible for not performing an impossibility, in taking a bond from a dead man? It is impossible to tell from the <em>nar </em>how this breach of duty arose; whether the commissioners took <em>no bond at all, </em>or whether the bond they took, though sufficient at .the time of <em>taking, </em>proved insufficient, or whether they relied upon the <em>general </em>bond of the collector, and did not think it necessary <em>to take a special </em>bond, as was the case in <em>State vs. Waters, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>302. This case was not reported at the time of these transactions, and, until this decision, the <em>general </em>bond was thought to be sufficient. In either case the approval of the bond was a discretionary <em>act </em>\u2014 a <em>judicial </em>act by a special jurisdiction \u2014 and the failure to perform it is not the subject of such an action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-8\">4th. The <em>nar </em>says the commissioners <em>made the levy. </em>When? If it was not made at the proper time, it was void. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>should be alleged in the <em>nar </em>with certainty as to time and as to its legal effect,</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-5\">5th, There is shown no legal authority for the institution of 'this suit, and some should be exhibited. The remedies on the part of the State, a <em>mandamus </em>and <em>indict ment\u00f3me </em>to be found laid down, but none such as <em>this. No </em>individual, without express authority from the lows of the State, has any right to use the name and sovereignty of the State in suits in its own courts against its own citizens. Such a power as this will lead to mulcting the State in costs, as well as its citizens, without, authority, and may be used oppressively to the rights of citizens. Who would accept these petty offices, or any public trusts, at such a hazard as to be personally responsible for all the acts of the entire corporate body ? It may well be that these particular <em>individuals </em>may not have been, in point of fact, cognizant of the breach of duty alleged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-6\">The authorities cited by the appellant, only apply to actions by <em>individuals </em>against sheriffs and other <em>ministerial </em>officers. But no case can be found of an action <em>by the government </em>for damages against its own officers for alleged neglect of <em>judicial </em>duty. As well might the State sue the individual members of this court for damages on account of some decision deemed prejudicial to the State, or the Governor of the State, for not approving the bond of an inspector, or taking an insufficient bond.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b355-7\">Le Grand, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWA\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">We think the court properly sustained the demurrer to the declaration, and affirm their judgment. It does not clearly appear from the <em>nar </em>whether or not any bond was given by the collector, it is doubtful whether the allegation was intended to deny that any bond at. all was given, or only that an <em>insiifficient </em>one was given. Without going into an examination of the authorities bearing on the question presented by the demurrer, we consider it sufficient for the purposes of this case to refer to the decision at this term in the case of <em>Green vs. </em>Purnell, <em>Comptroller of the </em>Treasury, <em>(ante </em>329.) The principle there decided covers this case. The duty imposed upo* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the commissioners, was one requiring of them \u201cthe exercise of judgment and discretion.\u201d It was judicial and not ministerial. A mere error in judgment does not give to the State a right of action. The <em>nar </em>does not contain any allegation that the commissioners acted corruptly.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b356-6\">(Decided July 22nd, 1858.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
