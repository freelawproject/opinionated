</em>concerns,\u201d only avails' for the person for whose benefit it <em>was,-intended when obtained, </em>by the party obtaining it, and whether it was so intended for one claiming the benefit of it, is a question of <em>fact </em>for the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b356-9\">Where a policy provides that it shall be void, \u201cin case of its being <em>assigned </em>or <em>transferred </em>or <em>pledged without </em>the <em>previous consents in writing, of the insurers,\u201d </em>an assignment without such consent confers no right upon the assignee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b356-10\">'So far as <em>good faith </em>in <em>obtaining </em>the insurance is Concerned, a polity issued <em>\u201cfor whom it concerns,\u2019* </em>stands on the same ground as any other; for every such policy <em>supposes an agency, </em>and one who claims the benefit 6f it,- is <em>bound </em>by the <em>acts </em>ahd <em>representations </em>of the parties or agents Cohneeted with the business of <em>proinring it, </em>although obtained without his knowledge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aj_\">If any <em>misrepresentdtioil </em>of <em>ioUiedlinent </em>of.factS <em>material to the risk </em>be shown on the part of the agents or parties obtaining such a policy, it is void, no matter how innocent the party for whom it was <em>intended </em>may be, and no matter whether such misrepresentation or concealment be fraudulent, or' the result of negligence or inadvertehce on the part of such agents of parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AeQ\">The utmost good faith and fair dealing fire of the very essence of the contract of ins\u00fcffince, and every fact and circumstance which can possibly influence the mind of any prudent and intelligent insurer, in determining whether he will underwrite the policy at all, or at what premium, ought to be communicated t6 him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b356-13\">A statement made to the insurers, that the vessel \u201cis about r\u00e9ady to sail,\u201d or \u201cshe will sail soon,\u201d is not a promissory representation as to the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Ot sailing, which binds the assured and the breach of which will vitiate the policy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-5\">In answer to the question, \u201cwhat is the condition of the vessel as to seaworthiness?\u201d a representation that she is a <em>\u201cgood old vessel,\u201d </em>imports no more than that she is <em>seaworthy.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-6\">Whore a representation is made merely <em>on </em>information, the assured is not answerable for the truth of the <em>facts </em>stated, but only for the truth with which he has <em>staled </em>the <em>information received.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-7\">In a policy on a cargo of <em>lumber, </em>the implied warranty is, that the vessel is seaworthy to transport <em>such a cargo, </em>and a statement to the insurers, that on a previous voyage she had carried a cargo of <em>coal </em>without insurance, did not enlarge that warranty so as to require the insured to prove she was seaworthy to carry <em>coal.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-8\">The difference between a <em>representation </em>and a <em>warranty </em>is, that while the latter must be <em>literally </em>fulfilled, it is sufficient if the former be <em>substantially </em>complied with.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-9\">Seaworthiness is an <em>implied warranty </em>in every contract of insurance, and the assured need not, <em>in the first instance, </em>disclose any fact however material to the risk, which tends to show the ship was unseaworthy when she sailed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-10\">But when <em>inquiries </em>are made as to matters embraced in an <em>implied warranty, </em>such inquiries may render it necessary for the assured or his agent to disclose facts respecting which he might otherwise be silent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-11\">An inquiry, \u201cwhat is the condition of the vessel as to seaworthiness?\u201d i\u00a7 general and indefinite, not pointing to any particular fact, and imports nd more than an inquiry as to whether she was seaworthy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-12\">Such an inquiry imposed no obligation Upon the assured, to disclose facts tending to show the insufficiency of the vessel to carry a cargo of coal, or that she had been <em>discredited </em>by the marine insurance reports of the port where she was lying, or that ineffectual attempts had befen made to get her insured there.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-13\">It is well settled that the assured is not bouhd to disclose the fact, that the risk has been declined by others or the estimate they put upon it, unless information on the subject be particularly called for.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-14\">Under a policy on a cargo of lumber <em>\u201cat </em>and from Baltimore to Bostoh,\u201d the risk commences from the time the lumber is laden on board the vessel, and a <em>deviation </em>thereafter will avoid the policy, whether it occurs <em>before </em>or <em>after </em>the vessel actually leaves the port of departure.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-15\">A deviation avoids the policy because it <em>varies </em>the risk, and <em>delay </em>in <em>commencing of </em>prosecuting the voyage is as much a <em>deviation </em>as a divergence from its prescribed course, and will discharge the underwriters if <em>unreasonable </em>or inexcusable, and this rule applies as well to a policy <em>on cargo </em>as on <em>the vessel.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Not to deviate is as much an implied warranty in every insurance OK <em>'&amp; </em>voyage, as the seaworthiness of the vessel, and each of these warranties is implied whether the policy bo on the <em>ship </em>or on the <em>cargo.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-5\">A-delay, from the 19th of November to the 22nd of December, in <em>commencing </em>the voyage, is unreasonable, amounts to a deviation, and will discharge the policy on the cargo unless it proceeds from causes which justify or excuse it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-6\">What the actual causes of delay are, is a question of <em>fact </em>for the jury; the legal sufficiency of such causes, to justify or excuse it must be decided by the court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-7\">Delay resulting from the difficulty in obtaining a crew is excusable; but if occasioned by proceedings instituted in the Circuit Court of the United States, in admiralty; for the recovery of debts due for repairs to the ves\u00bb sel, by which she was seized, detained and sold, it is not excusable-.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-8\">The underwriter does not run the risk of obstructions occasioned by thb debts, insufficient acquittance, or neglect to pay debts of the assured, and this rule applies whether the policy be on the <em>vessel </em>or on the <em>cargo; </em>detention for such cause is not covered by the terms, \u201crestraints and detainments of all kings, princes or people,\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-9\">Where a delay in commencing the voyage is occasioned by debts of the vessel previously existing, and contracted without reference to the particular voyage; and the owner of the <em>cargo </em>insured is on the spot, the master cannot sell or hypothecate the <em>same </em>to pay such debts, except with the consent and authority of such owner, whom he must consult.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-10\">A prayer,

One of the grounds upon which the action was resisted was, that this assignment was illegal, not having been made \u201cwith the previous consent in writing of the insurers,\u201d according to the condition of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\">The lumber was ladened on board the Orb, by the 19th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>November 1852, and she sailed on the 22nd of December following, was wrecked in Hampton Roads on the 3rd of January 1853, and by this disaster, loss and damage resulted to the cargo. The defences were, that the policy had been discharged, 1st, by that kind of <em>delay, </em>in the inception of the voyage, which amounted to <em>deviation </em>in construction of law; 2nd, because of misrepresentation as to the time of sailing; 3rd, because of misrepresentation and concealment of material facts as to the condition of the Orb, which, if they had been truly communicated to the defendant\u2019s agents, would have caused the risk to have been declined or the premium enhanced; and 4th, because the policy was not certainly intended to cover the cargo of the plaintiff, who had therefore, no such interest in the policy as to give him a right of action upon it. Evidence upon all these points was offered by both parties, and is sufficiently indicated in the instructions acted on by the court below, the arguments of counsel, and the opinion of this court. The letter of Frisbie to Fall, so frequently referred to, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">' \u201cBaltimore, October 20th, 1852.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">Mr. Fall:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-7\"><em>Dear Sir: </em>\u2014 I have taken up two or three times with lumber for Boston, and have to give it up on account of insurance, they cannot get her insured at no price, and I could not get the coal freight to Providence; there was one man said he would load her without insurance, and I waited for him two weeks, and was to commence (his morning, and his partner came home and would not let him ship it.

If the jury believe from the evidence, that at the inception of the voyage mentioned in the evidence, the Orb was sufficiently tight, staunch and strong, for the performance of the voyage from Baltimore to Boston, with the cargo of lumber mentioned in the evidence, and that she was properly officered, manned and equipped for the performance of said voyage with said cargo, and that on said voyage, through storm and perils of the sea the said cargo was lost in whole or in part, the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this case to the extent of such loss, although the jury shall believe from the evidence, that there was delay or negligence upon the part of the captain of said vessel in commencing said voyage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">The defendant then offered the following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">1st. That the plaintiff cannot recover if the jury believe from the evidence, that when the Orb sailed from Baltimore in December 1852, she was not a sufficiently sound and staunch vessel for the voyage, at that season of the year from Baltimore to Boston, with the cargo insured, or if the jury find from the evidence that sire was not supplied at that time, nor afterwards with such sails, chains and anchors, as were proper precautions for a vessel of her loimage, in view of the ordinary and probable perils of said voyage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">2nd. That there was an implied warranty by the plaintiff, that the voyage should be made in the usual and direct course for seaworthy vessels, conveying from Baltimore to Boston such cargo as was the subject of insurance in the policy in suit, and any deviation can only be justified by necessity or lawful cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">3rd. If the jury believe from the evidence, that the Orb was seaworthy for the purpose of lying in port, that her cargo was on board by the 19th of November 1852, that repairs and supplies had been ordered and contracted for by her master and owners, and had beeu done and furnished before the 20th of November 1852, that by reason of the refusal or inability of said master and owners, to pay for such supplies and repairs, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>vessel was seized, detained and sold, under the libel and decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Maryland, given in evidence, so that she did not in fact sail' from Baltimore, by some days, as soon as she would have done in case she had not been so seized and sold, then the plaintiff' cannot recover, provided the jury find all the other facts assumed in this prayer, and that no effort to pay for said repairs and discharge said libels was made by the master, by sale or hypothecation of the cargo to a sufficient extent, and that no loss or damage occurred to the cargo insured before the 2nd of January 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\">4th. If the jury believe from the evidence, that it would have varied the risk and premium, accordingly as the vessel sailed in November or December 1852, so that the risk would have been declined, or a higher premium charged, if it had been known to the defendant\u2019s agents at Boston that the Orb would' not sail sooner than the 20th of December 1852, and that this was known at the time of the application for the policy sued-on by both Parker Fall and defendant\u2019s said agents, and that with a view of deciding on this contingency, said agents did ask Fall, when he applied for said policy, when the Orb would sail from Baltimore, and that Fall then represented that she would sail soon, and that the cargo insured wac in fact ladened on the vessel by the 19th of November 1852, and that full,, reasonable and sufficient time, to have been expected by the parties to the contract, for the commencement of the voyage had elapsed by the 25th of November 1852, then the plaintiff cannot recover, if the jury find that the Orb did not sail from-Baltimore before the 20th <em>of </em>December <em>1852. from the </em>causes given in evidence, provided they find that no loss or damage occurred to the cargo insured before the 2nd of January 1853, and also find all other facts assumed in this prayer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">5th.

Pratt of Baltimore on board the Orb for conveyance to Providence, had, shortly before the said 20th of October, been necessarily discharged at Baltimore on account of the leaky condition of the vessel whilst said Frisbie was master and part owner of her, and that. Frisbie was then advised not to take another cargo of coal, but to freight the Orb with a cargo of lumber, so that her seaworthiness would not be so severely tried, and that accordingly said Frisbie declined an offer from E. Pratt, before the said 20th of October, to freight the Orb again with coal, after the cargo of coal had been discharged as before stated, and if the jury further lind, that a vessel must be more strong, staunch and seaworthy, to carry a cargo of coal by sea than a cargo of lumber, and that before the said letter of the 20th of October was written, Frisbie knew that the Orb had been characterised in October 1852, as an unseaworthy vessel, by the report of the inspector of ships for the insurance offices at the port of Baltimore, and that when, as before stated, Fall was enquired of as to the seaworthy condition of the Orb, none of the above facts nor the contents of said letter were communicated by him to tile defendant\u2019s agents at Boston, except as hereinbefore expressly stated so to have been communicated, and if the jury believe that if the above facts, or most of them, or the contents of said letter had been then communicated to them, said agents would have declined the risk or enhanced the premium, then the plaintiff cannot recover, provided the jury believe the premium had never been paid to the defendant, and all other facts assumed in this prayer, and if they believe the premium has been paid, then the plaintiff is only entitled to recover that and its appropriate interest, in case no fraud was intended by the parties applying for the policy, by the representations made and failure to disclose their information.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>6th.

A stipulation against deviation \u2014 and delay from <em>unjustifiable cause </em>is deviation \u2014 is an <em>implied warranty </em>in <em>every </em>policy of marine insurance. \u201cIn short, whenever the delay exceeds a reasonable time, or is incurred for purposes unconnected with the true object of the voyage insured, it will amount to a deviation.\u201d (1 <em>Arnould on Ins., </em>42, 341, 342, 383, 387, 390, 400. 1 <em>Phillips on Ins., secs. </em>690, 692, 981, 983, 984, 988, 989, 995, 996, 998, 1002, 1020, 1021, 1031, 1050. 9 <em>Mass., </em>448, 449, <em>Coffin vs. Newburyport Marine Ins.

The reason of thus holding the insured <em>on cargo </em>responsible for a deviation is, that a stipulation against deviation is an <em>implied wan anty </em>in <em>the policy. </em>It is admitted by the counsel for the appellee, that a deviation in <em>the course of the voyage </em>would vitiate a policy on goods. Why so? The <em>owner of the cargo </em>lias no more control over the action of the master as to the prosecution of the voyage, than he has as to its <em>commencement. </em>It is therefore only and solely because of this implied warranty, that the insured <em>on cargo </em>is responsible for a deviation in the course of the voyage. And this same warranty, according to all the authorities, applies as well to a deviation occasioned by an <em>unjustifiable delay in the commencement </em>of the voyage, as to an actual turning from the usual route in the progress <em>of </em>the voyage, in addition to the cases before cited, reference is made to the following authorities, all of which were cases of policies on goods, and the distinction here attempted to be drawn was not even alluded to. 14 <em>Eng.

It was competent for the master to have sold or hypothecated the cargo to enable his ship to sail. <em>Abbott, </em>372, <em>note 2. </em>9 <em>Johns., </em>30, <em>Fontaine vs. Col</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>umbian Ins.

But that case merely established, that the negligence of the master as to the stowage of cargo, was neither covered by implied warranty nor by any express one in the policy in suit. Mr. Phillips cites the case without any suspicion that it was introductory of any change in the <em>law of deviation. </em>1 <em>Phillips, </em>592. The fact is, there are certain implied warranties, which if fulfilled at the commencement of the risk, make the negligence of the master and crew thereafter chargeable to the insurer, if loss occurs from any of the enumerated perils, and this Maryland case is an instance. But there are other implied warranties which remain in obligation to the end of the voyage, and any breach of them by the master or mariners is at the risk of the insured. Such is the implied warranty as to deviation. After stating the law as to the first class, and the doctrine of <em>pr\u00f3xima causa, </em>Mr. Phillips, (sec. 1050,) says: \u201cThis doctrine is limited to the acts and neglect of the master and crew, as such, in conducting the voyage or in charge of the subject. It intercepts and prevents a forfeiture of the insurance by reason of unseaworthiness, resulting from or continuing by reason of carelessness or mistake of the master or crew, <em>but it does not prevent a forfeiture by </em>deviation, which is in effect a violation of an express stipulation of the policy, imported by (.he mere description of the voyage,\u201d Nor is the law of deviation simply applied to the commencement and course of the voyage. A tardy landing of goods at the port of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>destination, is a deviation which discharges the underwriter. 1 <em>Phillips, sec. </em>998. Nor is the law silent as to the specific cause of deviation in this case. \u201cThe doctrine is laid-down in <em>La Guidon de la Mer, </em>that the underwriter does not run the risk of obstructions occasioned by the <em>debts, </em>insufficient acquittance or neglect to pay debts of the assured. The underwriters were held, in New York, not to be liable for the aggravation of a loss, by reason of the assured\u2019s not providing for supplying means to the master of an American vessel, to raise funds to repair at the island of St.- Thomas in the West Indies.\u201d 1 <em>Phillips, sec. </em>1046. 20 <em>Wend., </em>287, <em>American Ins. Co., vs. Ogden. 1 </em>Camp., <em>265, Jarratt vs. Ward. </em>What facts constitute a deviation, is a question of law for the court, and \u201cthe court and not. the jury are the judges whether the deviation be justifiable.\u201d 7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>291. 2 <em>Phillips, </em>585. 2 <em>Smedes &amp; Mar., </em>375.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\">2nd. The policy was discharged or rendered void, by the misrepresentation or concealment of material facts connected with the condition of the vessel. As to this part of the case, it is contended by the counsel for the appellee, that being insured on cargo, and as the policy was \u201cfor whom it concerns,\u201d he cannot be affected by the acts or misrepresentation and concealment of the captain acting for the owners of the vessel, or of his agent Parker Fall. This presents, first, the inquiry, whether a policy \u201cfor whom it concerns\u201d can possibly be used by any one, free of responsibility for the acts and omissions of those who in fact obtained it? They certainly act as <em>agents </em>\u201cfor whom it concerns,\u201d either originally or by adoption. 7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>450, <em>Newson vs. Douglass. </em>The subsequent adoption of this policy cannot exempt it from the law of concealment, and of fraud or misrepresentation in its procurement; for all such policies presuppose <em>an agency, </em>and that the parties obtaining them are the <em>agents </em>of those who adopt and use them. The proof shows who ordered the policy, and who applied for it. Abbott is, therefore, answerable for Frisbie and Fall and each of them. That the verdict found the vessel seaworthy, does not dispense with the doctrine of misrepresentation and concealment in relation to her seaworthiness; for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>there are grades and degrees of this, which <em>affect the </em>risk and vary the premium, or causean insurance to be declined. The first step is to ascertain the general principle which is to be the law of duty to agents applying for insurance. It is the familiar one of <em>uberrima Jides. </em>2 <em>G. </em>&amp; J., 162, <em>Allegre vs. Maryland Ins. Co. </em>We are next <em>to </em>see the principles of construction, which are to expound any representation made, premising that \u201cthe object of the assured in making a representation usually is to reduce the premium by showing the real to be less than the apparent risk. \u201d 2 <em>Duer on Ins., </em>656. 1 <em>Arnould, </em>489, 492. \u201cA representation imports not only what is expressed, but also all the natural and obvious inferences from it.\u201d 1 <em>Phillips, secs. </em>567, 550. The \u201cinsured is required, as a preliminary step, to communicate to the underwriter all other\u201d (excepting those the underwriter is bound to know) \u201cmaterial facts within his knowledge, or presumed to be so, or of which he is bound to be informed, that would directly tend to induce the underwriter not to subscribe the policy at all orto demand a higher premium.\u201d 1 <em>Phillips, sec. </em>571. There is an additional principle which affects and controls the preceding one, as to representation and concealment; \u201cmatters of implied agreement in the policy need not be represented by the assured in the first instance, but he is bound to make true answers to inquiries by the underwriter, relating to matters of implied warranty. And though no such inquiries are made, still, if the assured voluntarily make representations of this description, he will be bound thereby, and the policy will be void unless they are substantially true.\u201d 1 <em>Phillips, sec. </em>601. 1 <em>Arnould, </em>515, 517, 518. 2 <em>Duer, </em>572 to 581. The duty of the assured to answer truly questions, as to matters covered by implied warranties, shows that there are grades of differences in those matters, which may affect the underwriter\u2019s judgment as to taking the risk at all, or the premium at which it will be taken. In other words, that the underwriter wishes to know more than the mere implied warranty of itself communicates. 1 <em>Phillips, sec. </em>586. 8 <em>Pet., 581, Hazard vs. New England Marine Ins. Co. </em>The moment, therefore, that the underwriter inquires as to such matters, the whole law of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>cealment and representation is brought to bear on the assured. As to the points enquired of, the assured is in the predicament, as to disclosure and truthfulness, which the law imposes on him as to other matters which he is bound to communicate and represent truly to the underwriter in the first instance. 1. <em>Phillips, sec. </em>601. 4 <em>East., </em>590, <em>Haywood vs. Rodgers. </em>Now, if seaworthiness were not a matter of implied warranty, what would the assured in this case have been bound to apprise the underwriters of, under the rule requiring him to inform them \u201cof all material facts within his knowledge, or presumed to be so, or of which he is bound to be informed, <em>that would directly tend to induce the underwriters not to subscribe the policy at all, or to demand a higher </em>premium?\u201d If the <em>inquiry had been made </em>as to her then condition of seaworthiness, would not the owner of the vessel in the case of <em>Haywood vs. Rodgers, </em>have been bound to communicate the letter, which stated that \u201cthe ship was in very good order, but that he had a survey on her <em>on account of her bad condition9\u201d </em>\u201cA question of seaworthiness is determined by the usages of the port where the vessel is fitted out, in reference to the destined voyage.\u201d 8 <em>Pet., </em>581. Seaworthiness is variable, and relates t.o the voyage and cargo <em>to </em>be transported. 1 <em>Phillips, sec. </em>720, <em>note </em>3. The implied warranty only relates to seaworthiness, <em>for the voyage </em>proposed with the cargo proposed. The proof shows, that a vessel may be seaworthy to carry lumber and not so to carry coal. The verdict has only found, that the vessel was seaworthy to transport lumber from Baltimore to Boston. But that was not the inquiry put to Parker Fall, nor was that the representation he made. The insurer had the right to make the inquiry as to the <em>general </em>seaworthiness of <em>the vessel, </em>and it was <em>the </em>duty of Frisbie to <em>have </em>provided his agent with the means of fully answering the question, and more especially the duty of Fall to have supplied the insurers with all the information that had been communicated t.o him by Frisbie\u2019s letter of the 20th of October 1853. This was required by the law of concealment <em>after the inquiry had been made. </em>2 <em>Paine's C. C. Rep., </em>84 to 90, <em>Buckly vs. Providence Ins. Co. </em>The fallacy is in supposing, that, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>verdict has found seaworthiness for the particular voyage with the particular cargo, nothing has been concealed and nothing misrepresented. But as it often happens that the representation of the assured, or information of the insurer, reduces the implied warranty in favor of the assured, (1 <em>Phillips, sec. </em>602; 2 <em>Duer, </em>671,) so, on the other hand, <em>when inquiry is made </em>that may call for disclosure of facts beyond those covered by the implied warranty, the representations made may avoid the policy by their untruthful or deceptive character, <em>even though the implied warranty is complied with. </em>2 <em>Duer, </em>670, 671. 1 <em>Phillips, sec. 586. </em>In <em>Hazard vs. New England Marine Ins. Co., </em>8 <em>Pet., </em>581, the court says: \u201cA question of seaworthiness is determined by the usages of the port where the vessel is fitted out, in reference to the destined voyage. But the facts stated in a representation, may go beyond those usages; and the insured is bound to the extent of his communication, whether verbal or written. In the one case the law implies a definite and fixed responsibility; in the other the liability depends on the express declaration of the insured.\u201d Whilst, therefore, the insurance was on a lumber cargo, the general inquiry as to her then condition of seaworthiness, called for the communication of the facts, that the marine report at Baltimore had discredited the <em>\u201cOrb\u201d </em>as unseaworthy, that she had proved incapable of conveying coal, that her captain had declined a cargo of coal offered by Pratt, and that the letter of the 20th of October also indicated to Fall that she was not deemed fit to transport that kind of tonnage. Yet, in the face of these facts, known either to the captain who ordered the insurance or to his agent who applied for it, the representation was made that she was a <em>\u201cgood old vessel,\u201d </em>and had <em>\u201ccarried coal </em>on her last trip from Philadelphia to Charleston, for a man who was <em>not accustomed to insure his cargoes. 2 Duer, </em>442, 443. Whether this concealment or misrepresentation was fraudulent or innocent is <em>wholly indifferent, </em>provided it has reference to <em>material facts. 2 Duer, </em>411, 412, 420 to 422. 20 <em>Eng.

Abbott had no interest in the policy, and it was not <em>certainly obtained </em>for him but for any one who might freight the vessel; the clause, \u201cfor whom it concerns,\u201d does not in such case dispense with (he necessity of an assignment under the conditions of the policy. These words do not. make the policy a <em>negotiable instrument; </em>they are only meant to conceal an <em>existing </em>fact, and are not so elastic as to cover <em>any one </em>who may come in afterwards. The party who seeks to obtain the benefit of such a policy, must have been in the contemplation of the party procuring the insurance, at the time it was procured. 7 <em>H. &amp; </em>J., 450, 451, <em>Newson vs. Douglass. </em>1 <em>Phillips, </em>214. All the proof shows that this policy was not <em>certainly intended </em>for Abbott; the <em>assignment </em>of the policy to him especially confirms this. At all events, it was, upon the evidence, a question for the jury that the policy was merely got in the hope and expectation that Abbott would ship, and that failing, to induce somebody to freight the vessel; and if they so found, this could not, upon the authorities just cited, be considered an insurable interest in Abbott at the time of the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-6\">4th.

It is immaterial whether Fall then knew for whose benefit it was intended, as he acted under the authority of Frisbie and as his sub-agent, and in this respect this case is similar to that of <em>Newson vs. </em>Douglass, 7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>452. Hence, the plaintiff by his subsequent adoption of this policy, had a right to avail himself of it, and such adoption is deemed equivalent to his prior order for insurance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-5\">A difference exists between such a case as this, and the case where the party desiring insurance applies by himself or his agent for insurance. An insurance company is bound tobe doubly careful when it issues a policy \u201cfor whom it concerns.\u201d It cannot know for whose benefit it will ensure, or who will claim under it or what use will be made of it. 5 <em>Cranch, </em>100, <em>Hodgson vs. Marine Ins. Co. of Alexandria. </em>It must have been issued in this case to give credit to the Orb, and to enable those interested to obtain a freight for her. Here an innocent party who made no representations, who authorised none to be made for him, and who has selected a vessel seaworthy and fitted for the destined voyage with <em>the destined </em>cargo, is sought to be affected by what is alleged to be a con-' cealment of what are said to be material facts, made before he had adopted the insurance, and under circumstances with which it was almost impossible for him to be acquainted, and which, if in point of fact they existed, were unknown to the plaintiff When he adopted the policy. To make him responsible under these circumstances, would be to visit him with the punishment of a wrong-doer, and to enable a party who has caused a wrong to be done him to <em>escape. </em>The insurance company Which issues a policy such as this, cannot escape upon a ground of this kind, without bringing home to the plaintiff some participation in the wrong complained of. By issuing this kind of policy a limited negotiability, at least, is given to it, for whosoever was in the contemplation of the party obtaining it, may, although he knew nothing of what had been done, when it was done, by subsequent ratification without limit as to time, or, at least, until the actual satisfaction of the policy, claim the benefit of it. 2 <em>Maule &amp; Selw., </em>385, <em>Hagedorn vs. Oliverson. </em>It is therefore insisted for the appellee:</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>1st. That tattler the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff, for whose benefit the policy was issued, was only bound to see that the vessel on board of which his cargo was put, was seaworthy, well fitted, manned and equipped, at the inception of the voyage; and that he is not responsible for the acts of the master and mariners of the vessel, in respect to the mode of conducting the voyage. In support of this view, see 2 <em>Gill, </em>370, <em>Georgia Ins. </em>&amp; <em>Trust Co. vs. Dawson; </em>5 <em>Mees. &amp; Wels., </em>415, <em>Dixon vs. Sadler, </em>and same case in 8 <em>Mees. &amp; Wels., </em>896; 11 <em>Pet., </em>224, <em>Waters vs. Merchants Louisville Ins.

In Maryland, \u201cunderwriters are liable for a loss, the proximate cause of which is one of the enumerated risks, though the remote cause may be traced to the negligence of the masters and mariners,\u201d (2 <em>Gill, </em>370,) and this rule applies to all cases involving the negligence of the master and crew, such as taking in sail, steering the course, trimming the ship, selecting the route, in <em>stopping in, port, </em>in <em>hastening </em>or <em>retarding </em>the <em>operations </em>of the <em>voyage; </em>for all these might be remotely connected with the loss. This rule might not apply to a deviation in its broad sense, or a breaking up of the voyage, upon the ground that there is an implied warranty in the policy, that the voyage between the points designated is to be performed; but this implied warranty does not require this to be done with the utmost speed practicable. But this rule does and must apply to a <em>delay in commencing </em>the vojrage, arising from the negligence or default of the master where the <em>cargo </em>is insured, and belongs to a party <em>not the owner of the vessel, </em>and when the <em>owner of the cargo </em>has used due diligence in shipping it. This is now the received law of this country and of England. See 10 <em>East, </em>415, <em>Bowden vs. Vaughan, </em>and 2 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>160, <em>Allegre vs. Maryland Ins. Co., </em>where the distinction is drawn between the case where the assured owns both <em>vessel </em>and <em>cargo, </em>and where he owns <em>only cargo. </em>No such laches on the part of the master can affect the holder of a <em>policy on cargo. </em>The case in 2 <em>Smedes &amp; Mar., </em>340, is not against us in view of the facts of the present case, and if it is, it is not the law of Maryland, for it is in <em>direct conflict </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>with <em>Dawson's </em>Case, in <em>2 Gill, </em>370, and cannot be regarded as authority by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-5\">3rd. There was no stipulation on the part of the assured, that the vessel was to sail by any particular day. The insurers might have inserted such a provision in the policy, or have advised the assured in time before the sailing of the vessel, that they relied upon Fall\u2019s statement, that she was \u201cabout ready to sail\u201d or \u201cwould sail soon,\u201d as a representation, neither of which was done, and no advantage can now be taken of this defence. 1 <em>Camp., </em>119, <em>Beckwith vs. Sydebotham. </em>2 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>160. 10 <em>East., </em>415.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-6\">4th. But if tliere was any delay or detention it was <em>excusable. </em>It was caused by the proceedings of a court of competent jurisdiction, and without fault or omission by the assured, the owner of the cargo. The insurers take upon themselves by this policy, perils \u201cfrom restraints and <em>detainments </em>of all kings, princes or people, and <em>barratry </em>of the master, (unless the insured be the owner of the vessel,) and of mariners.\u201d' The detention here, arose from liabilities of the vessel to material men. The owner of the cargo was under no obligation to pay these liabilities. It was the duty of the owner and master to pay them. Can their failure affect the assured the owner of the cargo? In this policy the distinction is made between the owner of the vessel and cargo in respect to barratry of the master, and this distinction prevails throughout. In the case of the <em>Patapsco Ins. Co. vs. </em>Coulter, 3 <em>Pet., </em>236, it was decided, that where the policy covers the risk of barratry <em>and Jure be the proximate cause, </em>the courts will not sustain the defence, that <em>negligence teas the remote cause. </em>The law cited on the other side, applies only to <em>voluntary </em>deviations. Here, for part of the time it was impossible to get a crew, and for the rest of the time the libels detained the vessel. The inability to obtain a crew is by all the authorities sufficient to excuse a delay; for a crew to navigate the vessel is just as necessary to her seaworthiness as the <em>planks </em>on her <em>bottom. </em>Before this difficulty was removed, she was detained by the libels under which the marshal had power to seize and detain her. But it is said the plaintiff ought to have paid th\u00e9se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>claims. This we deny. The plaintiff was a mere <em>freighted' </em>not <em>chartering </em>the vessel and was not bound to pay these port charges. Where a voyage is once <em>commenced </em>the master may <em>sell </em>or <em>hypothecate </em>the cargo, in order to <em>complete </em>the voyage, but this law has no application to the case of a ship lying in port before the voyage is commenced; it applies to the case of <em>completing </em>a voyage <em>begun, </em>not to charges incurred before that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-5\">5th. The evidence in the case, shows that the detention did not increase the risk and was <em>immaterial. </em>The first libel was filed on the 30th of November, at which time the vessel was not ready to sail, and she could not have sailed until December, even if not detained by the libels. The proof shows, that December was more dangerous than November, but this proof applies to the entire mouth of December. 2 G. <em>&amp; J., </em>160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\">6th. The insurance in this case being \u201cfor whom it concerns,\u201d and being intended to induce the plaintiff to ship a cargo by the Orb, and having been obtained without any previous authority to do so from the plaintiff, he is not bound by any acts, representations or concealments, if any, on the part of the captain or Fall, and is not responsible therefor to any extent whatever. His subsequent ratification of the policy does not make him responsible for their conduct in effecting it, unless he was in some way apprised or informed of such conduct.. In this respect, it differs from an ordinary insurance, which could be effected only by the party insured, or some one acting in his behalf, or by his authority previously given. The defendant, by issuing a policy in this form, has induced an innocent third party without knowledge or notice of the conduct or acts complained of, to accept the insurance and ship his cargo upon the faith of it. 1 <em>Term Rep., </em>12, <em>Fitzherbert vs. Mather. </em>4 <em>Mason, </em>74, <em>Ruggles vs. General Interest Co. </em>12 <em>Wheat., </em>414, <em>General Interest Co. vs. Ruggles, 5 Cranch, </em>100, <em>Hodgson vs. Marine Ins.

There is no evidence that there was any concealment or misrepresentation on the part of Frisbie or Fall, and none is pretended on the part of the plaintiff. Banks says, that Fall represented that the vessel was then at Baltimore, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>she was about ready to sail from there bound to Boston. Pall states, he represented that the brig Orb was then at Baltimore, and that she would sail therefrom soon, on the voyage insured,, but no particular time was slated when she would sail. On this point see 1 <em>Camp., </em>119; 2 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>159. Again, Fall made a representation as to the seaworthy condition of the vessel, and being asked what was the condition of the vessel, he represented that she was a good old vessel. When this representation was made, the agent referred to the Boston marine inspector\u2019s report, which showed the age of the vessel and her rate as B. 1. Fall also represented, that on the voyage before she brought a freight of <em>coal </em>from Philadelphia to Charleston, and that the cargo was not insured, that the man whom she brought the coal for never had his cargoes insured <em>as he understood. </em>Fall says he made no untrue statement, and none which was designed to deceive or mislead the underwriters; that he had no interest and no object except to accommodate Frisbie and assist him in- getting business. There was no misrepresentation, either as respects the time of sailing nor as to the actual condition of the vessel. The jury have found that the vessel at the commencement of the voyage was seaworthy, that she was sufficiently tight, staunch and strong, for the voyage insured with the cargo insured, and that she was properly officered, manned and equipped therefor, and they have therefore found the truth of every representation made as to the condition of the vessel, and there is no-proof that any statement was made which was <em>not true. </em>Was there any <em>concealment </em>as respects Fall ? It is contended, that he ought to have shown the letter from Frisbie to him, of <em>the </em>20th of October. This letter showed nothing beyond the fact, that Frisbie could not get <em>insurance in Baltimore, </em>and desired Fall to get it in Boston. Now it is well settled law, that the assured is not bound to state to the underwriters, that he has applied to others who refused to insure. 4 <em>Mason, </em>83, <em>Ruggles vs. General Interest Co. </em>Fall states that he had no conversation and no communication with Frisbie, in relation to any prior application for insurance, and that he was not able to state in what condition of repair the vessel was in when at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>.Baltimore in the fall of .1.852, or whether she was seaworthy, but from what he had heard of her, he should say she was fit to carry a cargo of lumber from Baltimore to Boston, at that time. So far then as respects Fall, there was no concealment; he replied fully, frankly and truthfully, to the question put to him. He was not asked as to whether there had been any previous application to insure, and was not bound to refer to this as no such matter was inquired about. As respects Frisbie, it is proved by the two witnesses at Boston, that he was not present when these representations were made, and his own testimony, although differing as to the fact of his being present at some time, yet it confirms what the others say so far as these representations were made, and that if made at all, they were not made in his hearing. But. it is said Frisbie knew all the circumstances which had taken place at Baltimore, and was bound to communicate them to his agent Fail, so that the latter might have made them known at the time he applied for insurance. On this subject, the case of <em>Haywood vs. Rodgers, </em>4 <em>East., </em>590, is directly in point. In that case the principle is laid down, \u201cas an assured impliedly warrants the ship insured to be seaworthy, what forms an ingredient in seaworthiness is not necessary to be disclosed by the assured in the first instance, unless information on the subject be particularly called for, and then the assured must disclose truly what he knows in the respect required.\u201d See also 3 <em>Kent, </em>286. The only inquiry here made was <em>general </em>in its character, no particulars are specified. Again, a party making a concealment or misrepresentation, must know that what he states is <em>false. </em>When Fall said she was a <em>good old vessel, </em>he said what he believed was true and what the jury have found to be true. To constitute concealment <em>facts </em>must be kept back not <em>opinions. </em>There is no evidence that the plaintiff or Frisbie, knew that the Baltimore Marine Insurance Reports had discredited the vessel by rating her B. But suppose they did, the defendant\u2019s agents took the risk upon the Boston report, not on what Fall told him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-4\">8th. All the prayers of the defendant, except the first and second are fatally defective in form, and for this reason ought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>not to have been granted. They all contain this clause, \u00a3\u00a3and if the jury shall find all <em>theother facts assumed in this prayer.\u201d </em>This is a fatal defect, for if any facts <em>are assumed </em>the prayer is bad, and if there are none assumed the clause tends to <em>mislead </em>the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-5\">9th. The ruling of the court in the second exception was correct, for under the rules and practice of that court, the counsel had no right to offer the prayer at that stage of the case. Besides, the law of it was erroneous, if the positions we have already argued are sound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\">10th. The court below was right in refusing to permit counsel in the argument of facts before the jury, to read the opinion of judges from <em>law books, </em>on a point of law which the court had decided by its action on the prayers presented in the case. If this were permitted, there would be no means of reviewing in the court above the legal propositions insisted on, and the right of appeal would thus be virtually destroyed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b380-7\">Bartol, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AP8\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">This action was instituted by the appellee, on a policy of insurance made by the appellant, upon a cargo of lumber per brig Orb, at and from Baltimore to Boston. The policy was issued in the name of <em>\u00a3\u00a3Parker Fall, for whom it concerns;\u201d </em>and the first question presented for our consideration is, whether the appellee has such an interest in the policy as to give him a right of action upon it? The evidence shows that the brig was lying at the port of Baltimore, and that Frisbie, the captain and part owner, employed Parker Fall, as his agent at Boston, to obtain insurance on a cargo of lumber, in order to enable him to procure freight for the vessel; that the appellee had told Frisbie he would freight the brig with lumber if an insurance could be obtained upon it, but did not expressly authorize either Frisbie or Fail to obtain the policy in question, nor had he any knowledge of it until after it was issued, when he adopted it,, and, upon the faith of it, placed his cargo on board.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The assignment of the policy by Frisbie to Abbott, made on the 18th day of November 1852, not being made <em>\u201c-with the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>previous consent inwriting of the </em>insurers,\u201d as required Ity its terms, conferred no right upon the assignee, and his interest in the contract must be determined as if that assignment, had not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The law is Well settled, that a policy of insurance is not a negotiable security. The Court of Appeals have said, that \u201cA policy in the name of one, with the general clause <em>for whom it may concern, </em>will cover and protect the interest of any person for whose benefit it was intended, and who authorized it to be effected; and if, in the absence of any express order or authority from the owner, or any previous communication with him on the subject, such policy is effected in his behalf, the intention at the time of the party effecting it to cover his particular interest, will so connect him with the policy as that his adoption of it afterwards, will cause it to inure to his benefit. The subsequent adoption of a policy by a party interested, and for Whose benefit it was intended, being deemed equivalent to his prior order for insurance. But no one can, by subsequent adoption, avail himself of such a poliejr who was not at the time in the contemplation of the party procuring the insurance, and for whose benefit it was not intended, notwithstanding any interest he may have in the thing insured.\u201d <em>Newson\u2019s Admr. vs. Douglass, </em>7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>451, 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In this case it is contended, on the part of the appellant, that the pol^ on which the action was brought, was not, intended to cover the particular cargo of Abbott; but that it was procured at the instance of Captain Frisbie, for the purpose of enabling him to obtain freight, and was designed to cover any cargo of lumber which he might obtain for the vessel, no matter from whom. If that be so, then upon the authority cited, the appellee cannot maintain his action upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">But it is properly a question for the jury to determine, from the evidence, whether the policy in question was or was not designed, <em>when </em>obtained, to cover the particular cargo of the appellee, and the Superior Court erred in taking that question from the jury. The second prayer of the plaintiff, which was granted by the court, treated the policy as if it had been issued to Abbott himself, or in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The next question presented by the record, is whether, in obtaining the policy, there was misrepresentation or concealment of material facts connected with the condition of the vessel? This depends upon the particular facts and circumstances which attended the obtaining of the policy; but before proceeding to an examination of them, it is proper to say that we do not concur in the view taken by the appellee\u2019s counsel in the argument, \u201cthat a difference exists between such a case as this and the case where a party desiring insurance applies for it by himself or his agent.\u201d So far as the question of good faith in obtaining the insurance is concerned, the case where the policy is issued <em>\u201cfor whom, it may concern,\u201d </em>stands upon the same ground as if the name of the assured were inserted. \u201cEvery such policy supposes an agency;\u201d (7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>450;) no one can avail himself of it, but he for whom it is intended, and although obtained without his knowledge, and without any previous authority to the agent, its adoption by him after-wards, binds him to the acts and representations of the parties or agents connected with the business of procuring it, to the same extent as if they had acted under his authority previously given. See <em>Park on Insurance, </em>208.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In this case, therefore, the appellee is responsible for the acts of both Frisbie and Fall, in their dealings with the company, and if any misrepresentation or concealment of facts material to the risk, be shown on the part of either of them, the policy would be void, no matter how innocent the appellee might be in the transaction; and no matter whether such misrepresentation or concealment be fraudulent, or result from negligence or inadvertence on the part of the agents connected with the business of procuring the insurance. 12 <em>Wheaton, </em>412. 4 <em>Mason\u2019s Rep., </em>74. 1 <em>Term, </em>12. 3 <em>Kent, </em>286.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">This results from the nature of the contract: \u201cThe utmost good faith and fair dealing are of its very essence, and every fact and circumstance which can possibly influence the mind of any prudent and intelligent insurer, in determining whether he will underwrite the policy at all, or at what premium he will underwrite it, ought to be communicated to him.\u201d 2 G. &amp; J., 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>In this case, the representations of Parker Fall to the agent of the appellant, were made in answer <em>to </em>the question, \u201c <em>Where is the Orb, and what is her condition as to </em>seaworthiness?\u201d The reply was, <em>\u201cShe is at Baltimore, about ready to sail, (or she will sail soon.) She is a good old vessel; on the voyage before, she brought a freight of coal from Philadelphia to Charlestown, and the cargo was not insured; that the man for whom she brought the coal, never had his cargoes insured, as I understood.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The policy was dated the 28th day of October 1852; the vessel did not sail till the 22nd day of December 1852.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The objection of the appellant, that the statement made as to the time of sailing, was a promissory representation which bound the assured, and that the breach of it vitiates the policy, is conclusively answered by the decision of the Court of Appeals, in the case of <em>Allegre's Admr. vs. The Maryland Ins. Co., </em>2 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>159, and was abandoned by the counsel in the argument. The time of sailing is not, therefore, material in the consideration of this branch of the case. As to the statement that she was <em>\u201ca good old vessel,\u201d </em>according to our construction of those words, they import no more than that she was seaworthy, a fact the truth of which it was proper to submit to the jury upon all the evidence; but that is embraced in the implied warranty, and does not stand upon representation, which is always matter outside of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">It has been argued that the statement made by Fall, \u201cthat the Orb had carried a cargo of coal on her previous voyage from Philadelphia to Charlestown for a man who did not insure,\u201d &amp;c., was equivalent to a representation that she was then capable of transporting such a cargo, and that there was evidence tending to show the same was not true. In support of this construction the counsel cited 1 <em>Phillips on Insurance, sec. </em>567, where the principle is staled, \u201cthat, a representation imports not only what is expressed, but also all the natural and obvious inferences from it.\u201d Without impugning the principle, it is sufficient to say, we do not consider that it sustains the view contended for here. It is not pretended the particular fact, stated was untrue; besides, the statement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>made merely on information, and in such case the assured \u201cis not answerable for the truth of the facts stated,- but only for the truth with which he has stated the information received.\u201d 1 <em>Arnould, sec. </em>193.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Nor did that statement, in our opinion, operate to change the contract. The policy issued was on a cargo of lumber;, the implied warranty was that the Orb was seaworthy for the transportation of such a cargo, and the statement made to the agent of the underwriter did not enlarge that warranty so as to require the assured to prove that the brig was seaworthy for the transportation of coal at the time of the contract. The difference between a representation and a warranty,-is,-that while the latter must be literally fulfilled, it is sufficient if the former be substantially complied with. In the language of Lord Mansfield, in 1 <em>Term Rep., </em>345, \u201cA representation may be equitably and substantially answered; but a warranty must be strictly complied with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Having disposed of the question of <em>allegatio falsi, we </em>have next to consider whether there was <em>suppressio veri </em>in obtaining the policy? It is undoubtedly true that a concealment of facts material to the risk, which the assured is bound to communicate, stands upon the same ground and has the same effect as a statement of material facts which are untrue, and will avoid the policy, whether such concealment be through design or from inadvertence. This brings us to the inquiry, what facts is the assured bound to communicate?</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In this case the alleged concealment has reference entirely to matters touching the seaworthiness of the vessel, or going to show that the risk had been declined by others. The authorities all agree, that \u201cif the subject on which disclosures would otherwise be requisite, be covered by a warranty either express or implied, in that case it need not be matter of representation.\u201d (3 <em>Kent, </em>286.) \u201cAnd as in every contract of insurance there is an implied warranty of seaworthiness, the assured need not, in the first instance, disclose any fact, however material to the risk, which tends to show that the ship was unseaworthy when she sailed.\u201d <em>Haywood vs. Rodgers, </em>4 <em>East, </em>597. 1 <em>Arnould, </em>56.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>It is true this rule is changed when inquiries are made as to matters embraced in an implied warranty. Such inquiries may render it necessary for the insured, or his agent, to disclose facts respecting which he might otherwise be silent. (See 1 <em>Phillips, sec. </em>601. 1 <em>Arnould, </em>518. And i-t has been argued that the inquiry addressed to Fall, in this case, \u201cWhat is the \u2022condition of the Orb as to seaworthiness?\u201d imposed upon him the obligation -of disclosing\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">1st. The contents of Frisbie\u2019s letter of the 20th of October.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">2nd. The facts and circumstances which had occurred in the port of Baltimore, tending to show the insufficiency of the brig t.o carry coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">3rd. The fact that the marine reports in Baltimore had discredited her as unseaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">It is clear that there was no obligation upon the assured, or his agents, to disclose any of these things, unless particularly interrogated with regard to them. The insurer had an undoubted right to ask for information upon such matters, and if he had done so, the assured would be bound to make true answers to such inquiries; but in this case no such inquiry was made. The question was general and indefinite, not pointing to any particular fact; it imported no more than an inquiry as to whether the Orb was seaworthy, ajad imposed no more obligation upon the assured to disclose the matters alleged to have been concealed, than if no question had been asked. The rule is well settled, that the assured is not. bound to disclose the fact that the risk has been declined by others, or the estimate they put upon it, unless information on the subject be particularly called for. See <em>Ruggles vs. The General Interest Co., </em>4 <em>Mason, </em>83. 3 <em>Kent, </em>286.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Upon these grounds we are of opinion, that even if the facts and circumstances to which we have referred were all proved, the agents of the assured were not bound to disclose them, and consequently the omission to do so, would not impair the policy. But the letter of Frisbie, and the other facts and circumstances detailed in the evidence, relating to the condition of the Orb, were all proper t.o be submitted to the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>and considered by them, in deciding the question of the seaworthiness of tiie vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The remaining question to be considered, is, whether the underwriters have been discharged by a <em>deviation 9 </em>The proof in the cause is, that the cargo was laden on board by the 19th of November, and that the vessel did not sail till the 22nd of December, and it is contended that this delay in the sailing of the vessel amounted to a <em>deviation, </em>which discharges the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">This being a policy on <em>a voyage at and from Baltimore to </em>Boston, the risk commenced from the time the lumber was laden on board, and a deviation thereafter will avoid the policy, whether it occurred before or after the vessel actually left the port of departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The law on this subject is well slated by <em>Arnould, Vol. </em>1, <em>page 383, sec. 146. Me says: </em>\u201cAs the <em>sole ground </em>upon which a deviation discharges the underwriter, is, that it <em>varies </em>the risk, and as it is evident that the risk may be as much varied by a delay in commencing or prosecuting the voyage, as by a divergence from its prescribed course, it follows that every such delay, if <em>unreasonable </em>or ine.vcused, will discharge the underwriter.\u201d This principle is sustained by the authorities there cited, and recognized in every elementary treatise on insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">In this case it is contended, that the insurance being on the <em>cargo, </em>and not on the vessel, and the appellee not being the owner of the brig, and having no control over her, is not responsible, even though the delay amounted to a deviation; and in support of this view the cases in 5 <em>Mees. &amp; Wells., 415, </em>8 <em>Mees, &amp; Wells., </em>896, and 2 <em>Gill, </em>365, have been cited. But those cases did not involve the question of a deviation; they turned upon the familiar principle <em>causa pr\u00f3xima non remota spectatur, </em>and affirm the rule, that when the immediate cause of the loss is one of the perils insured against, the underwriter is bound, although a remote cause may be <em>negligence </em>or <em>unskilfulness </em>on the part of the captain and crew engaged in navigating the vessel. The cases in 3 <em>Peters, </em>222, and in 11 <em>Peters, </em>224, are to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The law of deviation stands upon entirely different ground. The inquiry is not whether the loss resulted in any manner from the deviation. <em>Park on Ins., </em>294. The reason why R is held to avoid the policy, is because it changes the risk, and substitutes a different voyage for the one insured against.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">It is as much an implied warranty in every insurance on a, voyage, that the ship shall not deviate, as it is that the ship is seaworthy; and each of these warranties is implied, whether the insurance be on the ship or on the cargo. After a careful examination of the numerous authorities cited in the argument, and many others, Ave have been unable to find any one sustaining the distinction so much insisted on at the bar, between the assured on the vessel and on the cargo, where the question of avoiding a policy by deviation has been involved, although in many of the cases such a distinction, if it existed, might have been properly recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The same observation was made by the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the High Court of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi, iu the case of <em>The Natchez Ins. Co. vs. Stanton Buckner </em>&amp; <em>Co., 2 Sm. </em>&amp; <em>Mar. Rep., </em>340. In that case this question was elaborately considered and decided. An attempt has been made to impugn that decision on the ground that, in some respects, the law of implied warranty therein announced, is contrary to the ruling of the Court of Appeals of this State, in the case in 2 <em>Gill, </em>365. Upon an examination of the cases, however, it will be found that so far as the principle we are now considering is concerned, the cases are not in conflict; and we think the law on this point is clearly and properly laid down in the case of <em>The Natchez Ins. Co. vs. Stanton Buckner </em>&amp; <em>Co., </em>and sustained by the whole current of authorities applicable to the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">We have no hesitation in saying, that the delay which occurred in the sailing of the Orb, would amount to a deviation which would discharge the underwriters, unless it proceeded from causes which justify or excuse it. 8 <em>Bing., </em>317. What the actual causes of the delay were, is a question of fact for the jury. The legal sufficiency of such causes to justify or excuse it, must he decided by (he court. <em>7 H. </em>&amp; J., 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>If, as the appellants insist, the delay was occasioned by the proceedings instituted in the Admiralty Court of Baltimore, for the recoveiy of debts due for repairs and supplies done and furnished to the vessel, (hen the delay was not legally justified; or, in other words, the risk of such detention is on the assured, not on the underwriter.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">It is laid down in <em>La Guidon de la Mer, </em>\u201cthat the under- \u2022 writer does not run the risk of obstructions occasioned by the debts, insufficient acquittance, or neglect to pay debts of the assured.\u201d See 1 <em>Phillips, </em>590. 3 <em>Kent, </em>378. And upon a careful consideration of the question, we are of opinion that this rule applies, whether the policy be on the vessel or on the cargo. This follows from the principles regulating the extent of the risk assumed by the insurer, and inasmuch as the vessel and owners are responsible to the shipper, under the contract of affreightment, for any loss which he may suffer from such delay, it is not reasonable to hold the underwriter bound, without some stipulation in the contract to that effect. It is not covered by the terms-in the polic}!', \u201crestraints and detainments of all kings, princes* or people;\u201d for the construction of those Words, se\u00e9 <em>Park on Ins., </em>78, 79, 80, 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">On the other hand, if the delay resulted from the difficulty of obtaining <em>k </em>fcreW, and there is evidence in the record to go to the jury tending to prove that fact, then the delay would be excusable, anti the underwriters remain answerable. 1 Akyns, 545, <em>Motteux vs. London Assur. Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Having thus determined the principles which, in our opinion, govern the decision of this case, we shall proceed, in a few words, to dispose of the several prayers presented in the cause, and found in the several bills of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The first bill of exceptions contains two prayers on the part of the plaintiff below, and seven on the part of the defendant. The court granted both those of the plaintiff, and rejected all Of those offered by the defendant, except the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The first prayer on the part of the plaintiff and of the defendant, respectively, were granted without exception, and are hot before us for review on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The second prayer of the plaintiff ought not to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>granted. This follows from what has already been said in (he opinion of this court, and it is unriecessary to repeat here tbo several particulars in which it is erroneous. It withdrew from the jury the consideration of several facts upon the decision of which, in our opinion, the right of the plaintiff to recover depends; and the judgment must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The second prayer of the defendant ought to have been granted, the proposition of law therein contained is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">With reference to the phraseology of all the other prayers of the defendant, both in the first and second bills of exceptions, we consider it proper to remark, that, in one respect, they are all objectionable. Each of them, after stating certain facts hypothetically as the basis of the legal proposition, contains the words, and if the jury shall find <em>\u201call other facts assumed by this </em>prayerSuch a clause is unusual in practice, and, we think, objectionable, as tending to mislead the jury. If there are any facts assumed, (he prayer would be erroneous; .if there arc none, then, in any view of them, the words are unnecessary. We are aware of the reason which led the counsel to insert the words, but think they do not accomplish the object designed; and as this is the first time this court has had its attention called to prayers in that form, we deem it proper to say, that in our opinion such a clause forms a substantial objection, and would vitiate a prayer, although in other respects unexceptionable. Prayers in this form were before the court in the case of <em>Hopkins vs. Boyd, </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>107, but no point was made upon tlieir particular phraseology, and it would have had no effect upon the judgment of the court in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The facts upon which the court\u2019s instruction is asked, ought, to be slated in the prayer, otherwise the legal proposition is vague and indefinite, and the jury ought not to be left to speculate and conjecture what facts are assumed by the prayer, and yet. are necessary to be found by them, as the ground of their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Looking at the defendant\u2019s prayers as if the objectionable clause to which we have referred were stricken out, we are of opinion, for the reasons already given in stating the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>principles governing the case, that the 5th- Gth and 8th prayers of the defendant were properly refused. They are based upon the defence set up on the ground of misrepresentation and concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The defendant\u2019s fourth prayer was properly rejected, because it treats the statement made by Parker Fall, \u201cthat the brig would sail soon,\u201d as a promissory representation binding upon the assured, which we have said is not its legal effect, or if that be not the true construction of the prayer, it is faulty, because it refers in general terms to the causes of delay <em>\u201cas given in evidence,'1'1 </em>instead of being limited to those which we have said were not sufficient in law to excuse it. There are causes of delay mentioned in the evidence to which we have before referred, which, in the opinion of the court, would justify and excuse it, provided the jury should find they were the actual causes which detained the vessel, to wit, the difficulty of procuring hands at that time in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The defendant\u2019s 3rd and Tth prayers (without the objectionable clause spoken of) should be granted; they are in conformity with the principles which have been stated on the question of deviation. But in the expression of this opinion, we are not to be understood as deciding that the captain of the brig had the power of selling or hypothecating the cargo, or any part of it, for the purpose of paying the debts of the vessel previously existing and contracted without reference to the particular voyage, and unconnected therewith. Such sale or hypothecation, under the circumstances of this case, could only have been made by the master, with the consent and authority of the appellee, who was on the spot, and whom it was the duty of the captain to consult. See <em>Abbott on Shipping, </em>243. But whether such efforts to sell or hypothecate the <em>cargo </em>were made or not, it is sufficient to say, that in the opinion of this court the detention of the vessel by the causes referred to in these prayers, if the jury should find they were the causes of her delay, was a risk of the assured, and not one assumed by the underwriters under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The second bill of exceptions is taken from the refusal of the court below to grant the defendant\u2019s 8th prayer, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>have already said that such ruling was correct, for one of the reasons assigned by that court, to wit, \u201cbecause it was not the iaw of the case;\u201d and we deem it unnecessary to express any further opinion thereon.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b391-7\">(Decided July 22nd, 1858.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">With reference to the question presented by the third bill of exceptions, we deem it sufficient to say, that in conducting trials at <em>nisi </em>prim, many things necessarily depend upon the discretion of the court, and we think the ruling of the Superior Court, to which this exception was taken, was on a matter within its discretion, and that no appeal lies therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
