In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>Story's Conflict of Laws, secs. </em>379 to 382, the reason, policy and universality of this general doctrine is clearly stated, and has been fully recognised by this court in <em>Newcomer vs. Orem, </em>2 <em>Md. Rep., </em>305, and in <em>Chauvenet vs. The Commissioners of Anne Arundel county, </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>264, which was a case in which the rule was applied in reference to taxation. In the cases of <em>Harvard College vs. Gore, 5 Pick., </em>377; <em>Salem Iron Factory vs. Inhabitants of </em>Danvers, 10 <em>Mass., </em>520; <em>Gray vs. Kettell, et al., </em>12 <em>Mass., </em>162, and <em>Amesbury Woollen &amp; Cotton Manf. Co., vs. Inhabitants of Amesbury, </em>17 <em>Mass., </em>462; it was held, that, as a general rule, the owner is taxable for personal property in the town in which he dwells, no matter whether such property be found in that town or any other, and that this general proposition is proved by the exception introduced into the tax laws of that State, which <em>expressly </em>make the owners of goods and merchandise, &amp;c., who hire shops and stores, <em>&amp;c., </em>and carry on their business in other towns than those in which they dwell, liable to be taxed for such goods in the towns where their business is negotiated. The language of their acts is, \u201cthat for such goods, &amp;c., or other stock in trade including stock employed in manufactories, <em>ships or vessels </em>as are <em>sold, used </em>or <em>improved </em>in any towns, &amp;c., other than where the owners thereof dwell, such owners shall be respectively taxed therefor in <em>such towns, </em>&amp;c., and <em>not where they dwell or have their home.\" </em>The court will perceive that the language of this exception is clear and express, and entirely different from that in our act of 1852. In the cases of <em>The Draco, </em>2 <em>Sumner, </em>189, and <em>Leland, et al., vs. The Ship Medora, 2 Wood. &amp; Minot, 115, it </em>was held, that the rule applies to the general transfer of property, according to the laws of the State, without regard to acts of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-5\">The question then recurs, what is meant by the words \u201cpermanently located elsewhere within the State?\u201d It is supposed on the other side, that the fact, that the vessel was registered at the custom-house in Baltimore city, gives it a <em>permanent location </em>there. But this can have no such effect, for according to the existing laws of Congress, it could be reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>istered no where else, so long as the owner resides where he now does, (Acts of Congress of 1792, <em>ch. 1, sec. 3; </em>1798 ch. 8, sec. 2, and 1850, ch. 27, sec. 1,) and by the act of 1799, ch. 22, sec. 10, the registration district of which Baltimore is the <em>sole </em>port of entry, is not confined to the limits of Baltimore city, but includes \u201cPatapsco River, Turkey Point, Spes Utias Island, and all the waters and shores on the west, side of Chesapeake Bay, from the mouth of Magetfy river, which shall not he included in the district of ITavre-de-Gvacc.\u201d According to these laws the registry must be in Baltimore city, though the owner resides in Baltimore county, or any part of .Anne Arundel, Howard or Harford counties embraced within the limits of the registration district. The registry cannot, therefore, be said to give the vessel a <em>\u2018permanent </em>locationi\u201d in Baltimore city. Ships and vessels are <em>in fact </em>permanently located nowhere, and there is uo reasonable ground for presuming, in direct opposition to the fact, that thej^are to he held in law as located at the port of entry where they are registered or enrolled. The very purpose and objects of commerce forbid this. Registry and enrollment are for national purposes exclusively, and are so far from implying permanent location, that vessels registered and enrolled may lawfully leave the port to which they belong without ever returning to it again. They may, in fact, if tiiey are enrolled vessels, be permanently located in. another State, and carry <em>on commerce </em>exclusively in its waters. They may, if registered, sail altogether from and to the ports of another State. They are therefore, more properly than almost any other sort of chattels, within the reasonable rule in regard to taxation, that personal property follows the <em>situs of </em>the owner. If the rule were otherwise, the result, would be to exclude all the citizens of Maryland from the privilege of being interested in the commercial marine of their chief port of entry, except upon the condition of contributing to pay the municipal debts of Baltimore city. In the case of <em>Hays vs. The Pacific Mail Steam Ship Company, </em>17 <em>How., </em>596, it was held, that the State of California had no right to tax a vessel, temporarily in San Francisco, engaged in lawful trade, afld duly registered in the <em>city </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>of New York, </em>where her owners resided, and it was there said, that the <em>situs </em>of such a vessel was her home-port, where she belonged and where the owners were liable to be taxed for the capital invested. But the circumstances of that case are entirely different from this, and even if the <em>situs </em>of this vessel could be said to be her home-port where her owners resided, it would not locate her in Baltimore city, any more than in any other part of the registration district of which Baltimore is the port of entry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-5\">Again, various provisions in the acts of 1841 and 1852, show that the legislature did not intend to embrace such property as this within the words, \u201cpermanently located elsewhere within the State.\u201d We refer to the provisions of the 12th, 13th and 63rd sections of the act of 1841, and particularly to the 16th section, which makes the stock of <em>non-resident </em>stockholders, in banking or other moneyed corporations situated, for the purposes of taxation, <em>at the place at which the principal office </em>for transacting the business of such corporation <em>is situated. </em>There are also similar provisions in the act of 1852. See, also, the acts of December session 1841, ch. 281, 1843, ch. 289. Again, by the 2nd section of the act of 1841, Baltimore city is divided into various assessment districts, and this vessel would be returned by the assessors of that district in which the owner resided, if he resided in the city at all, though thevessel might, in'fact, be in another assessment district, and if this is admitted, as it must be under the provisions of the 12th section of the same act, it is because the <em>situs </em>of the owner draws to it the personal property of the owner.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-6\">JET. <em>R. Dulany </em>and Cr. <em>L. Dulany </em>for the appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-7\">It is admitted that personal property, as a general rule, must be taxed where the owner resides, but it is insisted that such property, when \u201cpermanently located elsewhere within the Slate,\u201d must be assessed to the party by the assessors of that place in which it is situated. This position is based upon the 9th section of the act of 1852, ch. 337, which supersedes the corresponding section in the act of 1841, ch. 23. After making it the duty of the assessors to inform themselves, by all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>lawful means, of <em>all </em>the assessable property in their respective districts, and to value the same at its full cash value; this section enacts, that \u201call property owned by residents of this State, <em>and not permanently located elsewhere within the </em>State, shall be assessed to the owner in the county or city where be or she may reside.\u201d Asimilar exception as to the place of taxation, of personal property generally, has been established by the legislatures of Massachusetts and New York. 5 <em>Sandford, </em>44. 17 <em>Mass., </em>461. In this case the owner is a <em>bona fide </em>and <em>actual </em>resident of Baltimore county, but has <em>his place of business, </em>as a merchant, in the city, and the vessel is duly registered at the custom-house in, and <em>sailing out </em>of the port of, Baltimore. These facts, we insist, makes the vessel \u201cpermanently located\u201d in that city, within the meaning of those terms, as they are employed in the acts of 1841 and 1852. Those words evidently apply to <em>personal property, </em>for in the 1st section of the act of 1841, they are used in immediate connection with goods, wares and merchandise; the language of that section is: \u201cAH real and personal property in this State, all chattels real and personal, all goods, wares and merchandises, and other stock in trade, at home, or <em>not permanently located elsewhere.\u201d </em>This clearly imports <em>\u00dax&amp;.t personal property </em>may have a <em>permanent location, </em>for the purpose of taxation, elsewhere than at the domicil of the owner, and that such was the meaning of the Legislature when they passed the law. What is meant by the general doctrine, that personal property has no <em>locality 9 </em>It does not mean that it has no <em>visible </em>locality, but it, only refers to the law governing the <em>transfer </em>and <em>transmission </em>of such property. This is clearly stated in the sections in <em>Story\u2019s Conf. of Laws, </em>referred to on the other side. The word <em>\u201cpermanent,\u201d </em>in its literal meaning, signifies <em>continuance </em>in a place for a greater or less time. When applied to real estate, it includes the idea of immobility. Blackstone applies the term to a <em>rent, </em>which is an incorporeal hereditament, and if applicable to a <em>rent, </em>why may it not also be applied to <em>personal property </em>? The word is to be taken in connection with the context in which it is used. 1 <em>Kent, </em>252. We do not contend that the fact of <em>registry, </em>alone, gives the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>right of taxation to the city, but tire statement of facts includes the business residence of the owner in the city of Baltimore, and that the vessel is <em>trading </em>out of that port. The argument on the other side goes to the extent, and must go to the extent, of saying that a vessel is not susceptible of <em>location anywhere. </em>But this is not so. A vessel is not, like stock in a corporation, invisible and intangible, but can be seen, occupies space, is tangible and susceptible of being <em>located. </em>In the eye of t.he law it has a <em>local situs, </em>and if capable of having such a situs, that <em>situs </em>is the city of Baltimore, and it is there subject to taxation. The Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of <em>Hays vs. The Pacific Steamship Company, </em>17 <em>How., </em>596, clearly say, that the <em>situs </em>of a vessel is her home-port, and that she is liable to be taxed there \u2014 her home-port is her <em>situs </em>for the purpose of taxation. The home-port of this vessel is the port of Baltimore, and it is there she is <em>\u201cpermanently located,'1'1 </em>within the meaning of the tax laws of the State.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b478-5\">Le Grand, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWa\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">This is an appeal from a <em>pro forma </em>judgment of the Superior court for Baltimore city, on the following statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u00a3\u00a3It is admitted in this case that the defendant is a <em>bona fide </em>and actual resident of Baltimore county, but having his place of business, as a merchant, in the city, and that this action is instituted to recover from him the sum of five hundred and five dollars, being the amount duly assessed in the city of Baltimore, as city taxes on the ship Anne E. Hooper, the property of the defendant, registered in the custom-house at said city, and sailing out of the port of Baltimore. It is agreed that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the said sum of money and costs, and that the court shall give judgment therefor, provided the court shall be of opinion that the said ship is lawfully to be valued to the said defendant, for the purposes of city taxation in the city of Baltimore, and that he may lawfully be compelled to pay city taxes upon the said ship, notwithstanding his residence in Baltimore county. It is further-agreed that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>court shall render judgment for the defendant, with costs, provided the court shall be of opinion that the said ship should be valued to the defendant, and that he should be taxed thereupon in the county where he resides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cIt is agreed that either party may have an appeal from the judgment of the Superior court, and that the said court may make inferences of fact, in their discretion, from the facts <em>herein </em>stated. It is further agreed that the Court of Appeals may, in case of appeal, render such judgment upon this statement and such inferences, as they may deem according to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The question presented by this statement of facts is simply this: is a vessel owned under the circumstances detailed, liable <em>to pay taxes, for </em>municipal purposes, <em>to the city of </em>Baltimore?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">It is claimed, on behalf of the city, that such liability exists because of the provisions of the act of 1841, chapter 23, sec. 9, <em>and of </em>those <em>of </em>the act <em>of </em>1852, chapter 337, sec. 9. The words of the latter, so far as this question is involved \u2014 and they are the same as in the former act \u2014 are as follows: \u201cAll. property owned by residents of this State, <em>and not permanently located elsewhere within the State, </em>shall be assessed to the owner in the county or city where he or she may reside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">It is urged that notwithstanding the owner of the ship Anne E. Hooper <em>\u201cis a bona fide </em>and <em>actual </em>resident of Baltimore county,\u201d she is liable to taxation for city purposes, because she is registered in the custom-house at said city, and is \u201csailing out of tire port of Baltimore,\u201d and because she is <em>\u201cpermanently </em>located elsewhere <em>within the </em>State\u201d without the limits of Baltimore <em>county, </em>the domicil of her owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">It was on the union of all these circumstances, and not on any one in particular, it was contended she was liable to city taxation. First, then, as to the effect of her registration at the custom-house, in Baltimore. We attach \u2014 and we also understood die counsel for the city to attach \u2014 but slight importance to this fact. Under the existing laws of Congress, so long as Mr. Hooper owns the vessel, and retains his residence in Baltimore comity, she can be registered nowhere else than at the custom-house, in Baltimore city.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">By the act of Congress of the 2nd of March 1799, entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201cAn act to regulate the collection of duties on imports and tonnage,\u201d it is provided \u201cthat in the State of Maryland there shall be ten districts,\u201d and that \u201cthe district of Baltimore shall include Patapsco river, Turkey Point, Spes Utise Island, and all the waters and shores on the west side of Chesapeake Bay, from the mouth of Magetty river, which shall not be included in the district of Havre-de-Grace; and a collector, naval officer and surveyor for the district shall be appointed, to reside at Baltimore, which shall be the sole port of entry.\u201d And by the act of Congress of December 31st, 1792, it is provided that every ship or vessel to be thereafter registered, \u201cshall be registered by the collector of the district in which shall be comprehended the port to which such ship or vessel shall belong at the time of her registry, which port shall be deemed to be that at or nearest to which the owner, if there be but one, or if more than one, the husband or acting and managing owner of such ship or vessel usually resides. And the name of the said ship or vessel, and of the port to which she shall so belong, shall be painted on her stern,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Under these acts of Congress, it is clear that the Anne E. Hooper could only have been registered at the custom-house in Baltimore, and she, in consequence of such registration, was made to belong to that port, but the district of which that is'the port, as is palpable from the language of Congress, is not confined to the limits of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The circumstances principally relied upon by the city, were the fact of sailing out of the port of Baltimore, and that she was \u201cpermanently located\u201d elsewhere than at the place of residence of the owner. If, in one sense, as was said in the case of <em>Hays vs. The Pacific Mail Steamship Co., </em>17 <em>Howard\u2019s S. C. Rep., </em>596, a vessel engaged in foreign trade can have a domicil, it must be regarded as that of the home-port, which, as we have seen in the present instance, may extend over a much larger territory than the limits of the city; and it would therefore be just as proper for Baltimore county or Anne Arundel county, as for the city of Baltimore, to impose a tax for municipal purposes, for all of the one, and a part of the other, is embraced within the district of which the city of Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>is the port of entry. If, therefore, there was no other consideration affecting the case, the city would clearly have no right to tax, she being in no better condition tiran the other portions of the registration district. But, in truth, the whole question depends upon the meaning of the words of the act of 1852. It cannot be denied, nor was it, that as a general principle, all. personal property, unless affixed to the freehold, is, in contemplation of law, without a location, <em>other </em>than the residence ol its owner. Wherever he or she may reside, there is, by operation of law, located the property. In this particular the rule being different from that applicable to realty. In the one case the domicil of the owner determines the law, whilst in the other the law of the <em>rei sites </em>governs. So universal is the recognition of this distinction, that it can scarcely be necessary to cite authorities in its support. It is the law of nations. Lord Loughborough, in <em>Sill vs. </em>Worswick, 1 <em>Hen. Bl. Rep., </em>690, has said, \u201cit is a clear proposition, not only of the law of England, but of every country in the world, where law has the semblance of science, that personal property has no locality. The meaning of that is, not that personal property has no visible locality, but that it is subject to that law which governs the person of the owner, both with respect to the disposition of it, and with respect to the transmission of it, either by succession or by the act of the party. It follows the law of the person. The owner, in any country, may dispose of his personal property. If he dies, it is not the law of the country in which the property is, but the law of the country of which he was a subject, that will regulate the succession.\u201d And Lord Chief Justice Abbott said: \u201cPersonal property has no locality. And even with respect to that, it is not correct to say that the law of England gives way to the law of the foreign country; but that it is part of the law of England that personal propeity should be distributed according to the <em>jus domicilii. </em>\u2019 \u2019 Justice Story, after treating of the history of this rule, in <em>section </em>379 of his work on the <em>Conflict of Laws, </em>says: \u201cIf the law <em>rei sites </em>were generally to prevail in regard to movables, it would be utterly impossible for the owner, in many cases, to know in what manner to dispose of them during his life, or to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>them at his death, not only from the uncertainty of their situation in the transit to and from different places, but from the impracticability of knowing, with minute accuracy, the law of transfer,\u201d &amp;c. Again: \u201c'Any change of place at a future tim\u00e9 might defeat the best considered will, and any sale or donation might be rendered inoperative from the ignorance of the parties of the law of the actual <em>situs </em>at the time of their acts. These would be serious evils pervading the whole community, and equally affecting the subjects and the interests of all civilized nations. But in maritime nations, depending upon commerce for their revenues, their power and their glory, the mischief would be incalculable. A sense of general utility, therefore, must have first suggested the doctrine, and as soon as it was promulgated, it could not fail to recommend itself to all nations by its simplicity, its convenience and its enlarged policy.\u201d These references are abundantly sufficient to show the rule and its policy. They might be multiplied to almost any extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Although the general rule is as we have stated it to be, yet it is perfectly competent to the sovereign authority to abolish or modify it, and the question here is: has it been so modified as to bring this vessel within the taxing power of the corporation of Baltimore? The words of the act are, \u201cAll property owned by residents of this State, and not permanently located elsewhere within the State, shall be assessed to the owner in the county or city where he or she may reside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Apart from the general principle to which we have adverted, it may be very properly doubted whether a vessel built for and actually employed in foreign trade, can be said to be <em>\u201cperma</em>nently\u201d located any where. The idea of its <em>permanent </em>location is at war with the very purpose of its creation. Yessels are not constructed to rot at <em>the </em>wharf or dock, but to carry, from place to place, cargo; their very use necessarily implies transition \u2014 the absence of permanency of locality. Besides, under our act of Assembly, to take personal property out of the general rule, so far as taxation is concerned, it must be \u201cpermanently located elsewhere <em>within the </em>State\u201d other than within the county or city of the residence of its owner. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ship in this case, clearly, is not permanently located <em>\u201cwithin this State.\u201d </em>Her mission is on the seas:\u2014</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b483-11\">(Decided January 6th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201cHer march is o\u2019er the mountain wave,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">Her home is on the deep.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The desire on the part of the tax-payers of a city to subject the personal property of non-residents, who transact their business within its limits, to a proportionate share of its burdens, is far from unreasonable; but this desire cannot be gratified unless the legislative will allows it, and this permission is not to be gathered by conjecture, but from the plain and unequivocal language in which it should be expressed. In <em>Dwarris on Statutes </em>it is said, at page 695, uAs a rule of exposition, statutes are to be construed in reference to the <em>principles </em>of the common law. For it is not to be presumed that the legislature intended to make any innovation upon the common law, further than the case absolutely required. The law rather infers that the act did <em>not </em>intend to make any alteration <em>other </em>than what is <em>specified, </em>and besides <em>what has been plainly pronounced.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">If the legislature hereafter should deem it wise and just to subject property held as is the vessel in question to city taxation, it can adopt the policy of New York and Massachusetts, but until it does do so in plain and unmistakable terms, the courts must adhere to the long established doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Being of opinion that the vessel, Anne E. Hooper, is not liable to city taxation under the authority given in that event by the case stated, we reverse the judgment of the court below, and enter judgment for the appellant, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
