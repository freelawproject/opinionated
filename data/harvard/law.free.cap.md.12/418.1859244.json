There was no renunciation by John T. Worthington of the trust created by this bequest, and the funds having come into his hands, he is bound to account to the legatees in remainder therefor, with interest thereon from the date of the death of the widow. On this point it is objected, first, that there was no trust for the legatees in remainder. But the trust clearly extended to them, and the trustee had duties to perform towards them; the subject of the trust was personal property, which he was bound to <em>pay over </em>to the parties entitled, upon the death of the widow. The will imposes two classes of duties upon the trustee in reference to this bequest, <em>one </em>in regard to the income, and the other as to the <em>principal; </em>the former he was to apply to the maintenance of the widow during the life, the latter he was to pay over to the legatees in remainder upon the death of the widow; and by the express terms of the will, his powers and duties as such trustee were to <em>continue </em>during the requisite continuance of the trust. Again, it is said he did not <em>accept </em>this trust, but <em>renounced </em>and <em>repudiated </em>it. But, in point of fact and law, he did <em>accept, </em>He came forward and <em>proved the vjill, </em>and <em>took out letters </em>under it, and where a party does this, he is bound to execute the will, and <em>accepts the trusts thereof. Hill on Trustees, </em>314. How has he <em>renounced </em>or <em>repudiated </em>it? The law requires plain, strong and unequivocal proof of his renunciation before the trustee can divest himself of such a trust. 4 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>430, <em>Fishwick vs. </em>Sewell. Now it is not pretended that this trustee ever <em>expressly </em>renounced this trust, or that he ever said a word repudiating it, but the renunciation is sought to be <em>inferred </em>from certain acts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>or rather from his <em>non-actibn. </em>Tire testator died in 1834, and the executors 1st and 2nd administration accounts were passed in 1837, and he now says, that because in these accounts no notice was taken of this legacy, he never was trustee of it; that is, the <em>non-performance </em>and <em>non-discharge </em>of his duties as trustee, is proof that he never was trustee, or, if he ever was, that he renounced the trust. This is to set up a <em>breach of trust </em>as a <em>disclaimer </em>of the trust. But the inventory, the administration accou.nts, and the various distributions show that for the whole time he was in <em>receipt </em>of the property in the character in which the will cast it upon him. The estate remained open, and is in fact still open, no <em>final </em>account by that name having yet been passed. It is also clear law, that where a trustee has once accepted a trust, he cannot afterwards, by disclaimer, renounce or repudiate the duties and responsibilities of the office. <em>Hill, </em>219. Again, it is well settled that where a party holds the double capacity of executor and trustee, the fund will be considered in his hands as trustee after the time limited by law for the settlement of the estate', nor is this principle or the responsibility of this trustee and executor to the <em>cestui que trust </em>at all varied by the fact that there were here two executors, for each is liable to them for the full extent of the funds he receives. 1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>190, <em>Beall vs. </em>Hilliary. The trustee, therefore, having accepted the trust, he could only discharge himself of it by paying over the money to these legatees in remainder, and his failure to do so, is a breach of trust for which he is <em>primarily liable, </em>and <em>failing this liability, </em>the residuary legatees, to whom the fund has been <em>wrongfully </em>paid, are <em>responsible </em>to these <em>cestuis que trust, </em>and interest should be calculated from the time the fund became due and payable to them\u2019. <em>Hill, </em>173.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\">3rd. There have been no such laches, <em>acquiescence </em>or <em>concurrence </em>in the acts of the trustee and executor, on the the part of the complainants, as will discharge him from liability. The acts of Worthington, <em>as executor, </em>in making these various distributions, do not protect him, for he settled up the estate in the orphans court without <em>plenary proceedings, </em>as provided for in the act of 1798, ch. 101, sub-ch. 14, sec. 12, and in doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>so, he merely acted <em>in pais, </em>and at his peril. 4 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>425, <em>Conner vs. Ogle. </em>As trustee, nothing but <em>gross laches </em>on the part of the <em>cesluis que trust </em>will protect him. A party standing by and ignorant of his title, and acting under a plain and acknowledged mistake of his legal rights, will not forfeit those rights in consequence of such misapprehension. 6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>525, 526, <em>Lammot vs. Bowly. </em>But we need not go to this extent, for there has been no acquiescence on our part in any act of the executor or trustee, inconsistent with our claim to this legacy. The <em>release </em>to the executor is only for the <em>distributive </em>shares of the <em>residue, </em>and purports to be given by the parties to it as <em>residuary legatees. </em>It only acknowledges the receipt of such funds <em>as far </em>as they have come to the hands of the executor, and been <em>accounted for </em>by him. What information did this give us of the legacy, or that the executor had not <em>retained for </em>it? It. is perfectly consistent with this release that there may have been other assets to be received and accounted for, out. of which this legacy could have been paid, or that, the executor had retained therefor. Nor are the releases to the guardian of any more avail. They only purport to release the guardian for what he <em>has -received, </em>whereas this is a claim for money which never came to his hands. Besides, at the time these releases were signed, the complainant legatees were minors, and have since been <em>married, women, </em>and under all the circumstances of the case, it is confidently insisted there have been no such laches, <em>acquiescence </em>or <em>lapse of time </em>as will prevent them from recovering this claim from the trustee and the parties to whom it has been wrongfully paid, all of whom are now alive and in court, with this very fund now in their possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-5\">4th. That the statute of <em>limitations </em>docs not apply to this case, the trust being enforcable <em>only in equity. </em>It was a subsisting, continuing, active trust, over which a court of law had no <em>concurrent jurisdiction, </em>but which could only be enforced jn equity, and to such a case the statute of limitations has- no application. 1 <em>Story's Eq., secs. </em>539, 540, 129. 3 <em>Gill, </em>159, <em>Dugan vs. </em>Gittings. 8 <em>Gill, </em>395, <em>Barnes vs. Compton. 3 Md.

Worthington, is not responsible to the complainants as trustee or legatee in trust of this bequest of $&gt;10.000, because the legacy and the trusts imposed by it were never accepted by him, but were, on the contrary, disclaimed by him, by all his conduct and acts in the administration of the estate. There is not a single act or word of this trustee shown in the record, or in his administration of this estate in acceptance of this trust, and it is clear, that the duties and liabilities of a trustee cannot be imposed upon any one without his assent or against his will. 7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>164, 165, <em>Maccubbin vs. Cromwell. </em>No express renunciation of the trust is necessary; there must be an acceptance of the trust, especially if the bequest be of personaltj-. There must be some assent or some act done in the capacity of trustee, before the law will make the transfer to him in that capacity, even where the <em>same party </em>is executor and trustee. (16 <em>Alabama, </em>14, 15, <em>Perkins vs. Moore.) </em>But here there were <em>two joint executors </em>and but <em>one </em>of them is made trustee by the will, and in such a case the principle of a transfer by operation of law does not apply. 2 <em>G. &amp; J., 220, Watkins vs. The State. </em>Where an executor is also legatee, it is necessary to the vesting of the legacy in him, that he should give his <em>assent, </em>either express or implied from his <em>doing some act </em>in the <em>character of legatee rather than that of executor-, </em>it is not enough that the act is equally applicable to <em>both </em>characters. 2 <em>Wms. on Excrs., </em>849, 850, <em>(Ed. of </em>1832.) 7 <em>Taunt., </em>217, <em>Doe vs. Sturges, </em>in 2 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>80, 81. A renunciation of a trust may be by parol, and at any length of time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>or by conduct inconsistent with the character of trustee. <em>Hill on </em>Trustee, 221, 226.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-5\">2nd. That by the renunciation of this bequest by the widow, all the trusts for her benefit created therein, became wholly inoperative and void, and thereby all the rights and duties of Worthington, as <em>trustee </em>under the bequest, wholly ceased, and there remained only the direct bequest over of the sum of $10,000, after the death of the widow, to the children of th\u00e9 testator\u2019s daughter Mary. That after this renunciation, Worthington had not the right, nor if he had, was he under any obligation, <em>as trustee ferr those in remainder, </em>to claim and hold the bequest only for the purpose of handing it over to th\u00e9 legatees in remainder, at the death of the widow. And that after this renunciation, by force of which the bequest resulted to the estate during her life as undisposed of, the legatees in remainder, at her death, became entitled to it, (if at all,) by a <em>direct </em>and <em>immediate </em>devise, without the intervention of a trustee, and were entitled on their own application, to claim or have secured to themselves at her death the payment of the same, and Worthington is not responsible to them for not having claimed or secured the legacy for them. It is well settled, that the estate to a trustee is limited by that to the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>that he tabes no greater estate than the purposes of the trust require. The only purpose of this trust was to create a trust <em>for the life of the widow; </em>the moment she died the <em>trust ceased. </em>The language of the devise clearly shows this to have been the sole object and purpose of the testator. After the widow\u2019s death the money was to be handed over by the executors to the legatees iu remainder, as the <em>testator\u2019s </em>property, and they were to receive it by virtue of a <em>direct </em>and <em>immediate </em>devise, without the intervention of a trustee. In support of these views see <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>239. 1 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress., </em>336, <em>Player vs. Nicholls, </em>in 8 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>94; 60 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>669, <em>Muller vs. Claridge; </em>4 <em>Mees. &amp; Wels., </em>428, <em>Barker vs. Greenwood.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-7\">3rd. That the time, manner and circumstances of the administration and distribution of the estate, down to its <em>final </em>distribution amongst the complainants and others as residu.ary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>legatees, and the lapse of time before making this claim, show not only such acquiescence, but also such concurrence on the part of the complainants, in the final distribution without, deduction of this bequest, and with full knowledge or means of knowledge that it had not been paid or retained for, and also such delay and <em>laches </em>in the assertion of the claim, until long after the death of the widow, and the final distribution, as are of themselves sufficient to bar the complainants\u2019 title to relief against John T. H. Worthington, if they ever had any, especially when coupled with the facts of the <em>release to him </em>and his co-executor by the husbands of the female complainants, and also of the wives and legatees after their arrival at age, to their guardian and father, and after his release to the executors. And neither is Worthington, as <em>surviving </em>executor, responsible to the complainants for their share in remainder of this bequest, because of his failure to retain for the same; for after the widow\u2019s renunciation, it was the right and duty of the legatees in remainder or their legal representatives, to claim or apply for the retainer of this legacy, and being guilty of <em>laches </em>in not claiming the bequest or the retainer for it, when they had full knowledge of it, and that it had not been paid or retained for, they cannot charge the executors because of their failure to retain for it. After the death of the widow, in 1838, this legacy was payable immediately to the legatees in remainder, and, after it became so payable, the executors finally distributed to the complainants or their legal representatives and the other residuary legatees, assets to more than the amount of this bequest without any claim made by them thereto, or any pretence of objection to the distribution without deducting the legacy, and received from the complainants or their representatives the releases above stated, whereby and by the acquiescence, concurrence and <em>laches </em>of the complainants before stated, the executors were discharged from liability to them, if there ever was any. Again, the estate was finally distributed in the lifetime of Johns and by <em>both </em>executors, and the breach of duty, if any, was by both, and to any claim for relief on that ground, the legal representatives of the deceased co-executor are proper and necessary parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The executor, in dealing with this estate, was acting honestly, innocently and as much to his <em>own prejudice </em>as that of the complainants, for he himself was <em>one of the </em>legatees in remainder of this bequest. If there was a mistake he was <em>helped on </em>in if. by the complainants, and there is an <em>equitable plena administravit </em>made with their knowledge and consent. Tf a party to whom a legacy is given <em>says </em>to the executor, \u201c\u00cd don\u2019t mean to claim it,\u201d this is an <em>estoppel, </em>and he cannot afterwards claim it, or induce the executor to administer the assets upon the footing that no such claim will be asserted, this is an <em>estoppel, </em>and the claim cannot be afterwards asserted. 1 <em>Ves. Jr., </em>172, <em>Clinton vs, Hooper. Bell on Property, </em>195, in 67 <em>Law Lib., </em>143. <em>Acts </em>and <em>conduct </em>may as strongty declare this to the executor, and be as much evidence of a disclaimer as <em>ivords. </em>It must be assumed, that all these parties knew all their rights, the will, their rights under it, the administration and distribution accounts and releases in the orphans <em>court.; for </em>outside parties even are bound to know what the <em>public records </em>will disclose. 5 <em>Md.

The complainants were bound to know what the law is, and whenever a party knows his rights, and stands by and sees another dealing with the property <em>in </em>a wanner repudiative of his rights, and does not assert them, he is <em>estopped </em>from ever afterwards asserting his rights t,o such property. 7 <em>Simons, </em>1, <em>Govett vs. Richmond, in </em>9 <em>Cond.

These were all cases of <em>outside acquiescence; </em>here we are dealing with the proceedings o\u00ed the proper <em>distributing forum, </em>and with <em>parties to such proceedings, </em>with <em>full notice thereof, </em>but have neglected to prosecute their claims. In such a case equity can afford them no relief. 1 <em>Keen, </em>392, <em>Sawyer vs. </em>Birchmore, in 15 <em>Cond. Eng. Ch.

As parties, the complainants are forever concluded; a decree of distribution would forever have concluded them from setting up any claim <em>inconsistent </em>with that <em>distribution. </em>The orphans court has as ample powers as a court of chancery, to adjudicate upon all claims between distributees, legatees, add administrators and executors. It is a court peculiarly constituted for the distribution of assets, and a <em>general bill </em>for distribution cannot be filed in chancery because it would interfere with the jurisdiction of the orphans court. Where an executor and legatee honestly misconstrue the will, and have a settlement in full based on such misconstruction, the settlement will not be opened merely because of such mistake. 4 <em>Richardson\u2019s Eq. Rep., </em>349, <em>Keitt vs Andrews. </em>If a <em>cestui que </em>trust, being <em>sui juris, </em>participates in, or consents to, or after full knowledge acquiesces in an act of the trustee, amounting to a breach of trust, it amounts to a waiver, he cannot afterwards complain. <em>Adams Eq., </em>62, in 68 <em>Law Lib., </em>93, 94. <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>(1 <em>Am.

The corn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>plainants do not allege in their bills, any excuse by which they can be taken out of the case of adults, neither mistake, fraud, infancy or any thing else. Rut, suppose they had alleged infancy, this defence could not avail them, and was completely waived by what subsequently took place. The guardian is constituted the peculiar custodian of the infant\u2019s rights, and when he comes forward and deals with an executor and compromises the rights of his ward, the infant is bound, so far as the executor is concerned, and must look to the guardian\u2019s bond for redress. The executor is authorised to look to the guardian as the representative of the infant. But when these infants came of age they released the guardian, with full knowledge that this legacy had not been paid, and this release is binding on them. 5 <em>Gill, </em>29, <em>Forbes vs. Forbes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-5\">Again <em>laches </em>and <em>lapse of time </em>are a full bar to this whole claim. Many of the cases already cited are applicable to this point. The question is, at what time parties must come in to be relieved from the equitable bar, and this depends upon the peculiar circumstances of each case. In 4 <em>Richardson\u2019s Eq. Rep., </em>349, a case already cited, and one very similar to the present, it was said, that parties desirous of opening a settlement on the ground of errors or mistakes, must <em>make haste </em>in their application to the court. In 1 <em>Bailey\u2019s Eq. Rep., </em>197, 198, <em>Moore vs. Porcher, </em>it was held, that an executor who makes a <em>general distribution </em>of the estate, will be protected after the <em>lapse of four </em>years; if he makes a full and fair distribution he no longer sustains the character of executor, but the trust is discharged. Again, the parties must come in at such a time as that the court can do full and equal justice to all parties. 13 <em>Ohio Rep., </em>585, <em>Ludlow vs. Cooper. </em>If the overpaid legatees should be held not to be liable by reason of the <em>laches </em>of tiiese complainants, then clearly the executor ought to be released. The plea of <em>laches </em>and <em>lapse of time </em>is as effectual as the plea of limitations, and they are analogously applied in equity. 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., secs. </em>1520, 1520 <em>(a,) </em>and <em>notes. </em>30 <em>Miss.

These parties had a remedy at law; they could have sued in the orphans court, and they could have sued at law on the <em>executors' bond. </em>The remedy was at least <em>concurrent, </em>and in such case equity will, in <em>obedience </em>to the statute, apply the statutory bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-5\">4th. That in any view of the case, the court, having now before it, as parties to the case, under the supplemental bill and answer, the four residuary legatees who were overpaid in the distribution of the estate to the prejudice of these complainants, and the two Worthingtons, who were exclusively entitled to this bequest of $10,000, ought, in relief of the executor and trustee to give the complainants relief, if any, by <em>direct decree </em>against such overpaid residuary legatees. That he is entitled to such relief in this case and on this bill, as against his co-defendants, is clearly settled by the case of <em>Gibson vs. McCormick, </em>10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>101. The court has power to <em>mould the decree, </em>so as to do complete justice between the parties, (5 <em>Gill, </em>355, <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Bank vs. Wayman &amp; Stockett,) </em>and will decree immediate payment from those who are ultimately bound. 5 <em>Cranch, </em>330, <em>Riddle vs. Mandeville. </em>1 <em>Bailey's Eq.

That these co-defendants are liable if the complainants have any claim, is clear, for by the distribution of the residue, without deducting this bequest of $10,000, they have by the admissions of their own answers, received more than they ought to the amount of $5000, or one-half thereof, and they received this with full knowledge of this bequest, and that it had not been paid as is fully shown by the will and the executors\u2019 accounts. These co-defendants are, therefore,' each respectively and severally liable to the legatees in remainder, for the amounts they respectively received in the distribution of this residue, over and beyond what they were entitled to in the proper distribution of it. A devise of <em>residue, </em>is of what remains after <em>debts </em>and <em>legacies </em>are paid, and when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>party takes this before the legacies are paid, he takes what the will does not give him, and receives it as trustee for those entitled, and must refund. 1 <em>McCord\u2019s Ch.

After answers were filed by the respondents, John T. Worthington and Samuel Worthington, the complainants, on the 8th day of January 1855, filed a petition praying leave to amend their said bill; and the same being granted, they on the 11th of January 1855, exhibited their amended bill, whereby they made parties defendants the said John T. Worthington as surviving executor, (Richard Johns his co-executor having died,) and also till the said residuary legatees, claiming among other things such relief as may be necessary to reform and correct the distribution of the said legacy of ten thousand dollars, so as to give to the Complainants their full share thereof, and interest thereon from the time the same became payable, and to cause any of the said parties who may have received more than his, her or their share or aliares, to account for, restore and pay over the same as they may be directed by the court, with interest thereon since the date of such wrongful overpayments; and that the whole distribution of said legacy, and its accumulated interest, may be now adjusted, settled and paid over, as if the same liad never been erroneously made.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The defence of the several respondents is based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>lapse of time and the <em>laches </em>of the complainants in making their claim, their acquiescence and concurrence ill the settlement of the estate by the executors, and in the distribution of the assets, and the releases executed by the said Anna Maria and Comfort M. to their guardian, and the release given by their husbands to the executors are also relied upon as a bar to the relief prayed, and the residuary legatees have pleaded the statute of limitations in bar of any claim against them, either by the complainants or by the respondent, Worthington.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">A <em>pro forma </em>decree having been passed, by the circuit court, dismissing the bill) the complainants have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The respondent, John T. Worthington, by his answer, claims that in the event of his being held answerable to said complainants for their shares of said legacy, the other respondents, Love and wife, Hodges and wife, John T. Johns and Richard Johns, Who were overpaid in said distribution among the residuary legatees, ought to be compelled by decree to refund and pay the same to him, or by direct decree to pay the same to the complainants to his relief, and the said John T. Worthington and Samuel Worthington have also appealed from said decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">It is clear, from the facts and circumstances disclosed by the record, that the executors acted from the beginning under a mistake as to the effect of the renunciation by the widow; and all the errors which occurred in the administration of the estate grew out of that mistake. The legal effect of such renunciation is not any longer a matter of contest in the cause; the authorities abundantly establish that by such renunciation the rights and interests of the legatees in remainder were in no wise affected. See <em>Darrington vs. </em>Rogers, 1 <em>Gill, </em>403; <em>McElfresh, Admr., vs. Schley &amp; Barr, </em>2 <em>Gill, </em>203.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">While, therefore, the renunciation had the effect of striking from the will the bequest to Mrs. Worthington, the estate in the remainder was vested in the persons to whom the same was limited by the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">We regard the probate of the will, and the taking out of letters testamentary by John T. Worthington, as a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>evidence of the acceptance by him of the trust created by the will, and there is no proof of any actual renunciation or disclaimer till the filing of his answer in this cause. See <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>214. 2 <em>Wms. on Excrs., </em>1530.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u201cWhere a party has once fixed himself by any means with the acceptance of a trust, he cannot afterwards, by disclaimer, renounce or repudiate the duties and responsibilities of the office.\u201d <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>219.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Looking at the several clauses of the will which we have cited, we are of opinion that the trust created and vested in John T. Worthington, was not limited to the life of Mrs. Worthington, but was a continuing, subsisting trust for the parties in remainder after her death, and the trustee could only be discharged from his obligation by the payment of the fund to the <em>cestuis que trust. </em>The legal interest was vested in him by the will; he was charged with the performance of certain duties with reference to the fund; had the power of investing, selling and reinvesting; and to enable him to discharge those duties, and to carry out the purposes of the trust, his estate extended be3rond the life of Mrs. Worthington. Such, we think, was the intention of the testator, as gathered from the will. Whatever might be the construction of the will as to the extent of the estate vested in the trustee, if the propert}^ devised were realty \u2014 and on this question the authorities seem to be somewhat conflicting \u2014 -here the devise is of personalty, and we entertain no doubt that the fee was vested in the trustee, and could not be devested, except by a transfer by him. <em>Hill, </em>in iiis treatise already referred to, after citing and commenting on the various cases in which this question had arisen, sa3Ts, on page 248: \u201cThe question as to the duration of the estate of the trustees can rarely arise where the subject is personal estate; for in that case the whole legal interest is in general vested in the trustees by a gift, without any words of limitation, and will continue in them until devested by a legal transfer or assignment. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Such being, in our opinion, the true construction of the will, it follows that it was the duty of John T. Worthington, the trustee, to collect and receive the said legacy of $10,000, for the purposes of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>If he had been sob executor, it is clear that by operation of Saw, the fund would be considered in his hands as trustee after the time limited by law for the settlement of the estate. It has been argued that this principle is inapplicable to this case, because Worthington was a co-executor with another; and <em>Watkins' case, </em>2 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>220, has been cited in support of \u00a1that-view. But it appears from the record that Richard Johns, the co-executor, died before the filing of the bill; Worthington then became, as survivor, the sole executor, and the principle to which we have adverted would therefore apply in the same manner as if he had been sole executor from the beginning. This is the plain inference from the ruling' of the court in <em>Watkins\u2019 case. </em>The trustee is, therefore, answerable to the complainants as <em>cesluis que trust </em>for their respective proportions of the legacy, unless something has occurred to relieve him from such responsibility. In our opinion, the releases relied upon ia defence <em>cannot </em>avail to bar the equity sought by the complainants. Conceding that the releases of the wards to their guardian, made after they had attained the age of eighteen, when by the statute they were competent to execute them, and being made <em>bona fide, </em>would operate as a good acquittance to the guardian, still such releases could not operate to discharge from liability any third person holding funds in the character of their trustee, or responsible to them in that character for funds which had never been paid or transferred to their guardian. Nor cam lire release to the executors, dated die 17th of July 184\u00bb, have the effect of discharging John T. \u2019Worthington, the trustee, from his liability for the specific legacy. The latter release, by its terms, purported only to discharge the <em>executors </em>from the sums due to the parties releasing, <em>as residuary legatees </em>of John T. Worthington, deceased, and applied only to the proportions of the personal estate of said deceased due to them in that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The only remaining questions for us to consider, are, whether the complainants are barred of their equitable relief by limitations or lapse of time, or their <em>laches and </em>delay in making their claim? or by acquiescence and concurrence in the settlement of the estate and distribution of the fund?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>After a careful examination of the numerous authorities cited as applicable to this part of the case, we are of opinion that none of those grounds of defence ought ip prevail in this court. The bequest in the will is admitted to be valid, and the accounts exhibited show conclusively that it has not been paid to the parties entitled, owing to a mistake of the executors in the construction of the will. Those accounts show also, the manner in which and (he persons to whom the fund has been improperly paid. The parties who have received wrongfully,,as well as the executor and trustee, are alive and in court, subject to its decree; and we see no suiln cient reason why the court may not do simple justice, by an equitable adjustment of the claims of the parties, and a correction of the errors which have been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">We have said that tiie trust in John T. Worthington, under the will, was a continuing trust; and that being so, we think the facts in the case do not show any such lapse of time, <em>laches, </em>or delay on the part of the complainants as can operate to bar their claim against him. What will constitute such a lapse of time and <em>laches </em>as will bar the right of parties to recover on a claim purely equitable, all the authorities say, must depend upon the particular facts and circumstances of each case. In the administration of the estate, the duty of the executors was to ascertain the persons entitled to the fund; their proceedings in the orphans court were <em>ex parte; </em>no steps were taken by them, nuder the act of 1798, ch. 101, sub-ch. 14, sec. 12, in appointing a meeting of claimants, nor was the distribution made under any order of the court; it was not conclusive on the complainants, even if they had been <em>sui juris. </em>But eyen supposing that those proceedings were known to the complainants, or were constructive notice to them of the acts of the executors, until the final distribution was made, they were not a notification to them that the legacy was not to be paid; notwithstanding any thing which appeared in the accounts, there might have been sufficient assets in the hands of the executors, not returned to the orphans court, to pay the legacy, or sufficient assets for that purpose yet to be received by them. When the final distribution was made, tile com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>plainants were married women. Under these circumstances, we find no such acquiescence or concurrence on the part of the complainants as ought to preclude them from relief against John T. Worthington, and inasmuch as the respondents, Love and wife, Hodges and wife, John Tolley Johns and Richard Johns, have erroneously received the fund to which the complainants are entitled, they are equitably bound to refund the same, they having taken the fund subject to the trust, and the defences set up by them cannot avail to bar the recovery by the complainants; what we have said as to the responsibility of Worthington, is equally applicable to them. See 2 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>Rep., 626, 627. 1 <em>McCord's Ch. </em>Rep., 388, 389. <em>Stephenson vs. Axson, </em>1 <em>Bailey's Eq. Rep., </em>274.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b450-10\">(Decided July 22nd, 1858.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The sum which the complainants were entitled to receive under the will, was one-fourth part each of the legacy of $10,000; having already received the one-eighth pari each of that sum, in the distribution erroneously made, there remains due to each of them the principal sum of $1250, on which we think they are equitably entitled to receive interest from the time that the same was wrongfully paid to the residuary legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The payments were made to them in various sums and at different times, running through a period of several years; a portion of the money thus paid to them, they were entitled to as residuary legatees, and in fixing the time from which interest is to be counted, we adopt the date of the last payment. Considering that the amount which the complainants are entitled to recover ought to be paid by John T. Worthington primarily, and that he is entitled to relief against the respondents, Love, Hodges, John Tolley Johns and Richard Johns, who are ultimately bound for the same, we shall decree accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">As to the respondent, Samuel Worthington, who, by his answer, disclaims any claim for the portion of the legacy due to him, the bill ought to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\n<em>Decree reversed, and decree in favor of complainants.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The same judge delivered the following opinion on the appeal of John T. Worthington and Samuel Worthington:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The decree from which this appeal was taken, was in favor of the appellants. They were respondents below, and by the decree of the circuit court, the bill was dismissed with costs. The appellants were, therefore, in no manner aggrieved thereby, and the appeal by them was erroneous, and must be dismissed. In order to save the rights of the respondents, John T. Worthington and Samuel Worthington, as set up by them in their respective answers, no appeal on their part was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">(Decided July 22nd, 1858.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
