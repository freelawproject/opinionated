And the said <em>Brandt </em>was ordered to run the lines according to the lines and courses of the patent, and according to the imaginary lines, and according to the direction of the Jury aforesaid, and the oath of the evidences, so as the truth of the matter, touching the said original bounds of the said defendant\u2019s land may be the better found out and discovered ; and to return a certificate of his proceedings herein, and a fair plot of the land in question, as well touching the said land according to the lines of the patent, as of the survey taken by direction of the Jury and witnesses aforesaid, in case they happen to differ, to the next Court; upon return of which certificate and plot aforesaid, the defendant is to put in his plea as he shall be advised, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">At the next term, (February, 1681,) it was \u201c ordered, \u201c that the defendant\u2019s plea to this action of ejectment be \u201c the general issue, and that this cause come to trial next \u201c Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">At the next term, <em>(May, </em>1682,) the order made at <em>November </em>-Term for a resurvey of the defendant\u2019s land, is recited at length; and it is also stated, that at <em>February </em>Term, 1681, the surveyor made return of the proceedings, and that the cause was continued till the present term.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-12\">When it was alleged by the defendant\u2019s attorney, that the said survey of the lands aforementioned was no true survey, for that in the plots of the defendant\u2019s land drawn by the surveyor and returned to the Court, doth not appear to be the quantity of acres mentioned in the certificate aforesaid, and that the defendant\u2019s witnesses, who could have proved the true ancient bound trees, and the line trees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>from one bound tree to another, were not permitted to be th\u00b0rc,ugfrly examined, nor was there any notice taken of the line trees by the surveyor or Jury, and that the plain-has his full quantity of acres of land according to his patent, without coming within any part of the clear ground of the said defendant. And therefore the said defendant prayed that the said commission of resurvey might be renewed, and that the said surveyor might be ordered to run the true ancient bounds thereof according to the evidence and the directions of the Jury, (if the lines and bounds according to the evidence and directions of the Jury happen to differ from the lines of the patent,) and when the same is so laid out as aforesaid, that then he run the line of the plaintiff\u2019s land next adjoining to the said defendant\u2019s land, according to the patent for the same, and the ancient known bounds thereof. Whereupon it was ordered by the Court, with the consent of the plaintiff and defendant, that a new Warrant issue, and that the said surveyor return a several and distinct certificate, and a fair plot thereof, when surveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">At <em>October </em>Term, 1682, a trial was had, and a verdict found for the plaintiff. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Taken from Lib.

It may be useful to the gentlemen of the bar to know, that the practice of executing warrants of resurvey in ejectment by the surveyor in the presence of the sheriff, <em>under the direction of a \u00bffury of the neighbourhood, </em>impanelled by the sheriff for that purpose, prevailed for a long time in the Provincial Court. As far back as the records have been consulted,' the practice appears to have prevailed ip the following cases in addition to the two above reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\"><em>Robert Ridgely\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>William Layson, February </em>Term, 1679.
