Mitchell, and that it would be followed by evidence, showing that her agent entered on the land, and demanded possession from the defendant, and that it was refused; the demand and refusal being more than one year prior to the institution of this action. The court refused to allow the testimony to go to the jury, and it is this refusal which constitutes the ground of the exception of the appellant.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>This case was argued during the present term before Le Grand, C.

Judgment in ejectment will support an action for mesne profits, because of the confession of lease, entry and ouster. But ejectment is not necessary to support an action for mesne profits. <em>Butller\u2019s N.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqY\">who, after stating the case as above, proceeded:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">We think the evidence was properly rejected by the county court. This is an action for <em>mesne profits, </em>and, although we have made the most diligent search, we have been unable to find a single reported case, in which such an action has been maintained <em>before </em>a recovery in ejectment. The labors of the learned counsel for the appellant, so far as this court is informed, were attended, in this particular, with no better success. In <em>all </em>the cases to which we have had reference, in which an action for <em>mesne profits </em>was maintained, it appeared, there had been a <em>previous recovery in ejectment, </em>and in the elementary treatises the action is declared to be, \u201cconsequential to the recovery in ejectment.\u201d 2 <em>Stephens Nisi Prius, </em>1489. The origin of this action is thus explained in <em>Adams on Ejectment, </em>379: \u201cWhilst,\u201d says that writer, \u201cthe action of ejectment remained in its original state, and the ancient practice prevailed, the measure of the damages given by the jury, when the plaintiff recovered his term, were the profits of the land accruing during the tortious holding of the defendant. But as upon the introduction of the modern system, the proceedings became altogether fictitious, and the plaintiff merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>nominal, the damages assessed became nominal also; and they have not since that time included the injury sustained by the claimant, from the loss of his possession. It was therefore necessary, to give another remedy to the claimant for these damages; and this was effected by a new application of the common action of trespass <em>vi et </em>armis, generally termed an action for <em>mesne profits, </em>in which action, the plaintiff complains of his ejection and loss of possession, states the time during which the defendant (the real tenant,) held the lands and took the rents and profits, and prays judgment for the damages which he has thereby sustained.\u201d At page 382 of the same writer, it is said: \u201cThe action for <em>mesne profits </em>may he brought <em>pending </em>a writ of error in ejectment, and the plaintiff may proceed to ascertain his damages, and to sign bis judgment; <em>but the court will slay execution until the writ of error is </em>determined.\u201d These views are fully sustained by the references made by the author, and show that this action was prematurely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It being conceded in argument, by counsel for appellant, that there had been no recovery in ejectment, prior to the institution of this action, this court cannot send it hack to supply proof, which it is admitted has no existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
