In the case of <em>Carvill's </em>Lessee v. Griffith, at <em>April </em>Term, 1762, in the Court of Appeals, <em>T. </em>Johnson, in his argument said, that in the case of <em>Spalding </em>and <em>Reeder, </em>the warrant was to survey 200 acres, but the surveyor returned 207 acres. And as the determination was on a recent grant in 1742, the Court knew the prevailing rules for its construction. That Lord <em>Coke </em>says, Courts are to give such construction as prevailed at the time of the grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\"><em>William </em>Paca, in his argument in the same case, says, that in the case of <em>Spalding </em>and Reeder, <em>Spalding </em>obtained a common warrant for 200 acres; he took up 207 acres including four acres of cultivated lands, the attempt there was to destroy the patent, as well for the uncultivated as the cultivated part, which was unjust and disallowed. In that case the fraud was <em>dehors </em>and not apparent, therefore the extrinsic matter could not be given in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">T. Johnson, in his reply, says, the case of <em>Spalding </em>and <em>Reeder </em>has not been answered; for where the King is deceived in his grant, the books say it is absolutely void, but there is no force in the reasoning, that if a man demands too much, he shall not have that which he is justly entitled to; and, therefore, that could not have been the reason of the miscarriage of the suit, but the principle before assigned. See the case of <em>Carvill </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>at <em>May </em>Term, 1769.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>A CASE.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\"><em>Benjamin Boyd </em>obtained a <em>common </em>warrant from the land-office dated 22d June, 1738, which he located on cultivated land, and returned a certificate dated 14th <em>November, </em>1738. <em>Nicholas Vandemon </em>obtained a <em>special </em>warrant dated 17th <em>October, </em>1739, which he located on the same land, and returned his certificate dated 19th October, 1739, and a patent issued the 12th <em>December </em>following. <em>Boyd </em>afterwards discovering that his <em>common </em>warrant would not affect the <em>cultivated </em>land, petitioned the Judges to vacate the certificate he had returned, and to grant him a special warrant, which they did, dated the 29th <em>October </em>1739. He returned a certificate on the 2d of <em>November </em>following, which was <em>caveated </em>in the office by the above mentioned <em>Nicholas </em>Vandemon, who had already obtained a grant for this land, and on \u00e1 hearing the <em>caveat </em>was adjudged good. The matter rested thus until 1763, when <em>Thomas </em>Boyd, the grandson of Benjamin, procured from the surveyor\u2019s books a copy of the above certificate, which had been vacated as aforesaid; with this he applied to the office and obtained a patent, under colour whereof he claims to hold the land. <em>Shiestion. </em>In whom is the legal title of this land ? If in Boyd, can the persons claiming under <em>Vandemon </em>be relieved in equity ?</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">I think the legal title is in the person who claims under-the elder certificate. I remember the point was determined in\u2019the case of <em>Reeder </em>and <em>Spalding, </em>in the Provincial Court and Court -of Appeals, and in consequence thereof, there was an information in the Court of Chancery to vacate <em>Spalding\u2019s </em>patent, in a similar case, <em>Spalding </em>having obtained a patent on a certificate upon a common warrant, when the land was cultivated.</p>\n<p id=\"ABs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The above facts being pi-oved, the fraud will I think be a ground for an information, on <em>scire </em>facias, and I have no doubt but the patent may be vacated. When the objection to a patent is made in a Court of law, it is, because it is void, and to be <em>void; </em>being considered as a sort of record,the fraud ought to appear <em>in the patent; </em>when the fraud arises on circumstances <em>dehors </em>the grant, it has been considered as voidable, and therefore that some suit ought to be instituted for its vacating. This was the distinction, and it always prevailed whilst I was in the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Daniel Dulany,</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">10th <em>March, </em>1768.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
