The defendant in the court below pleaded non-assumpsit, and issue was joined on that plea. At the trial of the case, the plaintiff, to maintain its action, offered in evidence its charter, whereby it appears that the plaintiff had not sued by its corporate name; or as it was expressed in one of the prayers of the defendant, there is a material variance between the names of the plaintiffs as stated in their writ, and the name of the corporation contained in the charter given in evidence by the plaintiffs. Because of this, the court, at the instance of the defendant, instructed the jury that the plaintiff cannot recover. Exception being taken, and verdict being for the defendant, the case is brought by appeal to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>This case was argued before Le Grand, C.

The corporate <em>existence </em>of plaintiff being established by its charter, its right to use the <em>name </em>by which it sues, can only be questioned, and proof of such right can only be demanded by a plea in abatement. It was so decided in <em>Bank of Metropolis vs. Orme. </em>If pleaded in abatement, it must show how it acquired a right to sue by a name other than that to be found in its original charter.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b509-15\">Le Grand, C.
