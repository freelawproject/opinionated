Yet they presume to have right to the land they enjoy, for that they made oath of fidelity in Capt. <em>Stone\u2019s </em>time of government, and seated their lands upon his Lordship\u2019s promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-5\">Col.

But that in place and stead thereof an engagement should be taken in manner and form, as in those articles, relation unto them being had, more at large appeareth. And whereas by an act of this last General Assembly the said articles are confirmed, and the said engagement by law commanded to be taken. To the end the said articles may be inviolably observed, and that all jealousies and fears be removed \u2014 -These are in the Lord Proprietary\u2019s name, strictly to charge, and command all persons whatsoever to make their repair to their clerks of their respective County Courts, at or before the 20th day of <em>August, </em>next ensuing, to make their subscriptions to the said engagement, or else that they provide themselves to depart the Province by the 25th day of <em>March </em>next; And to declare that all person's who shall be found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>in any part of this Province after the 25th of <em>March </em>afore said, shall be proceeded against as rebels and traitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-4\">Given under my hand this 23d of <em>July, </em>1658.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">\n<em>Josias Fendall.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">See Liber S. fol. <em>71. </em>the oldest record book of the prti ceedings in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">WRIT.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-8\">These are to will and require you in the Lord Proprietary\u2019s name, to summon all persons who have not subscribed the engagement within your County to appear at the meeting-house in the said County upon Tuesday, the 2d day of <em>August </em>next, then and there to shew cause why the lands in their possession, or pretended to be held by title derived from them, shall not be seized into the hands of the Lord Proprietary.
