He pleaded guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to using a facility in interstate commerce to attempt to coerce a minor to engage in criminal sexual acts and was sentenced to 65 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">On appeal, Hatton contends that he is entitled to resentencing under Amendment 732 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court is authorized to reduce a sentence based on a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission only if the amendment to the Guidelines is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) of the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); United States Sentenoing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10(a) &amp; cmt. n. 1 (2004). Amendment 732 is not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Hatton\u2019s motion was not an abuse of discretion. See United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1 (2004); <em>United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
