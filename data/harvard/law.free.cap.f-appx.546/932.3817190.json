After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-18\">Reed was convicted in 2008 of two counts of crack-cocaine distribution, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(iii). At sentencing, the parties stipulated that Reed was responsible for 74.7 total grams of crack cocaine. This triggered a base-offense level of 30. Because he was classified as a career offender, however, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) Reed\u2019s adjusted offense level was 37 and his criminal-history category was VI. After adjustments under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), Reed\u2019s total offense level was 34, and his resulting guidelines range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court imposed a term of imprisonment of 262 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-19\">In February 2012, Reed filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 750.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied Reed\u2019s motion, and this is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-20\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). We have previously held defendants sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, like Reed, are not entitled to a reduction under Amendment 750. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008). Reed contends he is entitled to a reduction, even as a career offender, because <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (plurality opinion), undermines the holding of <em>Moore. </em>We have, however, previously rejected this contention. <em>Lawson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>686 F.3d at 1319-21. And we are bound by that ruling, and, thus, by <em>Moore, </em>unless and until it is overruled by the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc. Id. </em>at 1319. For this reason, we must also reject Reed\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a reduction in his sentence under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012), we held that a defendant was not entitled to a reduction in his sentence under the FSA when he was sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date, August 3, 2010. We are bound by that decision and must apply it to bar Reed\u2019s claim because he was sentenced before that date. For these reasons, the district court was correct to deny Reed\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-17\">. Although Reed initially filed his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion <em>pro </em>se, he was appointed counsel, who supplemented the motion with additional briefing. Reed has also previously filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706, which the district court denied and declined to reconsider. The appeal now before us does not concern his arguments related to that amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
