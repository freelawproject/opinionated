After careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Accepting the facts alleged in England\u2019s pleadings as true at this motion to dismiss stage, plaintiff England is a veteran \u201cwriter, journalist and public relations professional\u201d who has worked on the editorial staffs of local and national news publications, in the public relations department of a major company, for a community theater program, and as the director of \u201cthe first adaptive alternative education and community learning center in the City of Tampa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">In May 2009, England applied for the position of \u201cwriting tutor\u201d at the Tutorial Center of defendant Hillsborough\u2019s Ybor Campus. The Tutorial Center\u2019s director, Alex Bell, promised England that she would get the job \u201cif the budget goes through.\u201d Bell suggested that, in the meantime, England start work on a volunteer basis, and she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">England continued in this volunteer position for eight months. During this period, she repeatedly inquired as to whether a paid position was forthcoming. Each time, Bell refused to give her any information.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Thereafter, Bell left his position as the Tutorial Center\u2019s director, and England applied for that job. England did not get the position, and she was the only in-house applicant not invited to interview. The position went to \u201ca 22-year-old white male graduate of the University of South Florida\u201d and was this person\u2019s \u201cfirst job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">After not receiving a paid position of any type \u2014 either as a writing tutor or as the Tutorial Center director \u2014 England complained to the administrator responsible for the Tutorial Center, Linda Herlocker. In response, Herlocker offered England \u201ca \u2018better\u2019 position ... as \u2018Student Success Coordinator,\u2019 reporting directly to Dr. Herlocker.\u201d Herlocker told England that the \u201cofficial tasks and function[s]\u201d of this position \u201cwere not yet clearly defined because the position was new.\u201d England accepted the position and \u201cwas told that the position would begin on January 11, 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">England did not, however, start work on that date. Prior to her start date, England encountered difficulties completing the necessary paperwork. Herlocker then rescinded the offer on January 8, 2010. Later, England learned that the position of \u201cStudent Success Coordinator\u201d was not a new one, and was not vacant at the time Herlocker offered it to England. England\u2019s original complaint stated that \u201cthe \u2018position\u2019 described by the Dean of Student Services did not actually exist within the approved operating budget but had been \u2018invented\u2019 as a diversionary tactic to distract the Plaintiff from a potential charge of discrimination against the college.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">A. First Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">After receiving a right to sue letter from the EEOC, England filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in the Middle District of Florida. England\u2019s complaint requested compensatory and punitive damages, as well as an order that she be \u201c \u2018reinstated\u2019 in the position ... of Student Success Coordinator.\u201d England\u2019s complaint referred to, <em>inter alia, </em>Title VII, the Americans with Disabilities Act (the \u201cADA\u201d), and the Age Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>crimination in Employment Act (the \u201cADEA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">England filed a substantially identical first amended complaint and then served defendant Hillsborough College. After-wards, Hillsborough responded with a motion to dismiss, arguing that England\u2019s amended complaint \u201cis vague, ambiguous and fails to state a cause of action on which relief can be granted.\u201d The district court agreed and dismissed the first amended complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">When it dismissed the first amended complaint, the district court stated that England could \u201camend the amended complaint\u201d within a certain period, and that \u201c[cjontinued failure to allege a claim for relief [would] result in dismissal with prejudice.\u201d The district court advised that \u201cTHE PLAINTIFF SHOULD RETAIN COUNSEL.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">B. Second and Third Amended Complaints</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Accordingly, England proceeded to file a second and a third amended complaint, however she continued to proceed <em>pro se. </em>England\u2019s third amended complaint asserted claims for: (1) breach of contract; (2) age discrimination under the ADEA; (3) unequal pay under the \u201cFair Employment Practices Act\u201d; (4) fraud; (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (6) retaliatory discharge; (7) abuse of process; (8) verbal harassment; and (9) discriminatory, abusive, and unfair labor practices (later construed by the district court as a Title VII claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Defendant Hillsborough College filed another motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which the district court also granted. The district court dismissed England\u2019s claims with prejudice, except for her breach of contract, fraud, and Title VII claims. The district court\u2019s order included specific instructions about what a litigant must plead to assert one of those types of claims. The district court stated that \u201con or before NOVEMBER 23, 2012, the plaintiff shall submit a fourth amended complaint and shall limit the allegations to breach of contract, fraud, and Title VII discrimination.\u201d It cautioned England that \u201cFAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM WILL LIKELY RESULT IN DISMISSAL OF THIS ACTION WITH PREJUDICE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">C. Fourth Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">England, <em>pro se, </em>filed a notice of interlocutory appeal of the district court\u2019s with-prejudice dismissal of her other claims and requested a stay of the district court proceedings pending appeal. The district court granted the stay, and this Court subsequently dismissed the interlocutory appeal for \u201cwant of prosecution because the appellant ... failed to file record excerpts within the time fixed by the rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">England <em>pro se </em>thereafter filed a fourth amended complaint. This pleading contained no factual allegations. Rather, it stated that \u201cbetween April 30, 2009 and January 9, 2010, the Defendant did willfully, knowingly, and with deliberate intent commit the following actions in violation of the Plaintiffs civil rights as defined in Title VI, Title VII, and Title IX of the United States Code: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7, the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (\u201cCRRA\u201d) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1687; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-4a, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6101), the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and The Age Discrimination in Employment Act.\u201d The \u201cactions\u201d to which the complaint referred were not factual allegations, but rather were more legal claims, including, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cbreach of contract in failure to hire,\u201d \u201cconstructive fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation,\u201d and \u201cviolation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and/or any other federal law prohibiting unequal pay for equal work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Defendant Hillsborough College responded to this fourth amended complaint with another motion to dismiss, which the district court also granted. The district court observed that the \u201cfourth amended complaint [was] entirely devoid of facts.\u201d Therefore, dismissal of all claims with prejudice was appropriate. England appealed the with-prejudice dismissal of her fourth amended complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We must first determine the scope of our review. England\u2019s notice of appeal is limited to the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims in her fourth amended complaint. However, on appeal, England appears to challenge also the district court\u2019s dismissal of claims asserted in her third amended complaint. As noted, we previously dismissed England\u2019s interlocutory appeal of those claims. Because the district court\u2019s dismissal of England\u2019s fourth amended complaint was a final judgment in this action, the scope of our review extends to \u201call prior non-final orders and rulings\u201d and \u201crulings on previous interlocutory orders.\u201d <em>Barfield, v. Brierton, </em>883 F.2d 923, 930-31 (11th Cir.1989). Thus, we consider the district court\u2019s with-prejudice dismissals of claims in both England\u2019s third and fourth amended complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">A. Third Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">On appeal, England challenges the with-prejudice dismissal of four of the claims she asserted in her third amended complaint \u2014 the ADEA claim, the \u201cFair Employment Practices Act\u201d claim, the retaliatory discharge claim, and the harassment claim. In dismissing these claims, the district court stated: \u201cthe Eleventh Amendment continues to bar the ADEA claim and neither a \u2018Fair Employment Practices Act\u2019 claim, a general \u2018retaliatory discharge\u2019 claim, nor a \u2018verbal harassment claim\u2019 appears in Florida or federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">The district court did not err. As for the ADEA claim, \u201cin the ADEA, Congress did not validly abrogate the States\u2019 sovereign immunity to suits by private individuals.\u201d <em>Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>528 U.S. 62, 91, 120 S.Ct. 631, 650, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000). As an \u201carm of the state,\u201d a Florida community college like defendant Hillsborough College enjoys immunity from suit. <em>Williams v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Edison Cmty. Coll., Fla., </em>421 F.3d 1190, 1194 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, the ADEA claim was barred. As for the other claims, England offers nothing to challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that her claims lack any legal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">B. Fourth Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">England also challenges the district court\u2019s with-prejudice dismissal of the remaining claims in her fourth amended complaint. As for these claims, the district court dismissed them because, after England had received numerous opportunities to amend her pleading, she filed a \u201ccomplaint entirely devoid of facts.\u201d We agree with the district court that England\u2019s fourth amended complaint, which was essentially a list of statutory and common law claims without any facts, much less any effort to link allegations to claims, did not satisfy the pleading requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>set forth in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (requiring that a complaint contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, in order to give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). <em>Twombly </em>demands that a complaint contain \u201cenough facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974. England\u2019s fourth amended complaint contained no facts and therefore did not satisfy <em>Twombly</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>s pleading requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">To the extent England argues that the district court should have granted her leave to amend, we note that England did not request leave to amend. Even if she had, we would not find reversible error. \u201cWe review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001). The district court gave England two opportunities to file amended complaints, and, each time, gave her explicit instructions as to what those amended complaints should contain. Moreover, England filed a total of five complaints in this case. In none of those pleadings did England heed the district court\u2019s instructions. In light of England\u2019s repeated \u201cfailure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,\u201d the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing England\u2019s fourth amended complaint with prejudice and without allowing her yet another opportunity to amend. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of all of the claims asserted by plaintiff England in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-8\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass'n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>\u201c[P]ro se </em>pleadings are held to a less strict standard than pleadings filed by lawyers and thus are construed liberally.\u201d <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). However, <em>pro se </em>parties still must adhere to the procedural rules. <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
