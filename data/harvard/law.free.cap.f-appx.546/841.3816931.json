Waterfield alleged that Florida Judges William Gary Law, Jr., Jacqueline R. Griffin, Vincent George Tor-py, Jr., and Charles Alan Lawson (collectively referred to as the \u201cJudges\u201d) violated his constitutional rights in their respective orders denying his 2011 motion for post-conviction relief and affirming that denial on appeal. He sought damages and requested injunctive relief directing the Judges to discharge him from liability for his 1985 conviction and sentence. The district court dismissed his damages claims because the Judges were entitled to judicial immunity and dismissed his claim for injunctive relief because it was not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">On appeal, Waterfield argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in dismissing his complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. He also contends that the Judges were not entitled to absolute judicial immunity because they lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim. <em>Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). We review a district court\u2019s grant of judicial immunity <em>de novo. Smith v. Shook, </em>237 F.3d 1322, 1325 (11th Cir.2001). The Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, requires the district court to review all complaints filed by prisoners against a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity to determine whether the action is \u201cfrivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\u201d; or \u201cseeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-17\">The standards that apply to a dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) apply to a dismissal under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). <em>Leal, </em>254 F.3d at 1278-79. In reviewing a complaint, the district court accepts the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006). To survive dismissal, a plaintiffs complaint \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>for relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Stating a claim upon which relief may be granted \u201crequires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not\u201d be enough to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A <em>pro se </em>complaint is liberally construed and held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys. <em>Boxer X, </em>437 F.3d at 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Judges are entitled to absolute immunity for all actions taken in their judicial capacity, except where they act in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1105, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978)). Absolute judicial immunity \u201capplies even when the judge\u2019s acts are in error, malicious, or were in excess of his or her jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, \u201cin any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer\u2019s judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">\u201c[Hjabeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks immediate or speedier release.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Pryor, </em>305 F.3d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir.2002). A prisoner \u201ccannot use a \u00a7 1983 action to challenge the fact or duration of his confinement.\u201d <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 1245, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, a \u00a7 1983 action is barred if \u201csuccess in that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81-82, 125 S.Ct. at 1247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not err in dismissing Waterfield\u2019s damages claims against the Judges because Waterfield sought relief from immune defendants. The actions taken by the Judges with respect to Wa-terfield\u2019s post-conviction motion were taken in their judicial capacity. <em>See Story, </em>225 F.3d at 1239. To the extent that Waterfield argues that the Judges acted without subject matter jurisdiction, this argument is unavailing because Water-field\u2019s conclusory allegations did not establish that they acted in \u201cclear absence of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See Rolleston v. Eldridge, </em>848 F.2d 163, 165 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe applicability of judicial immunity does not depend on the determination of nice questions of jurisdiction.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">As to Waterfield\u2019s claim for in-junctive relief, we conclude that he fails to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because his claim is not cognizable in a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. To the extent that Waterfield challenges the validity of his conviction and confinement, he must pursue that relief through a habeas petition. <em>See Bradley, </em>305 F.3d at 1289; <em>Dotson, </em>544 U.S. at 78, 125 S.Ct. at 1245. Contrary to Waterfield\u2019s contentions on appeal, the district court properly concluded that the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A standard applied because Waterfield was a prisoner seeking redress from a governmental authority. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal of Waterfield\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
