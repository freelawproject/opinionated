Benjamin Oshea Calhoun, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>sought an injunction to compel the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) to comply with his series of FOIA requests. The FBI then produced a set of responsive documents. Upon the FBI\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed the lawsuit, holding that the documents rendered the controversy moot. The district court also denied Calhoun\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">Calhoun filed his first FOIA request in November 2009. Calhoun sought copies of \u201call records\u201d pertaining to him, including surveillance records, or records of \u201celectronic eavesdropping.\u201d In a written response, the FBI informed Calhoun that it was unable to identify any such records. The FBI also informed Calhoun of his right to appeal the decision. Approximately one year later, in November 2010, Calhoun sent an e-mail to the FBI complaining of \u201cillegal hacking and fake web pages\u201d based on his apparent inability to access a certain website. The FBI responded, explaining that the described problem was not an FBI matter. From December 2010 through May 2012, Calhoun filed three more FOIA requests, seeking the same information he had sought in November 2009 \u2014 \u201call records\u201d pertaining to him, including surveillance records. In January 2011, and again in May 2012, the FBI informed Calhoun that it was unable to identify responsive records. Each time, the FBI restated that Calhoun had a right to appeal. In September 2012, Calhoun sent a letter to the attention of FBI Director Robert Mueller, complaining that his April 2012 request had not been fulfilled and again requesting \u201call records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">Calhoun filed his lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on October 5, 2012, seeking an injunction to compel the FBI to comply with his FOIA requests. Calhoun assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ed that the FBI had failed to comply with the applicable time limitations in \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A) and that therefore he had exhausted his administrative remedies pursuant to \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C). During the pen-dency of the litigation, on December 10, 2012, the FBI released thirty-eight pages of responsive records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With the exception of nine pages that included state criminal history records and one page that provided Calhoun\u2019s driver\u2019s license information, all released pages involved Calhoun\u2019s prior correspondence with the FBI \u2014 either requests for information sent by Calhoun or responses provided by the FBI. The FBI then moved to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that Calhoun had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and that the production of responsive records rendered the case moot. In an order dated January 30, 2013, the district court dismissed Calhoun\u2019s action on mootness grounds. The district court held that a viable case or controversy no longer remained, observing that while Calhoun \u201cdeplore[d] the tardiness\u201d of the FBI\u2019s response and production, Calhoun did not deny that he had received the documents. The district court subsequently denied Calhoun\u2019s motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). <em>Spotts v. United States, </em>613 F.3d 559, 565 (5th Cir.2010). We apply the same standard as the district court. <em>Wagstaff v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>509 F.3d 661, 663 (5th Cir.2007). Under Rule 12(b)(1), a district court may dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on any one of three separate bases: \u201c(1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts.\u201d <em>Spotts, </em>613 F.3d at 566 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the district court here did not resolve any disputed facts, our review is limited to whether the district court\u2019s application of the law is correct and, to the extent that the district court\u2019s decision was based on undisputed facts, whether those facts are indeed undisputed. <em>See id. </em>We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v. Diversicare Afton Oaks, LLC, </em>597 F.3d 673, 677 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">Federal subject matter jurisdiction is limited to \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. This limitation has given rise to the concept of standing: \u201ca plaintiff must have suffered ... an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if a plaintiff has standing at the commencement of a case, when intervening circumstances render the court no longer capable of providing meaningful relief to the plaintiff, the case is considered moot. <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity, Inc. v. BP Am. Prod. Co., </em>704 F.3d 413, 425 (5th Cir.2013). Federal courts have no constitutional authority to resolve moot disputes. <em>Envtl. Conservation Org. v. City of Doll., </em>529 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Under the FOIA, a plaintiff must exhaust his administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial review of a federal agency\u2019s decision. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A); <em>see also Kemmerly v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>430 Fed.Appx. 303, 304 (5th Cir.2011) (unpublished but persuasive) (citing <em>Voinche v. F.B.I., </em>999 F.2d 962, 963 (5th Cir.1993)). Where an agency fails to respond to a FOIA request in a timely manner, however, the requester is deemed to have exhausted his remedies and may bring an action in federal court. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C). Such an action challenges the failure of the agency to act at behest of the requester. <em>Voinche, </em>999 F.2d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Here, Calhoun grounded his request for injunctive relief in the FBI\u2019s alleged failure to respond to his FOIA requests, citing \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C). Even assuming that, prior to filing his action, Calhoun had exhausted his administrative remedies regarding the FBI\u2019s lack of response to his FOIA requests, the district court correctly determined that Calhoun\u2019s action was rendered moot when the FBI produced responsive records. <em>See Voinche, </em>999 F.2d at 963 (\u201cInsofar as [the plaintiff] challenged the tardiness of the FBI\u2019s response, his claim [under the FOIA] was rendered moot by the FBI\u2019s response to his request.\u201d). Calhoun has not disputed that those records were produced or that they were responsive to his request. We therefore conclude, based on the complaint and the undisputed production of thirty-eight pages of records, that a viable case or controversy no longer remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Calhoun is claiming that the FBI failed to produce all of the requested records, those claims have not been exhausted. Liberally construed, Calhoun\u2019s brief seems to contend that the FBI must be withholding records that are responsive to his litany of FOIA requests \u2014 including requests for records of \u201cphotographic surveillance\u201d and intercepted \u201coral, wire, or electronic communication[s]\u201d and records relating to the installation of the devices used to gather that information. We note that the FBI did not assert any exemptions to that effect. Nevertheless, if Calhoun wishes to contest the absence of such records, he must do so through the appropriate administrative appeals process. Accordingly, to the extent Calhoun has claims that were not mooted by the FBI\u2019s production of records, those claims were properly dismissed. <em>See Taylor v. U.S. Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>127 F.3d 470, 477 (5th Cir.1997) (claims not properly exhausted are subject to dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">We conclude that the district court committed no error in dismissing the lawsuit on mootness grounds. To the extent that any of Calhoun\u2019s claims are not moot, however, we conclude that those claims are subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. We further conclude that the district court did not err in denying Calhoun\u2019s motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">. The FBI reviewed forty-one pages, withholding three pages because they were duplicates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b515-10\">. There was no trial in this case. We construe Calhoun\u2019s motion for a new trial as a motion for reconsideration. <em>See Andrade v. Gonzales, </em>459 F.3d 538, 543 (5th Cir.2006) (\"We must construe the pleadings of pro se litigants liberally.... \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">. Calhoun asserts other arguments in his brief that are somewhat difficult to comprehend. Calhoun argues that the district court erred in not ruling on his \u201cwritten objections,\u201d but the district court explicitly stated in its order that it had considered those objections, however. Calhoun also contends that the FBI engaged in bad faith, but provides no supporting reasoning. We reject all other arguments not specifically addressed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
