He asserts that his sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) and did not take into account his personal history and characteristics, particularly his benign motive for returning. Medina also contends that he was punished disproportionately for his prior money-laundering conviction because it was used to increase his criminal history score by three points and to increase his base offense level by eight levels. Additionally, he asserts, in reliance on <em>Kimbrough v. United </em>States, 552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), that a presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because the illegal reentry guideline, \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">We review sentences for reasonableness by engaging in a bifurcated review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). First, we must ensure that the sentencing court committed no significant procedural error. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the sentencing decision is procedurally sound, we should then consider the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Medina raises no claim of procedural error and challenges only his sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">As he concedes, Medina\u2019s empirical data argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). His argument that the district court placed disproportionate emphasis on his prior money-laundering conviction is essentially an argument that guidelines range was greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals as a result of double counting, which argument is likewise unavailing. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">The district court had before it both mitigating and aggravating factors; it balanced these factors and determined that a sentence in the middle of the guidelines range was appropriate. Medina is essentially asking this court to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which it will not do. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). That an appellate court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Moreover, the within-guidelines sentence imposed by the district court is presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>tively reasonable, and Medina\u2019s argument concerning his benign motive for reentry fails to rebut that presumption. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>see </em>also <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
