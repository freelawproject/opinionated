According to Austin, he was entitled to relief, notwithstanding the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender in 1995, because (1) the crack cocaine guidelines under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, later amended by Amendment 750, factored into the district court\u2019s sentencing decision in his case and (2) the reduced statutory penalties under the Fair Sentencing Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) are retroactively applicable in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, even to defendants sentenced before the FSA became effective in 2010. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). We are bound by a prior panel opinion unless it is overruled by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting <em>en banc. Id. </em>A Supreme Court decision will overrule our prior opinion only if it is \u201cclearly on point.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if the defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Amendment 750, the amendment at issue here, effected a permanent lowering of the base-offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750. Amendment 750, however, made no changes to \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender provision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">As we explained in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (providing that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d). If an amendment did not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision,\u201d then a sentence reduction is not authorized. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). To illustrate, <em>Moore </em>held that a career offender, whose offense level was determined under \u00a7 4B1.1, was not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on amendments to the crack cocaine offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1: the base offense levels set forth in \u00a7 2D1.1 \u201cplayed no role\u201d in the calculation of the defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327 (involving Amendment 706). A career offender\u2019s offense level is determined by \u00a7 4B1.1 \u2014 not \u00a7 2D1.1 \u2014 so his sentence may not be reduced based on an amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See id.; see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), on which Austin heavily relies, did nothing to alter the just-described precepts, including those we set out in <em>Moore. See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. In <em>Freeman, </em>the question before the Supreme Court was whether defendants who entered into Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. A plurality of the Court determined that a defendant would be eligible to seek relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if the district court\u2019s decision to accept the Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea was based on the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2695 (plurality opinion). The plurality explained that, although Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements included binding sentencing recommendations, the district court \u2014 before accepting such a recommendation \u2014 was required to evaluate \u201cthe recommended sentence in light of the defendant\u2019s applicable sentencing range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2692. Accordingly, where the court accepted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea, that \u201cacceptance ... itself [was] based on the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Shortly after <em>Freeman </em>was decided, we directly considered what effect, if any, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision had on our prior ruling in <em>Moore; </em>and we concluded that there was none. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1821. Instead, in <em>Lawson, </em>we held that <em>Freeman </em>was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d to the issue raised in <em>Moore </em>\u2014 that is, the availability of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief for career offenders following amendment to the drug-quantity provisions \u2014 and therefore the <em>Freeman </em>decision did not abrogate our precedent. <em>Id. </em>To be more specific, while <em>Moore </em>considered a defendant who was preliminarily assigned a base-offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 but was actually assigned an ultimate guideline range as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, <em>Freeman </em>instead dealt with a defendant who had entered a plea agreement under Rule 11(c)(1)(C). <em>See id. </em>With <em>Freeman </em>thus distinguished from <em>Moore, </em>we determined that <em>Moore </em>remained binding and unabrogated law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Here, the district court correctly rejected Austin\u2019s first argument for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Although Amendment 750 lowered the base-offense levels for crack offenses under \u00a7 2D1.1, it left unaltered \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender provision pursuant to which Austin\u2019s guideline range was actually calculated. In <em>Moore, </em>we squarely addressed the situation presented here and concluded that those defendants whose guideline ranges were calculated as career offenders, like Austin, were not eligible for .sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) following amendments to \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. Austin\u2019s rebanee on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman </em>is misplaced. The plurality in that case may have made sentence reductions available to certain defendants to whom such relief was previously disallowed \u2014 namely, those who had entered Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements \u2014 but, as <em>Lawson </em>explained, <em>Freeman </em>simply did not speak to defendants who were sentenced as career offenders. <em>See Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. <em>Moore </em>remains good law, and Austin\u2019s argument to the contrary is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Austin\u2019s second argument for relief, based on the purported retroactive applicability of the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties, is also legally unsupported. The FSA, which became effective on 3 August 2010, lowered the statutory mandatory minimum penalties for crack cocaine offenses under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). <em>See </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. Ill\u2014 220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). The FSA also \u201cinstructed the Commission to make ... conforming amendments to the Federal sentencing guidelines ... to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2329, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012) (quotations omitted). The Commission obliged by promulgating Amendment 750, discussed above. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">The FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties are applicable to those persons sentenced after the Act took effect, but not to those persons sentenced beforehand. In <em>Dorsey, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory mandatory minimums apply to defendants who committed crack cocaine offenses before the Act became effective but who were initially sentenced <em>after </em>that date. <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2326. We later made clear that <em>Dorsey </em>did not extend to pre-FSA defendants who were sentenced <em>before </em>the Act\u2019s effective date. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). In <em>Berry, </em>after surveying then-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>existing ease law from sister circuits, we ultimately \u201cagree[d] with every other circuit to address the issue that there is no evidence that Congress intended [the FSA] to apply to defendants who had been sentenced prior to the August 3, 2010 date of the Act\u2019s enactment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Furthermore, <em>Dorsey </em>itself \u201cdid not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants ... who were sentenced long before the FSA\u2019s effective date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court in <em>Dorsey </em>carefully confined its application of the FSA to pre-Act offenders who were sentenced after\u201d that date. <em>Id. </em>at 378. '</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">With our prior ruling in <em>Berry </em>as backdrop, the district court correctly denied Austin\u2019s second argument for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. Austin has pointed to nothing in the text, history, or purpose of the FSA that demands its retroactive applicability to defendants who, like him, were sentenced <em>before </em>it took effect; and our prior precedent dictates the opposite result. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Nor does the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey </em>aid his argument, as the Court\u2019s ruling in that case was confined to defendants who, unlike him, were or would be sentenced <em>after </em>the FSA became effective. <em>See Dorsey, 567 </em>U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. at 2326. For that reason, Austin\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
