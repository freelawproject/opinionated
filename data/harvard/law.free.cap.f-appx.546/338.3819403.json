Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d 907, 911 (5th Cir.1995) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b365-8\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">A jury convicted Maria Abigail Contreras for possessing with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of methamphetamine and conspiring to do the same. She contends that insufficient evidence supports those convictions and argues that her sentence was substantively unreasonable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">\u201cA challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence that is procedurally preserved, as th[ese] ehallenge[s] w[ere], is reviewed <em>de </em>novo.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">\u201cThe offense of possession with the intent to distribute requires proof of (1) possession, (2) knowledge, and (8) intent to distribute.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial evidence showed that Contreras, who did not know how to drive, persuaded an acquaintance to cross a black Ford Mustang into the United States. She then recruited the acquaintance\u2019s husband to drive the vehicle to Houston and rebuffed his offer to use his pickup truck for the journey. When contraband was discovered at a checkpoint, Contreras gave inconsistent statements about the events that led to her presence in a vehicle loaded with approximately 4,716 kilograms of methamphetamine \u2014 a quantity worth at least $350,000. A witness also testified that Contreras asked whether there would be dogs at the checkpoint, suggesting a concern that drugs might be found in the vehicle. With respect to the possession with intent to distribute conviction, this is evidence enough.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">To establish that a defendant was a member of a drug conspiracy, the government must demonstrate \u201c\u2018(1) an agreement between two or more persons to violate the narcotics laws, (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the agreement, and (3) the defendant\u2019s voluntary participation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the conspiracy.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[A] jury can convict a defendant of conspiring with persons whose names are unknown\u201d where, as here, \u201cthe indictment charges a conspiracy with unknown persons and evidence supports their existence and the existence of a conspiracy\u201d with them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Following her arrest, Contreras gave a statement indicating that she obtained the Mustang from a person known to her as Jorge Alvarez, whom she knew was engaged in illegal activity, including drug trafficking. Contreras indicated in a statement that she was to be paid $800 for doing as Alvarez wished, and, as discussed above, the evidence was sufficient to show that Contreras had knowledge that the vehicle contained contraband. Although she gave conflicting statements, the jury was free to believe those portions of Contreras\u2019s statements that established her knowing agreement with Alvarez to violate the narcotics laws and her voluntary actions in accord with that agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, sufficient evidence supports her conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The district court sentenced Contreras to 285 months of imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and required her to pay a $200 special assessment. We review for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Contreras contends that her sentence is substantively unreasonable. She argues that the district court gave too much weight to her guideline range, and she asserts that a lesser sentence would have been sufficient to provide deterrence and serve as just punishment. Contreras further contends that the district court\u2019s choice of sentence was influenced by improper factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Although certain extraneous facts were discussed at sentencing, there is no indication in the record that any such matter affected the district court\u2019s choice of sentence. Contreras has not made a showing sufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to her within-guidelines sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
