The first suit was brought against several corporations affiliated with United Healthcare, the second suit was brought against three corporations affiliated with Aetna, the third suit was brought against Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida (Blue Cross), and the fourth suit was brought against three companies affiliated with Cigna. The plaintiffs asserted four claims in each complaint: failure to pay benefits under the terms of an insurance plan subject to Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3), failure to provide plan documents under ERISA \u00a7 502(c), and equitable estoppel. The district court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in each suit under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The plaintiffs, contending that they pleaded sufficient facts to state plausible claims, appeal that dismissal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">The plaintiffs here consist of two groups of medical care providers \u2014 physician providers and medical facility providers. Beginning in 2004, they began performing medical procedures known as manipulations under anesthesia (MUAs) on patients covered under health insurance plans administered by the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before performing those procedures the plaintiffs required each of their patients to sign a written agreement assigning their right to insurance benefits to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>originally paid them for the MUAs but later began denying those claims. While the complaints do not say when that change occurred, the exhibits attached to each complaint indicate that the denials began in 2006 and the plaintiffs continued to perform MUAs for which payment was denied by the defendants through 2009. The complaints allege that the defendants \u201cgenerally denied the MUA claims on the basis that they were an unproven service, experimental, investigational, not medically necessary, or for not being a covered benefit or covered service under the relevant plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to assert plausible claims rely on three broad factual allegations. The first is that the specific terms of each insurance plan in question provide for coverage of MUAs. Each complaint quotes isolated provisions from one to four group insurance plans administered by the defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to show that the plaintiffs are entitled to payment for the MUAs under all of the plans at issue. The quoted provisions state that the plans cover \u201cmedically necessary\u201d procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The plaintiffs attached exhibits to their complaints that list: (1) patient identification numbers, (2) group plan identification numbers, (3) medical conditions giving rise to MUA treatment for each patient, and (4) dates when the MUAs were performed. These exhibits show that the plaintiffs had performed MUAs to treat an array of conditions. They also show that the plaintiffs were seeking payment for procedures performed on 1,857 different patients: 347 covered by the Aetna defendants; 1,184 covered by Blue Cross; and 326 covered by the Cigna defendants. Finally, the exhibits indicate that many of those patients were covered under different group plans. The complaints, however, do not quote language from any of those other plans or contain copies of the other plans as additional exhibits. Instead the complaints rest on the allegation that \u201c[u]pon information and belief\u2019 all of those other plans contain language \u201cconsistent with\u201d the one to four plans quoted in each complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">The second broad factual allegation set out in the complaints is that MUAs qualify as \u201cmedically necessary\u201d procedures based on their inclusion in the American Medical Association\u2019s Codebook of Reimbursable Procedures. The complaints allege that the AMA recognizes that inclusion in the Codebook \u201cis generally based upon the procedure being consistent with contemporary medical practice and the fact that it is being performed by many physicians in clinical practice in multiple locations.\u201d The complaints further allege that MUAs would not have been classified in the Code-book unless (1) they were \u201ca distinctive service performed by many physicians/practitioners across the United States\u201d; (2) \u201cthe clinical efficacy of MUAs [was] well established and documented in the United States peer review literature\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe service/procedure has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">The plaintiffs\u2019 third general allegation concerns oral representations made by the defendants. Each complaint alleges that before performing MUAs on all 1,857 patients, the plaintiffs called representatives of the defendants to determine the scope of the patients\u2019 insurance coverage. The following topics were allegedly discussed in all 1,857 conversations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-13\">the existence, nature and extent of the patient\u2019s out-of-network coverage; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>patient\u2019s underlying medical condition which the patient\u2019s doctor believed necessitated the MUA; whether MUAs were covered services or benefits under the applicable insurance policy; the applicable co-payments and deductibles; pre-existing conditions; whether the patient had satisfied applicable authorization requirements for the MUA; and other issues concerning the patient\u2019s insurance coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The defendants allegedly told the plaintiffs that the MUAs were covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. <em>Ironworkers Local Union 68 v. AstraZeneca Pharm., LP, </em>634 F.3d 1352, 1359 (11th Cir.2011). We must accept the complaints\u2019 allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn assessing the sufficiency of the complaint[s\u2019] allegations, we are bound to apply the pleading standard articulated in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201callegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint[s] are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965 (citation omitted). As a result, the plaintiffs must plead \u201ca claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974. \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 663, 129 S.Ct. at 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">The plaintiffs first argue that they have pleaded sufficient facts to make out a plausible claim under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), which allows participants and beneficiaries of a welfare benefit plan governed by ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>to bring civil suits to recover benefits or enforce rights to benefits under the terms of the plan. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B); <em>Jones v. Am. Gen. Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1065, 1069 (11th Cir.2004). We conclude that each complaint fails to state a claim under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) because the plaintiffs do not plead specific facts creating a plausible inference that the MUAs were medically necessary, and thus covered benefits, for each patient in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">The primary factual support for the allegation that the MUAs were medically necessary is their inclusion in the AMA Codebook of Reimbursable Procedures. However, the Codebook does not support an inference that the MUAs were medically necessary for two reasons. First, the Codebook expressly states that \u201c[i]nclusion in the ... codebook does not represent endorsement ... of any particular diagnostic or therapeutic procedure\u201d and \u201c[i]nclusion or exclusion of a procedure does not imply any health insurance coverage or reimbursement policy.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, even if the Codebook lacked those dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>claimers, the only plausible inference that reliance on it would support is that MUAs are generally accepted procedures. However, general acceptance is not the same thing as medical necessity for a particular patient. Therefore the AMA Codebook fails to support the inference that the MUAs performed were medically necessary covered benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Unable to rely on the AMA Code-book, the plaintiffs\u2019 ultimate undoing is their failure to allege specific facts showing that each MUA was medically necessary for the 1,857 patients and wide variety of ailments treated. Without these specific facts the plaintiffs have not created a plausible inference that they were entitled to benefits. The broad allegation that the plaintiffs received preapproval from the defendants before performing the MUAs is also unhelpful. It reveals nothing about how the defendants applied the \u201cmedical necessity\u201d definition to deny each claim, and the plaintiffs instead rely on the scattershot allegation that the defendants \u201cgenerally denied the MUA claims on the basis that they were an unproven service, experimental, investigational, not medically necessary, or for not being a covered benefit or covered service under the relevant plan.\u201d The complaints also fail to allege any relevant facts to justify their assertion that the \u201cmedical necessity\u201d definition should have been applied differently to permit coverage. Without this type of particularized showing, the plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts supporting a plausible inference that they were entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The plaintiffs assert two additional claims that turn on the issue of standing. The first is a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3), based on the defendants\u2019 status as plan fiduciaries under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A). The second is a claim seeking civil penalties from the defendants for failure to provide plan documents to plan participants or beneficiaries as required by ERISA \u00a7 502(c), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">The only parties with standing to sue a plan subject to ERISA under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132 are \u201cparticipant^],\u201d \u201cbenefic-iarfies],\u201d \u201cfiduciaries],\u201d and the Secretary of Labor. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132; <em>Cagle v. Bruner, </em>112 F.3d 1510, 1514 (11th Cir.1997). Healthcare providers fall outside this group. <em>See Hobbs v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Ala., </em>276 F.3d 1236, 1241 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cHealthcare providers ... generally are not considered \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 or \u2018participants\u2019 under ERISA.\u201d). Nevertheless, healthcare providers may obtain derivative standing by securing an assignment of rights from a party with standing. <em>See Cagle, </em>112 F.3d at 1514-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Assignment agreements are generally interpreted narrowly. For that reason, the right to bring suit under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132 cannot be assigned \u201cby implication or by operation of law.\u201d <em>See Tex. Life, Acc. Health &amp; Hosp. Serv. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. Gaylord Entm\u2019t Co., </em>105 F.3d 210, 218-19 (5th Cir.1997) (holding that association did not have derivative standing to bring a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2) because there was no evidence that the right to bring a breach of fiduciary duty claim had been \u201cexpressly and knowingly assigned\u201d); see <em>also </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 324 (1981) (\u201cIt is essential to an assignment of a right that the obligee manifest an intention to transfer the right to another person without further action or manifestation of intention by the obligee.\u201d). Instead, the assignment must be \u201cexpress and knowing.\u201d <em>Tex. Life, </em>105 F.3d at 218. Accordingly, the scope of an assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>cannot exceed the terms of the assignment agreement itself. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The plaintiffs contend that they have standing to assert claims under \u00a7 502(a)(3) and \u00a7 502(c) based on the assignment agreements they entered into with each patient. The agreements provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-5\">I understand that I am responsible for all charges. As a courtesy, my insurance will be billed for me. It is my responsibility to pay any deductible, copay or any other balance not paid for by my insurance company. <em>I authorize insurance benefits to be paid directly to the provider.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-6\">By signing below, I acknowledge that I authorize payment to [Plaintiff] ... I have been presented with a copy of the Notice of Privacy Policy ... I understand the contents of the Notice. I request medical insurance benefits either to myself, or to the party who accepts assignment. Regulations pertaining to medical assignment of benefits apply,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEJ\">(emphasis added). The plaintiffs\u2019 contention stretches beyond its breaking point the plain meaning of the agreement, which assigns only the right to receive benefits and not the right to assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty or civil penalties. Because the agreements do not support the plaintiffs\u2019 position, they lack standing to bring claims under \u00a7 502(a)(3) and \u00a7 502(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is based on an equitable estoppel theory. We have recognized equitable estoppel as an additional remedial road beyond the remedy paths explicitly authorized under ERISA \u00a7 502(a). Jones, 370 F.3d at 1069. However, this alternative route is \u201cvery narrow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is only open to a plaintiff who can show that (1) \u201cthe relevant provisions of the plan at issue are ambiguous,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe plan provider or administrator has made representations to the plaintiff that constitute an informal interpretation of the ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A]mbiguity exists if the policy is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations that can fairly be made, and one of these interpretations results in coverage while the other results in exclusion.\u201d <em>Tippitt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>457 F.3d 1227, 1235 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). Equitable estoppel may not be relied upon to \u201cenlarge or extend the coverage specified in a contract.\u201d <em>Kane v. Aetna Life Ins., </em>893 F.2d 1283, 1285 n. 3 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">The plaintiffs rest their equitable estoppel argument on the allegation that the terms \u201cmedically necessary\u201d and \u201ccovered service\u201d are ambiguous under the plans. We note at the outset that this argument fails with respect to Defendant Blue Cross. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against Blue Cross points only to language in a plan issued by Carefirst, not Blue Cross, to support the plaintiffs\u2019 position that the terms of the Blue Cross plans were ambiguous. Coupling language from a non-Blue Cross plan with the conclusory allegation that similar, yet unidentified, language exists in the Blue Cross plans is insufficient to move the plaintiffs\u2019 equitable estoppel claim against Blue Cross beyond the \u201cspeculative level.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965 (citation omitted). This conclusion holds for all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on insurance plans that were not specifically quoted in the complaints. Without pointing to specific plan language that is ambiguous, the plaintiffs\u2019 equitable estoppel claims under those plans are speculative at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the Aetna and Cigna defendants, we may examine the plans specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>mentioned in the complaints to determine whether the plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to establish a plausible claim of equitable estoppel for those plans. While the plaintiffs only quoted selected portions of three Aetna plans and four Cigna plans in their complaints, our review to determine ambiguity in those plans is not limited to those isolated paragraphs. Instead, to assess for ambiguity we may review the broader portions of the plans that the defendants included in their motions to dismiss. <em>See Speaker v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>623 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010) (noting that a court \u201cmay consider an extrinsic document if it is (1) central to the plaintiffs claim, and (2) its authenticity is not challenged\u201d). It is well-established that if these plans \u201ccontradict the general and conclusory allegations of the pleading[s], the [plans] govern.\u201d <em>Griffin Indus., Inc. v. Irvin, </em>496 F.3d 1189, 1206 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Our review of the plans leads us to conclude that the terms \u201cmedically necessary\u201d and \u201ccovered service\u201d are not ambiguous. They are unambiguous because each plan contains an extensive definition of the terms. For example, a representative Aetna plan includes the following definition of \u201cmedically necessary\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">To be Medically Necessary, the service or supply must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-7\">\u2022 be care or treatment as likely to produce a significant positive outcome as, and no more likely to produce a negative outcome than, any alternative service or supply, both as to the disease or injury involved and the Member\u2019s overall health condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-8\">\u2022 be care or services related to diagnosis or treatment of an existing illness or injury, except for covered periodic health evaluations and preventive and well baby care, as determined by HMO;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-9\">\u2022 be a diagnostic procedure, indicated by the health status of the Member and be as likely to result in information that could affect the course of treatment as, and no more likely to produce a negative outcome than, any alternative service or supply, both as to the disease or injury involved and the Member\u2019s overall health condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-10\">\u2022 include only those services and supplies that cannot be safely and satisfactorily provided at home, in a Physician\u2019s office, on an outpatient basis, or in any facility other than a Hospital, when used in relation to inpatient Hospital Services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-11\">\u2022 as to diagnosis, care and treatment be no more costly (taking into account all health expenses incurred in connection with the service or supply) than any equally effective service or supply in meeting the above tests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">The plan further provides who will make the \u201cmedical necessity\u201d determination and what information that person will consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-13\">In determining if a service or supply is Medically Necessary, HMO\u2019s Patient Management Medical Director or its Physician designee will consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-17\">\u2022 information provided on the Member\u2019s health status;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-18\">\u2022 reports in peer reviewed medical literature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-19\">\u2022 reports and guidelines published by nationally recognized health care organizations that include supporting scientific data;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-20\">\u2022 professional standards of safety and effectiveness which are generally recognized in the United States for diagnosis, care or treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-21\">\u2022 the opinion of Health Professionals in the generally recognized health specialty involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>\u2022 the opinion of the attending Physicians, which have credence but do not overrule contrary opinions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-4\">\u2022 any other relevant information brought to the HMO\u2019s attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The Cigna plans contain a similarly extensive definition of the term \u201cmedically necessary covered services.\u201d For example, one Cigna plan outlines the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-6\">Medically Necessary Covered Services and Supplies are those determined by the Medical Director to be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-9\">\u2022 required to diagnose or treat an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-10\">\u2022 in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-11\">\u2022 clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and duration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-12\">\u2022 not primarily for the convenience of the patient, Physician or other health care provider; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-13\">\u2022 rendered in the least intensive setting that is appropriate for the delivery of the services and supplies. Where applicable, the Medical Director may compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative services, settings or supplies when determining least intensive setting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">Given these extensive definitions, the terms are not ambiguous. <em>See Katz v. Comprehensive Plan of Grp. Ins., </em>197 F.3d 1084, 1086 n. 8, 1090 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that the term \u201cactive service\u201d was unambiguous when insurance plan defined the term); <em>cf. Dahl-Eimers v. Mut. of Omaha Life Ins. Co., </em>986 F.2d 1379, 1382 (11th Cir.1993) (holding that the phrase \u201cconsidered experimental\u201d was ambiguous where the plan did not \u201cindicate who will determine whether a proposed treatment is considered experimental\u201d and did not contain \u201cstandards for how that determination will be made\u201d). Because the terms of the plans were unambiguous, the plaintiffs\u2019 equitable estoppel claims necessarily fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-17\">For the reasons discussed above, the plaintiffs did not state a plausible claim for relief and the district court properly dismissed their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-11\">. The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the dismissal of their complaint against the United Healthcare defendants was dismissed by this court for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Sanctuary Surgical Ctr., Inc. v.
