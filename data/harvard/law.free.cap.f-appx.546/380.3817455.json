He contends that his guidelines offense level was wrongly increased by 16 levels for a Texas burglary conviction, which he argues is not a crime of violence. In <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410 (5th Cir.2013), we rejected the same contention made by Pena-Rojas, namely that the Texas burglary crime is broader than the listed generic offense of burglary of a dwelling because Texas defines the \u201cowner\u201d of a dwelling as one having a greater right to possession than the criminal actor. <em>See Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d at 411-12. As Pena-Rojas concedes in his reply brief, his claim is foreclosed by <em>Morales-Mota. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
