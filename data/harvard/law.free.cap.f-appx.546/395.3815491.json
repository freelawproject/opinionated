Vickers argues that, as in <em>United States v. Carrillo, </em>421 Fed.Appx. 395 (5th Cir.2011), he is actually innocent of the armed career criminal enhancement because newly discovered evidence shows that his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation was not a crime of violence. He argues that, in light of <em>Haley v. Cockrell, </em>306 F.3d 257, 267-68 (5th Cir.2002), <em>vacated sub nom. Dretke v. Haley, </em>541 U.S. 386, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed.2d 659 (2004), his case should be an exception to the <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001), standard to correct a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In order to satisfy the criteria of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, Vickers must show that his claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that the claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time when they should have been raised at trial, on appeal, or in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Vickers has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Vicker\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">To the extent that Vickers seeks authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion raising the above claim, the motion is DENIED. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244, 2255(h).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
