He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of the cocaine, which was found during an inventory search of a car that he was driving after the car was impounded following a traffic stop. His motion to suppress did not challenge the search, but rather the impoundment. Specifically, he argued that the Florida Highway Patrol policy on impoundment does not sufficiently limit a law enforcement officer\u2019s discretion in determining whether to impound a vehicle, and thus lacks the explicit and comprehensive procedures that satisfy the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that vehicle impoundments and inventory searches be performed according to standard criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress under a mixed standard, reviewing the findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to the facts <em>de novo. See United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2007). In reviewing the district court\u2019s ruling, we must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">The community caretaking function is an exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement that permits police to inventory cars taken into custody. <em>See South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 369-72, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976); <em>Colorado v. Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 371, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987). In order to utilize the inventory search exception to the warrant requirement, the government has the burden to show first that the police possessed the authority to impound the vehicle, and then that the officers followed departmental policy in conducting the search. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>936 F.2d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">\u201cNothing ... prohibits the exercise of police discretion [in deciding to impound a vehicle] so long as that discretion is exercised according to standard criteria and on the basis of something other than suspicion of evidence of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Bertine, </em>479 U.S. at 375, 107 S.Ct. 738. <em>See also United States v. Roberson, </em>897 F.2d 1092, 1094, 1096-97 (11th Cir.1990) (concluding that the impoundment and inventory of a vehicle in accordance with standard police procedures was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-14\">For a number of reasons, the district court did not err by denying Mr. Burd\u2019s motion to suppress the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">First, the FHP policy contained sufficient standardized criteria under <em>Colorado v. Bertine. </em>Although the FHP policy does not cover every conceivable situation that might confront an impounding officer, and thus requires some use of officer discretion, it provides seven situations in which vehicles \u201cshall\u201d be towed and impounded, and also delineates the purposes guiding the officer\u2019s decision. The reasonableness of the FHP\u2019s impoundment policy or practice \u201cdoes not necessarily or invariably turn on the existence of alternative less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>intrusive means.\u201d <em>Bertine, </em>479 U.S. at 374, 107 S.Ct. 738 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Second, the officer\u2019s decision to impound the car driven by Mr. Burd fulfills three of the FHP identified principles, namely: to protect the public or property of the public, to protect the owner\u2019s vehicle and property, and to protect FHP from liability claims. The district court\u2019s factual determination that leaving the car on the interstate highway would have created a hazard to the public is not clearly erroneous, and by the terms of the FHP policy this concern justified impoundment. <em>See Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 368-69, 96 S.Ct. 3092. Turning the car over to Mr. Burd\u2019s passenger would not have protected the owner\u2019s property or protected the FHP from liability because neither Mr. Burd nor his passenger owned the vehicle or could identify the owner of the car. Contrary to Mr. Burd\u2019s assertions, evidence presented at the suppression hearing does not establish that his passenger actually knew the car\u2019s owner or had the owner\u2019s permission to drive the car. Furthermore, the vehicle\u2019s license plate and registration did not match. Under these facts, the district court properly concluded that the officer followed FHP policy by impounding the car to protect the public and the owner\u2019s interest in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
