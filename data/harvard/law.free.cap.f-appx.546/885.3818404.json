Harris, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for relief from a void judgment, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4), and subsequent denial of his motion for reconsideration, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). Because his present appeal is his fourth from a district court\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) determination, we briefly recount the procedural history of Harris\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">In 2003, a jury found for Harris on his Title VII retaliation claim against his former employer, Corrections Corporation of America (\u201cCCA\u201d), and awarded him $750,000. However, the district court granted CCA\u2019s post-trial renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law (\u201cJMOL\u201d). On appeal, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s JMOL and concluded that the record did not contain sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Harris had an objectively reasonable belief that he was being discriminated against, or that Harris established a prima facie case of retaliation. <em>Harris v. Corr. Corp. of Am. (Harris I), </em>139 Fed.Appx. 156, 159-60 (11th Cir.2005). We also noted that there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to conclude that CCA\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Harris was in fact pretext for retaliation. <em>Id. </em>at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Since our decision affirming the district court\u2019s grant of JMOL in favor of CCA, Harris has filed multiple Rule 60(b)(4) and Rule 59(e) motions before the district court. He has also brought before this Court multiple appeals from the district court\u2019s denials of those motions. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. Corr. Corp. of Am. (Harris II), </em>332 Fed.Appx. 593 (11th Cir.2009); <em>Harris </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number><em>v. Corr. Corp. of Am. (Harris </em>III), 433 Fed.Appx. 824 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">I. Rule 60(b)(4) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">In 2012, the district court denied Harris\u2019s instant Rule 60(b)(4) motion and subsequently denied his motion for reconsideration. In his present appeal, Harris argues that because CCA made no objections to the consistency of the jury\u2019s verdict or the jury instructions at the time of trial, CCA was precluded from filing any post-trial motions. As a result, Harris argues, the district court had no subject matter jurisdiction to review CCA\u2019s renewed JMOL motion, and thus JMOL in favor of CCA is void. Additionally, Harris argues that the judgment is void because the district court violated his due process rights. We reject both claims as frivolous and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">We review the denial of a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) <em>de novo. Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). A district court may relieve a party from a final judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) if \u201cthe judgment is void.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). \u201cGenerally, a judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4) if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>252 F.3d at 1263 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">We reject Harris\u2019s first argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over CCA\u2019s post-trial motion for JMOL. Harris argues that because CCA failed to object to any inconsistency in the jury verdict or to the jury instructions at the time of trial, CCA was prohibited from filing any post-trial motions. This argument is meritless, where CCA was not challenging the inconsistency of the jury\u2019s verdict or error in the jury instructions, but rather was challenging the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial in its JMOL motion, and where CCA had properly preserved such post-trial motion by moving for JMOL at the close of all evidence. Harris has demonstrated no error on the part of the district court to exercise jurisdiction over that timely filed motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We also reject Harris\u2019s other argument that the judgment is void because the district court violated his due process rights by (1) failing to allow him time to respond to CCA\u2019s request to exceed the page limit in his motion for JMOL and (2) failing to notify Harris that the court would utilize the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework in evaluating CCA\u2019s JMOL motion. Harris has not demonstrated how any error would rise to the level of a due process violation. Furthermore, we note that it is clear that the district court did not err in denying Harris\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">II. Rule 59(e) Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Harris also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. We review the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Mays v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>122 F.3d 43, 46 (11th Cir.1997). A Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration cannot be brought solely to relitigate issues already raised in an earlier motion. <em>See Michael Linet, Inc. v. Vill. of Wellington, </em>408 F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe only grounds for granting [a Rule 59] motion are newly-discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact.\u201d <em>Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Kellogg v. Schreiber (In re </em>Kellogg), 197 F.3d 1116, 1119 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">To the extent that Harris\u2019s motion for reconsideration merely reiterated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>previous arguments as to subject matter jurisdiction and due process violations, the district court properly denied his Rule 59(e) motion. <em>See Michael Linet, </em>408 F.3d at 768. Furthermore, the new arguments that Harris raises in his motion for reconsideration \u2014 namely, that the district court should have granted his instant Rule 60(b)(4) motion because CCA never objected to it, and that the district court improperly determined that his Rule 60(b)(4) motion was untimely \u2014 do not present any newly-discovered evidence or show a manifest error of law or fact. <em>See Arthur, </em>500 F.3d at 1343. Harris does not explain how the district court\u2019s conclusion that CCA was not required to respond to a Rule 60(b)(4) motion filed seven years after the case was closed, and its denial of Harris\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion even absent any opposition, is a manifest error of law such that the original JMOL order is void. <em>See id. </em>As for Harris\u2019s argument that the district court based its denial of Harris\u2019s motion on an improper conclusion that it was brought too late, this is not supported by the record. Although the district court noted that seven years had passed since the trial, its reasoning did not depend on this observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Harris\u2019s motions under Rules 60(b)(4) and 59(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
