He challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the district court\u2019s denial of his motions to suppress the evidence found at his residence, and the district court\u2019s determination that he is a career offender for purposes of United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea but may be allowed to do so on a showing of \u201ca fair and just reason.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 370 (5th Cir.2003). We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to permit withdrawal of a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>In this ease, our examination of the record shows that none of the factors set forth in <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984), weigh in Eikelboom\u2019s favor and that most of the factors weigh against the withdrawal of his guilty plea. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings on a motion to suppress for clear error and the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusions as to whether the Fourth Amendment was violated de novo. <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 440 (5th Cir.2010). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party unless that view is inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s findings or is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence as a whole. <em>Id. </em>The clearly erroneous standard is even more deferential when, as in this case, the denial of the suppression motion is based upon live oral testimony. <em>Id. </em>We should affirm a district court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion \u201cif there is any reasonable view of the evidence to support it.\u201d <em>United States v. Michelletti, </em>13 F.3d 838, 841 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Register, </em>931 F.2d 308, 312 (5th Cir.1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">A warrantless intrusion into an individual\u2019s home is permissible if \u201cprobable cause and exigent circumstances justify the search.\u201d <em>United States v. Troop, </em>514 F.3d 405, 409 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Gomez-Moreno, </em>479 F.3d 350, 354 (5th Cir.2007)). Eikelboom argues that no exigent circumstances existed to justify the warrantless search of his residence. However, based upon the testimonial evidence presented at the suppression hearing, exigent circumstances existed be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>cause there was a danger that accomplices could have been inside Eikelboom\u2019s residence, which posed a risk of harm to the officers as well as a risk of destruction of evidence. A reasonable view of the evidence supports the district court\u2019s denial of Eikelboom\u2019s motion to suppress challenging the warrantless search of his residence. <em>See Michelletti, </em>13 F.3d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Eikelboom also argues that the search warrant for his residence violated his Fourth Amendment rights because the search warrant affidavit lacked any indicia of probable cause and the magistrate judge lacked a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. The ultimate determination of the affidavit\u2019s adequacy is entitled to great deference on review. <em>United States v. May, </em>819 F.2d 531, 535 (5th Cir.1987). In light of that great deference coupled with the similarity of this affidavit to affidavits found sufficient in other cases, we uphold the district court\u2019s finding that the good faith exception is applicable in this case. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>27 F.3d 1009, 1013-14 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>953 F.2d 898, 904-05 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Finally, Eikelboom contends that the district court erred by sentencing him as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. Although he concedes that he has one pri- or Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation that qualifies as a crime of violence (COV), he asserts that his two other Texas convictions for burglary of a habitation do not qualify as COVs as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). We review de novo whether a prior conviction constitutes a COV. <em>United States v. Stoker, </em>706 F.3d 643, 646 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We employ a categorical approach to determine whether a particular offense constitutes a crime of violence by deriving the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of the undefined, enumerated offense and looking at the elements of the statute of conviction rather than at the defendant\u2019s specific conduct. <em>United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Moore, </em>635 F.3d 774, 776 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam). Eik-elboom\u2019s two prior Texas convictions at issue in this case were for burglary of a habitation under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02 (West 1993). We have previously held that a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes a COV. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 162 (5th Cir.1992) (holding that \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)); <em>see also James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 206, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (noting that the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for a career offender enhancement \u201cclosely tracks\u201d the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d set forth at \u00a7 924(e)). However, a conviction under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) does not constitute a COV because that statutory subsection does not require entry with an intent to commit a felony, theft, or assault. <em>United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 587 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (discussing \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) in the \u00a7 924(e) context). Because this statute has disjunctive subsections, we may look to the allegations in the charging instrument, but only to ascertain under which statutory subsection the defendant was convicted. <em>United States v. Miranda-Ortegon, </em>670 F.3d 661, 663 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The first paragraphs of both state indictments track the language of the version of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) in effect at that time, and the second paragraphs track the language of the version of \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) in effect at that time. The judgments do not specify the underlying subsection to which Eikelboom pleaded guilty. Under Texas law, a guilty plea is an admission of only those facts needed to support the convie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tion. <em>United States v. Morales-Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 356, 359-60 (5th Cir.2007). The Government argues that we should follow <em>United States v. Morales-Ordaz, </em>427 Fed.Appx. 319 (5th Cir.2011), to conclude that Eikelboom\u2019s conviction of a first-degree felony under \u00a7 30.02(d) proves that he was convicted under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1). However, unlike the version of \u00a7 30.02(d) relied upon in <em>Morales-Ordaz, </em>the version of \u00a7 30.02(d) applicable to Eikelboom\u2019s offenses did not contain any language specifying that a first-degree felony required intent at the time of entry. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30.02(d) (West 1993). Because Eikelboom could have pleaded guilty to facts supporting a conviction under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3), the district court erred in using either of Eikelboom\u2019s prior burglary convictions as a predicate offense for the career offender enhancement provided at \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Constante, </em>544 F.3d at 587; <em>United States v. Beltran-Ramirez, </em>266 Fed.Appx. 371, 372 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">As argued by Eikelboom, if the district court had not determined that he was a career offender under \u00a7 4B 1.1(b), his criminal history category would have been V and his total offense level would have been 31, thereby resulting in an advisory guidelines range of 168 to 210 months of imprisonment. Although the district court imposed a sentence of 200 months of imprisonment, Eikelboom argues that the district court could have imposed a lower sentence if it had started with the correct guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">A procedural sentencing error is harmless if the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>597 F.3d 242, 261 (5th Cir.2010). Although the Government bears the burden of showing that the district court\u2019s misapplication of the Guidelines was harmless, it argues only that the error was harmless because the district court imposed a downward variance. The record is unclear as to whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence if it had begun with the correct guidelines range. Because we cannot conclude that the guidelines error was harmless, we must vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Roussel, </em>705 F.3d 184, 202-03 (5th Cir.2013). We affirm Eikelboom\u2019s conviction and the district court\u2019s denials of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and his motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
