He additionally moves for a preliminary injunction and/or a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) and to dispense with the security requirement of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">In February 2011, Brown filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 1983 action against Warden Burl Cain, Assistant Warden Donald Barr, Dr. Jonathon Roundtree, and Mary Labatut, a pharmacist.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claimed that, starting in 2003, the defendants failed to provide him with his daily aspirin prescription on a regular basis; he received no aspirin from December 2008 to June 2009; and his prescription was filled incorrectly in March 2010. In addition, Brown maintained that, as a result, his condition deteriorated, resulting in a fall in June 2010, he fractured his hip, and the treatment of his hip was delayed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">In granting summary judgment and dismissing Brown\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action, the district court found that all of Brown\u2019s claims arising before February 23, 2010, were barred by limitations. The court found that Brown was not entitled to relief as to his allegations against Labatut because the undisputed evidence showed she was on leave. As to the allegations that Cain, Barr, and Roundtree were liable for the actions of their subordinates, the court found them insufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">In dismissing the claim that Roundtree acted with deliberate indifference to Brown\u2019s hip fracture, the court found that the undisputed evidence showed Brown had received prompt evaluation, treatment, and medication. Finally, as to the official-capacity claims against Cain and Barr, the court found that Brown had not sought prospective injunctive relief, so his claims were not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-17\">On appeal from a summary judgment, this court conducts a <em>de novo </em>review, employing the same standard used by the district court. <em>McFaul v. Valenzuela, </em>684 F.3d 564, 571 (5th Cir.2012). A court \u201cshall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-19\">For actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983, federal courts borrow the forum state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>personal-injury limitations period. <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir.1999). In Louisiana that period is one year. <em>Id. </em>at 158; La. Civ.Code ANN. art. 3492. Brown argues that some of his claims arose during the year before he filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint and thus are not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Brown\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action, initiated in February 2011, raised claims arising from acts starting in 2003 and, also, claims arising between December 1, 2008, and June 2009, in March 2010, and in June 2010. Brown is correct that his claim that the defendants provided him with the wrong quantity and dosage of aspirin in March 2010 and his claim that the defendants delayed treatment for his fractured hip in June 2010 are not time-barred because they arose during the year before he filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint. The district court\u2019s opinion is consistent with this particular argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">As for Brown\u2019s remaining \u00a7 1983 claims that, starting in 2003, the defendants failed to provide him with aspirin regularly and then provided no aspirin from December 2008 to June 2009, Brown concedes that any claims arising before April 13, 2009, are prescribed. Absent an exception to the one-year limitations period, the claims arising between April 14, 2009, and the end of June 2009 are time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Although, as Brown says, the filing of a prison grievance may toll limitations while the grievance is pending, Brown filed his \u00a7 1983 action too long after his grievance proceeding ended to benefit from any tolling. <em>See Harris, </em>198 F.3d at 158-59. With the benefit of liberal construction, Brown also argues that the defendants\u2019 behavior constituted a continuing tort. Brown\u2019s claims, however, do not constitute continuing torts because he did not allege continuous wrongful conduct \u201con an almost daily basis.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, claims arising between April 14, 2009, and the end of June 2009 are time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">Brown does not dispute the findings regarding when Labatut was working at the prison. Instead, he contends in a conclu-sional fashion that Labatut should remain a defendant because she was responsible for \u201censuring pharmaceutical services\u201d both before and after her leave. Because, however, the court properly found that the claims arising before February 23, 2010, were time-barred and because Brown\u2019s remaining claims arose when the undisputed evidence showed Labatut was not working, the court properly granted summary judgment as to the claims against Labatut.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">Brown additionally argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against Labatut because Brown sought prospective injunctive relief against Laba-tut. But in his original and amended complaints, Brown did not seek prospective injunctive relief against Labatut.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">Although the district court found Brown\u2019s claims against Cain, Barr, and Dr. Roundtree barred by the doctrine of <em>re-spondeat superior, </em>Brown argues that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u00a7 1988 complaint included allegations against these defendants for their own failure to provide a constitutionally adequate medication-delivery system in the prison and for their refusal to correct known deficiencies in the system. In Brown\u2019s original and amended \u00a7 1983 complaints, he indicated that he sought to hold Cain, Barr, and Roundtree responsible for both the actions of others and their own actions. To the extent Brown sought to hold Cain, Barr, and Roundtree liable for the actions of their subordinates, the district court is correct that such claims are insufficient to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1988. <em>See Sanders-Burns v. City of Plano, </em>594 F.3d 366, 380 (5th Cir.2010). To the extent Brown sought to hold Cain, Barr, and Roundtree liable for their own actions concerning the allegedly inadequate medication-delivery system, the district court provided no analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">A supervisor may be hable for involvement in a constitutional deprivation. <em>Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 304 (5th Cir.1987). Supervisory liability may exist under \u00a7 1983 \u201cwithout overt personal participation in the offensive act if supervisory officials implement a policy so deficient that the policy itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights and is the moving force of the constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A policy may be a \u201cstatement, ordinance, regulation, or decision that is officially adopted\u201d by an official who has policymaking authority or a \u201cpersistent, widespread practice\u201d that is not formally authorized but \u201cis so common and well settled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents ... policy.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Moore, </em>958 F.2d 92, 94 (5th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Knowledge of a custom must be attributable to a policymaker. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The evidence in the record, including the affidavits of Cain, Barr, and Roundtree, the answers to interrogatories, a prison job description, prison policies discussing policymaking and the training of staff, and the affidavits of Brown and other inmates, establishes genuine disputes as to material facts concerning whether a policy or widespread practice in the prison medication-delivery system resulted in the violation of Brown\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Thompkins, </em>828 F.2d at 304; <em>Johnson, </em>958 F.2d at 94. Accordingly, summary judgment on such claims was improper. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Brown argues that, contrary to the district court\u2019s findings, Roundtree delayed treatment of his hip fracture in violation of the Constitution. A delay in treatment does not violate the Eighth Amendment unless the denial or delay was the result of the defendant\u2019s deliberate indifference and harm was suffered during the delay. <em>Easter v. Powell, </em>467 F.3d 459, 464-65 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The evidence in the record, including the prison medical records, Roundtree\u2019s affidavit and answers to interrogatories, and Brown\u2019s declarations, establishes genuine disputes as to material facts concerning whether there was a delay. <em>See Easter, </em>467 F.3d at 464-65; <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, summary judgment dismissal of Brown\u2019s deliberate-indifference claim against Roundtree was improper. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Brown argues that the district court erroneously dismissed his official-capacity claims against Cain and Barr because, contrary to the court\u2019s findings, he sought prospective injunctive relief against Cain and Barr by seeking the removal of unqualified, inadequately trained security employees from the medication-distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>tion system and the use of adequately qualified and medically trained personnel. Although Brown did not seek prospective injunctive relief against Cain and Barr in his original \u00a7 1983 complaint, he sought it in his amended complaint in addition to seeking various other amendments, including clarifying the capacities in which Cain and Barr were being sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In granting Brown\u2019s motion to amend, in part, the magistrate judge (\u201cMJ\u201d) specified that Brown could amend to clarify the capacities in which Cain and Barr were being sued. Later, in a report and recommendation to the district court, the MJ interpreted that order, stating that, but for permitting Brown to clarify these capacities and issuing other unrelated rulings, he had denied the motion in all other respects; consequently, the MJ concluded that Brown had not sought prospective injunctive relief against Cain and Barr. The district court\u2019s later adoption of the MJ\u2019s interpretation of the order was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Francois v. City of New Roads, </em>459 Fed.Appx. 475, 478 (5th Cir.2012). Accordingly, the court properly dismissed Brown\u2019s official-capacity complaints against Cain and Barr.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Brown argues generally that the MJ\u2019s report and recommendation omitted some of his claims, cited partial standards of law, took arguments out of context, omitted record facts and evidence, and selectively used the evidence to cast an unfavorable light on his claims. He has identified no such errors with specificity, so he has abandoned those claims on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">Brown claims the district court failed to rule on his objections to the sufficiency of certain answers and discovery responses and that he needed the evidence to show deliberate indifference to his medical needs. Discovery is not a prerequisite to the disposition of a motion for summary judgment. <em>Washington v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>901 F.2d 1281, 1285 (5th Cir.1990). A party who contends that additional discovery is required before summary judgment may file a motion for a continuance under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) (formerly Rule 56(f)) together with an affidavit showing, for specified reasons, that he cannot present essential facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The party may not rely on \u201cvague assertions that additional discovery will produce needed, but unspecified facts\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but instead must \u201cset forth a plausible basis for believing that specified facts, susceptible of collection within a reasonable time, probably exist and indicate how the emergent facts, if adduced, will influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">A decision whether to delay summary judgment for further discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Raby, </em>600 F.3d at 561. Because Brown failed to file a Rule 56(d) motion and because his motion for an extension of time to complete discovery did not specify what facts, susceptible of collection, would influence the outcome of his case, the court did not abuse its discretion by granting summary judgment without further discovery. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the summary-judgment dismissal of Brown\u2019s claims arising before February 2010; the claims against Labatut; the <em>re-spondeat superior </em>claims against Cain, Barr, and Roundtree; and the official-capacity claims against Cain and Barr. We VACATE and REMAND as to the dismissal of Brown\u2019s claims against Cain, Barr, and Roundtree regarding the prison-medication-delivery system and his claims against Roundtree regarding the hip-fracture treatment. We DENY Brown\u2019s motions for a preliminary injunction and/or a TRO and his motion to dispense with the requirement of security because he did not move for injunctive relief in the district court and has not shown that application for such relief would be impracticable. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 8(a)(1)(C), (2)(A). We state no view on the ultimate merit of any claim or on what decisions or rulings the district court should make on remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
