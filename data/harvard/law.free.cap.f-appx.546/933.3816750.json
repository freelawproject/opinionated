The district court denied both motions. Although we affirm the denial of Gregory\u2019s motion for the return of his firearm, we vacate the denial of Gregory\u2019s motion to dismiss his indictment and remand for the district court to dismiss the motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Gregory also moves for sanctions against counsel for the government and for reassignment of his case to a different judge on remand, but we deny both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">In 2006, Gregory entered an agreement to plead guilty to possessing with intent to distribute methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of drug trafficking, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). In his written plea agreement, Gregory \u201cagreed[ ] to forfeit all of his rights, title and interest in ... [his] Beretta 9-millmeter handgun, serial number SZ005675\u201d; \u201cvoluntarily abandoned] all right, title and interest in and right and claims to the ... firearm\u201d; and \u201cvoluntarily withdr[e]w[ ] the claim of ownership he made to the property.\u201d The district court accepted Gregory\u2019s pleas of guilty and ordered that he forfeit his interest in the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">In 2007, Gregory moved to vacate his sentence. Gregory argued that his conviction for possessing a firearm was invalid because there was no evidence to prove that he used a firearm in relation to his drug trafficking. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied the motion. Gregory appealed, but he later dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">Gregory then moved for an order that the government produce inventory records of his firearm, which had been seized from him in 2005 when deputies of the Sheriffs Office of Whitfield County and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed a warrant to search Gregory\u2019s residence. <em>See </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7 128-50.101. Gregory alleged that the firearm was in the possession of the government, although it had, in 2008, obtained an order allowing it to destroy the firearm, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). The district court construed Gregory\u2019s motion as seeking the return of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>his firearm. <em>See </em>FecLR.Crim.P. 41(g). The government responded that it did not have to comply with section 128-50.101 because it did not seize Gregory\u2019s firearm; nevertheless, the government attached to its response copies of the inventory lists provided by the Sheriffs Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Gregory next moved to strike the response of the government and to dismiss his indictment \u201cdue to no subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Gregory sought relief on two grounds: (1) the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the order allowing the destruction of the firearm because the government had commenced its action for forfeiture of his firearm more than 120 days after its seizure in 2005, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d)(1); and (2) \u201cthe government had no jurisdiction over the alleged grand jury indictment\u201d and \u201cjurisdiction [had been] lacking personal and subject matter throughout the entire criminal action\u201d because the firearm \u201c[n]ever had been in the federal governments domain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The district court denied Gregory\u2019s motions. The district court ruled that the government was not obliged to provide Gregory an inventory list, and, in any event, Gregory, \u201cas a convicted felon, [did] not have possessory interest in the handgun pursuant to the terms of his plea agreement\u201d and the district court had already \u201cissued an order authorizing the destruction of the firearm in question.\u201d The district court also ruled that Gregory failed to provide \u201ca valid reason to strike the government\u2019s response\u201d or to cite \u201cany valid factual or legal grounds for dismissing [his] indictment.\u201d With respect to Gregory\u2019s argument that the order allowing the destruction of the firearm was illegal, the district court ruled that Gregory was \u201cignor[ing] the fact that [he] voluntarily entered into a plea agreement, wherein he agreed to forfeit the firearm that was seized.\u201d The district court found \u201cunavailing\u201d Gregory\u2019s jurisdictional arguments and instructed Gregory to raise \u201cchallenge^] [to] his indictment or any other issue related to his conviction or plea agreement ... via an appeal to the Eleventh Circuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Our review is governed by two standards of review. We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cquestions of law dealing with a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for return of seized property,\u201d and we review related findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Howell, </em>425 F.3d 971, 973 (11th Cir.2005). We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking\u201d and review that issue <em>de novo. Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">The district court correctly denied Gregory relief to the extent that he sought the return of his firearm. \u201c[F]or an owner of property to invoke Rule 41(g), he must show that he had a possessory interest in the property seized by the government.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 974. As Gregory admitted in his motion to dismiss, he forfeited voluntarily his ownership rights in the firearm as a term of his plea agreement. Gregory argues that the district court should have granted his motion for inventory records, but that motion was rendered moot when the government gave Gregory a copy of the inventory list produced by the Sheriffs Office. <em>See United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">The district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider Gregory\u2019s motion to dismiss his indictment. Gregory\u2019s motion to dismiss was the functional equivalent of a motion to vacate. Because Gregory did not obtain leave from this Court to file a successive motion, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h), Gregory\u2019s motion to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>miss was subject to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Gregory moves for sanctions against counsel for the government and for reassignment of his case to a different judge on remand, but his motions lack merit. Gregory requests that we impose sanctions against opposing counsel for obtaining an extension of time to file their brief, but sanctions are warranted only when conduct \u201cmultiplies the proceedings ... unreasonably and vexatiously,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. Gregory also requests that we reassign his case, but Gregory\u2019s disagreement with adverse rulings does not give us reason to doubt the impartiality of the district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Gregory\u2019s motion for return of his firearm, but we VACATE the denial of his motion to dismiss and REMAND for the district court to dismiss that motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We DENY Gregory\u2019s motions for sanctions and reassignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
