He also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his subsequent \u201cobjection\u201d to the denial of a sentence reduction and his motion for leave to supplement his pending motion for reconsideration pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Under the Guidelines, as amended by the FSA, Edmond\u2019s base offense level remains unchanged because he was held accountable for 31.8 grams of cocaine base, and, after the amendment, a base offense level of 26 applies to \u201cat least 28 G but less than 112 G of Cocaine Base.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). Edmond thus was ineligible for a sentence reduction because the amendment did not reduce his guidelines range. See \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Moreover, to the extent Edmond challenges the district court\u2019s failure to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and exercise its discretion to resentence him, the district court otherwise lacked discretion to resentence him. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">Further, Edmond has not shown that he was entitled to a sentence reduction through either his \u201cobjection\u201d or his motion for leave to supplement his motion for reconsideration. District courts have limited authority to correct a sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(b). However, none of the requirements for relief, as set forth in \u00a7 3582(b), were satisfied here. The Bureau of Prisons did not move to reduce Edmond\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). Nor did Edmond file a motion to modify his sentence within 14 days of being sentenced. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B); Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). The Government did not move for a sentence reduction for substantial assistance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B); Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). Finally, as discussed above, the amendments did not reduce Edmond\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment, and thus he was ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Consequently, because neither Edmond\u2019s \u201cobjection\u201d nor his motion for leave to supplement could be construed in such a way that relief was possible, he has appealed from the denial of \u201cmeaningless, unauthorized motion[s].\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>States v.
