Because he had three prior violent felony convictions, he was subject to the sentence enhancement provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), which mandates a minimum 15-year prison term. Garcia was sentenced to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment for the felon-in-possession conviction and to a concurrent 120-month term for the stolen firearm conviction. His conviction and total sentence were affirmed by this court on appeal. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>Appeal No. 99-2185 (11th Cir. Jan. 4, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">Garcia subsequently sought relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, arguing that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the ACCA sentence enhancement amounted to ineffective assistance. The district court denied Garcia\u2019s motion. Garcia appealed, but we affirmed the district court. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>107 Fed.Appx. 184 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">Garcia then filed a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. He did not obtain leave to file this motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His \u00a7 2241 petition asserted that the sentencing court erroneously relied on police reports to establish his ACCA-predicate convictions, in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). The district court, however, dismissed his petition for lack of jurisdiction, finding that Garcia failed to make the requisite showing to invoke the Savings Clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The Savings Clause permits a prisoner to file a habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2241 where the remedy available under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">Garcia now appeals the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition. Garcia argues, despite having been previously denied relief in an earlier \u00a7 2255 proceeding, that he was eligible for post-conviction relief under the Savings Clause. In support, he again as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>serts that his claim is based on <em>Shepard,, </em>which Garcia believes to be a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. He also argues that our subsequent decision in <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326 (11th Cir.2010), and the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) and <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), all support granting his \u00a7 2241 petition. Further, he asserts that <em>Shepard </em>and <em>Sneed </em>establish that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense \u2014 namely, the ACCA enhancement. Accordingly, he contends that he is entitled to relief under <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999), and that he is entitled to resentenc-ing without the ACCA enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 normally presents a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006). In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its rulings of law de novo. <em>Coloma v. Holder, </em>445 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). \u201cPro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">In order to decide whether Garcia may proceed, we articulated a three-prong test in <em>Wofford </em>to determine whether \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to examine the legality of a prisoner\u2019s detention under the \u00a7 2255(e) Savings Clause. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. Under that test, Garcia must show that: (1) his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that \u201ccircuit law-busting\u201d Supreme Court decision establishes that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised during his trial, direct appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">New constitutional rules of criminal procedure are not retroactively applicable on collateral review unless they fall within one of two exceptions. <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1075, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). First, such rules apply retroactively if they hold that certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct may not be proscribed. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 109 S.Ct. at 1073. Second, they will apply retroactively if they require the observance of procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty \u2014 so-called \u201cwatershed rules of criminal procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307, 310-11, 109 S.Ct. at 1073, 1075-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Here, Garcia has not demonstrated that the Savings Clause of \u00a7 2255(e) applies. First, in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>this court was asked whether \u201cthe savings clause ... permits a federal prisoner to challenge his sentence in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition when he cannot raise that challenge in a \u00a7 2255 motion because of the \u00a7 2255(h) bar against second and successive motions.\u201d 640 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012). We found that it did not, \u201cat least where the sentence the prisoner is attacking does not exceed the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, because Garcia\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum \u2014 life in prison \u2014 the district court did not err in dismissing Garcia\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">In addition, his claim fails to meet the first prong of <em>Wofford </em>as it was not based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. <em>Sneed </em>was not decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, <em>see id, </em>and <em>Shepard </em>has not been made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, <em>see Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1268. Further, neither exception for retroactivity under <em>Teague </em>applies. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Shepard </em>does not provide that certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct may not be proscribed. <em>See Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 307, 109 S.Ct. at 1073. Further, <em>Shepard </em>does not appear to announce a \u201cwatershed\u201d rule of criminal procedure, as neither we nor the Supreme Court has held that the rule applies retroactively. <em>See id. </em>at 307, 310-11, 109 S.Ct. at 1073, 1075-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-11\">. Garcia also moves this court to permit him to file his reply brief out of time. The government has not responded to this motion. Because it appears that Garcia attempted to timely file his brief in good faith and because it appears that no prejudice would accrue to the government if the motion were granted, Garcia\u2019s motion to file his reply brief out of time is GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-16\">. Garcia may proceed before this Court despite the lack of a certificate of appealability (COA), because federal prisoners must obtain a COA only when proceeding under \u00a7 2255. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1); <em>see also Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003). \"By negative implication, a federal prisoner who proceeds under \u00a7 2241 does not need a COA to [appeal].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
