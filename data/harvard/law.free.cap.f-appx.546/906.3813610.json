The statutory minimum sentence applicable to Varela increased from five to ten years\u2019 imprisonment because of a prior felony drug conviction. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). This conviction was not included in the government\u2019s indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-22\">Varela argues on appeal that the fact of his prior conviction needed to be included in the indictment because it was used to elevate his statutory minimum sentence. He concedes, however, that his argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-23\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that the fact of a prior conviction is not an element of the offense that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable. <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 239-40, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>118 S.Ct. at 1228-29. We have previously noted that until the Supreme Court specifically overrules itself, we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres. United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">A defendant who is found guilty of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture containing cocaine ordinarily faces a statutory sentencing range of five to forty years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). However, if a defendant commits the same offense after having been convicted for a felony drug offense, he faces a statutory sentencing range of ten years to life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Varela correctly concedes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>forecloses his argument on appeal. The Supreme Court has not overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Alleyne, </em>570 U.S. at-n. 1, 133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1 (stating that the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Al-mendarez-Torres </em>was not being revisited). Accordingly, it remains binding precedent. <em>See Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1273. We therefore affirm Varela\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
