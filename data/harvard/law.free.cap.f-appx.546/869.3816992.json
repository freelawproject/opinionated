After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Tubby\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">A. Tubby\u2019s State and Federal Convictions and Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b896-19\">In March 2004, Tubby was being held in Florida on pending state charges of ut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>tering a counterfeit instrument and other related offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In May 2004, while Tubby\u2019s state charges were still pending, Tubby was transferred to federal custody and arrested on federal charges relating to a large-scale check fraud conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">In December 2004, Tubby pled guilty in federal district court to conspiracy to pass fictitious obligations and to commit wire fraud, passing fictitious obligations, wire fraud, and social security fraud. In March 2005, the district court imposed a 125-month sentence, which was later reduced to 94 months in 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">However, after his federal sentencing, Tubby was returned to state custody on May 13, 2005. On June 21, 2005, the state court sentenced Tubby to 62 months on his state charges, to run concurrent to his federal sentence and ordered that Tubby\u2019s state sentence be served in federal custody. On February 24, 2006, Tubby was transferred to federal custody, but the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) returned Tubby to state custody on May 13, 2006 to first serve the remainder of his state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">In April 2007, the state court vacated Tubby\u2019s state sentence and imposed a suspended sentence so that Tubby\u2019s state and federal sentences could be served concurrently in federal custody. On April 26, 2007, Tubby was again transferred to federal custody and began serving his federal sentence. In calculating Tubby\u2019s federal sentence, the BOP denied Tubby\u2019s request for a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>designation, which would have given him credit for time served in state custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">A federal sentence begins when the defendant is received in federal custody to begin serving his sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a). The BOP, however, has the discretion to retroactively designate a state facility as the place for service of a federal sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b); <em>Barden v. Keohane, </em>921 F.2d 476, 478-79 (3d Cir.1990); BOP Program Statement 5160.05(9)(b)(4). If a defendant is already serving a state sentence, this <em>\u201cnunc pro tunc\u201d </em>designation has the effect of starting the federal sentence while the defendant is in state custody and running the federal and state sentences concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">B. <em>Pro Se </em>Post-Conviction Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">Beginning in January 2008, Tubby filed a series of <em>pro se </em>motions arguing that the BOP had improperly calculated the start date of his federal sentence by failing to give him credit for time served in state custody. The district court denied the first of these motions, a \u201cRequest for A <em>Nunc Pro Tunc </em>Designation\u201d because Tubby had not exhausted administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>A second <em>pro se </em>motion, titled a \u201cMotion for Judicial Recommendation,\u201d was filed in June 2008. The district court denied this motion, again for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">C.First \u00a7 2241 Petition</p>\n<p id=\"As0\">In 2009, Tubby filed a <em>pro se </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. Tubby\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, like his previous <em>pro se </em>post-conviction motions, argued that the BOP had improperly calculated his federal sentence. He also alleged that he had exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The district court denied Tubby\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition on the merits, concluding that the BOP properly calculated Tubby\u2019s federal sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585. The district court found that the sentencing court\u2019s judgment was silent as to whether Tubby\u2019s federal sentences should run concurrently to any future state sentence, and, therefore, the BOP properly ran Tubby\u2019s federal sentence consecutively to Tubby\u2019s state sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) (providing that \u201c[mjultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concurrently\u201d). The district court further noted that the BOP had asked for the sentencing court\u2019s recommendation, and the sentencing court had responded that Tubby should not be given <em>nunc pro tunc </em>designation based Tubby\u2019s presentence investigation report and his offense conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">The district court further concluded that Tubby\u2019s due process rights had not been violated because a state court\u2019s order that a federal sentence and a state sentence should run concurrently is not binding on federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Tubby\u2019s subsequent appeal to this Court was dismissed for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">D. Additional <em>Pro Se </em>Post-Conviction Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Between 2010 and 2012, Tubby filed several additional <em>pro se </em>motions in the district court that continued to argue that he should be given credit for time served in state custody. The district court denied all of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">E. Pro Se \u201cMotion for Review of Plain Error and Correction of an Otherwise Illegal Sentence\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">In 2013, Tubby filed the <em>pro se </em>motion that is the subject of this appeal. As the basis for the motion, Tubby cited Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b). This time, Tubby argued that the sentencing court had misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) when it failed to order that his federal sentence run concurrently to his state sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Tubby also contended that the sentencing court abused its discretion by not recommending to the BOP that Tubby receive a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">The district court denied Tubby\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion. Tubby appealed. Although Tubby\u2019s notice of appeal was not filed within fourteen days of entry of the district court\u2019s order, as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b), the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ment affirmatively waived this issue in its appellate brief. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>605 F.3d 1271, 1278 (1 1th Cir.2010) (concluding that this Court had jurisdiction to review an appeal that was filed past Rule 4(b)\u2019s non jurisdictional filing deadline because the government affirmatively forfeited its objection to the timeliness issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">\u201cThe authority of a district court to modify an imprisonment sentence is narrowly limited by statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), a district court may modify a sentence only if: (1) the BOP files a motion and certain other conditions are met; (2) a modification is expressly permitted by statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35; or (3) the defendant was sentenced based on a guidelines range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission and other requirements are met. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1194-95. Thus, \u201cabsent other express statutory authority, modification of an imprisonment sentence can only be done pursuant to Rule 35.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1195. Furthermore, the time for filing a Rule 35 motion is jurisdictional and \u201coutside of Rule 35(c) there exists no \u2018inherent authority\u2019 for a district court to modify a sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1196-97 (brackets and footnote omitted); <em>see also United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315-18 (11th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Tubby\u2019s <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion for Review of Plain Error and Correction of an Otherwise Illegal Sentence\u201d does not fall within any of the categories of authorized \u00a7 3582(c) motions. The motion was not filed by the BOP or based on an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. Given that the motion was not filed within seven days of Tubby\u2019s March 2005 sentence, it was not permitted by Rule 35(a). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) (2003);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1315-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">While a district court is required to \u201clook behind the label\u201d of a <em>pro se </em>motion, <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624 (11th Cir.1990), there is no statute or rule permitting Tubby to challenge his federal sentence under the circumstances of this case. Tubby cited Rule 52(b) as the basis for his motion. However, Rule 52(b) simply defines the plain error standard of review and does not provide a vehicle for the district court to modify Tubby\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">Further, the district court could not have construed Tubby\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion as a \u00a7 2255 petition. Tubby already had filed one \u00a7 2255 motion. Before the district court could consider a second \u00a7 2255 motion, Tubby was required to seek authorization from this Court, which he did not do. <em>See Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). \u201cWithout authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive petition.\u201d <em>Farris, </em>333 F.3d at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">Tubby\u2019s sentencing calculation claim probably would be cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>425 F.3d 987, 990 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>2005) (explaining that an inmate\u2019s claim relating to credit for time served is properly brought in a \u00a7 2241 petition). However, even if the district court had construed Tubby\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion as a \u00a7 2241 petition, the district court would have been unable to address Tubby\u2019s sentencing calculation claim because it already had been denied on the merits in his first \u00a7 2241 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Tubby couches his present <em>pro se </em>motion in terms of the district court\u2019s miscalculation of the guidelines. But, the crux of his argument remains that the district court and the BOP failed to give him credit for time served in state custody. This argument is the same argument Tubby made in his first \u00a7 2241 petition, which the district court denied on the merits. A successive \u00a7 2241 petition is subject to dismissal where it raises the same claims that were dismissed on the merits in the first \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, had Tubby\u2019s present <em>pro se </em>motion been construed as a \u00a7 2241 petition, the district court would have been required to dismiss it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">In sum, we conclude that because the district court had no authority to modify Tubby\u2019s seven-year-old sentence, the district court did not err in denying Tubby\u2019s <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion for Review of Plain Error and Correction of an Otherwise Illegal Sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\">. These state charges stem from Tubby\u2019s attempt to buy groceries using a counterfeit check and false identification. Tubby was originally arrested on these state charges on March 19, 2003. However, he appears to have been released shortly thereafter, as he was arrested again in May 2003 and in March 2004, each time on different state charges. After his March 2004 arrest, however, Tubby was held in state custody to face his original March 2003 state charges. The state court's ultimate sentence on the March 2003 charges was calculated from the March 2004 arrest date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-13\">. Tubby filed and then voluntarily dismissed his direct appeal of his federal sentence. In 2006, the district court granted the government\u2019s Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 motion based on Tubby\u2019s substantial assistance and reduced Tubby\u2019s sentence to 94 months. In 2006, Tubby filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence based on ineffective assistance of counsel during his plea proceedings. The district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion, and Tubby did not appeal that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b898-7\">. Section 5G 1.3(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that when \"a term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction\u201d and \"was the basis for an increase in the offense level\u201d under Chapters 2 or 3 of the Sentencing Guidelines, the sentencing court \"shall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment if the court determines that such period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons,\u201d and \"the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b899-7\">.. We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court has jurisdiction to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1194 n. 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b899-9\">. In 2009, Rule 35(a) was amended to provide that a court may correct a sentence within fourteen days after sentencing. Even if the 2009 amendment applies in this case, Tubby's motion was filed seven years after his sentencing and well beyond the time provided in either version of Rule 35(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b900-8\">. Even if we were to construe Tubby\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion as a \u00a7 2241 petition, the government notes that when Tubby filed his current <em>pro se </em>motion in the Southern District of Florida, he was incarcerated in the Western District of Texas. Thus, at the time the motion was filed in April 2013, the district court would have lacked jurisdiction to review the motion as a \u00a7 2241 petition for this reason as well. <em>See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 443, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 2722, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
