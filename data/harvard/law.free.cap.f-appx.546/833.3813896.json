Badger\u2019s employment with MCG Health was terminated after she returned to work from FMLA leave. On appeal, Badger contends that she needed additional discovery and that the district court incorrectly granted MCG Health\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Because Badger did not make her discovery argument before the district court and did not meet her evidentiary burden in response to MCG Health\u2019s summary judgment motion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">MCG Health employed Badger as a nurse manager. Badger requested and was approved for approximately one month of FMLA leave. Based on evidence in the record, while Badger was out on leave, her supervisor discovered that Badger had failed to: create files for important documents, maintain a competency manual required for accreditation, appropriately discipline employees, minimize employee overtime, and maintain employee FMLA paperwork, among other problems. So, when Badger returned to work, MCG Health terminated her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">Badger, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed this lawsuit alleging she was terminated in retaliation for taking FMLA leave. After discovery \u2014 during which Badger never filed a motion to compel \u2014 MCG Health moved for summary judgment, contending that it terminated Badger for legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons. Because Badger failed to present evidence that the proffered reasons were pretextual, the district court granted MCG Health\u2019s summary judgment motion. Badger appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">II.Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b860-18\">Badger contends (1) that she needs additional discovery and (2) that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on her FMLA retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-19\">III.Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b860-20\">We hold Badger\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings \u201cto a less stringent standard than pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>drafted by attorneys\u201d and liberally construe her arguments. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">A. Badger failed to preserve the argument that she needs additional discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Badger contends she \u201cwas not [allowed] to plead her case before the Court.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2.) Badger then makes various discovery requests. <em>{Id. </em>at 2-5.) Badger\u2019s main contention appears to be that she needed additional discovery to respond to MCG Health\u2019s summary judgment motion. MCG Health responds that Badger did not preserve this issue because she raises it for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">As previously stated, we construe pro <em>se </em>pleadings liberally. <em>Boxer X, </em>437 F.3d at 1110. However, even applying a liberal construction, issues not presented to the district court are waived on appeal. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that while <em>pro se </em>complaints are liberally construed, issues not raised in the district court are deemed waived). Badger does not contend that she presented this argument to the district court. After careful review, we find no such argument in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Accordingly, Badger waived this argument because she did not argue before the district court that she needed additional discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">B. The district court correctly granted MCG Health\u2019s summary judgment motion because Badger failed to provide evidence that MCG Health\u2019s non-retaliatory reasons for her termination were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Badger contends that we should \u201creview the information submitted to the Court and to consider if the Appellant has the right to proceed \"with her Complaint.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1.) We construe this as a challenge to the district court\u2019s summary judgment order. Badger contends that summary judgment was inappropriate because the non-retaliatory reasons for her termination were not her fault, but rather resulted from systemic failures at MCG Health or a lack of proper resources. MCG Health responds that it presented evidence of legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for Badger\u2019s termination. Furthermore, MCG Health contends these reasons were not pretextual and that Badger does not challenge their efficacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment de novo viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Dolphin LLC v. WCI Communities, Inc., </em>715 F.3d 1243, 1247 (11th Cir.2013). The moving party bears the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>The nonmoving party bears the burden of presenting evidence on each essential element of its claim, such that a reasonable jury could rule in its favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">\u201cTo prove FMLA retaliation, [Badger] must show that [her] employer <em>intentionally </em>discriminated against [her] for exercising an FMLA right.\u201d <em>Martin v. Brevard Cnty. Pub. Sch., </em>543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir.2008). When \u2014 as in this case\u2014 there is no \u201cdirect evidence of retaliatory intent, we apply the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1268. Under this framework, first, the employee bears the burden of establishing a valid case of retaliation. <em>Id. </em>Second, the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>shifts to the employer to \u201carticulate a legitimate reason\u201d for termination. <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Third, the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the employer\u2019s reasons are pretextual. <em>Id. </em>To meet this burden, the employee must show that the reasons given were not the real reasons for termination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In this case, MCG Health provided multiple non-retaliatory reasons for Badger\u2019s termination. MCG Health contends it terminated Badger because she failed to create and maintain adequate files regarding her subordinates, failed to properly enforce MCG Health\u2019s attendance policy, failed to control the amount of overtime used by her units, and failed to submit FMLA paperwork for subordinates, among other failures.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Because MCG Health offered non-retaliatory reasons for Badger\u2019s termination, the burden shifted to Badger to show that these reasons were pretextual \u2014 that they were not the real reason for her termination. Instead of meeting this burden, Badger admits most of these failures and blames them on a variety of systemic and resource issues beyond her control. Even taking Badger\u2019s assertions as true, these allegations fail to demonstrate that MCG Health\u2019s reasons were pretextual. We do not sit as a \u201csuper-personnel department\u201d determining the wisdom of an employer\u2019s business decisions. <em>Alvarez v. Royal Atlantic Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1266 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Commc\u2019ns, </em>738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cThe employer may fire an employee for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based on erroneous facts, or for no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason.\u201d). Based on Badger\u2019s allegations, arguably her termination may not have been deserved. But, Badger presents no evidence that the reasons MCG Health offered for terminating her were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Accordingly, the district court properly granted MCG Health\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Badger waived the argument that she needed additional discovery by failing to make this argument before the district court. Badger also failed to show that MCG Health\u2019s non-retaliatory reasons for her termination were pretextual. Thus, the district court properly granted MCG Health\u2019s summary judgment motion and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
