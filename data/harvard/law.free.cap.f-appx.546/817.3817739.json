After considering the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">After an action has been removed from state court to federal court, we review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to remand to de novo. <em>Henderson v. Wash. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>454 F.3d 1278, 1281 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cAn action in state court may be removed to federal court when the federal courts have diversity or federal question jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). The defendant must file a notice of removal within 30 days following receipt of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b). Under the \u201clast-served\u201d defendant rule, now codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b)(2)(B)-(C), each defendant may \u201cfile a timely motion for removal within [30] days of receipt of service by that individual defendant.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Janssen Pharmaceutica, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number><em>Inc., </em>586 F.3d 1202, 1204 (11th Cir.2008). In other words, \u201cearlier-served defendants who may have waived their right to independently seek removal ... may nevertheless consent to a timely motion by a later-served defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Here, Kennedy\u2019s state-court action alleged violations of several federal laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VIP), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634; .the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d); and Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. Therefore, the district court had federal question jurisdiction. Kennedy served Securitas Security Services (USA) Inc. (\u201cSecuritas\u201d) on April 16, 2012, and Bell South Telecommunications, Inc. (AT &amp; T) (\u201cBell South\u201d) on May 11, 2012.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bell South filed its notice of removal on June 8, 2012; therefore the notice of removal was within 30 days and timely. Because the removal was both timely and based on federal question jurisdiction, the district court did not err in denying Kennedy\u2019s motion to remand the case to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for recusal for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>175 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Under the abuse of discretion standard, we will affirm the district court\u2019s decision unless we \u201cconclude that the impropriety is clear and one which would be recognized by all objective, reasonable persons.\u201d Id.; <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b) (describing circumstances under which a federal judge must recuse himself). Here, Kennedy only points to three orders by the district judge that supposedly show bias: (1) an order denying motions by Kennedy for sanctions and objecting to the notice of removal; (2) an order dismissing his first amended complaint without prejudice; and (3) the order dismissing his second amended complaint with prejudice. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that no objective, reasonable person could question the district court\u2019s impartiality, because each order articulated a legitimate legal basis for the action. <em>See In re Walker, </em>532 F.3d 1304, 1311 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\u201cAdverse rulings are grounds for appeal but rarely are grounds for recusal....\u201d). Moreover, there was no evidence of bias from \u201cextrajudicial sources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1310 (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Kennedy\u2019s motion to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">A district court may sua sponte dismiss an action for failure to obey a court order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). <em>See Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V MONADA, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of an action for failure to comply with a court order or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for abuse of discretion. <em>Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019ns, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires that a pleading set forth \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 10(b) requires that a party \u201cstate its claims or defenses in numbered paragraphs, each limited as far as practicable to a single set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>of circumstances.\u201d We discourage consideration of \u201cshotgun\u201d pleadings where the plaintiff asserts multiple claims of relief in single counts and \u201cit is virtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Cent. Fla. Cmty. Coll., </em>77 F.3d 364, 366 (11th Cir.1996). Although dismissal of a case for failure to comply with pleading rules \u201cis a severe sanction, its imposition is justified when a party chooses to disregard the sound and proper directions of the district court.\u201d <em>Friedlander v. Nims, </em>755 F.2d 810, 813 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Kennedy\u2019s original and amended complaints did not confine individual claims to separate counts, incorporated hundreds of paragraphs by reference, and generally failed to identify the factual or legal bases for many of the alleged violations of federal law. Twice, the district court dismissed Kennedy\u2019s complaint without prejudice, providing Kennedy with opportunities to amend his complaint. Finally, after Kennedy\u2019s second amended complaint failed to satisfy the district court\u2019s pleading requirements, the court dismissed Kennedy\u2019s complaint with prejudice. Although we must liberally construe pro se pleadings, Rule 41(b) dismissal may be warranted \u201cwhere there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hepperle v. Johnston, </em>590 F.2d 609, 612 (5th Cir.1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court repeatedly told Kennedy how to comply with its pleading requirements, and Kennedy repeatedly ignored those instructions. Moreover, Kennedy gave no indication that he would be willing and able to comply if given another opportunity, but rather insisted \u2014 and still insists \u2014 that his complaints were in substantial compliance. Under the circumstances of this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Kennedy\u2019s second amended complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-9\">.
