After a jury trial, the defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law, which the district court granted. In granting the motion, the district court recited that there was no evidence before the jury from which it could infer the content of the call to police, much less whether that content was untrue or defamatory. Furthermore, the court held that the evidence was overwhelming that plaintiffs termination had \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with this call,\u201d but rather was the result of the incident between plaintiff and his supervisor. Finally, the court observed that there was \u201cno evidence of malice in this case.\u201d As a result of these conclusions, the district court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-24\">We have reviewed the record, the trial transcripts provided, and have read and considered the parties\u2019 arguments in their briefs. Finding no clear error in the district court\u2019s view of the evidence, we conclude that its decision to grant judgment as a matter of law to defendant is due to be</p>\n<p id=\"b971-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
