He urges that his sentence is unreasonable, specifically challenging the district court\u2019s imposition of a three-year term of non-reporting supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Ulloa has completed his term of imprisonment and has been removed to Honduras. For that reason, his appeal is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
