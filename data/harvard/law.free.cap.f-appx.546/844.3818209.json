The presentence investigation report (PSI) applied the 2008 Sentencing Guidelines Manual to assign Hall a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, because Hall was responsible for 1,613 grams of cocaine, 391 grams of crack cocaine, and 4,501 grams of marijuana, an equivalent total of 8,147 kilograms of marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a two-level increase for possessing a dangerous weapon in the offense and a total three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Hall\u2019s total offense level was 31. Based on an offense level of 31 and a criminal histo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>ry category of III, Hall\u2019s guideline range was 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Hall to 72 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">In 2012, Hall filed a pro <em>se </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, in which he asked the district court that \u201call new law be applied\u201d that would help reduce his sentence. The district court denied Hall\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because, even after application of Amendment 750, his base offense level remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582, a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the relevant amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 181, 187 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence by \u201csubstituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780. In other words, the court \u201cshall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). Under the second step, the court must decide whether, in its discretion and in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. District courts may not reexamine the other sentencing determinations made at the original sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (stating that courts should substitute only the amendment and \u201cleave all other guideline application decisions unaffected\u201d); <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">To determine a base offense level for an offense that involves different controlled substances, the Guidelines provide that each substance is to be converted to its marijuana equivalent, the quantities are to be added together, and then the offense level is to be determined based on reference to the Drug Quantity Table. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 8(B)) (2012). Amendment 750, effective November 1, 2011, and retroactive, eliminated the two-level reduction to the combined base offense level where the offense involved both crack cocaine and other controlled substances. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 750 (2011). Amendment 750 also lowered the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See id. </em>Under Amendment 750, 1 gram of crack cocaine equates to 3,571 grams of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>marijuana. <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n. 8(D)) (2012). Amendment 750 did not amend the marijuana equivalency for powder cocaine, which equates 1 gram of powder cocaine to 200 grams of marijuana. U.S.S.GApp. C., amend. 750 (2011); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 8(D)) (2012). A defendant\u2019s base offense level is 32 after Amendment 750 if he was held accountable for at least 1,000 kilograms, but less than 3,000 kilograms, of marijuana. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court properly denied Hall\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Under the Drug Equivalency Table in effect after Amendment 750, Hall was responsible for a total of 1,723 kilograms of marijuana: each of 1,613 grams of cocaine equates to 200 grams of marijuana, for a total of 322.6 kilograms of marijuana; each of 391 grams of crack cocaine equates to 3,571 grams of marijuana, for a total of 1,396.2 kilograms of marijuana; and Hall was also responsible for a total of 4.5 kilograms of marijuana. A defendant responsible for 1,723 kilograms of marijuana is assigned a base offense level of 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (2012). Applying the same sentencing determinations made by the sentencing court, Hall\u2019s adjusted offense level would still be 31, and his guideline range would remain 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). Accordingly, the district court did not err when it determined that it did not have the discretion to reduce Hall\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-14\">. Pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3), an offense involving at least 3,000 kilograms but less than 10,000 kilograms of marijuana would receive a base offense level of 34, but a two-level reduction to the base offense level applied, pursuant to \u00a7 2DI.1 n. 10(D)(i), for a base offense level of 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-10\">. The government had previously moved for a sentence reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), because after his arrest Hall provided substantial assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\">. Hall also urges this Court to remand his case for sentencing in light of <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), and <em>United States v. Hinds, </em>713 F.3d 1303 (11th Cir.2013). Neither case applies here. <em>Dorsey </em>held that Congress intended the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) to apply to defendants who committed their offenses before the FSA but were sentenced after it went into effect. <em>See Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. at 2326, 2335. Hall both committed his offense and was sentenced pri- or to the FSA, and thus <em>Dorsey </em>does not apply. As for <em>Hinds, </em>it also does not apply in Hall\u2019s case because it applies the <em>Dorsey </em>rule to a <em>de novo </em>resentencing following the effective date of the Fair Sentencing Act, circumstances which are not present here. <em>See Hinds, </em>713 F.3d at 1305.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
