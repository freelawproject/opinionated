While on drug-offender probation for two offenses, Newmones was arrested and charged with the second-degree murder of Leroy Browning (\u201cBrowning\u201d). At trial, the state presented no physical evidence connecting Newmones to the murder, and, instead, relied nearly exclusively on the testimony of Arthur Jones (\u201cJones\u201d), Browning\u2019s roommate, to place Newmones at the scene of the murder. No other eyewitnesses connected New-mones to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Newmones\u2019s main argument is that the district court \u201cunreasonabl[y] applied the standard for reviewing due process challenges based on the sufficiency of the evidence, as set forth in <em>[Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) ], in determining that a trier of fact could have found Mr. New-mones guilty by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d [Appellant Br. at 1.] Among other things, Newmones contends Jones was not a credible witness and the district court erred in relying upon his testimony. After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2254 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">At trial, Jones testified on direct examination that he was sitting on his porch in his wheelchair when Newmones approached and asked where Browning was. Jones testified that he had told Newmones that Browning was in bed, and that he had overheard Newmones and Browning arguing before he heard two gunshots. However, Jones\u2019s testimony on cross-examination was inconsistent either with his own testimony or other witnesses\u2019 statements as to, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) where he was physically located when Newmones allegedly approached the house; (2) both the number of gunshots that he heard and the number of gunshots that were actually fired; (3) the specific comments that he overheard during the incident; (4) whether he went into the bedroom, where Browning\u2019s body was found, after he heard the gunshots and whether it was possible to see Browning\u2019s body without approaching the bedroom; (5) whether he had consumed alcohol on the date in question; (6) what time of day the shooting occurred; (7) his physical location when the police arrived; (8) what kind of firearm was involved; and (9) his ability to walk, as he was wheelchair-bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Jones refused to answer various questions, which required the state trial court to intervene in the questioning. Jones was hostile to Newmones\u2019s attorney, telling him that he needed to go back to school, that Jones was not going to continue answering questions, and that Newmones\u2019s attorney needed to stop questioning him. Other witnesses consistently indicated that Jones was inebriated at the time of the incident and in the interviews with law enforcement that followed. The trial transcript reflects that Jones apparently soiled himself while on the stand. There was also evidence suggesting that Jones himself committed the murder, as he had owned a gun of the caliber used in the murder, the murder happened at his home, and he had traces of gunshot residue on his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The jury acquitted Newmones of second-degree murder. Nevertheless, the state trial judge conducted a probation-revocation hearing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> immediately after the jury verdict was announced and concluded that Newmones had violated his probation, stating \u201cThe violation is he murdered someone, in my opinion.\u201d [Jury Trial Transcript, Vol. Ill at 390.] When asked if the trial court was giving credibility to the witnesses\u2019 testimony without physical evidence, the court declined to point out the specific evidence on which it had relied. The court sentenced Newmones to consecutive m\u00e1ximums on the probation violations, totaling 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Newmones argued (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the state trial court\u2019s conclusion that his guilt had been proven by a preponderance of the evidence; the state trial court erred by failing to (2) give New-mones an opportunity to be heard; (3) allow his counsel to be present at the probation violation hearing; (4) be a neutral party; (5) enter a written order reciting the specific violations found; and (6) give him a full revocation hearing. The district court denied Newmones\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, but issued a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of whether the state trial court\u2019s conclusion that New-mones had violated his probation was supported by insufficient evidence so as to render the decision unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause. Liberally construing Newmones\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief, New-mones argues on appeal that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 2254 petition because there was insufficient evidence for the trial court to conclude that he had violated his probation. Specifically, he argues that the district court unreasonably applied <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789, when it determined that a trier of fact could have found him guilty by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to deny habeas relief. <em>Ferguson v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>716 F.3d 1315, 1330 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 33, - L.Ed.2d - (2013). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>petitions. <em>Dupree v. Warden, </em>715 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2013). We will not review issues that are outside the scope of the COA. <em>Jordan v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>485 F.3d 1351, 1356 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Under \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated in state court, unless the state court\u2019s adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented\u201d in state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2). The phrase \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d refers to holdings by the U.S. Supreme Court at the time of the state court\u2019s decision. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Clearly established federal law does not encompass statements made in <em>dicta. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">\u201cThe \u2018contrary to\u2019 and \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 clauses of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) are separate bases for reviewing a state court\u2019s decisions.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cA state court decision is \u2018contrary to\u2019 clearly established federal law if either (1) the state court applied a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by Supreme Court case law, or (2) when faced with materially indistinguishable facts, the state court arrived at a result different from that reached in a Supreme Court case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of federal law occurs when the state court either (1) correctly identifies the legal rule from Supreme Court precedent but unreasonably applies the rule to the facts of the case, or (2) \u201cunreasonably extends, or unreasonably declines to extend, a legal principle from Supreme Court case law to a new context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has repeatedly reiterated \u201cthat an <em>unreasonable </em>application of federal law is different from an <em>incorrect </em>application of federal law.\u201d <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>563 U.S.-,-, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1411, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Unreasonableness is \u201ca substantially higher threshold.\u201d <em>Schriro v. Landrigan, </em>550 U.S. 465, 473, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007). Under the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), the \u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 standard \u201cis difficult to meet, because the purpose of AEDPA is to ensure that federal habeas relief functions as a guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems, and not as a means of error correction.\u201d <em>Greene v. Fisher, </em>565 U.S. -,-, 132 S.Ct. 38, 43, 181 L.Ed.2d 336 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, \u201cif some fairminded jurists could agree with the state court\u2019s decision, although others might disagree, federal habeas relief must be denied.\u201d <em>Hill v. Humphrey, </em>662 F.3d 1335, 1346 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(fin </em>banc) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2727, 183 L.Ed.2d 80 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">In <em>Jackson, </em>a federal habeas petitioner claimed he had been convicted of murder based upon insufficient evidence. 443 U.S. at 309, 99 S.Ct. at 2783-84. The Supreme Court concluded that, when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2788-89. Here, the district court applied that standard to determine that a \u201crational trier of fact could have found [Newmones] guilty [of second-degree murder] by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d [R. 18 at 13.]</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>The standard set forth in <em>Jackson, </em>however, primarily applies to cases involving direct criminal prosecutions. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. White, </em>815 F.2d 1401, 1403, 1404 (11th Cir.1987) (holding that a rational jury could have found the evidence sufficient to prove robbery and assault with intent to murder beyond a reasonable doubt). Here, on the other hand, we are reviewing not a direct criminal prosecution but a probation revocation. Indeed, the Supreme Court has indicated the standard applicable to probation-revocation cases is different from that in <em>Jackson. </em>In <em>Douglas v. Buder, </em>412 U.S. 430, 93 S.Ct. 2199, 37 L.Ed.2d 52 (1973), the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of the revocation of a petitioner\u2019s probation for his failure to immediately report a traffic citation where the terms of petitioner\u2019s probation required him to report all \u201carrests.\u201d The Court determined the state court\u2019s decision that petitioner had violated his probation \u201cwas so totally devoid of eviden-tiary support as to be invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 93 S.Ct. at 2200. The Supreme Court has since applied that standard in affirming the revocation of an incarcerated petitioner\u2019s good-time credits. <em>See Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 2774, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985) (noting that the Court had previously recognized \u201ca governmental decision resulting in the loss of an important liberty interest violates due process if the decision is not supported by any evidence\u201d (citing <em>Douglas, </em>412 U.S. at 432, 93 S.Ct. at 2200)).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">We conclude the standard set forth in <em>Jackson </em>is not applicable to this case. Instead, the appropriate standard is set forth in <em>Douglas, </em>i.e., whether \u201cthe finding that [Newmones] had violated the conditions of his probation ... was so totally devoid of evidentiary support as to be invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d 412 U.S. at 432, 93 S.Ct. at 2200. Although Newmones only challenges the district court\u2019s application of <em>Jackson, </em>this Court liberally construes <em>pro se </em>petitions, such that we construe his claim to refer to <em>Douglas </em>and address it on the merits. <em>See Dupree, </em>715 F.3d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">We conclude there was sufficient evidence to find that Newmones had violated his probation by committing second-degree murder, such that the state trial court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Douglas\u2019s totally-devoid of evidence standard. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Further, the state court\u2019s determination of the facts was not unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1). Although Jones\u2019s testimony was hostile toward New-mones\u2019s attorney, inconsistent both with his prior statements and other testimony that he provided at trial, and often unclear, it was not \u201cso inherently incredible, so contrary to the teachings of human experience, so completely at odds with ordinary common sense, that no reasonable person would believe it beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Wilcox v. Ford, </em>813 F.2d 1140, 1146 (11th Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). Jones consistently stated that Newmones had approached his home, asked where Browning was, and confronted Browning about money, immediately before Jones heard gunshots. Further, numerous witnesses testified that Jones had identified Newmones as the shooter consistently since the date of Browning\u2019s death. Because Jones consistently testified as to these facts, his testimony was consistent enough for us to conclude it was not incredible as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Giving credence to Jones\u2019s testimony, we conclude there was evidence to support the state court\u2019s finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Newmones had violated his probation by committing second-degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>murder. Jones\u2019s testimony connected Newmones to Browning\u2019s death. Although Jones\u2019s testimony was the only evidence linking Newmones to Browning\u2019s death, Jones\u2019s testimony was not contradicted, and he never wavered in his statements that Newmones shot Browning.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">We conclude that the district court did not err by denying Newmones\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. Jones\u2019s testimony was not incredible as a matter of law, and, as such, the state court\u2019s determination of the facts was not unreasonable. Moreover, under a totally devoid of evidence standard, the state court\u2019s decision that Newmones had violated his probation by committing second-degree murder was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. We decline to address Newmones\u2019s other arguments about the procedural requirements of the revocation hearing, because those issues are outside the scope of the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court denying ha-beas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\">. Prior to <em>voir dire </em>on the substantive count of second-degree murder, the State noted that Newmones had a violation-of-probation case and asked the court to conduct a silent violation of probation hearing during the trial. Newmones agreed to permit the court to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
