In his plea agreement, Celestine reserved the \u201cright to appeal as it relates to Double Jeopardy and the Speedy Trial Act.\u201d On appeal, Celestine contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial had been violated. The Government has filed a motion to dismiss Celestine\u2019s appeal on the ground that the Sixth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>issue was not preserved for appeal, and thus, waived by Celestine\u2019s guilty plea. Celestine opposes the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">A voluntary and unconditional guilty plea waives an appellant\u2019s right to challenge any nonjurisdictional defects, such as a speedy trial claim, in the proceedings leading to a conviction. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 915 (5th Cir.1992). However, by entering into a \u201cconditional plea\u201d pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2), like Celestine\u2019s plea in the instant matter, a defendant may preserve the right to appeal an adverse ruling on a pretrial motion. A conditional guilty plea must be made in writing, be consented to by the Government, and be approved by the district court. Rule 11(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In the instant case, the reservation in Celestine\u2019s agreement was unambiguous and reserved only claims relating to double jeopardy and the Speedy Trial Act. Celes-tine suggests that, because he did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation regarding his claim pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act, it is illogical to conclude that he would preserve such a claim in his agreement. However, Celes-tine\u2019s suggestion fails to recognize that he did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation relating to his double jeopardy claim, yet preserved such a claim in his agreement. Furthermore, after the district court ruled on his motion to dismiss, but before Celestine entered his plea, Celestine filed another motion to dismiss the indictment exclusively relying on the Speedy Trial Act. Thus, it is logical to conclude that Celestine intended to reserve the right to appeal a claim pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act and that such a reservation was not a \u201ccareless oversight\u201d on the part of trial counsel. Celestine\u2019s valid guilty plea waived his speedy trial claim pursuant to the Sixth Amendment because it was not preserved in the plea bargain and does not rise to the level of a jurisdictional challenge. <em>See Bell, </em>966 F.2d at 915. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
