The defendant called three witnesses, Grossman, Wald-man, and Flowerman, who testified, in substance, to admissions of plaintiff at various times to the effect that he knew he was signing a release when he signed tire release produced by the defendant. The plaintiff did not deny the making of any of these admissions, but testified merely that he had never heard the release read before (the trial), and only signed it by advice. It was not necessary that plaintiff should have read the release to make it binding upon him. If, when he signed it, he believed it was a release, he would be bound by it. The question, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you heard they got more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>than $150, and that is the reason you brought suit?\u201d answered as follows, by plaintiff: \u201cYes, sir; that is right\u201d\u2014seems quite convincing that plaintiff knew he was signing a release of his claim when he signed Exhibit 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">The judgment will be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
