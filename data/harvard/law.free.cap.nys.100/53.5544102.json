The first paragraph of the will of the deceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>.husband of the plaintiff is as follows: \u201cAfter all my lawful debts and funeral expenses are paid, I give and bequeath to my wife Sarah M. Van Sise the interest on the sum of seven thousand dollars to be paid to her by my executors hereinafter named semi-annually as long as she shall remain my widow, this bequest to her to be in lieu of her dower and for her distributive share in my estate, and at her death or remarriage the said sum of seven thousand dollars, is to be equally divided among my following named children, Ann E. Bumstaed, Mary Amelia Velsor, Frances M. Velsor, Makaiy Seaman, Peter E. Van Sise, Charles Franklin Van Sise and Frederick S. Van Sise.\u201d Shortly after his death all of the heirs at law and legatees under his will entered into the following agreement: \u201cKnow all men by these presents, that we, the undersigned, heirs at law and legatees under the will of Charles A. Van Sise, deceased, do hereby agree and consent that the executor of the last will and testament of Charles A. Van Sise, deceased, pay to Sarah M. Van Sise, widow of said deceased, the sum of three hundred and seventy-five dollars each year during her natural life, the same to commence from the date of the death of said Charles A. Van Sise, the said sum of three hundred and seventy-five dollars to be in lieu of the interest in the sum of seven thousand dollars as mentioned in the will of said deceased. And it is further agreed that the Huntington bank stock shall remain in the estate, and, in the event of the fund of $7,000 not bringing interest Sufficient to meet the payment of $375, yearly, then the dividend on said stock shall be applied to make up the deficiency and bringing said amount up to the sum of $375; said agreement being binding upon each of us and our heirs.\u201d Appended to this agreement is the following memorandum, signed by the plaintiff: \u201cIn consideration of the premises in the foregoing agreement, I, Sarah M. Van Sise, hereby consent to said agreement, and become a party thereto the same as if my name was signed to the foregoing agreement. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 26th day of March, 1902.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b77-6\">Argued before JENKS, HOOKER, RICH, GAYNOR, and MILLER, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-7\">Thomas Young, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-8\">Nathan O.

It is clear, however, from the agreement that it was within the contemplation of the plaintiff, the defendant, and all the heirs at law and legatees of the deceased, that the payments to be made to her should come out of the estate of the deceased. That being so, the executor was no doubt entitled to his commissions, payable out of the fund, and not from the annuity. The judgment, however, is erroneous in that it has refused to adjudge due to the plaintiff the semiannual payment which was tendered on Eebruary 10, 1903. This amount is admittedly owing the plaintiff, and it was error to charge the commissions against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The judgment should therefore be modified by inserting the provision for the recovery of $178.13 by the plaintiff against the defendant, together with all commissions charged against the plaintiff\u2019s annuity, and striking out the provision relating to costs, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
