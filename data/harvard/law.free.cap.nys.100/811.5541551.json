The defendant, if not satisfied with the settlement of the case, had a right to move, on additional affidavits for a resettlement. Such a motion requiring to be made upon notice was properly returnable at Part 1, Special Term. As the settlement of a case on appeal is to be made by the justice presiding at the trial, if he was not sitting at Special Term, Part 1, when the motion was returnable, it was the duty of the justice so presiding to refer said motion to said trial justice for decision. The refusal in the case at bar to so remit the motion, and to undertake to determine it at Special Term, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the original motion directed, to be remitted for decision to the justice, who presided at the trial of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
