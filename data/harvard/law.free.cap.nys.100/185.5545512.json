The complaint alleges the incorporation of the defendant; that.it is engaged in printing a newspaper in the city of New York; that the plaintiff, on the days of the publications complained of, was and had been for many years a resident of the city of New York, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>engaged as a foreign newspaper correspondent, and had a reputation ' as an authority on historical works; that the publications complained of were false, libelous, and defamatory, and that the defendant suffered damage. The publication of November 20, 1904, translated into the English language, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\">\u201cNew Lascivious Literature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">\u201cA book just published in London by the journalist Henry W. Fisher, known in the United States, entitled \u2018Private Lives of William II and His Consort,\u2019 has created immense disgust. This new product of obscene literature is a conglomeration of dirty tittle tattle. Bilse\u2019s Little Garrison is the purest idyl compared with it. The London papers are' printing columns about this Machwerk [meritless concoction] but the result of their long-winded criticism culminates in the sentence that the book contains only back stairs gossip.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The publication of November 26, 1904, translated into the English language, is as follows: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cObscene Book Confiscated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\"Fisher\u2019s obscene blackguard book about the Emperor, about which I cabled you several days ago, was confiscated in all book stores here. As known, it contains the stupidest back stairs gossip.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The order should be reversed, and the plaintiff required separately to state and number the causes of action alleged in the complaint. That each publication of defamatory matter is a cause of action separate and complete in itself does not admit of doubt. In Pollock on Torts, it is said (page 215): \u201cEvery publication of defamatory words is a new publication and is a distinct cause of action.\u201d See, too, Fleischmann v. Bennett, 87 N. Y. 231; Rockwell v. Brown, 36 N. Y. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">The order should be reversed, and the motion granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
