The damages alleged are the expense of getting the the scow off and repairing it, and for the use of the scow meanwhile. As the damages sued for were unliquidated, the plaintiff was not entitled to interest. Excelsior Terra Cotta Co. v. Harde, 181 N. Y. 11, 73 N. E. 494, 106 Am. St. Rep. 493; Smith v. Velie, 60 N.
