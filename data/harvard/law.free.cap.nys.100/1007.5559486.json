Plaintiff testified that he did not read the receipt at the time of shipment, but upon cross-examination stated that the receipt came out of his own book of receipts, in his possession at the time of the shipment. <em>Held </em>insufficient to support a finding that the shipper did not have notice of the limitation of liability contained in the receipt.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1030-10\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Manhattan, First District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1030-11\">Action by Solomon Fried against Wells Fargo &amp; Co.

It seems to be the law that, if the shipper knew the terms of the receipt, the limitation of liability would bind him. Springer v. Westcott, 166 N. Y. 117-123, 59 N. E. 693; Rosenthal v. Weir, 170 N. Y. 148, 153, 63 N. E. 65, 57 L. R. A. 527. The plaintiff, being examined in his own behalf by his counsel, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>asked, \u201cDid you read the receipt at that time [time of shipment] ?\u201d\u2022 ,and he answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Upon cross-examination he testified that the receipt was from his own book; that it came out of a book of receipts in his possession at the time the shipment was delivered. Upon this evidence the court should not have found, as it must have found to have rendered the judgment, that the shipper did not have notice of the limitation of liability referred to in the receipt. To overcome the reasonable inference that he knew the form of the receipts in his book, it was not sufficient to show that he had not read the receipt at the time of shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">The judgment will be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
