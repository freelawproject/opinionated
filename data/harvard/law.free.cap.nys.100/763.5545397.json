The judgment demanded by the complaint was that the defendant be decreed to specifically perform a contract for the conveyance of real estate in the city of New York, and that in the alternative the plaintiff be decreed or adjudged to have a lien for the amount deposited upon the execution of the contract. It has been determined in this department that the right of the plaintiff to retain the notice of pendency of action in an action for a decree for specific performance of the contract for a conveyance of real property must be determined upon the allegations of the complaint, or facts clearly established, and that upon such a motion, as in the case at bar, we are not authorized to look into the facts as upon a trial nor to search the complaint as upon a demurrer. Tishman v. Acritelli, 111 App. Div. 237, 97 N. Y. Supp. 668; Lindheim &amp; Co. v. Central Co., 111 App. Div. 275, 97 N. Y. Supp. 619; Wolinsky v. Okun, 111 App. Div. 536, 97 N. Y. Supp. 943; McCrum v. Lex Realty Co., 113 App. Div. 58, 98 N. Y. Supp. 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-15\">Upon those authorities the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
