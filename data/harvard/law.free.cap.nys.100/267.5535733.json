The case was decided upon the following proposition of the learned trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201cBy taking the property away from the defendants and into her own charge the plaintiff rescinded the contract and thereby lost her right of action for damages for the breach by the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The case of the plaintiff is that the defendants broke the contract, and thereupon, upon notice to the defendants that she considered that they had repudiated the contract, she took such possession and rented the premises. If the defendants renounced the contract, the plaintiff could act upon the assumption of a breach before the time for performance (Bernstein v. Meech, 130 N. Y. 354-358, 29 N. E. 255; Windmuller v. Pope, 107 N. Y. 674, 14 N. E. 436), and she could thereupon sue upon the breach (Howard v. Daly, 61 N. Y. 362-376, 19 Am. Rep. 285). I am of opinion that a rescission was not necessarily established by the act of the plaintiff in taking over the premises, provided there was a breach of the contract by the defendants. So far as her obligations to the defendants were concerned, it was indeed her \u201cduty to mitigate the damages as much as she could.\u201d See Kidd v. McCormick, 83 N. Y. 391-399; Allen v. McConihe, 124 N. Y. 342, 26 N. E. 812; Johnson v. Meeker, 96 N. Y. 93, 48 Am. Rep. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Inasmuch as the court disposed of the case upon the view that the act of the plaintiff in any event was a rescission, I think that the judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial must be granted; costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
