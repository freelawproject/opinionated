Clause 4 of the judgment is not an alternative provision inserted for the benefit of the defendant, and which it is at liberty to avail itself of at its election, instead of making specific performance. It was intended to give, and does give, the plaintiff the right to avail himself of its terms, should he so elect, for the causes therein specified. Plaintiff has insisted upon specific performance, and is ready and willing to perform on his part. Defendant appealed to the Appellate Division, and thereupon deposited a deed in form as required by the judgment. After affirmance there he has appealed to the Court of Appeals, and the latter appeal is pending and undetermined. The practical interpretation of its obligations, in the event of an ultimate determination affirming the judgment thus made, should not be disturbed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-14\">Motion denied, with $10 costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A3Mj\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.
