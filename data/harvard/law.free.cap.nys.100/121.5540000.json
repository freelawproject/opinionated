The defendants interposed a counterclaim for damages for a breach of contract, by which it is alleged that the plaintiff constituted the defendants his general agents for the sale in the Philippine Islands of a compound manufactured by him in the United States known as \"sulphur bitters,\u201d and gave them the exclusive right to there sell said compound, and agreed that he would not, directly or indirectly, sell or ship said compound for sale in the Philippine Islands to any other person, company, or corporation. The evidence sought to be procured under the commission is upon the issue as to whether the plaintiff violated these covenants designed to protect the defendants in their right to the exclusive agency, and upon the quantum of damages as well. The order does not expressly specify whether the commission authorized is an open commission, or one upon interrogatories, or partly upon interrogatories and partly upon oral ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tions. It directs that a commission issue to one Lyon, an attorney at law residing in Manila, \u201cto examine under oath Carl Muller, one of the defendants herein, as a witness on behalf of the defendants, in which the plaintiff shall be at liberty to join, and any other witnesses who may be produced by either party.\u201d A commission may, in a proper case, issue to examine a party as well as a witness upon interrogatories, pursuant to the provisions of section 887 of the Code of Civil Procedure; but this application is made by the defendants without the consent of the plaintiff, and it is expressly provided in section 895 of the Code of Civil Procedure that the applicant for the commission cannot be examined in his own behalf pursuant to the provisions of section 893 and section 894 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provide for an open commission and for a commission to examine wholly or partly upon oral questions. A commission, therefore, could only issue to examine the defendant Muller upon interrogatories to be annexed thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\">If the order was granted under section 887 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it should have provided that the commission was issued to examine the witnesses upon interrogatories to be annexed thereto, and all of the witnesses to be examined should have been named therein (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 887; Matter of Anderson\u2019s Will, 84 App. Div. 268, 82 N. Y. Supp. 683) ; and if it was intended to authorize a commission wholly or partly upon oral questions or an open commission, it should have been so expressly provided in the order (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 893, 894).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The facts presented are insufficient to justify the court in issuing an open commission, which virtually transfers the place of trial to another forum, and for that reason such commissions are only granted in very extreme cases. Darling v. Klock, 74 Hun, 248, 26 N. Y. Supp. 445; Stewart v. Russell, 66 App. Div. 543, 73 N. Y. Supp. 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The defendant Muller is in charge of the branch office of the defendants at Manila. The affidavit of the defendant Radigan shows that he is informed and believes that his codefendant is without the state of New York, but he does not set forth the source of his information of the grounds of his belief. The affidavit of the attorney is positive and to the effect that Muller is not within the state of New York, but how he is in a position to have greater knowledge of the fact than Muller\u2019s partner in business does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs, but with leave to renew. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
