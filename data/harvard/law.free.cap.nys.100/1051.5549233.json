They are the residuary legatees of the testator, and one of them is coexecutor of the testator\u2019s will. By his will the testator left an amount of personalty to his wife, this executrix, to have the income for her life, and with \u201cthe right to use the principal if she shall need it.\u201d In administering the estate she has paid over to herself $1,600 under this bequest, and in her account credits herself as executrix therewith, the words bejng, \u201cI have paid to myself as legatee of said deceased under and by virtue of said will the sum of,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-21\">This is correct. She has a right under the will to receive the personalty bequeathed to her as aforesaid, and invest it and use the income, and also to use the principal if she needs it. On her death the residuary legatees will be entitled to any of it that remains. Meanwhile she is their trustee of the fund. Rose v. Hatch, 125 N. Y. 427, 26 N. E. 467; Leggett v. Stevens, 185 N. Y. 70, 77 N. E. 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>There is also an appeal from an order of the Surrogate denying a motion of the co-executor that he have joint custody of the fund with the executrix. She is given full possession and control by the will in the way above stated and is entitled to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">The decree and order should be affirmed with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
