These motions were both denied. So far as the motion to cancel the lis pendens was denied, we think the court was right. The action is for the specific performance of a contract for the sale of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"A6qK\">The question at issue between the parties is as to whether the title of the defendant to the property is a marketable title, and until that question is finally determined the lis pendens should not be disturbed. This is not a case in which the plaintiff can be protected by an undertaking, as, if the plaintiff succeeds in getting a j'udgment for a specific performance of the contract, he is entitled to the property. I think, however, that the defendant should have been allowed to serve a supplemental answer. It seems that after the action was at issue the parties agreed upon a statement of facts, and there was submitted to this court the question as to whether the defendant\u2019s title was marketable. There seems to have been no written stipulation as to what should be done with this action pending the final determination of that submission; but it is quite clear that the parties must have intended that the proceedings in this action should be suspended until the questions involved in the submission were settled. The case was submitted to this court, and it was determined that the defendant\u2019s title to the property was marketable and the plaintiff was directed to specifically perform the contract. There was a dissent, however, and the plaintiff has appealed to the Court of Appeals from the j'udgment entered upon that submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">There is a question in the affidavit as to the actual pendency of the appeal at the time this motion was made, but it appeared that the plaintiff intended in good faith to appeal. The subsequent answer seeks to set up the j'udgment of this court upon the submission, and I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the defendant is entitled to have that determination presented upon the record, so that advantage can be taken of it when the case is actually tried, and the order, so far as it denies the motion for leave to serve such supplemental answer, should be reversed and the defendant allowed to serve a supplemental answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">It is proper to state, however, that we think that, if an appeal to the Court of Appeals is properly perfected, this motion should not he tried until that appeal is determined; and the leave granted to serve this supplemental answer is without prejudice, therefore, to an application by the plaintiff for a stay of the proceedings in case the defendant should move the case for trial before the final determination of the appeal to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">No costs are awarded in this court or in the court below. All concur:</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
