He arrived at the scene of the accident very soon after it took place, and describes the injuries to the van and to the front part of the street car. It appears that the van was loaded with furniture. He was asked on direct examination: \u201cQ. What was the condition of that furniture in regard to being injured ?\u201d The question was objected to, the objection was sustained, and the plaintiff excepted. In view of the fact that the principal questions in the case, and especially that as to the defendant\u2019s negligence and the speed of the car, were sharply contested, and presented close questions of fact for the jury\u2019s consideration, we think that the manifest mistake in excluding this question attained to the dignity of reversible error. The evidence was important for the purpose of showing the force of the impact, and inferentially the speed of the car, at that time. The questions of fact were so sharply contested and evenly balanced, when the case went to the jury, that it is not unreasonable to suppose that this error would have affected the result, especially as there appears to be no other evidence touching the condition of the furniture in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\">Judgment and order of the County Court of Westchester county reversed, and new trial ordered, costs to abide the event. Ail concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
