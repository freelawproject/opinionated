His claim is not contested, but the defendant, by way of counterclaim, seeks to establish an indebtedness by plaintiff to him in the sum of $6,000. This claim is for moneys said to have been loaned to plaintiff and paid out for his account, mainly in small sums, between October 28th and November 12th. By his bill of particulars defendant shows that his claim embraces some 340 items, The reply to the counterclaim is, in effect, a general denial. . From an order of reference granted on plaintiff\u2019s motion, defendant appeals. The cause of action set up by the counterclaim would undoubtedly justify a compulsory order of reference, if embodied in a complaint, and while it is the general rule that, if a plaintiff sues upon a contract for a definite sum of money, or for damages ex contractu, and his cause of action be gainsaid by the defendant, the cause is not referable, notwithstanding anything which the defendant may set up in his answer; yet if, as in the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s claim is not gainsaid, and the defendant sets up- a counterclaim which requires the examination of a long account, then the cause is referable. Stock v. Col. Fuel &amp; Iron Co., 142 N. Y. 236, 37 N. E. 1, 25 L. R. A. 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
