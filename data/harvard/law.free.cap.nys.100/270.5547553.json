Sanford were copartners carrying on business as dealers in millc and other dairy products. Their partnership agreement contained a provision that \u201cupon the retirement of any partner upon the dissolution of said copartnership by reason of the expiration of its term or otherwise, he shall not thereafter carry on the same kind of business in such manner as to interfere with, draw any customers from, be in opposition to, or in any way hurt or damage the business already established and carried on by said firm.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-10\">In an action brought by the defendant for that purpose the said partnership was dissolved, and all of the assets thereof sold by a receiver, \u201cincluding the good will of the said business theretofore conducted by the said copartnership, together with the right to enforce any and all covenants and agreements in said copartnership agreement contained\u201d (I. e. the partnership agreement of the said partnership).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">The said copartner Pierson E.

The agreement is only not to carry on such business \u201cin such manner as to interfere with, draw any customers from, be in opposition to, or in any way hurt or damage the business already established and carried on by said firm.\u201d A controversy can arise under this in respect of numberless acts, business methods and policies of the defendant in his new business in respect of whether they violate the agreement. How is it to be determined whether they \u201cinterfere with, draw any customers from, be in opposition to, or in any way hurt or damage the business\u201d of the plaintiff? Many or most cases of alleged violation would involve the consideration of the question whether they in fact amounted to carrying on the business in a way to affect the plaintiff\u2019s business within the general prohibition of the agreement. Courts of equity will not take upon themselves the burden of interpreting and enforcing an agreement as unprecise, as infinite in its details and ramifications, as obscure as this. Parties have no right to cast such a burden on courts of equity; on the contrary, it is for them to make such an agreement specific. It was for the parties in this in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>stance to have specified the things which would interfere with, hurt, be in opposition to, or draw away the customers of the business. Caswell v. Gibbs, 33 Mich. 331; High on Inj. \u00a7 1178; Stokes v. Stokes, 148 N. Y. 708, 43 N. E. 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">This agreement should be enforced only in the respect in which it is not open to doubt. \u25a0 Beyond doubt it prevents the defendant from soliciting the plaintiff\u2019s customers, directly or indirectly, for himself, the plaintiff, or any one else, and in this respect only should it be enforced. The trial court has found that he did this in respect of five customers. The interlocutory judgment should have been restricted to that way of violating the agreement, and empowered the referee to take evidence of the damage done in the five cases, and like cases, and no other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The agreement includes not only the old customers of the partnership, but all who have since become customers of the plaintiff\u2019s business, it contemplated a changing and growing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The interlocutory .judgment should be modified as above, and as thus modified affirmed without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
