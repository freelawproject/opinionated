O\u2019Brien, deceased. The complaint has been dismissed; the plaintiff and one of the defendants appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-17\">The trust provision of the will is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-18\">\u201cI give and devise to my executor hereinafter named any and all Real Estate of which I may die seized, to hold in trust for the benefit of my children, for which said purpose I hereby direct-that my Executor apply whatever proceeds there may be therefrom to their benefit, until the youngest of my said children shall have attained the age of twenty-five, years,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-19\">This is coupled with a discretionary power of sale, not material to the question presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-20\">The defect alleged\" is that the will provides no termination of the trust estate, though a definite term is set apart for the trustee to make a particular disposition of the proceeds. This is clearly untenable. All trusts end when the purpose for which they have been created has been performed, and, the testatrix having provided a trust fund to pay over the income to her children until the youngest of them shall be <em>25 </em>years of age, the trust terminates upon the arrival of that time, because there is no further purpose of the trust to be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-22\">But it is urged that, if the above proposition is overruled, the trust is for a term fixed by years, and is therefore void. The trust is for the benefit of a class measured by the life, or a less time, of the testatrix\u2019s youngest child. It terminates absolutely upon the youngest child reaching the age of 25 years, and, if he dies before that time, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>trust term is ended by his death. Sawyer v. Cubby, 146 N. Y. 192, 197, 40 N. E. 869. There is a perfectly valid trust, and the plaintiff is without a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
