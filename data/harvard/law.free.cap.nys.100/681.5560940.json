Upon the trial, at the close of the case, by permission of the court a juror was allowed to be withdrawn. Thereafter plaintiff moved for leave to amend his complaint in order to enable him to set up with more particularity the defects complained of. The order appealed from granted the motion upon the payment of $20 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-19\">The order should be modified by providing for the payment by the plaintiff of all taxable costs to the date of the motion for leave to amend, with $10 costs of that motion, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
