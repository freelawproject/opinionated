An examination of the judgment debtor had been had, but the proceeding itself had not been concluded, and was still pending before the justice who granted the original order. The judgment creditor desired to examine appellant to whom it is claimed the judgment debtor fraudulently transferred a large amount of property; and to that end his attorneys issued a subpoena in the usual form, subscribed by them, tested in the name of the justice before whom the proceeding was pending, and appended thereto the name of the clerk of the court. A motion was made to set aside this subpoena on the ground that it was a nullity, because it was not signed by the justice before whom the proceeding was pending, and from the order refusing to set it aside this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">While in a sense proceedings supplementary to execution are proceedings in the action in which the judgment is obtained, because the action is not deemed in law terminated until the judgment is satisfied (Matter of Crane, 81 Hun, 96, 30 N. Y. Supp. 616), still the proceeding is not instituted by or in the court in which the judgment has been obtained, but by a judge of that court or some other judge given by law concurrent jurisdiction therefor. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2434. A subpoena to testify as a witness is a \u201cprocess\u201d within the meaning of the statute (Yorks v. Peck, 31 Barb. 350), and when it is issued out of a court of record, as upon the trial of an action, authority is given by section 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>of the Code of Civil Procedure to the attorney for the party to issue it. In an action or proceeding pending in a court of record unless the law otherwise specifies, an attorney for a party may issue a subpoena without application to a court or judge, by signing it himself and testing it in the name of a judge of the court and of its clerk (People ex rel. Jacobs v. Ball, 37 Hun, 245); and such is the universal practice. Where, however, a judge or an arbitrator, referee, or other person, or a board or committee is expressly authorized by law to hear, try, or determine a matter in relation to which the attendance of a person as a witness may be required, it is expressly provided by section 854 of the Code of Civil Procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-5\">\u201cThat a subpoena may be issued by and under the hand of the judge, arbitrator, referee, or other person, or the chairman or a majority of the hoard or committee, requiring the person to attend; and also, in a proper case, to bring with him a book or paper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">We think this provision is imperative, and that under such circumstances a subpoena must be issued under the hand of the judge, or referee, arbitrator, or other person, and that it applies to a subpoena issued in supplementary proceedings. As has.been pointed out, such proceedings are not instituted in the court or by the court, but by a judge who is given special authority therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">The provision of section 3444 of the Code that on such proceeding either party may be examined as a witness in his own behalf, and may produce and examine other witnesses, \u201cas upon the trial of an action,\u201d relates, not to the manner of summoning a witness to appear by subpoena, but to the manner in which the examination shall be had after the witness has been properly summoned. The subpoena should have been signed by the judge before whom the proceeding was pending, and, having been issued without his signature, and by the attorney alone, it was a nullity and the motion to set it aside should have been granted. Judgment creditors are given the right by law to examine witnesses on proceedings supplementary to execution instituted against their judgment debtors; and it has long been the rule on such examinations \u201cthat the fullest scope was intended to be given to ferret out fraudulent transfers of property.\u201d Lathrop v. Clapp, 40 N. Y. 328, 331, 100 Am. Dec. 493. The Legislature might well have given authority to the attorney for the judgment creditor to issue subpoenas without application to the judge who granted the order for the examination. It has not done so, however; but, on the contrary, has provided that such subpoena shall be issued by the judge or referee before whom the proceeding is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to set aside the subpoena granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
