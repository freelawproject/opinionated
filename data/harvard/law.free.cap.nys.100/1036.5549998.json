Bartlett, 100 N. Y. Supp. 1032, and we need only supplement the facts set forth in the opinion in that case by stating that, subsequent to the termination of the criminal prosecution by the plaintiff against the defendant, an action was begun in justice\u2019s court by the plaintiff against the defendant to recover the value of the mileage book, and the trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff against the defendant for the value thereof, $13:02, and judgment was entered by the justice upon the verdict for the sum of $13.02 damages and $5 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">An appeal was taken by the defendant from the judgment to the County Court of Steuben county, where the judgment was reversed upon the ground that the plaintiff was not the owner of the mileage book and acquired no title or interest therein, and therefore that the action was not maintainable. We have reached a different conclusion. We have fully set forth our views upon the question in the other case, and it is unnecessary to reiterate them. If we are right, it follows that the judgment of the County Court cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">The judgment of the County Court should be reversed, and that of the Justice\u2019s Court affirmed, with costs in this court and in the County Court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
