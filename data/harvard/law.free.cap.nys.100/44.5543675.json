The people, represented by the Attorney General, and the claimants were the only parties to the reference. Any stipulation they may have made the Special Term could not disturb while it remained in force. This being so, the action of the Special Term in reducing that amount to $15,000 was unwarranted. The order appealed from should be reversed, and the report of the referee confirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
