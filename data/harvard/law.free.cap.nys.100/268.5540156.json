It appeared that on the 26th day of June the building in which the plaintiff was employed burned. The defendants did not resume work until the 25th of July, at which time the new contract of employment for a year was entered into. There is no evidence, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s right to wages for the four weeks intervening had been waived by any express agreement between the parties, and the fire furnished no excuse for the defendants\u2019 failure to pay the sum stipulated. The plaintiff was employed as a designer and cutter, but there was no evidence that the labor was to be performed at any particular place or in any particular building. The defendants engaged absolutely to pay the plaintiff the sum of $35 per week for a given period. It is undisputed that the plaintiff was at all times ready to perform the services for which he was employed. If the defendants desired to protect themselves from the result of accidents, they should have so stipulated in their contract. Harmony v. Bingham, 12 N. Y. 99, 62 Am. Dec. 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Upon this state of the proof we think it clear that the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment for the four weeks\u2019 wages at $35 per week, and for this reason the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
