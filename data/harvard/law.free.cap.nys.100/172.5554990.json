The plaintiff recovered a judgment upon a verdict. Upon defendant\u2019s appeal therefrom, and from an order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial' on the minutes, we reversed the judgment and the order, and ordered a new trial, \u201ccosts to abide event.\u201d 105 App. Div. 96, 93 N. Y. Supp. 844. On the second trial the plaintiff again recovered a judgment, and thereupon the costs now objected to were taxed. The appellant does not challenge the propriety of the items, but contends that the plaintiff, being unsuccessful on the appeal, is not entitled to tax the costs thereof as the prevailing party upon the new trial. The costs were \u201cto abide the event,\u201d and the event is favorable to the plaintiff; that is, he has succeeded in the trial, for there is in the eye of the law but one trial of this action, namely, that which has terminated in favor of the plaintiff. Benjamin v. Ver Nooy, 168 N. Y. 578, at page 583, 61 N. E. 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">We are of opinion that the taxation by the clerk was correct. Koon v. Thurman, 2 Hill, 357; First N. Bank of Meadville v. Fourth N. Bank of New York, 84 N. Y. 469; Franey v. Smith, 126 N. Y. 658-660, 27 N. E. 559. There is, of course, a distinction between an award of costs in the terms pf the judgment in this case and awards of \u201ccosts to the appellant or to the plaintiff or the defendant to abide the event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
