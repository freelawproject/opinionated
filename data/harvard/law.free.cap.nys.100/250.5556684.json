The defendant leased a store to the plaintiff, who carried on in it the business of retail dealer in butter and eggs. The ice box he put in for his business being too large to go through the door,. he took out the large plate glass which formed part of the front of the store, and was set in the building itself, instead of in a movable sash, and put the ice box in through the opening, and replaced the plate glass. The defendant was present while the ice box was being put in in that way, and did not forbid or prevent it, but only asked who was to repair the damage by the removal of the glass, the plaintiff saying he would. When the tenant was moving out at the end of the term the defendant prevented him from taking the ice box out in the way he took it in and there was no other way to take it out. It could not be taken apart without being destroyed, or greatly injured.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b274-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Argued before WOODWARD, JENKS, HOOKER, MIDLER, and GAYNOR, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-3\">Robert H.
