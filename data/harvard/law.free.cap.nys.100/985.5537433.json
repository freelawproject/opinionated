Counsel for defendant argues that the complaint was insufficient to enable the plaintiff to recover for the furnishing of an unsafe scaffold, which section 18 of the labor law (Laws 1897, p. 467, c. 415) forbids, because it did not plead the said statute and allege a violation of it. It was not necessary to do so. The complaint alleged that the scaffold was of unsafe material and also unsafely constructed, and that sufficed. That the liability o,f the employer is created or enlarged by statute does not make the action a statutory one. The effect of the statute is to make the negligence of fellow servants in the making of a scaffold that of the master, and thus enable the negligence of the master to be proved by evidence which formerly did not prove it. It is enough now as formerly for the complaint to allege the negligence of the master. The difference is that evidence which formerly did not prove his negligence now does. Harris v.

Supp. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">Judgment o\u00ed the Municipal Court affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
