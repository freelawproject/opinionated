Strong v. Sheffield, 144 N. Y. 392, 39 N. E. 330. Brockway\u2019s refusal to make further advances when requested did not serve to invalidate the mortgage. At most it could only have furnished a cause of action against him. We are unable to find any evidence, however, that Mrs. Greene ever consented that the $50 subsequently loaned should be included in the amount to be secured by the mortgage. Concededly this loan was not made as part of the future advances for which the mortgage was, in part, made, and neither party understood or intended, when this sum was loaned, that it was to be covered by the mortgage. The agreement to that effect was made afterwards by Greene and Broclcway, and apparently Mrs. Greene neither knew of this nor assented to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The judgment must therefore be modified by deducting from the principal sum found due the sum of $50, with a corresponding reduction of interest and allowance, and, as so modified, must be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
