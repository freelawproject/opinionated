Judgment was demanded that the assignment be canceled and set aside, and that plaintiff have an accounting of the property received by defendant of the corporation to pay plaintiff\u2019s claim, and that plaintiff recover the balance of the account. <em>Held, </em>that a demurrer to the complaint on the ground that it did not state a cause of action was properly sustained, as the complaint showed that the plaintiff had no claim against the corporation, and hence the assignment of any such claim was no bar to an action which he might have against the defendant on the original delivery of the goods, and the facts did not show plaintiff entitled to an accounting.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Appeal from Special Term, New York County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b915-5\">Action by Joseph Gordon against Bernard J.

Wherefore the plaintiff demands judgment that the said assignment be canceled and set aside, that plaintiff may have an accounting of the said amounts of moneys and property received by the said Maas from the Gallatin Hotel Company for the payment of plaintiff\u2019s claim, that plaintiff recover the said $126.50, and that, in case the said amount is not paid, plaintiff may have orders of arrest and execution against the said defendant, and such other and further relief as to the court may seem just and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>There is no allegation in this complaint that the Gallatin Hotel Company made any contract with the plaintiff, bought anything from him, or owes anything to him. The allegation is as plain as language can make it that the plaintiff furnished coal to the hotel at the request of the defendant, and upon his promise to pay therefor, not as guarantor, but as an original promisor. If the plaintiff had no claim against the Gallatin Hotel Company, as it is evident under these allegations that he did not, the assignment of such claim to the defendant is no bar to any action which he might have against the defendant upon the original delivery of the goods at his request and upon his promise to pay; and therefore there is no necessity for an equitable action to set aside the said assignment upon the ground of fraud. If, in a direct action.upon the original promise, said assignment should be set up or introduced as a defense, it could be attacked, and would be of no avail. Nor does there seem to be any necessity for an accounting; for, if the Gallatin Hotel Company- was not indebted to the plaintiff, I do not see that the plaintiff has a right to this accounting for any sums of money which the Gallatin Hotel Company may have paid the defendant. Pleading, under the liberal rules of the Code, has reached a deplorable condition of ineptitude and uncertainty. But I do not think that a trial court should be called upon to spell out from this complaint a cause of action, or determine whether it should be tried before a jury or before the court at Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs in this court and the court below, with leave to the plaintiff, within 30 days, upon the payment thereof, to serve an amended complaint. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
