Section 1674 provides that if plaintiff, after filing notice, unreasonably neglects to proceed, the court may, in its discretion, direct that the notice be canceled upon the application of any party aggrieved. <em>Held, </em>that a motion of a defendant to cancel a notice was properly denied, where the reason that he had not been served was that neither he nor his place of residence could be found, and he refused to disclose it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b228-12\">Appeal from Special Term, Kings County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-13\">Action by Sadie Levy against Sarah Kon and Charles Tasman.

Section <em>1670 </em>of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that where a lis pendens is filed personal service of the summons must be made on \u201ca defendant\u201d within sixty days thereafter, \u201cor else, before the expiration of the same time, publication of the summons must be commenced, or service thereof must be made without the state, pursuant to an order obtained therefor, as prescribed in chapter fifth of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-19\">It will be noticed that this does not provide for the case of substituted service on a resident defendant who cannot be found, or who avoids service, as prescribed by section 435 of chapter 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-20\">Section 1674 provides that if the plaintiff after filing the notice \u201cunreasonably neglects to proceed in the action, the court may, in its discretion,\u201d direct the notice to be cancelled \u201cupon the application of any person aggrieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-21\">These two sections are to be read together, and the remedy of a person aggrieved by failure to serve the summons is under the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>(Cohen v. Ratowsky, 43 App. Div. 196, 59 N. Y. Supp. 344), and \u201cthe court may, in its discretion,\u201d cancel the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The learned justice below exercised his discretion properly in denying the motion. The moving defendant professes to be aggrieved that he has not been served with the summons, but the reason is that neither he nor his place of residence can be found, and he refuses to disclose it. His default having been taken on this motion, the attorney for the plaintiff offered to open it if the attorney who appears for the said defendant specially for the purposes of this motion would give him the residence of the said defendant, but he refused. Let the said defendant give his residence, or else appear in the action, and he will no longer be \u201caggrieved.\u201d He is the sole cause of his being aggrieved. The plaintiff has exercised due diligence in trying to find him.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">HOOKER, J., concurs. HIRSCHBERG, P. J., and RICH and MIDLER, JJ., concur In result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
