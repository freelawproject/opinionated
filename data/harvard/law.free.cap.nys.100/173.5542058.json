The defendant entered into a contract with one or more contractors for the erection of one or more buildings, among whom was one Assip, who sublet certain of the steelwork to one Hoff, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor. While the work was in progress\u2014about July 1, 1903\u2014before, as Hoff says, \u201chardly any\u201d of the work had been done or materials furnished, Hoff had a conversation with defendant, at the building upon which he was working, in which he told the defendant that he did not feel safe in regard to his payments, and did not care to go on with the work without an understanding that he (defendant) would guaranty his payment, to which the defendant replied, \u201cAll right, Mr. Hoff; if that is the case, I will see that you are paid.\u201d Between that time and the completion of the work, on September 17th, Hoff spoke to the defendant several times with reference to payment for his work, and was told, \u201cDon\u2019t fear, Mr. Hoff; I will take care of you,\u201d and that \u201che will see that I get it.\u201d This agreement and conversation, testified to by Hoff, were not denied or in any manner controverted by the defendant, who was sworn as a witness in his own behalf upon the trial. The plaintiff completed his work on the faith of this agreement. He had no communication with Assip, did no work for him, and furnished him no materials after the conversation with defendant about July 1st. There was a balance due and unpaid Hoff upon his contract of $271.05. which he subsequently assigned to the plaintiff, who brought this action to recover the same as on an original undertaking. This evidence, wholly uncontradicted, from a witness in no wise impeached, the trial court was not at liberty to disregard (Littlefield v. Lawrence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>83 App. Div. 327, 82 N. Y. Supp. 25), and it established a valid and enforceable contract. Mannetti v. Doege, 48 App. Div. 567, 62 N. Y. Supp. 918, and authorities therein cited; Breen v. Isaacs (Sup.) 96 N. Y. Supp. 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">HIRSCHBERG, P; J., and HOOKER and MILDER, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b197-6\">GAYNOR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8z\">(dissenting). The justice gave the right judgment, it seems to me, viz., for defendant. Assip contracted with the defendant, the owner, to do work and furnish material in erecting a building. Hoff was a subcontractor in writing to Assip, and claimed of the defendant $271.05, the unpaid balance of his contract price with Assip. It not being paid, he assigned his claim to the plaintiff, who brought this action upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The facts are these: Hoff (plaintiff\u2019s assignor) entered upon his contract with Assip, and Assip paid him $400 for work and material on the contract\u2014all that was then due. Hoff then says he wanted to feel safe that he would be paid thereafter, and saw the defendant. He tells what the defendant said to him\u2014that he would see that he got his money\u2014that he would not pay it to Assip, but hold it back\u2014 that he would take care of it. He did no more than owners do every day, viz., promise to take care of subcontractors by holding their money from the contractor until he pays it. It will not do to pick out one sentence\u2014all must be taken. And the defendant kept his word. He held back the money from Assip, and with the latter\u2019s consent paid Hoff $500, leaving the balance sued for. That is not paid because a lien has been filed against Assip for more than that sum and more than is due Assip. When the plaintiff, after his contract was finished, talked to the defendant of filing a lien, the defendant did no more than renew his former promise to hold back the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">It seems to me the justice would have wronged the defendant by giving judgment against him.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
