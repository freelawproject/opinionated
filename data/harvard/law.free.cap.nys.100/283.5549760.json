Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-16\">The action was for damages to a tenant by breach of contract to repair by a landlord. The defendant let an entire building of five stories to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor by a written lease for a term of three years. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>lease provided that if the building \u201cshall be partially damaged by fire the same shall be repaired as speedily as possible at the expense of the party of the first part\u201d (the lessor), and that if the damage should be \u201cso extensive as to render the building untenantable,\u201d the rent should cease until the building was repaired. The tenant occupied the building for business purposes. A fire entirely destroyed the roof, and also burned holes through every floor. Next day the tenant notified the landlord of the damage to the building. The fire was on February 15th, and on February 21st there was a heavy rain which damaged the tenant\u2019s goods in the building. Neither landlord nor tenant had made any repairs in the meantime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARE\">The court excluded all evidence of damage to the tenant\u2019s goods by the rain. The plaintiff thereupon asked to withdraw a juror. The court refused, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff for six cents. The plaintiff offered evidence of no other damage.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b307-7\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

Such criticism was unfounded and out of place. It was for the tenant to protect his goods after the fire by covering them, moving them out, or by making the repairs himself at the landlord\u2019s expense. ' The law did not tie his hands. The law is not that he could neglect his goods, and recover of the landlord for damage done to them by the landlord\u2019s neglect to repair. Cook v. Soule, 56 N. Y. 420. Nor did the lease bind the landlord to repair; it only provided that the repairs should be done at his expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">The judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">Judgment and order affirmed,- with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
