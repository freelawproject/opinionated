This statement of nominations, forms of proxies, and certain instructions, with a stamped envelope, are to be mailed to each policy holder. The statute provides that the inclosures so mailed shall be approved by the superintendent of insurance before being mailed. This does not recognize any authority in him to change the nominations, or authorize him to make any different statement of the nominees than the ones filed. Chapter 354 of the Laws of 1906 provides that the election shall be under the supervision of the superintendent of insurance. This does not purport to give him any authority to change the nominations as made. There is no provision made in the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>for changing a nomination \u25a0 after it is made, except in case of the death or incapacity of a nominee.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">In Dental Society v. Jacobs, 103 App. Div. 86, 92 N. Y. Supp. 590, it was held by this court that a public officer cannot by mandamus be compelled to change a record in his office, except in cases where it: is expressly authorized by statute. This court cannot, therefore, compel the superintendent of insurance to.change the record of nominations filed with him. Neither can it require the company to send a different statement of nominations to the policy holders than that required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The order appealed from is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
