Perpetuities\u2014Suspension oe Alienation\u2014Real Property</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b602-4\">Testator\u2019s will provided in the third clause that his two sons should have the privilege of purchasing testator\u2019s interest in a certain partnership at a valuation of $5,000, which purchase price should be treated as a bequest to them. By the fifth clause it was provided that whatever sums of money the testator's trustees might see fit to pay over to testator\u2019s children, should be given to his four daughters until the sum received by each should equal half the purchase price paid by the sons for the interest in the business, from which time the surplus should be distributed equally between the children. The seventh clause directed the trustees to collect the rents and to apply the net income of one-sixth to the use of each child during his life, on the death of any child the property of such one-sixth to go to the child\u2019s heirs or testamentary appointee. The sons elected to take the business. It was contended that a trust was created invalid as suspending the power of alienation over real estate for more than two lives in being. <em>Held, </em>that the contention was without merit, since the seventh clause created Valid separable trust estates, and while the fifth clause was invalid so far as it directed the accumulation of income, effect could be given to its intent, in which view each child took a life interest in one-sixth, under the seventh clause of the will, but the sons having received $2,500, the income of the share held in trust for each of them should first be applied in bringing about equalization.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b602-5\">Appeal from Special Term, New York County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-6\">Suit by Johanna Fischer- against Julia Langlotz and others.

It is my express wish that my above trustees shall not be held to furnish security or give bonds for the carrying out of the provisions of this will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b603-10\">The following is the opinion of the court below by Leventritt, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-11\">\u201cThis is an action in partition involving a single piece of real estate, The construction of the will is incidental to the main relief sought It is incumbent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>on the plaintiff tt&gt; establish, under section 1537 of the Code, that the apparent devise of this realty is void. Whatever may be said of the other clauses of the will it is clear from the instrument itself, as well as from the meager testimony adduced on the trial, that the property here in question passes under the seventh clause of the will which creates perfectly valid separable trust estates for the life of each of the testator\u2019s children with remainders over to their children in the absence of an exercise of the power of appointment. Vanderpoel v. Loew, 112 N. Y. 167, 19 N. E. 481. This seventh clause disposes of all of the testator\u2019s realty while the eighth makes disposition by precisely similar trusts of all the testator\u2019s personalty. The fifth clause of the will is doubtless confusing. If there is any inconsistency\u2014 and it might plausibly be argued that there is a double disposition of income\u2014the later clauses together disposing of all the testator\u2019s property should control. The duty always cast upon the court to sustain a will if possible, is rendered all the more imperative in this case where the testator\u2019s intent is not only clear but was capable of effectuation without resort to any complicated testamentary devices. The testator desired that each of his six children should share equally in his estate. He wished, however, to have his two sons continue his business and provided that in the event that they elected to take it over, his interest be valued at $5,000 and that then each of his daughters should first receive $2,500 to equalize the shares before there should be any further distribution. The contingent gift of the business to the sons precedes any of the trust provisions and it seems clear that it was his purpose that, at their election, they should have the business in any event. It seems most anomalous, however, to say that the exercise of that election should make invalid a will otherwise good. Had the sons not taken over the business no possible question, save an academic one, could arise under this instrument. I find no such compelling necessity because they have elected. While the fifth clause, so far as it directs an accumulation of income, is invalid, effect can be given to its clearly disclosed intent when read in connection with the seventh and eighth clauses disposing of all the testator\u2019s property. That is to say resort may be had to it to discover and apply intent. In this view each child takes a life interest in one-sixth but the sons, each having received $2,500 by virtue of having taken over the business, the income of the share held in trust for each of them should first be applied in bringing about equalization. The testimony shows that has in effect already been accomplished. In any event as to each one-sixth as it passes under the seventh clause of the will, there is a suspension for but a single life. I am of the opinion that the complaint should be dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b604-3\">Argued before O\u2019BRIEN, P.
