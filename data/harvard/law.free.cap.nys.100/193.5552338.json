This the commission did not do. Instead of plainly reporting that the defendant was insane or not it wrote what it calls an opinion \u201cper curiam\u201d which leaves the matter referred to them in a state of confusion. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The order should be reversed and the defendant discharged from the lunatic asylum and delivered over to the custody and confinement whence he came.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and defendant discharged \" from the lunatic asylum, and delivered over to the custody and confinement whence he came.
