The defendant has not appealed from the order granting the alternative writ. The order must therefore stand, but be modified by striking therefrom the provision as to waiver of back salary, and as so modified affirmed, without costs in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-19\">By this decision we do not assume to pass upon relator\u2019s rights, or to change in any manner our ruling in People ex rel. Michaels v. Ahearn as President, etc. (Sup.). 98 N. Y. Supp. 492.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
