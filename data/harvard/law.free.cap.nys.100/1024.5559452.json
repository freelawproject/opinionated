Construing the complaint with the liberality which should be accorded pleadings in the Municipal Court, it will be found to allege in effect that the defendant wrongfully, unlawfully, and knowingly caused a notice of mechanic\u2019s lien against plaintiff\u2019s property to be filed in the clerk\u2019s office of New York county upon a fictitious claim, thereby delaying the work on a building in process of construction, resulting in the loss of a month\u2019s rental of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-18\">The appellant urges that the action is one to recover damages for \u201can injury to property\u201d and that jurisdiction of such an action is conferred upon the Municipal Court by subdivision 14, \u00a7 1, Municipal Court Act, Laws 1902, p. .1489, c. 580. At first blush it might appear that the term \u201cinjury to property\u201d included only some physical injury to tangible property, but it is defined by. subdivision 10 of section 3343 of the Code of Civil Procedure to be \u201can actionable act, whereby the estate of another is lessened, other than a personal injury, or the breach of a contract.\u201d It is plain from this definition that the expression \u201cinjury to property,\u201d as used in the act, is to be given a broad and unrestricted meaning, so as to include every invasion of one\u2019s property rights by actionable wrong, and the decisions in this state have quite uniformly construed the expression in this manner. Buckley v. Mayor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>30 App. Div. 463-466, 52 N. Y. Supp. 452; Stewart v. Lyman, 62 App. Div. 182-185, <em>70 </em>N. Y. Supp. 936; Bogart v. Dart, 25 Hun, 395; Weiller v. Schreiber, 63 How. Prac. 491; Cleveland v. Barrows, 59 Barb. 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The only question left for consideration, then, is whether the complaint. states a cause of action; i. e., is the wrong alleged to have been done the plaintiff actionable ? The respondent urges that the complaint is to be construed as an ineffectual attempt to allege a cause of action either for slander of title, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution, but it is not necessary to denominate the cause of action by any particular name other than as an action on the case for wrongful injury to property. If the law affords no redress for such an injury as is alleged in the complaint, then the most serious and wanton injury may be inflicted with, impunity. No reason is suggested by the respondent, except his inability to classify it, for asserting that no cause of -action is alleged. We think the complaint states a cause of action for injury to property, that the Municipal Court has jurisdiction, and that the complaint was improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">The judgment must, therefore, be reversed, and a new trial ordered, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
