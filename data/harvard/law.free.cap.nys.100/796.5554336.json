Defendant made a motion for a bill of particulars, which motion was denied, and from the order entered thereon this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The defendant, having denied the making of the written contract alleged in the complaint or any knowledge of the terms thereof, is entitled to a copy thereof. Rhodes v. Adams, 113 App. Div. 304, 98 N. Y. Supp. 913. Plaintiff having alleged special damages in the complaint by reason of its inability to perform contracts made upon faith of the agreement with the defendant, the defendant is entitled to a bill of particulars giving the names and addresses of the parties who are alleged to have made contracts with it. Mussinan v. Willner Wood Co., 69 App. Div. 448, 74 N. Y. Supp. 1026. \u201cThe defendant was entitled to have a bill of particulars for a special damage claimed to have been sustained by the plaintiff.\u201d Royle v. Goodwin, 98 App. Div. 95, 90 N. Y. Supp. 142. Therefore the plaintiff should be required to give the names of the persons, firms, or corporations to whom it alleges it sold and agreed to deliver box straps, and with whom it engaged to sell box straps, as set forth in paragraphs 3, 4, 7, and 8, and a statement of the items of damage sustained, as set forth in paragraph 9 of the complaint, as to the orders it was unable to fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and a motion granted as indicated, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
