The bill of particulars served specified as one of the.items for which defendant asked a judgment that between October 30,1897, and June 16, 1900, 141 weeks, the defendant expended on account of the plaintiff $10 a week for theaters, meals, etc., and as another item he.expended for plaintiff for trips and excursions $2 per week during four months each year, five seasons, about $1,400. He alleges in his affidavit, in opposition to the motion, that these were running disbursements for railroad fares and at theaters and hotels; that no itemized account of the disbursements were ever kept, and defendant is unable to furnish a detailed statement of the amount included in those items, and on account of the circumstances under which these disbursements were made, it is impossible for him to specify them more particularly than he has in the bill of particulars furnished. If the defendant is required to give these particulars, it would result in defeating his claim for reimbursement. There was no affidavit submitted by the plaintiff which denies that the defendant actually advanced money for the purpose mentioned, except the reply to the counterclaim, and if such advances were actually made the plaintiff must have as much information about them as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">I think that the bill of particulars furnished, containing all the information that the defendant could give, was sufficient, and consequently the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for a further bill of particulars denied. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
