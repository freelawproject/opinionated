Under these circumstances we think it is the duty of the court to suppress the commission, and to leave the party who desires to avail himself of the testimony of the assignor of his claim to such relief as he may procure upon an application for a new commission at the special term. The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to suppress the commission granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
