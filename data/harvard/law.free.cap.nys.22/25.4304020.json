Dodge and others against Henry A. Ockerhausen to recover on two promissory notes for $500 and $519, respectively, given by defendant to plaintiffs in renewal of a certain other note, for $1-019. The note for $1,019 had been given by defendant to Keely &amp; Son for work done by them on \u00e1 building. Keely &amp; Son, being indebted to plaintiffs in this amount for lumber used in defendant\u2019s buildings, indorsed the note to plaintiffs. When the note became due the renewal notes were given directly to plaintiffs by defendant. Plaintiffs had judgment, which was entered on a verdict directed by the court. Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AbKN\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Argued before BARNARD, P.

If, at the time it was made, any counterclaim existed against the payee, in favor of the maker, it did not attach to the note. That passed to the indorsees free from any set-off. If Keely &amp; Son had a cause of action against plaintiff for delay in delivering the lumber, they have it yet. There is no evidence that it has been transferred by them to this defendant. The court below correctly held that there was no question for the jury. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
