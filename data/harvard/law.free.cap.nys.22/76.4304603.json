If the appellant had stipulated, on the motion for reference, to withdraw his claim on a quantum meruit, and rely solely on the allegation of a promise to pay, no proof of the items would have been necessary. The plaintiff may not be able to prove the promise, and then can prove the items of the account. The order of reference was therefore properly made. Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
