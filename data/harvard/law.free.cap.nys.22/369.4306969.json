Stocking, 6 Hill, 314, 318. The petition alleges a verbal letting on or about the 1st November, 1892, \u201cfor the term of one month.\u201d The proof was of an oral lease, in April, from month to month, \u201cso long as he would pay the rent.\u201d The evidence failed to sustain the petition. Romeyn v. Sickles, 108 N. Y. 650, 652, 15 N. E. Rep. 698. Waiving the discrepancy between the pleading and proof, still it appears the petitioner miscarried in making a case for an order of dispossession. As to the notice requisite in summary proceedings the distinction is between tenancies for a month and tenancies from month to month; in the former no notice being necessary, while in the latter the formal notice is indispensable. Wilson v. Taylor, 8 Daly, 256; Geiger v. Braun, 6 Daly, 506; Anderson v. Prindle, 23 Wend. 616. Assuming, as held in some cases,\u2014Ludington v. Garlock, (Sup.) 9 N. Y. Supp. 24, and citations,\u2014 that notice be not requisite in simple tenancies from month to month, here was something more, namely, a letting from month to month, \u201cso long as the rent was paid.\u201d These qualifying words, in effect, make the term indefinite, and entitle the tenant to hold so long as he pays the rent, or until he receives a month\u2019s notice to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-17\">The order reversed, with costs, and restitution directed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
