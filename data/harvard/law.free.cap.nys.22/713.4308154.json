The appellants\u2019 counsel contends that the same should be reversed on several grounds, but we are unable to agree with his propositions for the following reasons: We think a contractor can file a valid mechanic\u2019s lien for the whole contract price before all the work is done, or all the materials furnished, provided the balance of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>is thereafter fully completed, according to the terms thereof. Laws 1885, c. 342, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4; Van Clief v. Van Vechten, 130 N. Y. 571, 29 N. E. Rep. 1017. In our opinion, the plaintiff was regular in first suing and recovering judgment against the owner, and, being unable to collect the same, then in suing the sureties on the bond given to discharge the lien, though we do not feel called upon to decide whether or not the bondsmen could have been made parties to the first action. The first action having been brought within a year from the date when the mechanic\u2019s lien was filed, it was not discharged by lapse of time. Section 24, subd. 4. Then, again, in section 24, subd. 6, it seems to have been contemplated that the liability of the sureties should be predicated upon a judgment recovered on the mechanic\u2019s lien against the owner. Lawson v. Beilly, 13 Civil Proc. B. 290. It is very questionable whether appellants can complain for the first time on appeal that the action was not brought against the sureties within a year from the date of filing the lien, when they raised no such question on their motion to dismiss, or by suitable requests for findings before the trial court. If any such question had been suggested before the trial court, it might have been met by showing an order of the court extending the time to bring the action. Section 24, subd. 4. It is true that plaintiffs agreed, in consideration of the assignment of an alleged claim of $2,000, and the payment thereof to them, to release the sureties from their obligation, but the assignment was never made, and no payment was ever made, and, as a consequence, the sureties were not released.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
