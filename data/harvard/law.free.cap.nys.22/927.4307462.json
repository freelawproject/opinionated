The plaintiff, on trial, offered and had marked in evidence an agreement or certificate No. 2,699, signed by said firm, and by them delivered to him when he made the first payment of $5 in June, and which provided, among other things, that \u201con payment of $5 as a first installment, and of further twenty monthly installments of $5 each, payable at our office, oh the first day of each month, we agree to deliver to bearer the following five original bonds, to wit:\u201d and this agreement further provides that \u201cby accepting this certificate the buyer signifies his consent to the conditions therein contained, and cannot thereafter rescind his agreement thereunder.\u201d The proof shows that he paid six other installments of $5 each in the next succeeding six months, and that upon each of such payments he received from the firm a receipt as follows: \u201cBeceived from Adam Martin five dollars as second payment on certificate No. 2,699;\u201d and so on as to the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh installments paid by him. This action is to recover these seven payments as money received by said firm to the use of plaintiff, and there is no allegation of fraud or mistake. However, the plaintiff was allowed, against defendant\u2019s objection, to introduce evidence of the sayings of the firm, when this agreement No. 2,699 and the other similar one was delivered to plaintiff, as follows: \u201cHe said that I should keep them, and pay him $5 on each; and I said \u2018What for?\u2019 and he said that they were lotteries, and that if I paid $5 apiece I should get my money back. I told him that I did not want them, and he said, \u2018You be sure and keep them, and you will be sure of your money.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff took them in June, and then paid first installment, and continued to pay the monthly installments for six months thereafter, keeping the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>ments of sale meantime, and producing them on trial. It is conceded by plaintiff that these bonds, sold on this installment plan, are authorized by the decisions of the court of appeals. The plaintiff was properly nonsuited at trial, and the judgment is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
