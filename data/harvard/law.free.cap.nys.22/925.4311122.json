The only evidence of this was that one of plaintiffs testified that he told defendant\u2019s husband that he would supply the lumber if it could be charged to defendant, and her husband said she agreed to it. He also testified, \u2018T can\u2019t swear to anything about Ms wife, any more than what he told me.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that defendant was entitled to a nonsuit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b945-10\">2. Same\u2014Indorsement.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b945-11\">It appeared that one of the makers induced defendant to indorse the note. He testified that he told defendant that plaintiffs wished to discount the note, that they couldn\u2019t do it with Ms \u00f1ame; that he asked her to indorse it, and she did so. It appeared that the note was discounted by a bank for plaintiffs, <em>Sdd, </em>that the proof did not show that defendant indorsed the note to give the makers credit with plaintiffs, but she was only second indorser, and not liable to payees, the first indorsers.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b945-12\">Appeal from trial term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b945-13\">Action by Ephraim C.

Gates &amp; Co., the plaintiffs, sue Mrs. Williams, the defendant, upon a note made by Fritz &amp; Hafner to the order of Gates &amp; Co., and indorsed by h\u00e9r before delivery to them, and their complaint recognizes that from the instrument itself the presumption of law is that she intended to become liable simply as a second indorser, (Coulter v. Richmond, 59 N. Y. 481,) for it is further alleged therein that this note was made and indorsed and delivered to them as so indorsed for the purpose of paying for building materials furnished by them to her. Except for this latter allegation, the complaint would have been demurrable; hence the plaintiffs\u2019 cause was maintainable only upon proof thereof-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>And upon this theory the case was tried, but they failed to prove by legal evidence that they had furnished the materials to her, or upon her credit, for their only proof upon this question was that of their Mr. Barnard, who testified: \u201cI told him [her husband] I was willing to supply the lumber if we could charge it to Mrs. Williams, * * * and he said she agreed to it;\u201d and, continuing, he testified, \u201cI can\u2019t swear to anything about his wife, any more than what he told me.\u201d This evidence was taken against defendant\u2019s objection, and allowed upon the statement of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, \u201cWe will show that she ratified it.\u201d However, the proof does not show that she ratified it, nor does it show any authority by her husband to act for her. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case the defendant was entitled to a nonsuit, and her motion to dismiss, then made, should have been granted, instead of denied. The defendant\u2019s proof in no way closes these gaps in plaintiffs\u2019 proof as to ratification by her and authority by her husband, for they both testify that he had no such authority, and that she had never agreed to have the lumber charged to her. The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the merits at the close of the case should have been granted. The plaintiffs insist, however, that, although their complaint did not allege that Mrs. Williams indorsed the note under an agreement to give the makers credit with the payees, these plaintiffs still claim that the proof shows that she indorsed it under such an agreement. But such is not the proof, for Mr. Robinson, plaintiffs\u2019 collector, who conducted the negotiations as to this indorsement, testifies: \u201cI don\u2019t know what was said to Mrs. Williams when she signed this note. I represented to her husband that we wanted to get money on the note at a bank. I wanted to get it in the right shape, so it could be negotiated.\u201d And Mr. Fritz, who really induced Mrs. Williams to indorse the note, testifies: \u201cI can repeat my exact words in asking Mrs. Williams to indorse this note. I told Mrs. Williams that Gates &amp; Co. wanted to raise money on the note, and they couldn\u2019t do it with my name; and I asked her if she wouldn\u2019t be kind enough to indorse that note, so they could have it discounted; and she did so.\u201d It is in proof that the note was discounted by a bank for plaintiffs, (th\u00e9 payees,) and protested for nonpayment, and subsequently taken up and now held by plaintiffs. This proof does not show that Mrs. Williams indorsed the note for the purpose of giving the makers credit with the payees, but rather that she indorsed it to give the payees credit with the bank of discount, and certainly does not overcome the well-settled presumption of law that a person making such an indorsement intended to become liable only as a second indorser, and that on the face of the paper, without explanation, she is to be regarded as second indorser, and, of course, not liable upon the note to the payee, who is supposed to be the first indorser. Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
