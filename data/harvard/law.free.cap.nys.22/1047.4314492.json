And again, I do not know that the type was of a kind that it would be likely to reveal its meaning to persons sitting in the car. I noticed that the chief inspector, or perhaps the inspector, who was on the stand when the card was presented to him, in order to read it, or to see anything about it that would indicate to him what it was, had to put his spectacles on.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1068-9\">Section 46 of the general railroad act, under which the defendant contended that plaintiff must be nonsuited, is as follows: \u201cIn case any passenger on any railroad shall be injured while on the platform of a car, or on any baggage, wood, or freight car, in violation of the printed regulations of the company, posted up at the time in a conspicuous place inside of its passenger cars then in the train, such company shall not he liable for the injury, provided, such company at the time furnished room inside of its passenger cars sufficient for the proper accommodation of its passengers.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1068-10\">Argued before DTTGRO and GILDERSLEEVE, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1068-11\">Root &amp; Clarke, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1068-12\">Redington &amp; Mayor, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1068-13\">DTTGRO, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6K3\">This is an appeal from a judgmeht entered upon a verdict. The trial judge did. not' err in refusing to allow in evidence that entry in the police blotter. It was not admissible as proof of' what the plaintiff said, for it was not the best evidence. That of McLaughlin was certainly better. It Avas not admissible to contradict McLaughlin, as his attention had not been called to the statements therein, and it was not admissible to corroborate McLaughlin, as for this it was but hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-14\">There was no error requiring mrersal in the charge or refusals to charge. That part of the charge which referred to the lack of evidence of notice was not erroneous, for it did not appear that the notice was posted up or placed where it could be seen by the plaintiff. The only evidence upon the point is that \u201cit was on both sides of the inside of the car, about the center of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>the car.\u201d As the evidence showed that the seats of the car were filled, and persons were standing up, it became material to know with more particularity than is disclosed by the evidence just where the alleged notice was, in order that the jury could say whether or not it was a notice to the plaintiff, or should be considered as such. It does not appear that, with the seats filled, the alleged notice was visible, and a guess is not permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">The refusal to charge defendant\u2019s request \u201cthat, proof having been given that the notice required by the general railroad act was posted in the car on which the accident to the plaintiff happened, and that plaintiff was riding upon the front platform and was upon the step of the car when injured,\u201d etc., was not error, as the defendant had not pleaded the facts which would entitle it to the exemption which it claims that the act in question allows. The evidence required the submission of the questions of negligence and contributory negligence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">Upon the whole case the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
