The action was heard before the court and a jury, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, on the 25th day of October, 1892, for the sum of $500. Judgment was entered thereon on the 26th day of October, 1892. An order was entered denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.

The Court: I decline so to charge.\u201d The request was to charge that driving \u201cfast, as testified to on the trial,\u201d was not sufficient to establish negligence. The only evidence on the trial as to the rate of speed defendant\u2019s driver was driving is that of the plaintiff, who testified \u201cthat he [defendant\u2019s driver] was driving fast.\u201d Ernest Deltz, <em>a </em>witness on the part of the plaintiff, testified that \u201cthe Adams Express wagon was being driven so rapidly as to attract my attention.\u201d And: \u201cI do not think it took me a second to get up to him. He was going at a pretty fair gait. Running, it would take me about eight seconds to get from iny house,\u201484 to 78. At the time of the accident, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>I was where 78 is, on the ground, on the sidewalk. The first thing I saw was this Adams Express wagon going by me at 86. I went to 75, and stood, and saw the accident, and then ran after the Adams Express wagon, and stopped at opposite 76. I am certain of it. Will swear to that.\u201d And \u201cthat the Adams Express wagon was not going very fast.\u201d And: \u201cQuestion. And, at the time he struck, Adams Express wagon was being driven rapidly? Answer. Yes.\u201d Defendant\u2019s witness Henry Carey testified that \u201cthe rate of speed at which the Adams Express wagon was going was nothing extra,\u201d and, on cross-examination, that \u201cthe express wagon was traveling, not anything slow, but at a fair gait, too.\u201d Defendant\u2019s witness Charles O\u2019Rourke, the driver, testified; \u201cI was going up Stanton street at a pretty slow gait.\u201d Henry Manning, a witness for defendant, testified that \u201cthe express wagon was not going fast at all, but on an ordinary trot.\u201d There was no evidence to show that defendant\u2019s driver was driving at an unlawful rate of speed. We think that it was error on the part of the trial justice in refusing to charge as requested, and that the request was a proper one, as it bore on a material question in the case, namely, the negligence of the defendant\u2019s driver, as evidence was given on the part of plaintiff as to the rate of speed defendant\u2019s wagon was being driven, and we cannot say whether it did or did not mislead; but such refusal may have misled the jury upon that particular point, inasmuch, if they believed the testimony of the witnesses as to the rate of speed the wagon was being driven, as such might have affected the minds of the jury, .and led them to bring in their verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Even had the evidence been clear that defendant\u2019s wagon was being driven fast, that fact alone was not sufficient to support any finding of negligence on the part of the defendant, unless the wagon had been driven .atan unlawful rate of speed,\u2014a rate of speed forbidden by law or ordinance,\u2014in which case there would be a presumption of negligence \u2022on the part of the driver. In Crocker v. Ice Co., 92 N. Y. 652, the evidence was that the driver was driving the team at \u201ca lively trot.\u201d The court sajr:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">\u201cIt cannot be held, as a matter of law or fact, that merely driving at the rate of speed stated, in the streets of a city, is negligence. Persons driving in the \u25a0streets of a city are not limited to any particular rate of speed. They may drive slow or fast, but they must use proper care and prudence, so as'not to cause injury to other persons lawfully upon the streets. There was no proof in this case, or at least not sufficient proof for submission to the jury, that the team was \u25a0 driven carelessly, or that the driver was negligent. <em>\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The judgment and order herein appealed from must be reversed, and \u25a0 a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant, to abide the event. All \u25a0 concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
