June 8, 1886, letters of administration on his estate were duly granted by the surrogate\u2019s court of the city and county of New York to William T. Ward, who afterwards, with James M. Baldwin and William H. Bowden,' executed and filed the usual admimstrator\u2019s bond. On the same date\u2014June 8, 1886\u2014 said Ward was duly appointed by said surrogate\u2019s court the general guardian of the estate of said Marie Carleton. Ward entered upon the discharge of Ms duties as administrator and as guardian, and continued until June 19, 1890, when he was removed from both positions by said court. On the 9th of March, 1891, George L. Prentiss, the plaintiff, was appointed by said court general guardian of the estate of said infant in the place and stead of Ward removed, and on the same day executed the usual guardian\u2019s bond. No administrator has been appointed in the place of Ward, removed, of the estate of William Carleton. December 31, 1890, Ward filed in said court an account as administrator, by wMch it appears that he then had on hand $3,413.87 in cash belonging to the estate. This account was never judicially settled. March 23, 1891, Ward filed a final account as administrator in said court, showing that he had in his hands $3,503 in money belonging to the estate, wMch, on the 2d of July, 1891, was adjusted and settled by said court. Ward \"was allowed $212.70 for commissions and counsel fees, and was directed to pay to a creditor $150 in satisfaction of a claim. These sums, deducted from $3,503, left $3,140.30 in his hands, which he was directed to pay over to George L. Prentiss, general guardian of the infant. Thereupon a judgment was docketed for the amount, on wliich an execution was issued in December, 1891, wMch was returned wholly unsatisfed. TMs action was brought on the administration bond against William T. Ward, the principal, (though not so described in the bond,) and against James M. Bald win and William H. Bowden, the sureties, (though they were not described as such in the bond,) to recover $3,140.30, wMch Ward, as administrator, was directed by the decree of the surrogate\u2019s court to pay to the plaintiff. Bowden alone defended the action, wMch resulted in a judgment May 26, 1892. On July 8, 1892, Bowden died, and the action was subsequently continued against his executors by order of the court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b702-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

The decree of the surrogate\u2019s court directed the administrator to pay over to George L. Prentiss, general guardian of the estate of Marie Carleton, $3,140.30, upon Ms giving the security required by section 2746 of the Code. TMs brings the case witMn the section, wMch expressly authorizes a general guardian to maintain the action. The decree was not in favor of a guardian ad litem, and the action could not have been maintained by one. November 27, 1891, the plaintiff executed a bond pursuant to section 2746 and the decree, wMch perfected the plaintiff\u2019s right to bring tMs action. The body of the bond is contained in the case, but the record does not show that it was \u201capproved by the surrogate,\u201d as required by the section last cited. The answer to tMs is that no such question was raised on the trial of the action. The bond, as printed, does not appear to have been acknowledged, but its admission in evidence was not objected to on tMs or any other ground. The fact that an acknowledgment and an approval are not printed as a part of the record does not prove their nonexistence. The original bond, being a record, can be received in evidence on tMs appeal for the purpose of sustaining the judgment. Wines v. Mayor, etc., 70 N. Y. 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">There is nothing in the position that a new administrator should have been appointed, who should have brought the action. The decedent\u2019s estate was finally settled, and there \"was no occasion for the appointment of a new administrator. By the decree the liability of the administrator to tMs plaintiff was established, and Ms right of action was perfect.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Section 2609<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Code provides that an action brought thereunder shall be by leave of the surrogate. That section does not relate to actions Eke the one at bar, but to actions brought \u201cby any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>persons aggrieved, * * * in behalf of himself and all others interested.\u201d The defendant urged on the trial that the surrogate\u2019s decree was procured through the fraud and collusion of Ward, the administrator, and this plaintiff, and for that reason was not binding on the administrator\u2019s sureties. Upon an examination of the record we are of the opinion that there is not sufficient evidence of collusion to have justified the submission of the question to the jury. The administrator filed two accounts,\u2014the first, December 1, 1890, which showed an indebtedness to the estate of $3,413.87; the second account, upon which the decree was made, was filed in March, 1891, by which the administrator charged himself with $3,503. The difference\u2014$89.13\u2014is accounted for by the amount charged for counsel fee, which was stated in the first account as $500, and in the second account the item was stated and allowed at $410.87. There is no claim that the first account was not voluntary, and made by the administrator in entire good faith. The point that the surrogate could not finally settle the accounts of the removed administrator without appointing a new one is not well taken. Section 2693<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was not intended to be mandatory, as is clearly shown by section 2609. When an estate has been fully administered, as in the case at bar, the surrogate\u2019s court is not required to go through with the needless formality of appointing an administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">It is also urged that the appointment of the plaintiff as general guardian was illegal, because the letters do not show, on their face, that a citation was issued to the person (Ward) formerly appointed general guardian. The petition in the proceedings resulting in the appointment stated all the necessary facts, and prayed that a citation be issued to Ward, the late guardian, to show cause, etc. It was prepared in January, 1891, but the case does not show when it was filed. The plaintiff was appointed March 9, 1891, so that there was ample time for the service, and return of the citation. The mere fact that the issuing of a citation is not recited in the letters is not proof that a citation was not issued and served. A further answer to this point is that it was not taken on the trial below. If it had been, it might have been obviated by producing the citation. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.
