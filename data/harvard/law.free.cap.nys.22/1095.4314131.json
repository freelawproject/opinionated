We are aware of no way in which the court can acquire jurisdiction of infants except by action brought on behalf of the infant by a guardian ad litem, or by the service of a summons, as prescribed by the Code, upon the infant. A general guardian has no power to submit a cause of action, either on behalf of or against an infant, so as to give the court jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the rights of the infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-16\">This attempted submission must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
