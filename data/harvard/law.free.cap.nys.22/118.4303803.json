J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADn\">We see no reason for interfering with the order made by the court below. It does not appear that any harm can come of the production of the letter in question. If it is material to any of the issues involved in the suit, then the plaintiff is clearly entitled to an inspection; if it is immaterial, then no harm is done by allowing an inspection thereof. We think therefore, that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
