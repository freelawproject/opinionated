The defendant answered the complaint on November 21, 1889. The action first appeared upon the day calendar on December 17, 1890, and it was then marked \u201cOff term.\u2019\u2019 It reappeared upon the day calendar on May 4,1891, and was passed several days in May, and reappeared in June. On June 11th, it was marked \u201cOff term\u201d by the presiding judge. Afterwards and in December, 1892, plaintiff moved to restore the case to the trial calendar,-and defendant moved for leave to file a supplemental and amended answer, alleging that on or about the 26th day of May, 1891, plaintiff executed and delivered to defendant, under seal, a release, duly acknowledged, of all claim and demand on the part of the plaintiff set up, in the complaint, and from any and all claims and demands by him against this defendant. On December 24, 1892, the court (BISCHOFF, J.)made the following order, from which this appeal is taken: \u201cUpon reading and filing the plaintiff\u2019s notice of motion herein, that this cause be restored to-the calendar of this court, and placed on the day calendar for trial on the first Tuesday in January, 1893, and the affidavit of Joseph Wamsley, sworn to December 22, 1892, thereto annexed, and the affidavit of J. Hampden Dougherty, sworn to December 21, 1892, and said motion having regularly come on to be heard before me on December 21, 1892, after hearing Mr. j. Wamsley, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, in favor of, aud Btessrs. Smith &amp; Dougherty, defendant\u2019s attorneys, in opposition thereto, ordered, that the said motion be, and the same is hereby, granted, upon plaintiff\u2019s attorney stipulating, in writing, to accept service of a supplemental and amended answer herein.

But we are of opinion that the order should have been granted on the condition of a stipulation by defendant to pay the taxable costs and disbursements to the date of the order. If the defendant will so stipulate, the order is affirmed; otherwise, it is-reversed. <em>No </em>costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
