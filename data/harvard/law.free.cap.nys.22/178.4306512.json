The complaint alleges that the defendant entered into an agreement with the plaintiff that he would furnish, at the time of passing title, a man competent and willing to make certain alterations on certain premises for $1,000, if plaintiff would enter into an executory agreement with defendant to purchase from the latter the said premises for $3,750, $200 thereof to be paid at the time of execution thereof; that plaintiff did enter into such executory contract to purchase the same, and paid $200 in cash; that plaintiff\" was ready and willing to take title, and pay the balance of purchase price at the time fixed in the contract, provided the defendant furnished a person competent and willing to do the work of alteration for $1,000; and that defendant refused to comply with his contract in this respect, to plaintiff\u2019s damage $500. This sets up a good cause of action, provided the entire contract is in writing, and, as there is no allegation that any part of it is not, it must be assumed that it is all in writing. Hurliman v. Seckendorf, (City Ct. Brook.) 18 N. Y. Supp. 756. It seems to us, in another view of the allegations, that a good cause of action can be fairly spelled out in the complaint, viz. that plaintiff was induced to enter into this executory contract for the purchase of the premises and the payment of $200, by his belief in and reliance upon the false and fraudulent representation, made by defendant, for the purpose of deceiving the plaintiff, that the specified alterations could be made for $1,000. Schumaker v. Mather, 133 N. Y. 590, 30 N. E. Rep. 755; McIntyre v. Buell, 132 N. Y. 192, 30 N. E. Rep. 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
