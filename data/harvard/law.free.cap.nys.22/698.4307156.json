Plaintiff made a motion for resettlement of an order dated February 6, 1893, reversing a judgment for plaintiff entered on a verdict, and an order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the minutes. Granted in part, and denied in part.</summary>\n<seealso data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b719-4\">For decision on appeal, see 211ST. Y.

Y. Supp. 941;) and the purport of respondent\u2019s present motion is to have the ground of reversal recited in the order entered upon our decision of the appeal. Such a recital is, however, not only unnecessary, (Goodwin v. Conklin, 85 N. Y. 21,) but also without authority, (Harris v. Burdett, 73 N. Y. 136,) and respondent\u2019s motion, in this respect, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The order of reversal should, however, be resettled by striking out the words, \u201cwith costs to abide the event,\u201d at the conclusion of the order, and inserting in lieu thereof the words, \u201cupon condition that appellant shall within twenty days after service of this order, with notice of entry thereof, pay to the respondent, or his attorney of record, the costs and disbursements of the last trial, to be taxed on notice; and, if such costs and disbursements be not so paid, then respondent may apply, on proof by affidavit that the costs and disbursements remain unpaid, for an order affirming the judgment and order appealed from, with costs.\u201d It does not appear from the record of this appeal that appellant protested in any manner against the submission of the case to the jury, and for the omission so to do it has been the invariable, and is the settled, practice of the courts at general term to impose payment of the costs of the former trial upon the party against whom the verdict was rendered, as a condition of granting a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the evidence, or the weight of the evidente, (Jackson v. Thurston, 3 Cow. 342; Bank v. Ives, 17 Wend. 501; Brown v. Bradshaw, 1 Duer, 192; Overing v. Russell, 28 How. Pr. 151; Bank v. Hoyt, 22 How. Pr. 478; North v. Sargent, <em>20 </em>How.

Woodburn, 27 Barb. 346;) and there does not appear to be any sufficient reason for departure from that practice in the present instance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
