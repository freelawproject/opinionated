The court, having jurisdiction of the proceedings, could entertain any motion by either party necessary to give efficacy thereto. The provisions of section 17, e. 140, of the Laws of 1850,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in regard to the company giving notice of confirmation, were enacted for the purpose of enforcing diligence upon the part of the corporation in bringing the proceedings to a conclusion, and to insure to the parties against whom the company was moving notice of the application for confirmation of a report. The company could not discontinue the proceeding without an application to the court, the court fixing such terms as it might deem proper as a condition of such discontinuance. It follows, therefore, that, unless the company desired to discontinue, the court might, upon motion of the property holder, give efficacy to the report of the commissioners by the confirmation of the same. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with SIR costs and disbursements.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Laws 1850, c. 140, \u00a7 17, relating to the confirmation of the report of the commissioners of appraisal in proceedings to condemn land for railroad purposes, is. as follows: \u201cSeel 17.
