The grantee entered into possession of the lot, resided thereon November 24, 1880, and continued to reside thereon until his death. He never parted with the. title, or any interest therein, until the execution of the instrument dated November 24, 1880. He died intestate April 16, 1881, leaving no descendants, but leaving several collateral relatives entitled to inherit any realty of which he died seised. Mary Ann Campbell was born March 18, 1847, and in 1853 she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>was adopted by Peter Broadfoot, and thereafter, and until her intermarriage with James W. Campbell on the 30th of April 1891, was called Mary Ann Broadfoot. The adoption was not in the mode provided by the statutes of this state, but she lived in the family with Peter Broadfoot until his death, and was treated as an adopted child. July 11, 1866, the wife of Peter Broad-foot died, and thereafter and until his death the adopted child lived with and cared for him, acting as his housekeeper and nurse, until his death. November 24, 1880, Broadfoot signed, sealed, and December 7, 1880, acknowledged, and delivered to Andrew Milligan, an instrument of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1022-5\">\u201cBroadway, Twenty-Fourth Ward, New York City, Nov. 24th, 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1022-6\">\u201cThis document setteth forth that I, Peter Broadfoot, in my seventy-seventh year, of sound mind and memory, do, in consideration \u00f3f the fact that pay adopted daughter, Mary Ann Broadfoot, has, since the death of my beloved wife,, been my housekeeper, and been most devoted and self-sacrificing in her efforts to minister to my wants and comfort, and by her uniform kindness and companionship has done much to make my life pleasant and enjoyable; and also in consideration of the fact that were she so minded she could, in law and equity, claim in compensation for her services to me from the year 1866 until the present time: Therefore, for these and other reasons, I do give, bequeath, and convey to my adopted daughter, the said Mary Ann Broadfoot, the house and lot of ground which we now occupy, together with the entire premises, and all the real and personal property of every kind and name, to have and to hold for her own personal use, and to dispose of in such manner and time as she may please.

City and County of New York, 3rd Ave., Cor. 9th St.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1022-12\">When this instrument was executed, it and the deed from Jarvis to Broad-foot were sealed in an envelope, and delivered to Milligan, with directions to deliver them to his adopted daughter after his funeral, which was done, and since which time she has remained in the peaceable possession of the lot, claiming title thereto in fee simple under the foregoing instrument, which was recorded May 3, 1881,. in the office of the register of the city and county of New York, in Book 1594 of Deeds, at page 346. December 29, 1892, the parties to this submission entered into a written executory contract, by which Mary Ann Campbell agreed to sell, and William Morgan agreed to purchase, the premises described in said deed for $5,000. One hundred dollars of the pinchase price was paid on the execution of the contract, and the remainder was agreed to be paid on the 13th day of January, 1893,' when Mary Ann Campbell was to convey an unincumbered estate in fee simple in the premises to Morgan. Between December 29, 1892, and January 13, 1893, Morgan necessarily expended $94.25 for an examination of the title, which was reported to be defective, and on that ground he refused to take the deed tendered.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1022-13\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

If the question is answered in the affirmative, judgment is to be rendered in her favor, that Morgan specifically perform his contract; but, if it is answered in the negative, judgment is to be rendered in his favor, against Mrs. Campbell, for $194.25, and interest thereon from January 13, 1893. The instrument was executed by the owner of the fee of the subject of the grant, a definite grantee is named, and the instrument has sufficient parties to- constitute a legal conveyance. The consideration recited is a valuable one, and sufficient to support a grant. The instrument contains sufficient words of conveyance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8j7\"><em>\u201cI </em>do give, bequeath, and convey to my adopted daughter, * * * to have and to hold for her own personal use, and to dispose of in such manner and time as she may please.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">This language carried the fee to the grantee named. The words \u201cgive and bequeath\u201d are surplusage, and do not affect the validity of the instrument as a conveyance, which is a deed, and not a will. The subject of the grant is described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-9\">\u201cThe house and lot of ground which we [the grantor and grantee] now occupy, together with the entire premises, ana all the real and personal property of every kind and name, to have and to hold for her own personal use, and to dispose of in such manner and time as she may please. A full description of the property herein conveyed will be found in the deeds accompanying this document, (except the personal,) which are signed and sealed in one package.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">This description is sufficiently definite to convey the title to the lot in question, as against the grantor and his heirs.

In the case last cited a deed was executed upon the stipulation \u201cthat the said deed shall not be delivered to Gideon R. [the grantee] during the life of Gideon [the grantor] and his wife, or either of them, but shall remain in the possession of Edward Herrendeen, of Farmington, or his executors, administrators, or assigns, to be delivered to the said Gideon B. Payne, his executors, administrators, or assigns, immediately after the decease of said Gideon Payne and Phebe, his wife, as a good and valid conveyance of all the lands therein contained.\u201d The deed was executed in November, 1839. The grantor died November 23, 1848. His wife, Phebe, died April 3, 1854. The grantor left a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>last will, by which he empowered his executors to \u201cconvey the real estate of which he should die seised.\u201d The executors, on the 22d of June, 1854, after the death of Phebe, granted the land described in the deed of November 25, 1889, to one Hathaway, who brought trespass against Gideon R. Payne. A judgment was recovered by the plaintiff at circuit, and affirmed by the general term, but was reversed by tifie court of appeals, where it was held that the delivery by Herrendeen to Gideon E.-Payne, after the death of the grantor and his wife, vested the title in the defendant. See, also, Nottbecker v. Wilks, 4 Abb. Pr. 315; Grymes v. Hone, 49 N. Y. 17-22; Hunter v. Hunter, 17 Barb. 25; Crain v. Wright, 36 Hun, 74, affirmed 114 N. Y. 307, 21 N. E. Rep. 401; 3 Washb. Real Prop. (4th Ed.) 301. The question submitted must be answered in the affirmative, and we hold that Mary Ann Campbell held the absolute fee of the land at the time she entered into the contract with Morgan, who must specifically perform his contract.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1024-5\">VAN BBTJNT, P.

That a deed may be delivered by a grantor to a stranger, to be delivered to grantee after death of grantor, such second delivery relating back to the first delivery,, seems to have been long settled.
