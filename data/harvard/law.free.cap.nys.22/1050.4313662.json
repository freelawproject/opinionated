(3) That said undertaking was thereafter duly approved, and said notice of lien canceled and discharged of record, pursuant to an order granted at a special term of the court of common pleas for the city and county of New York. (4) That thereafter, and on or about September 30, 1892, in a proceeding or action brought by plaintiff to-enforce said lien, judgment was rendered and entered against said property, in favor of the plaintiff, for the sum of $1,476.21. (5) That a copy of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>judgment, with notice o\u00a3 entry thereof on September 30,1892, was personally served on the defendants Conrad Muller, Jr., Anna Hauff, and Victor P. P. Erslev, on October 1, 1892, and on the defendant Edwin S. Updike, Sr., on October 3, 1892, accompanied by a written demand for the payment of the-amount thereof. (6) That the defendants Anna Hauff and Conrad Muller, Jr., have not paid the aforesaid judgment so rendered against said property, and no part thereof has been paid, and there is now due plaintiff on account thereof the sum of $1,467.21, with interest from September 30, 1892. Wherefore the plaintiff demands judgment against the defendants for the sum of $1,476.21, with interest from September 30, 1892, with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1071-5\">Argued before SEDGWICK, C.

The order is brought up for review by the notice of appeal. Unless the demurrer is clearly bad upon its face, it should not have been overruled upon the motion. The failure to state in the complaint the amount of the bond, the person to whom it was made, the court wherein the judgment was obtained, and that it was duly rendered, and other omissions, make the plaintiff\u2019s success upon a trial very doubtful. We are by no means certain that the demurrer is not good.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">Judgment reversed, with costs. Order reversed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
