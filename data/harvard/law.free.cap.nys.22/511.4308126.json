Newkirk formerly owned lands at North Rondout, now in city of Kingston. Four avenues or streets were laid out through said lands, (one of which is Second avenue, the street in question,) and a map made of the same. He (Newkirk) sold lots along said street, (Second avenue,) and gave deeds for same, which deeds referred to said map, and which lots were numbered and bounded in said deeds on Second avenue. The defendant, by a resolution of its common council, introduced by an alderman in the ward in \"which Second avenue is located, ordered and caused street lamps to be placed on said avenue.

The question of contributory negligence was for the jury. The city, by working the street in question, had accepted it, and had no business to have such an excavation in it so near the traveled way. Judgment should be affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
