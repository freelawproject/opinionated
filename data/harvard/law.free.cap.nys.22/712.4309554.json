The evidence showed that for a number of years, in the leading cities of the country, steps with closed backs had been used, partly to strengthen them, and partly to prevent the passenger\u2019s foot from slipping in between the head of the wheel and the platform, and some of defendant\u2019s cars were fitted with such steps. <em>Held, </em>that it was a question for the jury whether defendant was negligent in having any open-backed steps on its cars.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b732-12\">Action by Frank E.

Whether or not the defendant exercised ordinary care in having an open-backed step on this car, under such circumstances, was, in our opinion, a question for the jury. The fact that the other kind of step was in common use, and for the purpose of preventing just such accidents, would justify a finding of the jury that defendant was negligent in respect to this step, and we think it was error for the court to take the question from them.

Judgment and order must be reversed, with costs to appellant to abide the event, and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
