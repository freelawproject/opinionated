Jordan &amp; Go., and engaged in the transportation of coal in barges from Newport News, New York, and Philadelphia to Boston and other ports in the New England states. October 23, 1888, the parties to this action entered into a contract, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-14\">\u201cArticles of agreement entered into this 23d day of October, 1888, between H. G. Jordan &amp; Co., of Boston, Mass., and W. M. Tebo, of Brooklyn, L. I. The said W. M. Tebo agreed to charter the steamer B. T. Haviland to said H. G. Jordan &amp; Co. from the morning of Octob.er 26, 1888, to May 1,1889, (either party having the privilege of cancellation upon one month\u2019s notice,) to tow their coal barges from New York, Philadelphia, or Newport News to Boston, or some other safe port, not east of Portland, Me.; the steamer to be provided with a hawser on board, and, in cases of parting the barge\u2019s hawser, to use the same for the balance of the trip free of cost to Messrs. Jordan &amp; Co. When the steamer is in New York, and obliged to wait for barges to tow, the Messrs. Jordan have the privilege of sending the tug to Sandy Hook, seeking. The steamer is expected to go at all times when, in the judgment of the captain, it is prudent and safe for his boat and tow; two days in each month to be allowed for washing and cleaning out boiler. In. the event of the boat becoming disabled in machinery, the lost time to be at the expense of charterers. Payments to be made on the 1st day of every month to W. M. Tebo for the amount of each month\u2019s charter; the price to be twenty-two hundred ($2,200) dollars per month. In the executipn of this charter, the dangers of the sea excepted, and the tug not held responsible for damages from that cause. A representative of Messrs. Jordan &amp; Co. to be on the tug at any time when they see fit, and free of cost to the tug, excepting food, which the tug is to supply. W. M. Tebo.

H. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">December 2, 1888, the tug, while towing defendant\u2019s barges Charter Oak and George Moon, laden with coal, from Newport News, via New Tork, to Boston, was, with the barges, stranded at about 6 o\u2019clock in the evening on Handerchief shoals, remaining aground about an hour. At about 6 P. M. on the next day the barges were stranded in Boston harbor, and remained aground for about an hour. By these strandings the barges were injured in the amount of \u00a71,167.64, but the greater part of the injury was caused by the first stranding. Handerchief and Shovelful lights are about three and a half miles apart, the latter being northeasterly from the former. Monomoy light is about a mile, and a little west of north, from Shovelful light. The channel from Handerchief to Shovelful light is narrow, with dangerous shoals on each side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">The plaintiff claimed to recover the contract price for service from</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-8\">October 26,1888, to January 8, 1889, amounting to $5,426 64......$5,426 64</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-9\">Less cash paid by defendants.......................... $2,059 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-10\">Earned by tug between December 8 and January 8,.... 725 00 2,784 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-11\">Plaintiff claims ..............................................$2,642 64</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-12\">The defendants assert that they were liable only for the service of the tug from October 26 to December 8, at the contract price, amounting to...................................................$3,226 64</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-13\">Cash paid............................................. $2,059 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-14\">Damages to barges..................................... 1,167 64</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ami\">- $3,226 64</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-16\">The defendants allege in their answer that the strandings were caused by the unseaworthiness of the tug, and the negligence of its officers and pilot, who were, it is averred, incompetent.

Putnam v. Wood, 3 Mass. 481-483; Kopitoff v. Wilson, 1 Q. B. Div. 377-380; Cohn v. Davidson, 2 Q. B. Div. 458; Iron Co. v. Huntley, 2 C. P. Div. 464; 1 Pars. Har. Law, 258. A vessel which is not commanded by competent officers is unseaworthy. Walden v. Insurance Co., 12 Johns. 128-134; Draper v. Insurance Co., 4 Duer, 234; 2 Pars. Har. Law, 135. The plaintiff was not a common carrier, and liable as an insurer of the safety of the barges, but he was liable for the damages occasioned by the failure of the master of the vessel to exercise reasonable care and skill in its management. The Margaret, 94 U. S. 494\u2014 496; The Webb, 14 Wall. 406; Wells v. Steam Nav. Co., 8 N. Y. 375. On this trial the defendants did not attempt to show that the vessel was unseaworthy by reason of defects in its hull, machinery, or material equipment, but rested their defense solely on the ground that the captain and pilot were incompetent and negligent. In reviewing the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>deuce given on the former trial it was held (62 Hun, 514, 17 N. Y. Supp. 80) that the trial court should have decided, as a matter of law, that the captain was negligent (1) in not anchoring his fleet at Handkerchief light, instead of proceeding on his voyage in the night, with a thick haze; (2) in not taking soundings between Handkerchief and Shovelful lights, which are 3 to 3\u00fc miles apart. On the present trial the evidence seems to have been greatly changed. After the plaintiff proved his contract, and introduced the letters of December 8th and 12th, and the necessary formal evidence, he rested. The defendants called the captains of the two barges, and their superintendent of the tow, who was on board of the tug at the time of the accident. Jones, the captain of the barge George Moon, testified: \u201cThe captain was justified, in my opinion, in going on, instead of anchoring. He was justified in going on, if he knew the course, and had a pilot aboard who was familiar with the course. I saw no necessity of anchoring, nor of their sheering over to port. I didn\u2019t know what they sheered over for,\u2014no idea at all.\u201d Hendrickson, the captain of the Charter Oak, testified: \u201cThere was no fog.\u201d That he saw the lights known as \u201cShovelful,\u201d \u201cMonomoy,\u201d and \u201cPollock Rip.\u201d \u201cI saw nothing in the condition of the wind or weather to require him [captain of the tug] to anchor. I thought it was good navigation for him to go ahead.\u201d Van Cleaf testified that it was a clear, dark night. \u201cI say that originally starting for Shovelful light was good navigation.\u201d \u201cThere was nothing in the weather that, in my opinion, required them to stop and anchor. They could have gone on perfectly easily. Any navigator could see, where they were.\u201d He also testified that he, the captain of the tug, and its pilot all saw Handkerchief and Monomoy lights. George M. Hallett, a sea captain, called by defendants, testified that he was familiar with the course from Handkerchief light to Boston. He said: \u201cI should say that on a dark night, with all the lights plainly visible,\u2014distinctly visible,\u2014a man who is familiar with the course should not have any difficulty in going over the course without running aground, if he is familiar with it. I don\u2019t see why he should. I don\u2019t know of any reason, if he knows all the lights.\u201d Ruling, another navigator, called by the defendants, testified: \u201cIf there was a haze on the water, so I would not see the Shovelful light vessel at all, for any reason, and I could see the Monomoy light distinctly, I would have some difficulty in going through safely with the Monomoy light in view. I could not steer the proper course with the aid of that light to carry me on. In that case I would anchor, and wait until I could see the other lights. I would turn to the anchorage if the weather was so you could not see. I would not go blindfolded. * * * I never anchored a long .tow in that place. I have passed over there in a haze. I don\u2019t know any one instance that I can call to mind now of passing over there when I could not see the Shovelful, and could see the Monomoy.\u201d This is substantially all the evidence given in behalf of the defendants which bears upon the question as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s captain was negligent in not anchoring at Handkerchief light. The plaintiff\u2019s captain testified: \u201cI did not anchor because I didn\u2019t think it was prudent to anchor,\u201d etc. \u201cIt would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>be good navigation to anchor her there.\u201d \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been safe to anchor there at all. It would be in the track of vessels, which is against the law.\u201d Barnard, who was piloting the tug, testified that he had been a seafaring man since boyhood, had \u201csailed over this route not less than a hundred times, and in my judgment the course of navigation which we took was good navigation, I think.\u201d \u201cIt would not have been a prudent thing to have anchored the vessel after passing Handkerchief light.\u201d Curran, a sea captain, testified: \u201cQuestion. You don't think it would have been good navigation to have anchored? Answer. Ho, sir. * * * It all depends upon the weather. If I saw Monomoy light clearly, there would be no difficulty in going forward, if I did not see Shovelful light, and it would be prudent to go ahead then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Under this state of the evidence, it is impossible to sustain the ruling that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff\u2019s captain was negligent in not anchoring his tow at Handkerchief light. The question was one of fact, and should have been submitted to the jury. In admiralty cases the court may determine the law and the facts, and the decisions of those courts afford but little light upon the question whether, under the practice in this state, an issue should be decided by the court, as^ a matter of law, or left to the jury, as a question of fact; and, unless these cases are considered with reference to the difference in practice of the two courts, they are likely to mislead the investigator. Whether it was negligent not to sound between Handkerchief and Shovelful lights was a disputed question of fact, which should have been submitted to the jury. Again, the proximate cause of the standing on Handkerchief shoals seems to have been, under the evidence in this case, the shifting of the course of the vessel, after passing Handkerchief light, from H to 4 points to the westward, which brought the vessels on the shoals. The captain and the pilot of the tug testified that the course was changed <em>li </em>to 2 points to the westward, while the defendants\u2019 witness testified that it was changed 4 points to the westward. The difference in this narrow channel is not unimportant. All of the witnesses agree that when the course was changed the wind was blowing and tide flowing from the westward. The plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that the change was made to counteract the assumed force of the wind and tide, and for the purpose of avoiding Stonehouse shoal, a dangerous one, which lay on the east side of the channel. By how much the course was changed was a question of fact, and also whether the change actually made, whatever found to be, was negligent. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellants, to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
