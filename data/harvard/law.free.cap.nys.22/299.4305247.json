At the time of the marriage the defendant owned real estate worth \u00a7100,000, in which the value of the plaintiff\u2019s inchoate right of dower would have been \u00a78,900. July 3, 1890, a contract was executed between them, under their hands and seals, which was duly acknowledged, and of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-18\">\u201cThis agreement, made and entered into this third day of July, 1890, between John Graham, of the city, county, and state of Hew York, party of the'first part, and Theresa Cassidy, of said city, party of the second part, witnesseth, that whereas a marriage is about to be had and solemnized between the said parties, and the said party of the first part is desirous of making provision for a fit and proper settlement to and for the use and benefit of the said Theresa Cassidy, his intended wife, now, therefore, the said party of the first part doth agree that, if the marriage shall be had and solemnized as aforesaid, he shall or will, on or before the date of such marriage, or just previous thereto, give, assign, transfer, and set over unto the said Theresa Cassidy the sum of one dollar, in cash, to have and to hold the same, unto her, the said Theresa Cassidy, to and for her sole and separate use, benefit, and behoof forever; and the said Theresa Cassidy, in consideration of the payment to her of the aforesaid sum of one dollar, and in further consideration of love and affection, and willingness to become the wife of the said John Graham, the party of the first part, doth, for herself, her heirs, executors, and administrators, covenant and agree with the said John Graham that for and in consideration of the premises, that said provision so made as herein specified shall be in full satisfaction of her dower in his estate, and shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>bar her from claiming the same, if she shall survive him after said marriage; and, further, if the said marriage shall be had, and she shall survive him, that she will not claim any share in his personal estate, unless some part thereof shall be given her by his will or act, done by him. subsequent to the execution of these presents. And the said Theresa Cassidy further covenants and agrees, in consideration of the premises, and of the marriage about to be celebrated between her and the said John Graham, in case he, the said John Graham, shall hereafter acquire property, real or personal, by purchase or otherwise, that she will, on request, sign and execute for him, his heirs, executors, or administrators, any or all releases of dower or quitclaims in such property, and hereby releases and quitclaims to the said John Graham, arid to his heirs, executors, or administrators, all and every right, title, or interest in and to any of the estate or property of the said John Graham, which he now owns, or which he may hereafter acquire.

Prior to the execution of this contract, another one had been drawn, under the instructions of the defendant, which was the same, in all respects, except that it recited a consideration of $5,000, instead of $1. The litigants agree that the terms of the contract were not agreed to before the parties met at the office of the defendant\u2019s counsel to execute it. On this occasion the defendant offered the plaintiff $5,000, which she refused to accept; and the contract was redrafted and \"aconsideration of $1 substituted, which was not paid. About five months after the marriage the parties became estranged, and the defendant conveyed some of his real estate to a daughter. November 28,1891, this action was brought to have the contract adjudged null and void, on the ground that it was procured to be executed by the plaintiff by fraud, and that she signed it without knowing the contents.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b320-10\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

VIII. c. 10, the title to the greater part of the land in England was 'in the hands of trustees for the use of sundry persons; and, as a wife was not dowable of uses, her father or friends, upon the marriage, procured the husband to create a jointure, that there might be a competent provision for the wife after the husband\u2019s death. 1 Cruise, Dig. tit. 7, \u201cJointure,\u201d \u00a7 2; Vernon\u2019s Case, 4 Coke, lb. Indeed, if a man, in consideration of a marriage afterwards to be had with a woman, created an estate in jointure, in full satisfaction of all dower which, after marriage, might accrue to her in his lands, and they intermarried, that was no bar of dower, at common law, for two reasons: (1) Because no right could be barred until it accrued; (2) because no right or title to an estate or freehold could be barred by a collateral satisfaction. So it was found impossible to bar a woman of dower by any assurance of lands either before or during the marriage. Cruise, Dig. tit. 7, \u201cJointure,\u201d, \u00a7 1; Vernon\u2019s Case, 4 Coke, lb. For the prevention of the mischiefs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>arising out of lands being held for the use of others, the statute of 27 Hen. VIII. c. 10, 4 Pick. St. 359, known as the \u201cStatute of Uses,\u201d was passed, which transferred the legal estate of the lands of England to those who were entitled to their use. Thus all the married women of England would have become dowable in the lands theretofore held to the use of their husbands, and also would have held the lands settled on them in jointure, but for section 6 of that chapter, which provided that women with jointures then or thereafter provided should not have dower in the residue of their husbands\u2019 estates. By a subsequent clause the wife was empowered to refuse a jointure assured during marriage. Vernon\u2019s Case, 4 Coke, 2 a, note 1, by Thomas. The word \u201cjointure\u201d has now been so extended by the statutes of England and of this state as to include a sole estate limited to the wife alone, or a pecuniary provision in lieu of dower. Sections 6 and 9 of chapter 10, 27 Hen. VIII., before referred to, were enacted almost verbatim in this state, in sections 8, 9, c. 4, Laws 1787, (2 Jones &amp; V. 2,) which provisions were continued unchanged until the adoption of the Revised Statutes, (1 Rev. Laws 1801, p. 51; 1 Rev. Laws 1813, p. 56.) This statement of the origin of the law of jointure shows, we think, that its central idea was some provision for the benefit of the wife, as a consideration for her relinquishment of her right to dower. It will be observed that the decisions of the courts in England, and the earlier cases in this state, are founded on statutes which are identical. There are two sorts of jointures created by the statutes of this state: (1) By an antenuptial agreement executed by both parties, which prevents the right to dower .from ever arising; (2) a jointure created before marriage, but not assented to by the betrothed wife, or created after marriage, which, when accepted in lieu of dower, bars it, but not before. 1 Rev. St. p. 741, \u00a7\u00a7 9-12; 1 Cruise, Dig. c. 1, \u00a7 25. Section 11 (1 Rev. St. p. 741) provides that \u201cany pecuniary provision that shall be made for the benefit of an intended wife, and in lieu of dower, shall, if assented to by such intended wife, as above provided, be a bar to any right or claim of dower of such wife in ail the lands of her husband.\u201d Under the statutes a valid jointure or a pecuniary provision in the nature of a jointure must be supported by some valuable consideration, as a compensation for the relinquishment of the right to dower. McCartee v. Teller, 2 Paige, 511-560; Hawley v. James, 5 Paige, 318-447. See, on other points, Priest v. Cummings, 16 Wend. 61; Power v. Sheil, 1 Moll. 296; Curry v. Curry, 10 Hun, 366; Ennis v. Ennis, 48 Hun, 11-14; 4 Kent, Comm. 56, note a; 1 Co. Litt. 36b, 37a. Some of the authorities go further, and hold that an antenuptial jointure or provision in lieu of dower must be a fair equivalent for the right relinquished. But we find no case, English or American, which holds that an antenuptial contract entered into for the purpose of barring dower is effectual, unless some provision is made for the intended wife, except in case the intended wife has property which would on marriage become the husband\u2019s, and the contract provides that neither shall become entitled to any interest in the estate of the other. In some jurisdictions such a consideration is held to be sufficient to support a contract relinquishing dower without any provision being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>made for the wife. No estate in lands or pecuniary provision having been received by or secured to the plaintiff, the antenuptial contract will not bar her claim to dower, under the Revised Statutes, in case she survives her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Is a contract relinquishing the right to dower, without any consideration, valid and sufficient, under the statutes for the protection of married women? Section 4 of chapter 200, Laws 1848, and section 3 of chapter 375, Laws 1849, provide: \u201cAll contracts made between persons in contemplation of marriage shall remain in full force after such marriage takes place.\u201d In Curry v. Curry, supra, it was held that the section quoted had no application to contracts creating jointures, or providing pecuniary provisions in lieu of dower, which had previously been authorized and regulated by the Revised Statutes; and we are of the opinion that it was not the intent of the legislature that this section should change those statutes in respect to antenuptial contracts relating to dower. We are also, of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to a new trial, upon the facts.: In Kline v. Kline, 57 Pa. St. 120, and Kline\u2019s Estate, 64 Pa. St. 122, it was held that persons engaged to be married stand in a confidential relation to each other, demanding the exercise of the utmost good faith on the part of both, and that an ante-nuptial contract executed by the intended wife, relinquishing her interest in the estate of her intended husband will not be supported unless there was a full and free disclosure of all the circumstances bearing upon the contemplated agreement. These cases were followed in Pierce v. Pierce, 71 N. Y. 154, where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that the contract in question cannot be upheld, for the reason that the evidence establishes, beyond any controversy, that it was executed by the respondent under a belief\u2014which was created by the conduct and declarations of the deceased\u2014that it contained more beneficial provisions in her favor than were contained in the same, and that, the deceased taking advantage of the confidential relationship existing between him and the respondent, who was the intended wife of the deceased, he was chargeable with fraud and misrepresentations in procuring her signature to the same. Antenuptial contracts, whereby the future wife releases her claim to her right of dower, and all other rights to the estate of her husband upon his decease, are fully recognized in law. When fairly made, and executed without fraud or imposition, they will be enforced by the courts. The surrender and release of rights to be acquired by the intended wife by the marriage relation must, however, be regarded with the most rigid scrutiny; and courts will not enforce contracts of this nature, against the wife, where the circumstances establish that she has been overreached and deceived, or been induced by false representations to enter into a contract which does not express-or carry out the real intention of the parties. The relationship of parties who are about to enter into the marriage state is one of mutual confidence, and far different from that of those who are dealing with each other at arm's length. This is especially the case on the part of the woman; and it is the duty of each to be frank and unreserved when about to enter into an antenuptial contract, by a full disclosure of all facts and circumstances which may in any way affect the agreement. <em>\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The plaintiff testified that on Sunday, June 29th, six days before their marriage, the defendant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">\u201c \u2018If we are going to be married, I think it is necessary that you should see a lawyer.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t think so.\u2019 He said, \u2018Business is business.\u2019 I said, \u2018My marriage is not business. I have nothing to see a lawyer about.\u2019 He said, \u2018Will you come and see mine?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, certainly I will.\u2019 He did not tell me why he wanted me to go see a lawyer. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>They then made an appointment to meet at the corner of Broadway and Fulton streets on Thursday following, at an hour named, and go together and see his lawyer, which appointment was kept, and resulted in the contract under consideration. She testified that its terms were never talked over. The defendant was examined as a witness in his own behalf, and testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201cI have heard Mrs. Graham\u2019s testimony as to what took place between us prior to our visit to Mr. Shaw\u2019s office. I have to say about that that I told her I would like to have my real-estate matters fixed up, so as T would have no interfering, so I could use it freely, whatever I would like,\u2014sell it, or to buy real estate, and nobody to interfere. I told her that before I went to Mr. Shaw\u2019s office. She said, \u2018All right.\u2019 I went to Mr. Shaw\u2019s office, and told him I would like to have such a paper made out, and then, subsequently, I took Miss Cassidy down there. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The defendant does not testify that the nature of the contract, or its effect, was explained to the plaintiff, nor that there was any conversation about dower, or the release of all of her interest in his real and personal estate. The attorney who drafted the contract testified that, after reading the first paper through, she said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201c 'The paper is all right, with the exception of the $5,000. I will not take any of Mr. Graham\u2019s money. I am not marrying him for money.\u2019 Mr. Graham said, T will not carry out the ceremony unless you release your dower right in my property.' She said, T am willing to, but 1 don\u2019t want to take any money.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">This is the-only evidence that the subject of releasing dower was ever the subject of conversation between the parties. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant testified that such language was used; but, if it was, it comes very near being a threat which would be likely to influence a woman on the eve of her intended marriage. Both litigants, the draughtsman of the contract, and the notary who took the acknowledgments,\u2014the only persons present when it was formulated and executed,\u2014 testified that the plaintiff refused to receive $5,000 in cash, and execute a contract cutting off her rights in the estate of her intended, on the ground that the marriage ought not to rest on a pecuniary consideration. The finding does not seem wholly natural and reasonable that the plaintiff freely, and with a perfect understanding of the intended effect of this contract, executed it without any pecuniary consideration, alter having absolutely refused to receive $5,000, and execute the first proposed contract. On a retrial the evidence may be of a character that will sustain the burden resting on the defendant, to convince the court, by the most cogent proofs, that the plaintiff fully understood the effect of the agreement, and that it was executed on her part freely, and without compulsion; but we are not satisfied that the evidence in this record fully justifies such a conclusion. The judgment should be reversed, both on the law and the facts, and a retrial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<author id=\"b323-9\">VAN BRUNT, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY9\">I am of the opinion that the provision in lieu of dower must be substantial, not merely nominal, in order tabar dower.

An antenuptial contract, to bar a woman\u2019s dower, should be based on a valuable consideration. The facts in this case show that no adequate compensation was made for the relinquishment of her dower right, and she, therefore, apart from the question of fraud, was entitled to have the agreement set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
