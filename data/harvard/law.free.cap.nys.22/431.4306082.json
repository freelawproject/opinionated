V. Cassagne against James M. Marvin and John Tayler Hall, as trustees of the United States Hotel, of Sara-toga Springs. The complaint alleged that the defendants were in 1875 appointed trustees of certain property known as the \u201cUnited States Hotel,\u201d and entered upon their duties, and still continue to act as such; that they issued certificates; and that the plaintiff is the owner of a share issued to Eugenia Boche, of the par value of |997,\u2014and, assuming that the trust is a valid and authorized trust, asked that the defendants specially perform an alleged agreement connected with said trust. The defendants, by their answer, admit they are the legal owners of certain property in which Eugenia Boche had a beneficial interest, and set out the certificate given to her. They set up that Eugenia Bo chi brought an action against them, and put them to great cost and expense, and claim they have a lien on the trust fund to be reimbursed, and ask that the amount of their claim be declared a lien, and that they may sell her interest to reimburse themselves for the amount due. The complaint was dismissed at the hearing, and defendants\u2019 claim for a lien was disallowed. Both parties appeal.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AGTg\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b451-14\">Argued before MAYHAM, P.

Y. Supp. 590, and 3 N. Y. Supp. 844,) and I feel constrained, by what the court said upon those appeals, to hold that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. As to the claim of the defendants that the amount of their costs and expenses should in this action be adjudged a lien upon the interest of the plaintiff, I can see no reason to differ from the learned justice who tried the case, or from the views expressed in his opinion. The judgment should be affirmed,\" as both parties appealed, and, as neither has succeeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>upon such appeal, let an order of affirmance be entered, without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\">MAYHAM, P.
