James C. Chapin, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, for hearing and to make finding of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">A hearing was conducted on the petition. The parties, having jointly stipulated to fifty-six matters of fact, which the court accepted, testimony having been taken, and other evidence having been considered, the court, as required, determined the facts, stating that they were supported by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The respondent, admitted to the Bar of the State of Maryland in 1972, has, since 1986, been engaged in the private practice of law, as a solo practitioner, specializing in personal injury cases on behalf of plaintiffs. He also is admitted to the bar of the District of Columbia. Until 1996, when it was declared bankrupt, the respondent\u2019s practice was known as Alan. F. Post, Chartered. Because he was allocated a portion of the debt of the previous firm with which he had been associated when it dissolved, the respondent started Alan F. Post, Chartered, his first solo practice, in debt, and with virtually no cash reserves. In March, 1996, the respondent formed Alan F. Post &amp; Associates, P.A. He was its sole shareholder, as was also the case with the prior professional corporation he formed. Moreover, while operating each of these corporations, he employed at least one employee and sometimes more.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Because the records of the Maryland Comptroller of the Treasury (the \u201cComptroller\u201d) do not reflect the activity on respondent\u2019s withholding tax account before 1993, the hearing court\u2019s findings related to that period and after. The records do reflect that the respondent made payments in March, 1993, which were applied to taxes and interest outstanding from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>1990. In addition, the stipulation reveals that, although at all relevant times, the firms maintained separate employee payroll accounts as required under Section 10-906 of the Tax-General Article,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with few exceptions, the respondent filed his withholding tax returns late and usually did not timely remit the taxes withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">.The respondent and the comptroller\u2019s office agreed to a payment plan in February of 1993, when the firm\u2019s outstanding State withholding tax liability was $12,406.32. As the stipulation attests, from the inception of the plan, the respondent\u2019s payments were late. Furthermore, the respondent only made two monthly payments, prompting the Comptroller to attach his bank account. On October 5, 1993, the respondent made his next voluntary payment of 1993. At that time, he also filed his June, 1993 return, due July 31, 1993. The respondent continued to file withholding tax returns, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>but they too were frequently filed late and, of course, filed without the withheld taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">There was a similar pattern in 1994. A new payment plan was established on January 13,1994; however, as was true the previous year, the two payments the respondent made were late. While everything was in order with respect to the January, 1994 return, it was both on time and remitted the taxes withheld, the February, 1994 return was filed late, on March 25, 1994, without the withholding taxes. The respondent neither made payments pursuant to the payment plan nor filed any other withholding tax returns until November, 1994. The Comptroller having again obtained liens and attachments, the respondent paid the outstanding balance, then $7,102.70, on November, 15, 1994. The returns for March through November of 1994 were filed, but without the withholding taxes, on January 6,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">As of March 30, 1995, the respondent\u2019s arrearage was $8,821.60, without considering the three returns which then were due. That arrearage had been paid by early April and the overdue returns filed. The respondent made no additional payments on the arrearage until he made two payments in late February and early March 1996. The respondent\u2019s payments under the payment plan continued to be consistently late. On one occasion, in August, 1995, the respondent\u2019s payment check was returned for insufficient funds, when his bank account had been attached by another creditor. For a time, the respondent filed his withholding tax returns on time, enclosing the withheld taxes. That was not the case in June, 1995. The June return was filed late and was not accompanied by interest or penalty payments. Withholding tax returns for August through November 1995 did not include the taxes; however, those for the next three months did and they were timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>When the respondent formed Alan F. Post and Associates, P.A., he opened a withholding tax account with the Comptroller\u2019s office for the new firm. At that time, Alan F. Post, Chartered owed $6306.68 in taxes, exclusive of unpaid interest and penalty. The new entity had not, as of April 29, 1997, remitted withholding taxes to the Comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The respondent does not dispute that he was aware of his obligation to file withholding tax returns, to remit the taxes withheld, and to hold those funds in trust for the State and federal governments. Although the parties have stipulated that the respondent \u201cdid not intend to defraud the Comptroller or to deprive the Comptroller permanently of the funds,\u201d he acknowledged, and the court found, \u201cthat the withheld funds were not placed in his payroll account on multiple occasions due to his cash flow problems and that he used the funds withheld from his employees\u2019 wages to pay business expenses of the law firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The court also found some facts that may explain why the respondent had difficulty staying current with his withholding taxes, including that the respondent handles his personal injury claims on a contingency basis, incurring \u201csubstantial out-of-pocket expenses,\u201d for a time, he was paying a monthly rental that he could not afford, a portion of which, approximately $20,000, he presently is paying, in addition to his current rental payments, and his involvement for about six years in a complex case, which, in addition to his time, contributed to the economic hardship his practice has experienced. The court found that the respondent\u2019s \u201cactual salary income for 1996 was approximately $36-$38,000,\u201d noting that he always drew checks to himself in the amount of $1000 each month, but would not cash the checks if there were insufficient funds to cover them.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Finally, the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cPetitioner readily acknowledged that Respondent has been cooperative in the investigations of this complaint and has promptly supplied requested documents. He has never been the subject of prior disciplinary actions by Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Bar Counsel. Paul T. Stein, Esquire, a member in good standing of the Maryland bar and a senior partner in an established Montgomery County law firm testified that he has known the Respondent for well over twenty years, attended law school with Respondent and has personal knowledge of his character and legal ability. He further testified that Respondent is a man of good character, a truthful person, and a good attorney who has given his clients good advice and has served them well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">As we have seen, Bar Counsel charged the respondent with violation of Rule 8.4(b) and (d). The court concluded that the respondent violated Rule 8.4(d). The respondent agrees. Recognizing that \u201c[i]n order to establish a violation of Rule 8.4(b), there must be a violation of a criminal statute and that specific violation must adversely reflect on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness <em>or </em>fitness as a lawyer,\u201d the court also concluded that that section was violated. As to the first prong, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201cRespondent violated Sections 10-817,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 10-822<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>906 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Annotated Code of Maryland, Tax General Article. Pursuant to Section 13-1007[ (d) ]<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of that Article, a -willful failure to pay withheld taxes is a criminal act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">The court finds that Respondent\u2019s conduct was willful since he voluntarily failed to comply with a known legal duty. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>308 Md. 397, 519 A.2d 1291 (1987). Respondent acknowledges that he understood that he was legally required to hold the withheld funds in trust, to promptly remit the funds to the Comptroller and the Internal Revenue Service, and to timely file returns reporting the withholdings. Respondent failed to do so, at least in part because of his election to apply those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>funds to pay other obligations of his law firm. Respondent\u2019s conduct was willful and in violation of both federal and state law. The court does not believe, however, nor is it contended by Bar Counsel, that Respondent intended to defraud the Comptroller or the federal authorities or to deprive the Comptroller [or] the federal authorities permanently of the funds.\u201d (Footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">With respect to the second prong, the court was not convinced that the respondent\u2019s conduct adversely reflected on his honesty or trustworthiness. Focusing on what it believed to be the root of the respondent\u2019s problem, the respondent\u2019s \u201cendeavors to operate his office in a business-like manner,\u201d the court concluded that his conduct reflected on his fitness as an attorney. As it saw it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201c[o]ne of the most fundamental of a lawyer\u2019s functions is to give sound legal co\u00fansel to his or her .clients, meaning that he or she must, when called upon to do so, advise the clients of their various lawful rights and duties, and concomitantly is bound to urge them to comply with those legal duties. An attorney, almost without regard to his reasons therefor, who does not \u2018practice\u2019 what he or she is required to \u2018preach\u2019 surely diminishes the stature and fitness of his role as a provider of legal counsel. Therefore, notwithstanding a degree of sympathy which Respondent\u2019s quandary may create, it cannot be doubted that his conduct reflected adversely on his fitness as a lawyer and, consequently, that he is in violation of Rule 8.4(b)\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The respondent does not agree that he violated Rule 8.4(b). To make' that point, he has excepted to the court\u2019s concluding that he did. The respondent\u2019s problem with the conclusion goes to both prongs. With respect to the first prong\u2014 whether he committed a criminal act,\u2014he argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">\u201cConduct that may give rise to a tax offense\u2014such as the failure to file a return or to pay a tax\u2014should not, simply because the conduct was \u2018voluntary,\u2019 constitute the commission of a \u2018criminal act\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 8.4(b).... If the Rule were construed in such a broad fashion, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>conduct or series of acts that could be charged as a crime, regardless of the lawyer\u2019s motive or intent, would automatically amount to a violation of the first element of Rule 8.4(b). Nothing in the Rules Commentary or the history of the enactment requires such a broad construction.\u201d (Footnote and citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">He relies on <em>Baldwin. </em>At issue in that case was the applicability of Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A), the predecessor of Rule 8.4, to a situation similar to that <em>sub judice, </em>in which an attorney had failed timely to file withholding tax returns and remit the taxes withheld, in particular, whether the subsections prohibiting \u201cillegal conduct involving moral turpitude\u201d and \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\u201d were implicated. Recognizing that we declined to reach the issue this case presents, the respondent points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">\u201cThe trial judge in <em>Baldwin </em>did find that the attorney\u2019s conduct met the general test of willfulness.... However, as the Court of Appeals went on to state in <em>Baldwin:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">\u2018The fact-finder further concluded, however, that he was not convinced by clear and convincing evidence that Baldwin\u2019s conduct showed \u2018dishonesty, conduct involving moral turpitude, an intent to cheat or an intent to deprive the State of monies to which it was entitled.\u2019 This finding was based principally on the effect of Baldwin\u2019s financial and family problems and alcoholism had on his intent, together with the absence of any evidence that Baldwin falsified or did not maintain records.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">(Quoting <em>Baldwin, </em>308 Md. at 404-05, 519 A.2d at 1295).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The respondent maintains, in other words, that something more than the general test of willfulness is required to prove a violation of Rule 8.4(b). And, he asserts, something more is negated in this case by, among other things,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> his maintenance of a separate employee payroll account, allowing the Comptroller, at all times to be able to ascertain what was due and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>respect of whom, and the stipulation that the respondent did not intend to defraud the Comptroller or deprive the Comptroller permanently of the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Concerning the second prong\u2014his fitness as a lawyer,\u2014the respondent is equally adamant that it does not apply to the circumstances of this case. He accepts the court\u2019s observation that the root of his problems \u201cstemmed primarily not in his performance or abilities as an attorney, but rather in his endeavors to operate his office in a business-like manner.\u201d Indeed, the respondent believes that, as used in the Rule, \u201cfitness\u201d connotes \u201csomething intrinsic to [his] conduct that implicate^] his legal abilities.\u201d Moreover, the respondent maintains that that is the only appropriate construction of the term when one considers that the conduct on which the court relied fits quite comfortably within the reach of Rule 8.4(d). There is no such connection between the conduct and the respondent\u2019s fitness as a lawyer in this case, as the court recognized, he asserts. Because we believe that this argument is correct, we will not address whether \u201csomething more\u201d must be proven under the Rule to establish the necessary predicate of the commission of a criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The legal profession is a \u201cpublic calling that specially invites complete trust and confidence.\u201d <em>Rheb v. Bar Ass\u2019n of Baltimore City, </em>186 Md. 200, 205, 46 A.2d 289, 291(1946). Thus, a critical inquiry that informs the bar admission process is into the character and fitness of each applicant for the practice of law. See Admission Rule 5. Section (b) of that Rule requires the Character Committee member to whom the matter is assigned to investigate that fact and Section (a) places the burden on the applicant to prove it. Consistent with the focus at the beginning of the process, the paramount aim of disciplinary proceedings is protection of the public from incompetent, unscrupulous, and morally deficient lawyers. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Protokowicz, </em>326 Md. 714, 607 A.2d 33 (1992); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kerpelman, </em>323 Md. 136, 149, 591 A.2d 516, 523 (1991); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Hamby, </em>322 Md. 606, 611, 589 A.2d 53, 56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>(1991); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kolodner, </em>316 Md. 203, 208, 557 A.2d 1332, 1334 (1989); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kahn, </em>290 Md. 654, 682, 431 A.2d 1336, 1351 (1981). As we put it in <em>Rheb, </em>186 Md. at 205, 46 A.2d at 291 (1946), \u201cIn the last analysis the duty rests upon the courts, and the profession as a whole, to uphold the highest standards of professional conduct and to protect the public from imposition by the unfit or unscrupulous practitioner.\u201d In such proceedings, when the facts are found, ultimately, \u201c \u2018[t]he question is whether, after the conduct of this man, it is proper that he should continue a member of a profession which should stand free from all suspicion.... It is not by way of punishment; but the courts, on such cases, exercise their discretion whether a man whom they have formerly admitted is a proper person to be continued on the roll or not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Boone, </em>255 Md. 420, 425, 258 A.2d 438 (1969), quoting <em>Ex parte Brounshall, </em>2 Cowp. 829 (1778).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Rule 8.4(b) recognizes, by its reference to character traits, rather than enumerating specific crimes, that commission of some crimes evidence or demonstrate a character flaw that, were the person committing them applying for admission to the bar, would constitute a significant impediment, if not outright prohibition, to his or her admission or, having been admitted, could result in his or her disbarment. The rule identifies two such traits. In addition to those traits, however, it includes as a catchall object, \u201cfitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u201d Since the Rule is specific in the requirement that the criminal act reflect adversely on the character traits or fitness as a lawyer, it follows that what the Rule contemplates is that the criminal act evidence another character trait, which, like honesty and trustworthiness, is relevant or critical to the practice of law. Thus, in that regard, although not the commission of a criminal act, this Court has recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atf\">\u201cDisobedience of a court order, whether as a legal representative or as a party, demonstrates a lapse of character and a disrespect for the legal system that directly relate to an attorney\u2019s fitness to practice law and serve as an officer of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 398, 692 A.2d 465, 472 (Md.1997), quoting, with approval, <em>In re Kelley, </em>52 Cal.3d 487, 276 Cal.Rptr. 375, 380, 801 P.2d 1126, 1131 (Ca.1990). We also said of the respondent in that case, who had failed to obey a court order requiring him to report to a DWI facility, at which he was to spend 33 days, \u201cRespondent\u2019s behavior evidences both an alcohol problem and a lack of respect for the legal system. If not addressed, it may affect his professional practice and injure the public.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">This Court has not been called upon, until now, to determine whether the acts which the respondent admits, failing timely to file withholding tax returns and/or to remit the taxes reportedly withheld, and to hold in trust those taxes, fall within Rule 8.4(b) or, at the least, adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness as a lawyer in other respects. We have considered whether failure to file income tax returns bears on a lawyer\u2019s fitness. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Walman, </em>280 Md. 453, 374 A.2d 354 (1977). The Court in that case pointed out that \u201cthe crime of which respondent stands convicted represents conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and, under the particular circumstances of this case, reflects upon his fitness to practice law is beyond debate,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 374 A.2d at 360, citing <em>In re Bunker, </em>294 Minn. 47, 199 N.W.2d 628, 631-32 (1972) and <em>Committee of Legal Ethics v. Scherr, </em>149 W.Va. 721, 143 S.E.2d 141, 147 (1965). A similar result was reached with regard to possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, albeit the issue was not presented so clearly as in this case and the case was decided under Disciplinary Rule 1-102A. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Proctor, </em>309 Md. 412, 524 A.2d 773 (1987). There the hearing court concluded that the respondent had thereby violated DR 1-102(A)(3) (engage in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude), DR 1-102(A)(6) (engage in conduct that reflects adversely on fitness to practice law), and <em>ipso facto, </em>DR 1-102(A)(1) (violation of a disciplinary rule). <em>Id. </em>at 414, 524 A.2d at 774. This Court refused to overrule those findings. On the matter of the proper sanction, however, after noting that, pursuant to Standard 5.11 of the Stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>dards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, adopted by the American Bar Association in February 1986, disbarment is generally appropriate when, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca lawyer engages in any other intentional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice,\u201d we severely sanctioned, rather than disbarred, the respondent in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 524 A.2d at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We agree with the conclusion reached in <em>Walman, </em>that, like the failure to file federal income taxes, the manner in which the respondent handled his escrow account in this case is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Both the petitioner and the respondent also agree that this is so. We do not believe that, under the circumstances of this case, that the respondent\u2019s conduct \u201creflects adversely on his fitness as a lawyer.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The only basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that it does reflect adversely on his fitness as a lawyer is that failure to practice what one preaches undermines one\u2019s credibility as a provider of legal counsel. But that is simply another way of saying that the administration of justice may be prejudiced. The court was specific in rejecting any suggestion that, by his actions, the respondent\u2019s honesty or trustworthiness was compromised, the conclusion that one could most logically be expected to draw. Moreover, the court also diagnosed the problem as one involving the respondent\u2019s office management skills rather than \u201chis performance or abilities as an attorney.\u201d Furthermore, there was evidence in the record attesting to the fact that this was the respondent\u2019s first brush with the lawyer discipline system and that the respondent \u201cis a man of good character, a truthful person, and a good attorney who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>given his clients good advice and has served them well.\u201d And there is no reason to suppose, and every reason to conclude the opposite, that the court did not accept that evidence. Finally, it must be recalled that the respondent maintained the separate employee payroll accounts as required by \u00a7 10-906.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">What remains is the determination of the appropriate sanction. We consider this issue cognizant that: \u201c \u2018conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice,\u2019 delegates or confirms to the courts the power and duty to consider particular conduct of one who is an officer of the court, in relation to the privileges and duties of a public calling that specially invites complete trust and confidence.\u201d <em>Rheb, </em>186 Md. at 205, 46 A.2d at 291. We are also mindful that the purpose of attorney discipline is the protection of the public and not punishment of the attorney. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gittens, </em>346 Md. 316, 697 A.2d 83 (1997); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kahn, </em>290 Md. 654, 431 A.2d 1336 (1981); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bailey, </em>286 Md. 630, 408 A.2d 1330 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The petitioner recommends that the respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law, with the right to reapply for reinstatement no sooner than three years and the imposition of certain conditions upon his reinstatement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The conditions Bar Counsel would have imposed are: payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>in full of all of his federal and State tax obligations, proof that he has no other substantial indebtedness that would impair his operation of a law office, including the timely remission of withholding taxes, and a monitor of the respondent\u2019s practice and accounting records for two years. The respondent believes that a reprimand, the sanction recommended by the hearing court, is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">We agree with the petitioner that the appropriate sanction is a period of suspension. Considering all of the facts and circumstances, however, we believe that the period recommended by the petitioner is too long. Instead we believe that the public will best be served, and we think it sufficient, if the suspension imposed is an indefinite one, with the right of the respondent to reapply after 30 days. Without in any way intending to suggest that the charges are not serious, it is significant that there is an explicit finding of no intent, on the respondent\u2019s part to defraud the State and that he did maintain the employee ledger even when not remitting the taxes as and when due. Thus, there never has been an issue as to the amount of withholding taxes for which the respondent has to account.

This Court is aware of <em>Application of Hyland, </em>339 Md. 521, 522, 663 A.2d 1309, (1995). Aside from the fact that the facts of this case are not strikingly similar to the facts in that case, the applicant was convicted of fifteen counts of failure to file Pennsylvania State sales tax returns, for which he was sentenced to jail, and, in that case, ''[t]roubling issues of candor and credibility [were] raised by much of his testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525, 663 A.2d at 1311. Moreover, the issue in that case was whether the applicant then possessed the requisite moral character to justify his admission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\">. Some of the cases upon which the petitioner relies for the recommendation are not at all apposite to the facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>e.g., <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Walman, </em>280 Md. 453, 374 A.2d 354 (1977); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gilland, </em>293 Md. 316, 443 A.2d 603 (1982); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>328 Md. 276, 614 A.2d 102 (1992); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n. v. Berger, </em>326 Md. 129, 604 A.2d 58 (1992). The first two of the cases involved criminal prosecutions for income tax violations. The last involved misappropriation of client funds. An attorney\u2019s obligation with respect to withholding taxes was at issue in both <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>308 Md. 397, 519 A.2d 1291 (1987) and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Boyd, </em>333 Md. 298, 635 A.2d 382 (1994). Both are also distinguishable. In <em>Baldwin, </em>the respondent had twice before been disciplined, which may account for the eighteen month suspension. In <em>Boyd, </em>there absolutely is no similarity between the cases other than that withholding taxes played some part in both cases. The conduct in <em>Boyd, </em>which included the failure to pay his taxes and to file his tax returns, was not only extensive, but it was willful. <em>See Boyd </em>at 308, 635 A.2d at 387.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>RAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVe\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">I would overrule Respondent\u2019s exception to the conclusion of ' the hearing court that he violated Rule 8.4(b). The hearing court properly found that Respondent\u2019s wilful violation of the tax law adversely reflected on his fitness as a lawyer. Respondent has committed a criminal act that reflects on his fitness as a lawyer. Section 13-1007(c) of the Tax-General Article, Maryland Code (1988, 1997 Repl.Vol.), makes the wilful failure to pay taxes a crime. Respondent wilfully and repeatedly violated his legal obligation to file necessary tax forms and to remit taxes to the State and federal taxing authorities for a period of several years. He also failed to hold in trust those funds which should have been withheld from his employees and, instead, used those funds to operate his law practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Respondent acknowledged that he understood his filing and payment obligations and the legal requirement to withhold funds in trust for the State and federal governments. He also acknowledged that the withheld funds were not placed in a separate account. The excuse he proffered for these failures was that he suffered cash flow problems. Respondent\u2019s motive for . using the money is no excuse. We rejected this excuse in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Boyd, </em>333 Md. 298, 307, 635 A.2d 382, 386 (1994), stating that those monies must be held in trust for the State by the employer; those monies belong to the State and are not to be used by the employer. Judge McAuliffe, writing for the Court, stated: \u201cThe fact that respondent used them to support his business, and not his personal endeavors, is of no consequence, and does not reheve him of responsibility for his failure to hold the funds in trust for the proper authority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The repeated failure to timely file tax returns and to remit payments is a serious violation; when a lawyer fails to pay withholding taxes for the employees of his law office, that conduct reflects adversely on his or her fitness as a lawyer. The Minnesota Supreme Court observed that the failure to file tax returns or pay employee withholding taxes is \u201cdirectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>related to the operation of [a] law practice and may well reflect upon the seriousness with which [a lawyer] regards his professional obligation in handling other people\u2019s money.\u201d <em>Matter of Discipline of Johnson, </em>414 N.W.2d 199, 202 (Minn. 1987). In addition, perhaps the most basic element of an attorney\u2019s fitness to practice law is the ability to conduct that practice lawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We said in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Walman, </em>280 Md. 453, 465, 374 A.2d 354, 361 (1977), that \u201c[b]y willfully failing to file his tax returns, a lawyer appears to the public to be placing himself above the law.\u201d How can we say with confidence that Respondent is fit to give others proper legal advice when he chooses to make illegal \u201cbusiness\u201d decisions in his own life? <em>See id. </em>at 471, 374 A.2d at 365 (Smith, J. dissenting) (reasoning that a failure to file income tax returns for three years demonstrates that the attorney is \u201cnot the type of person to whom we may in confidence entrust the handling of the affairs of others\u201d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
