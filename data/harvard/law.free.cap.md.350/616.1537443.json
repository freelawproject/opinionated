In the petition, it is alleged that Respondent engaged in misconduct, as defined in Maryland Rule BVlk, now Md. Rule 16-701k. We ordered that this matter be transmitted to Judge Lawrence R. Daniels of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">After a hearing on the merits, Judge Daniels made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201c1. The Respondent, William Ober, was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 21,1977.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">A. <em>Complaint of Anthony Raymond, Jr.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">2. The Respondent had a social relationship with Anthony Raymond, Jr., dating back to the mid-1980\u2019s. The Respondent and Mr. Raymond regularly played backgammon and frequently gambled on the outcome of their games.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">3. Over the years of their social relationship, the Respondent also represented Mr. Raymond at various times in several legal matters. One such matter was a Pennsylvania bankruptcy proceeding in which Mr. Raymond had a claim as a creditor against the bankruptcy petitioners, Seymour and Wendy Kilstein. The Respondent\u2019s representation of Mr. Raymond in the Kilstein bankruptcy matter commenced in 1990 and was ongoing throughout 1992 and 1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">4. The Respondent received no fee for his representation of Mr. Raymond in the Kilstein case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">5. On August 24, 1992, the Respondent accepted a no-interest loan of $1,800.00 from Mr. Raymond, as evidenced by Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 8. The Respondent did not advise Mr. Raymond to seek advice of independent counsel in connection with this transaction. The Respondent was unable to produce any documentation or other evidence that he repaid this loan to Mr. Raymond, who maintains that the loan was not repaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">6. Respondent provided competent representation to Mr. Raymond in the Kilstein case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">7. On or about December 23, 1993, the Respondent received a check in the amount of $8,673.35, made payable to the Respondent, from the Kilstein bankruptcy trustee. That check was issued in partial settlement of Mr. Raymond\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim and constituted client funds received by the Respondent on behalf of Mr. Raymond. On December 23, 1993, the Respondent deposited the bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>trustee\u2019s check into his attorney escrow account at Mercantile Safe Deposit and Trust Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\">8. On December 31, 1993, the Respondent issued Check No. 1247 from his escrow account, payable to Mr. Raymond in the amount of $2,000.00 as a partial distribution of the Kilstein bankruptcy settlement proceeds the Respondent had received. Mr. Raymond negotiated the escrow check, which cleared the Respondent\u2019s account on January 4, 1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">9. On December 31, 1993, the Respondent also issued Check No. 1246 from his escrow account, payable to himself, in the amount of $1,500.00. The Respondent negotiated that check for cash on the same date. The Respondent maintains he gave Mr. Raymond $500.00 in cash on December 31, 1993, along with Check No. 1247 for $2,000.00. Mr. Raymond acknowledged receipt of Check No. 1247, plus $500.00 in cash, when he signed a written distribution sheet (in evidence as Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 9) on January 21, 1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">10. With respect to the balance of the Kilstein bankruptcy funds the Respondent was holding, the Respondent maintains he entered into an agreement with Mr. Raymond whereby Mr. Raymond agreed to lend the balance, in the amount of $6,173.35, to the Respondent for the purpose of allowing the Respondent to use the money to gamble on backgammon. In addition to the $1,000.00 he received from cashing Check No. 1246, the Respondent withdrew the remaining trust funds from his escrow account by writing the following checks payable to himself:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">a. Check No. 1248 (dated Jan. 5,1994) $2,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">b. Check No. 1249 (dated Jan. 7,1994) $2,300.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">c. Check No. 1250 (dated Jan. 13,1994) $ 500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">d. Check No. 1251 (dated Jan. 14,1994) $ 400.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\">$5,200.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-12\">11. The Respondent removed $6,200.00, including $6,173.35 in client funds received by the Respondent on behalf of Mr. Raymond, from his escrow account over a two-week period from December 31, 1993 to January 14, 1994. The Respondent used those funds to gamble on backgammon with Mr. Raymond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>12. On January 21,1994, Mr. Raymond signed the distribution sheet (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 9) indicating that there had been an agreement to lend $6,173.35 to the Respondent \u2018for the period of three weeks for his personal use\u2019 and that the Respondent had Mr. Raymond\u2019s \u2018full permission and consent to withdraw the sum of $6,173.35, ... , from his escrow account for his personal use.\u2019 Mr. Raymond acknowledged receipt of two personal checks from the Respondent on January 21, 1994, repaying the principal of the loan, plus $28.40 in interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">13. The Respondent did not advise Mr. Raymond to seek the advice of independent counsel in connection with the loan of the Kilstein bankruptcy settlement funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">14. Mr. Raymond, who has an undergraduate degree in business, as well as a master\u2019s degree, is a person savvy in business matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">15. Had Respondent advised Mr. Raymond to seek the advice of independent counsel concerning the loan, Mr. Raymond would not have sought such advice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">16. In response to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation of Mr. Raymond\u2019s complaint, the Respondent was unable to produce any escrow account records related to his receipt and disbursement of Mr. Raymond\u2019s client funds received in December, 1993 from the Kilstein bankruptcy trustee. At an Inquiry Panel hearing on October 9, 1996, for which a subpoena was issued to Respondent to produce such records, the Respondent admitted that he did not have any records relating to the Kilstein bankruptcy funds deposited into his escrow account.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">17. Respondent and Mr. Raymond have not played backgammon for money with each other since the events giving rise to the instant complaint, or shortly thereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Judge Daniels concluded that Respondent violated Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by \u201centering into financial transactions with Mr. Raymond without advising him to seek the advice of independent counsel.\u201d Judge Daniels also concluded that Respondent violated former Maryland Rule BU9<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by \u201cborrowing client funds required to be deposited in an attorney trust account.\u201d Judge Daniels further concluded that, by \u201cfailing to preserve complete trust account records related to his receipt of client funds on behalf of Mr. Raymond for a period of five years after termination of the representation,\u201d Respondent violated Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\">\u201cA lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to [Subtitle BU] of the Maryland Rules. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and of other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>With regard to the second complaint against Respondent, Judge Daniels made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">\u201cB. <em>Complaint of Carolyn Grooms</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">18. In 1986, the Respondent began representing Carolyn Grooms in a workers\u2019 compensation case arising from an accidental injury Ms. Grooms sustained at work on December 31, 1985. Ms. Grooms initially hired another attorney, but the Respondent assumed responsibility for the representation when that attorney joined the law firm with which the Respondent was associated at the time. The Respondent left that law firm in August of 1989, but Ms. Grooms later asked the Respondent to resume representing her, and he agreed to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">19. At some point during Respondent\u2019s representation of Ms. Grooms, he requested a hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to consider the issue of nature and extent of permanent disability. Although a hearing was scheduled in 1992 as part of a regular docket at the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, the Respondent wanted to have Ms. Grooms\u2019 physician testify in person, necessitating a postponement to have the case specially set. From that point forward, the Respondent did not take reasonably diligent steps to have that hearing rescheduled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">20. During a period of time Ms. Grooms alleges she had no contact from Respondent, Ms. Grooms admits that she was in regular contact with Respondent concerning an unrelated real estate matter which Respondent successfully handled for Ms. Grooms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">21. In July 1994, the Respondent left the private practice of law to go to work for the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund. He did not notify Ms. Grooms of his new address or phone number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">22. Sometime after leaving his private practice office in 1994, the Respondent lost Ms. Grooms\u2019 file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">23. In January 1995, Ms. Grooms consulted another attorney, Richard Hackerman, Esquire about taking over her case. Mr. Hackerman agreed to look at the case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>attempted on several occasions throughout 1995 to contact the Respondent, both by writing to him and by making phone calls. Both Ms. Grooms and Mr. Hackerman sent correspondence to Respondent in January, 1995, but the correspondence was sent to the wrong address (Respondent was still using his old office as a mailing address, but the letters were addressed to a Randallstown zip code rather than the correct Baltimore zip code), and Respondent never received either correspondence. In a letter dated January 24, 1995, Ms. Grooms attempted to notify the Respondent that she was terminating his representation. At one point, the Respondent agreed to meet with Mr. Hackerman and to bring Ms. Grooms\u2019 file to go over it, but he never did so. The Respondent did not initially tell Mr. Hackerman that he could not locate Ms. Grooms\u2019 file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">24. At an Inquiry Panel hearing on October 9, 1996, the Respondent admitted that he could not locate Ms. Grooms\u2019 file, which he had been subpoenaed to produce at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">25. Respondent did, however, reconstruct the file and personally handed it to Ms. Grooms on November 18, 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">26. Ms. Grooms then gave the file to Mr. Hackerman who presently still has it and represents Ms. Grooms in her workers\u2019 compensation claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">27. The reconstructed file turned over to Ms. Grooms by Respondent is complete and in good order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">28. No prejudice has accrued to Ms. Groom[s\u2019]rights in her workers\u2019 compensation claim by virtue of the delay in Respondent getting the file to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">29. Even though Mr. Hackerman has had the file for almost one full year, Mr. Hackerman has not yet requested a hearing before the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Judge Daniels concluded that Respondent failed to act diligently with regard to Ms. Grooms\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and thus violated Rule of Professional Conduct 1.3 which provides that a \u201clawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>promptness in representing a client.\u201d In addition, Judge Daniels concluded that Respondent violated Rule of Professional Conduct 1.16(d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by failing to provide Ms. Grooms or her new attorney, Mr. Hackerman, with her case file upon request after Ms. Grooms notified or attempted to notify Respondent that she was terminating his representation. Finally, Judge Daniels concluded that, by losing Ms. Grooms\u2019s file and then failing to promptly find or reconstruct the file, Respondent violated Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 which provides that a \u201clawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">RESPONDENT\u2019S EXCEPTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Respondent filed exceptions to Judge Daniels\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201c \u2018To be sustained, the findings of fact of a hearing court must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n. v. Kemp, </em>335 Md. 1, 9, 641 A.2d 510, 514 (1994). Because this Court has original jurisdiction over disciplinary proceedings, we will make an \u2018independent, detailed review of the complete record with particular reference to the evidence relating to the disputed factual finding.\u2019 <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 516, 307 A.2d 677, 680-81 (1973).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\"><em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>349 Md. 623, 629, 709 A.2d 1212, 1214-15 (1998). The findings made by the hearing court, however, are <em>\u201cprima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 470, 671 A.2d 463, 474 (1996). For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that there was clear and convincing evidence to support Judge Daniels\u2019s findings, and thus, they were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">\n<em>Complaint of Anthony Raymond, Jr.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Respondent argues that the transactions between Respondent and Mr. Raymond are not of the type contemplated by Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a) because he and Mr. Raymond were close personal friends and the transactions were not directly related to the attorney-client relationship. In support of his contention, Respondent cites <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>328 Md. 276, 614 A.2d 102 (1992). In <em>Powell, </em>this Court left open the question of whether the conduct of a lawyer falls within the scope of Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a) where the lawyer enters into a business transaction with a client who also is a personal friend. 328 Md. at 297-98 n. 23, 614 A.2d at 113 n. 23. The trial judge \u201cfound that the loan Vas a fair and equitable personal loan to a close friend\u2019 \u201d and implicitly found that the lawyer advised the friend/client to seek the advice of independent counsel. <em>Powell, </em>328 Md. at 296, 614 A.2d at 112-13. Without addressing the merits of Powell\u2019s argument that Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a) did not apply because the loan came from a close friend, we concluded that the record supported the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Powell\u2019s actions met the requirements of Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a). <em>Powell, </em>328 Md. at 297-98 n. 23, 614 A.2d at 113 n. 23. For the following reasons, we conclude that Respondent\u2019s conduct in the instant case falls within the scope of Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a) provides that \u201c[a] lawyer <em>shall not </em>enter into a business, financial or property transaction with a client ...\u201d unless certain conditions are met. (Emphasis added). Where, as in the instant case, an attorney enters into a transaction with a client using the client\u2019s escrow funds held by the attorney during a period in which the attorney is actively representing the client, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>language of this rule is mandatory, and this Court will not read into the rule an exception for a client/personal friend of an attorney. Where there is a nexus between the transaction and the attorney-client relationship, we believe that Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a) covers the type of transaction before this Court even if the client, like Mr. Raymond, is a personal friend and is sophisticated in business matters. A client, even if a close friend, may be more likely to trust the attorney and less likely to scrutinize the financial transaction because of confidence in his or her professional advisor as well as the professional relationship between the attorney and client. As a result, the Rules of Professional Conduct provide safeguards to protect the client\u2019s trust and confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">We also disagree with Respondent\u2019s contention that the transactions between him and Mr. Raymond were not related to their attorney-client relationship. At the time of the transactions with Mr. Raymond, Respondent was actively representing Mr. Raymond in the Kilstein bankruptcy matter. Moreover, Respondent borrowed the same funds obtained in partial settlement of Mr. Raymond\u2019s claim in the Kilstein bankruptcy matter from Respondent\u2019s escrow account. There was a nexus between Respondent\u2019s transactions with Mr. Raymond and their attorney-client relationship, and thus, Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a) is applicable to the instant case. We need not determine whether Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a) is applicable where an attorney enters into a financial transaction with a friend who is also a client and where there is absolutely no nexus between the transaction and the attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\"> Under Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a), Respondent was prohibited from borrowing Mr. Raymond\u2019s funds unless: 1) the transactions were fair and equitable to Mr. Raymond; and 2) Respondent advised Mr. Raymond to seek the advice of independent counsel regarding the transactions and gave Mr. Raymond a reasonable opportunity to do so. We need not address the fairness of the transactions to Mr. Raymond as Respondent did not advise Mr. Raymond to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the advice of independent counsel with regard to the loan as required by Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a)(2). In the instant case, it may have been important for Respondent to advise Mr. Raymond to seek independent advice because any debt incurred by Respondent or Mr. Raymond as a result of illegal gambling might be unenforceable in this State. <em>See Emerson v. Townsend, </em>73 Md. 224, 227-28, 20 A. 984 (1890). Furthermore, we reject Respondent\u2019s contention that the requirement of Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a)(2) does not apply because Mr. Raymond would not have sought the advice of independent counsel' even if Respondent had advised Mr. Raymond to do so. An attorney\u2019s decision to inform a client to seek'the advice of independent counsel should not rest upon the attorney\u2019s speculation as to whether the client will in fact seek such advice. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s exception and conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence in the record to support Judge Daniels\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Respondent also contends that the transaction with Mr. Raymond does not fall within the scope of Md. Rule BU9. Respondent claims that he obtained the loan with the \u201cfull consent and permission of Mr. Raymond ... after the funds were deposited in Respondent\u2019s escrow account.\u201d Thus, Respondent argues, the transaction with Mr. Raymond did not constitute a loan from Respondent\u2019s escrow account but was a loan from Mr. Raymond. Maryland Rule BU9 plainly prohibited Respondent from borrowing funds required by the Maryland rules to be deposited in an attorney trust account. Regardless of whether Respondent obtained the loan with Mr. Raymond\u2019s \u201cfull consent and permission,\u201d the fact remains that Respondent borrowed client funds belonging to Mr. Raymond that were required to be deposited in an attorney trust fund account, instead of disbursing the funds to Mr. Raymond. Thus, Respondent\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">\n<em>Complaint of Carolyn Grooms</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Respondent excepts to Judge Daniels\u2019s factual finding (number 19) that Respondent failed to take reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>diligent steps to have Ms. Grooms\u2019s hearing rescheduled and the conclusion that Respondent violated Rule of Professional Conduct 1.3, asserting that Judge Daniels\u2019s finding and conclusion were not established by clear and convincing evidence. In support of this contention, Respondent claims that neither party presented expert testimony concerning reasonable diligence, that Ms. Grooms\u2019s testimony was \u201cunclear and confusing,\u201d and that Respondent testified that several obstacles delayed the rescheduling of the hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. We conclude, however, that there is clear and convincing evidence in the record to support Judge Daniels\u2019s finding that Respondent had not taken reasonably diligent steps to have a hearing rescheduled on the nature and extent of permanent disability when a 1992 date for the hearing was postponed. From that date until 1995 when Mr. Hackerman took over Ms. Grooms\u2019s claim, Respondent did not attempt to reschedule the hearing. Thus, expert testimony concerning reasonable diligence was not necessary under the circumstances of this case. Moreover, we note that the hearing judge \u201cmay pick and choose the evidence on which to base his findings,\u201d and Judge Daniels was free to disregard any testimony, including Respondent\u2019s, that was not credible. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Miller, </em>301 Md. 592, 603, 607, 483 A.2d 1281, 1287, 1289 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Respondent further argues that Mr. Hackerman had not rescheduled the hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission as of January 15, 1998 even though he had Ms. Grooms\u2019s complete file since November of 1996, and thus Ms. Grooms suffered no prejudice as a result of the delay. The comment to Rule of Professional Conduct 1.3, however, states that \u201c[ejven when the client\u2019s interests are not affected in substance, ... unreasonable delay can cause a client needless anxiety and undermine confidence in the lawyer\u2019s trustworthiness.\u201d Thus, even if Ms. Grooms has not suffered any prejudice due to Respondent\u2019s delay, she still suffered needless anxiety for which Respondent is responsible. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Respondent also excepts to Judge Daniels\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1, noting that \u201cnothing in the record ... supports] the Conclusion that the loss of a file equals incompetent representation\u201d in violation of Rule of Professional Conduct l.l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree, however, with Petitioner\u2019s statement that \u201cRespondent\u2019s loss of Ms. Grooms\u2019 file demonstrated a lack of stewardship in managing client files.\u201d In our view, the thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for competent representation includes the proper management of case files. The loss of a file may substantially affect an attorney\u2019s ability to adequately prepare the client\u2019s case. Furthermore, Judge Daniels also based his conclusion that Respondent violated Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 on the fact that Respondent failed to promptly reconstruct Ms. Grooms\u2019s file and not solely on Respondent\u2019s loss of the file. This conclusion is supported by clear and convincing evidence, and thus Respondent\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Moreover, Respondent claims that there is not clear and convincing evidence supporting a violation of Rule of Professional Conduct 1.16(d) because it is not clear when Ms. Grooms notified Respondent that she was terminating their attorney-client relationship and that Mr. Hackerman would be her new attorney. In addition, Respondent asserts that he did not receive any written correspondence from Ms. Grooms regarding the termination of their attorney-client relationship. Respondent also claims that, as of October 9, 1996, Mr. Hackerman had not agreed to represent Ms. Grooms regarding her workers\u2019 compensation claim. Regardless of when Mr. Hackerman agreed to represent Ms. Grooms, it is clear that Ms. Grooms notified or attempted to notify Respondent that his representation was terminated as early as January of 1995. Although Respondent did not receive any written correspondence, it is apparent from the record that, sometime prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>to August 31, 1995, Respondent communicated by phone with Mr. Hackerman regarding the Grooms matter and promised to send him a copy of the file. Respondent, however, did not provide Ms. Grooms with a reconstructed file until November 18, 1996. Thus, we find that there is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent failed to \u201ctake steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect [Ms. Grooms\u2019s] interests\u201d upon termination of representation, in violation of Rule of Professional Conduct 1.16(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Finally, Respondent excepts to finding number 24, arguing that it implies that Respondent admitted for the first time at the Inquiry Panel hearing that he could not locate Ms. Grooms\u2019s file when Ms. Grooms\u2019s new attorney, Mr. Hacker-man, testified that Respondent informed him of this fact well before the Inquiry Panel hearing. We agree with Respondent\u2019s statement as to Mr. Hackerman\u2019s testimony. While finding number 24 on its own indicates that Respondent admitted to misplacing the file, the last sentence of finding number 23 states that \u201c[t]he Respondent did not initially tell Mr. Hackerman that he could not locate Ms. Grooms\u2019 file.\u201d When read in this context, finding number 24 does imply that Respondent admitted to misplacing the file for the first time at the Inquiry Panel hearing. We therefore sustain Respondent\u2019s exception as to finding number 24 with regard to the above implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">SANCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">We now must determine the proper sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct. In sanctioning Respondent, we note that \u201c[t]he purpose of disciplinary proceedings against an attorney is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Com\u2019n v. Hamby, </em>322 Md. 606, 611, 589 A.2d 53, 56 (1991). \u201cThe public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm,, v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). The seventy of the sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>case before this Court. <em>Hamby, </em>322 Md. at 611, 589 A.2d at 56. Imposing a sanction protects the public interest \u201cbecause it demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct which will not be tolerated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Petitioner recommends that Respondent be suspended for one year and that upon reinstatement an attorney monitor be appointed for a two-year period if Respondent returns to private practice. While Respondent concedes that he \u201cfail[ed] to preserve for five years his escrow account records relating to his representation of Mr. Raymond and [lost] Ms. Grooms\u2019s file,\u201d he maintains that he should merely be reprimanded. Respondent argues that the uncertainty with regard to Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a) is at least \u201ca mitigating factor with respect to Respondent\u2019s failure to so advise Mr. Raymond, especially in light of the trial court\u2019s uncontested finding that Mr. Raymond would not have sought the advice of independent counsel had he been so advised.\u201d As we stated earlier, we believe that the application of Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(a) is clear in the instant case, and we will not consider the fact that Mr. Raymond would not have sought the advice of independent counsel as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">We note that Respondent has been practicing for over twenty years and that he has not previously been sanctioned by this Court. We also note that it appears that Respondent did not intend to defraud Mr. Raymond of the Kilstein bankruptcy funds. This Court, however, has found that Respondent has violated disciplinary rules by entering into inappropriate financial transactions with a client, borrowing client funds, failing to maintain adequate trust account records, losing a client\u2019s file, and demonstrating a lack of diligence in handling a client\u2019s case. Upon careful consideration in this matter, we conclude that the appropriate sanction is to suspend Respondent from the practice of law for a period of thirty days. This suspension shall be effective thirty days from the filing of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-715c, FOR WHICH JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST WILLIAM OBER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\">.
