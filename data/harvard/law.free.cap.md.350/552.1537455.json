We shall hold that the client did not waive the accountant-client privilege found in Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>land Code (1974, 1995 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.), \u00a7 9-110 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, accordingly, shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Appellant Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., (hereinafter \u201cSears\u201d) obtained a judgment in the amount of $36,031.46 against Appellee, Paul Gussin, on August 7, 1995 in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. After judgment was entered in Maryland, the judgment was enrolled in Florida, where Mr. Gussin resides. Sears proceeded with discovery in aid of enforcement of that money judgment and Sears took Mr. Gussin\u2019s deposition in Florida on May 30,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">At his deposition in Florida, Gussin produced his 1994 federal income tax return. The 1994 tax return, filed jointly with his wife, showed $247,787 in investment income. Gussin testified that the return was prepared by his accountant, Ernst &amp; Young L.L.P. (hereinafter \u201cErnst &amp; Young\u201d) of Baltimore, Maryland. Attached to the 1994 return was a printout showing the companies, partnerships, trusts, and bank accounts that make up the reported investment income. Gussin testified that Ernst &amp; Young had in its possession the K-l forms, showing the income for each individual investment item. Gussin stated that he had no bank accounts, that he did not own the home in which he and his wife resided, and that he did not know when the home was acquired. The 1994 tax return also showed $161,000 in \u201cother gains and losses.\u201d Gussin denied ownership of any significant individual assets, despite the fact that in the mid-1980s he received $6.7 million for the sale of a business.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">At the deposition, Sears\u2019s counsel questioned Gussin regarding his assets.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Q: Now who has the papers that would reflect the actual ownership of these various investments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">A: Probably in\u2014probably, Pm just trying to think, probably in the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">Q: What office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">A: That my son has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">Q: All right. Would Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young have the papers also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">A: I imagine. I don\u2019t know. They did the tax return. <em>You could ask them.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">(Emphasis added). Sears also deposed Mr. Gussin\u2019s wife, Jocelyn. Ms. Gussin testified that, \u201cshe was born into money,\u201d and that she was involved in a shoe store business with her husband. The shoe business was sold in the mid-1980\u2019s for $20 million, and, in return for his one-third interest in the business, Mr. Gussin received approximately $6 million. Ms. Gussin testified that she had no idea what investments Mr. Gussin owned or presently owns, and she had no idea what he did with the money he received from the sale of the shoe store. She testified that Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young had all the papers that were used to prepare the tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Thereafter, Sears served a subpoena on Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young in Maryland in order to discover the assets and general financial condition of Paul Gussin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The subpoena directed Ernst &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Young to designate a representative to testify as to matters concerning Gussin and to produce documents, <em>inter alia, </em>relating to Gussin\u2019s ownership interest in the investments listed in his 1994 federal income tax return. Ernst &amp; Young filed an objection to the subpoena, indicating that it would turn over the documents and comply with the subpoena so long as a court order was entered to that effect. Sears filed a written response to Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">On July 11,1997, Judge Thomas Smith held a hearing in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. In response to Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s objection to the subpoena, Sears made several arguments. First, Sears argued that Gussin waived the accountant-client privilege by his statement, \u201cyou can ask them,\u201d at his deposition. Second, Sears argued that Gussin made a fraudulent conveyance, in violation of Subtitle 2 of Title 15 of the Commercial Law Article of the Maryland Code (1975, 1990 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.), to his wife or some other individual, thereby precluding Gussin from relying on the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The record reflects that the waiver and fraud arguments were the only two issues raised by Sears at the hearing before Judge Smith. Sears did not argue that the documents themselves were not privileged information. The circuit court sustained Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s objection and quashed the subpoena in its entirety, finding that Gussin asserted the accountant-client privilege and that the privilege had not been waived. Sears filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and we granted <em>certionnri </em>on our own motion prior to consideration by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Before this Court, Sears contends that the accountant-client privilege established in \u00a7 9-110 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article should not apply in this case for several reasons: (1) Gussin expressly permitted Ernst &amp; Young to disclose the information and/or Gussin waived the privilege by his conduct at his deposition; and (2) the discovery Sears seeks falls within the \u201cfraud exception\u201d to the privilege, recognized in <em>Dixon v. Bennett, </em>72 Md.App. 620, 642, 531 A.2d 1318, 1329 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 557, 536 A.2d 664 (1988). Sears initially contends that Gussin\u2019s statement, \u201cyou can ask [Ernst &amp; Young],\u201d operated as express permission for disclosure, thereby waiving the accountant-client privilege, because it gave Sears permission to deal with Ernst &amp; Young regarding his investment income. Sears also argues that Gussin cannot rely on the accountant-client privilege because there is evidence that he was involved in fraud. Sears maintains that there is evidence \u201cthat Gussin may be committing fraud, or has committed a fraud, to avoid paying creditors.\u201d Sears\u2019s fraud argument is based on Mr. and Ms. Gussin\u2019s deposition testimony that, notwithstanding both Gussin\u2019s receipt of $6 million in the mid-1980s and the 1994 tax return reporting investment income of $247,787, Gussin nonetheless testified, \u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d Sears concedes in its brief that it does not, and, indeed, cannot allege that Ernst &amp; Young participated in or furthered fraudulent activity, or was even aware of any fraudulent conduct. Sears simply argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>they are entitled to discover the documents under the fraud exception because Ernst &amp; Young has access to documents showing assets presently or previously owned by Gussin.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In response, Ernst &amp; Young, on behalf of Gussin, argues that Gussin never waived the privilege or gave express permission for the documents to be released. Ernst &amp; Young argues that Gussin\u2019s deposition statement, \u201cyou can ask them,\u201d was merely Gussin suggesting that Ernst &amp; Young was more likely to know which documents were in its possession than Gussin. Furthermore, if Gussin\u2019s statement was an invitation to approach his accountant, Ernst &amp; Young contends that this statement was merely an invitation to ask Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young about whether the accountant had <em>possession </em>of the documents pertaining to Gussin, not permission for Sears to discover the content of those documents. According to Ernst &amp; Young, Gussin\u2019s deposition testimony was not a partial waiver of the privilege. Second, Ernst &amp; Young argues that even if the accountant-client privilege could be waived in a manner other than by express permission, nothing in Gussin\u2019s testimony could be taken as an implied waiver of the privilege. Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young asserts that it is obvious that Gussin intended to keep his financial affairs confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Finally, as to any purported \u201cfraud exception\u201d to the accountant-client privilege, Ernst &amp; Young argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in <em>Dixon </em>by recognizing a fraud exception to the accountant-client privilege. In addition, even if this Court were to adopt a fraud exception to the privilege, this case would not fall within that exception because Sears has not made the requisite <em>prima facie </em>showing of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The privilege against disclosure by a licensed, certified public accountant of the contents of any communication made by a client who employs the accountant to audit, examine, or report any account, book, record, or statement of the client, and any information derived from the client while rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>professional services, is found in Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 9-110. The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">(b) <em>Privilege\u2014In </em>general.\u2014Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section or unless expressly permitted by a client or the personal representative or successor in interest of the client, a licensed certified public accountant or firm may not disclose:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">(1) The contents of any communication made to the licensed certified public accountant or firm by a client who employs the licensed certified public accountant or firm to audit, examine, or report on any account, book, record, or statement of the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">(2) Any information that the licensed certified public accountant or firm, in rendering professional service, derives from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">(i) A client who employs the licensed certified public accountant or firm; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">(ii) The material of the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">\u00ed|\u00ed <em>i't </em>\u00ed-\u00ed :js</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">(d) <em>Privilege\u2014Exceptions. </em>\u2014The privilege against disclosure required by subsection (b) of this section does not affect:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-12\">(1) The bankruptcy laws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-13\">(2) The criminal laws of the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-14\">(3) A regulatory proceeding by the State Board of Public Accountancy under \u00a7\u00a7 2-317 and 2-412 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">In construing a statute, the paramount objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128, 1130 (1998); <em>Harris v. State, </em>344 Md. 497, 510, 687 A.2d 970, 976, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Koenig v. State, </em>U.S. , \u2014 U.S.-, 118 S.Ct. 605, 139 L.Ed.2d 492 (1997). \u201c[I]f the plain meaning of the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>is at an end.\u201d <em>Philip Electronics v. Wright, </em>348 Md. 209, 216-217, 703 A.2d 150, 153 (1997); <em>see Frank v. Baltimore County, </em>284 Md. 655, 661, 399 A.2d 250, 254 (1979). In other words, if the statutory language is clear, ordinarily this Court\u2019s function is simply to construe the provision in accordance with the plain meaning of the text. The words of the statute should be given their ordinary and commonly understood meaning. <em>Lerman v. Heeman, </em>347 Md. 439, 443, 701 A.2d 426, 428 (1997). In addition, because the statute is in derogation of the common law, it should be strictly construed. <em>MacBride v. Gulbro, </em>247 Md. 727, 729, 234 A.2d 586, 588 (1967); <em>see United States v. Bowman, </em>358 F.2d 421, 423 (3rd Cir.1966) (strictly construing Pennsylvania statutory accountant-client privilege); <em>McNair v. District Court, </em>110 Nev. 1285, 885 P.2d 576, 578 (1994) (construing accountant-client privilege narrowly).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Client communications to accountants are privileged in approximately one-third of the states. <em>See 8 </em>Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2286, at 533-34 n. 22 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961 &amp; 1998 Supp.) (citing and summarizing statutes); Francis M. Dougherty, Annotation, <em>Privileged Communications Between Accountant and Client, </em>33 A.L.R.4th 539 (1984 &amp; Sept. 1997 Supp.) (listing judicial decisions recognizing existence of accountant-client privilege by virtue of specific statutory enactment); <em>see generally </em>1 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 76.2, at 288 (J. Strong ed. 4th ed.1992). At common law, no accountant-client privilege existed, perhaps because the activities of the accounting profession were very limited in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when the common law recognized many of the present day privileges. <em>See In re Special Investigation No. 202, </em>53 Md.App. 96, 100, 452 A.2d 458, 460 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The purpose of the accountant-client privilege is to encourage free and open communication between the accountant and the client. <em>See id. </em>at 103, 452 A.2d at 462 (noting that the purpose of the privilege is to \u201cprotect the expectation of privacy of individuals in matters involving contracts, domestic disputes, and other civil matters and equity controversies\u201d); <em>see also Gearhart v. Etheridge, </em>232 Ga. 638, 208 S.E.2d 460, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>461 (1974) (noting that the purpose of the privilege is to ensure an atmosphere where the client will transmit all relevant information to the accountant without fear of future disclosure, thereby enabling the accountant to adequately perform his or her services); <em>People v. Paasche, </em>207 Mich. App. 698, 525 N.W.2d 914, 918 (1994) (noting that the purpose behind the Michigan statute recognizing the accountant-client privilege \u201cis to protect from disclosure the substance of the information conveyed by the client to the accountant\u201d). In creating the privilege, there is no indication that the Legislature intended to create an absolute privilege. Indeed, the privilege is subject to the statutory exceptions found at \u00a7 9-110(b), which provide that the privilege does not affect the bankruptcy laws, the criminal laws, or a regulatory proceeding by the Public Accountancy Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Section 9-110 regulates the conduct of the accountant, not the client, and is implicated when the accountant either voluntarily seeks to disclose, or is commanded to disclose, matters covered by the privilege. The plain language of the statute creating the privilege states that the accountant cannot disclose the contents of any communication or any information derived from the client without express permission by the client, by the personal representative of the client, or by the successor in interest of the client. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 580 (6th ed.1990) defines the word \u201cexpress\u201d as follows: \u201cClear; definite; explicit; plain; direct; unmistakable; not dubious or ambiguous. Declared in terms; set forth in words. Directly and distinctly stated. Made known distinctly and explicitly and not left to inference ... Manifested by direct and appropriate language, as distinguished from that which is inferred from conduct. The word is usually contrasted with \u2018implied\u2019.\u201d Similarly, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 803 (3rd ed.1963), defines \u201cexpress\u201d as \u201cdirectly and distinctly stated or expressed rather than implied or left to inference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The language of \u00a7 9-110 is clear and unambiguous. The statute dictates that, absent a valid waiver which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>discuss, <em>infra, </em>protected information may not be released by the accountant without the express permission of the client. Permission may not be implied. Courts may not create ambiguity in a statute where none exists, nor as a general rule, \u201csurmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or insert exceptions not made by the legislature.\u201d <em>Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49, 54 (1977); <em>see Wright, </em>348 Md. at 217, 703 A.2d at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Gussin did not expressly permit Ernst &amp; Young to disclose the information sought by Sears. Taken in the context of the deposition and the lawsuit as a whole, it is clear that Gussin did not intend to reveal any information or documents that he was not required by law to disclose. Thus, Gussin\u2019s actions cannot be interpreted as express permission. Gussin\u2019s statement, \u201cyou could ask them,\u201d merely permitted Sears to inquire whether Ernst &amp; Young held the documents, but did not permit Ernst &amp; Young to disclose the contents of those documents. <em>See Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 150-51, 345 A.2d 830, 846 (1975) (\u201c[W]e do not think that [Harrisonj\u2019s reply to the trial court when he stated \u2018I told my lawyer all about it\u2019 in response to the court\u2019s question concerning any attempt to further converse with [a witness], can be considered as constituting waiver of the [attorney-client] privilege. It was a general statement which did not disclose, or purport to disclose what words were used\u2014or what the conversation was\u2014nothing which was confidential was thereby revealed.\u201d). Nothing in Gussin\u2019s statement expressly permitted disclosure of the contents of any communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Sears argues that Gussin\u2019s express permission to speak to his accountants was a partial disclosure of privileged information, and as such, waives the statutory privilege notwithstanding the absence of express permission. <em>See Tofani v. State, </em>297 Md. 165, 173, 465 A.2d 413, 417 (1983) (\u201cWhere ... the reporter voluntarily and intentionally revealed the names of her sources in published news articles, nothing remains to be protected under the statute.\u201d). Sears argues that it is unfair to permit Gussin to insist on the privilege after such disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>sure. Sears also contends that because Gussin \u201cchose to be an obstructionist,\u201d and failed to answer the questions truthfully and in a straightforward manner, he waived the privilege by his actions. In response, Ernst &amp; Young contends that unlike other privileges, such as the attorney-client and doctor-patient privileges, the accountant-client privilege may be expressly waived only by the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The accountant-client privilege, like all other personal privileges, may be waived by the client\u2019s conduct. <em>See, e.g., Tofani, </em>297 Md. at 173, 465 A.2d at 417 (holding that reporter shield law, \u00a7 9-112 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, may be waived when reporter acts in a manner inconsistent with the statutory privilege or the intention to rely on it); <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 137-38, 345 A.2d at 839 (recognizing waiver by implication for attorney-client privilege); <em>see also In re Matthew R., </em>113 Md.App. 701, 707-09, 688 A.2d 955, 957-58 (1997) (addressing argument regarding waiver by implication for psychiatrist-patient privilege); Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 501.1, at 464 (1987) (\u201cAll privileges may be waived, but only by their holder.... \u201d). For example, the privilege may be waived by the client\u2019s disclosure to third parties. The accountant-client privilege may also be waived by issue injection by the client in a lawsuit, when the client injects the professional activity or the advice of an accountant as an issue in a particular case. <em>See In re Hillsborough Holdings Corp., </em>176 B.R. 223, 238-40 (M.D.Fla.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s broad interpretation of the privilege is not supported by law or policy. Were we to accept Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s argument that the accountant-client privilege can be waived <em>solely </em>by express permission, the result would be to elevate the accountant-client privilege to a higher status than most other privileges in Maryland, which may be waived by implication. The fair inference is that the General Assembly did not intend such an anomalous result when it enacted the accountant-client privilege. <em>See Lewis, </em>348 Md. at 662, 705 A.2d at 1135 (\u201cWe shall not interpret a statute to produce unusual or extraordinary results, absent the clear legislative intent to enact such a provision.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>that, although \u00a7 9-110 of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article regulates the circumstances under which an <em>accountant </em>must or must not divulge information possessed on behalf of a client, that statutory provision does not provide the governing principles regarding the <em>client\u2019s waiver </em>of the privilege. To discern the latter, we instead turn to common law principles regarding waiver. <em>See </em>McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 511.1, at 596 (\u201cLike other privileges, the accountant-client privilege may be waived by its holder\u2019s disclosing or consenting to disclosure of the privileged information to third parties outside the context of the privileged relationship.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In <em>Savino v. Luciano, </em>92 So.2d 817 (Fla.1957), the Supreme Court of Florida reached a similar conclusion. In that case, the plaintiff (\u201cSavino\u201d) filed a suit against the defendant (\u201cLuciano\u201d) for an accounting of profits allegedly due Savino under an employment contract. <em>Id. </em>at 818. Luciano filed both a cross-claim and a counterclaim, alleging that Savino had embezzled funds and \u201chad manipulated the books to show a net income where none existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In conjunction with his claims, Luciano averred that it would be necessary to engage a certified public accountant to \u201creconstruct the books\u201d of the business. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Luciano requested an award of damages as compensation for the fee charged by the accountant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Before trial, Savino sought discovery of the audit and report prepared by the accountant on behalf of Luciano. The latter resisted, on the ground that the accountant\u2019s audit and report were privileged and confidential. At that time, Florida recognized an accountant-client privilege as follows:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIF\">\u201c[N]o ... certified public accountant or public accountant shall be permitted to testify with respect to any of said matters, except with the <em>consent in writing </em>of [the] client or [the client\u2019s legal representative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 473.15 (1955) (emphasis added). In resolving Luciano\u2019s claim of accountant-client privilege, the court noted that \u201c[a]s in the case of all personal privileges, the accountant-client privilege may be waived by the client.\u201d <em>Savino, </em>92 So.2d at 819. Although the audit and report compiled by Luciano\u2019s accountant might, ordinarily, have been privileged under Florida law, the court reasoned that proof of Luciano\u2019s allegations would necessarily require the introduction of the audit and report into evidence. <em>Id. </em>The court held that Luciano had \u201ceither expressly or impliedly waived the right to insist upon the privileged nature ... of the audit and report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Florida concluded that, regardless of the degree of confidentiality generally afforded the client of an accountant, if a party engaged in activity which was clearly inconsistent with the exercise of a legal privilege, then that party waived the right to claim the privilege through his or her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Sears bears the burden of establishing any waiver of the accountant-client privilege. As a general rule, a party does not waive the privilege by denying the opposing party\u2019s accusations, or by acting in an obstreperous manner. In addition, a \u201c \u2018Court cannot justify finding a waiver of privileged information merely to provide the opposing party information helpful to its cross-examination or because information is relevant.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Hillsborough Holdings Corp., </em>176 B.R. at 239 (citing <em>Cox v. United States Steel &amp; Carnegie, </em>17 F.3d 1386, 1418 (11th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Remington Arms Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>142 F.R.D. 408, 415 (D.Del.1992)), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1110, 115 S.Ct. 900, 130 L.Ed.2d 784 (1995)). Although it has often been said that \u201c[w]hen a party himself ceases to treat a matter as confidential, it loses its confidential character,\u201d <em>Savino, </em>92 So.2d at 819, neither Gussin\u2019s conduct nor his statement suggest in any way that Gussin ceased to treat the documents as confidential. Merely \u201cbeing difficult\u201d is insufficient to waive the privilege. Moreover, Gussin\u2019s statement permitting Sears to ask Ernst &amp; Young if it had the records was not in the nature of a disclosure such that fairness would require that the privilege cease. We hold that Gussin did not waive the accountant-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Sears next argues that Gussin cannot rely on the accountant-client privilege because there is evidence of fraudulent activity by Gussin. Sears relies on the Court of Special Appeals opinion engrafting a \u201ccrime-fraud\u201d exception on the statutory accountant-client privilege. <em>See Dixon, </em>72 Md.App. 620, 531 A.2d 1318 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 557, 536 A.2d 664 (1988). Sears argues that the fraud exception recognized in <em>Dixon </em>should be extended to apply to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In <em>Dixon, </em>the Court of Special Appeals considered the applicability of the \u201cfraud exception\u201d to accountant-client communications and noted that \u201c[flederal courts have frequently held that communications that would otherwise be protected by the attorney-client privilege are not protected if they involve client communications in furtherance of contemplated or ongoing criminal or fraudulent conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639, 531 A.2d at 1327-28. The intermediate appellate court concluded that the same policy considerations underlying the decision to invalidate the accountant-client privilege in the face of potential criminal violations apply when the client may be involved in the perpetration of a fraud.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 640, 531 A.2d at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">This Court has not had the occasion to consider whether a fraud exception is applicable to the accountant-client privilege. In this case, we need not reach the question of whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\u201cfraud exception\u201d to the accountant-client privilege exists inasmuch as the facts in this case would not satisfy the application of the exception. Sears argues that it has made a <em>prima facie </em>showing of fraud. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Sears has not shown that there is a reasonable basis to suspect the perpetration of fraud or that the communications between Gussin and Ernst &amp; Young were in furtherance of any fraud. Sears was unable to show that there was any ongoing fraud, or that there had been any transfer of assets in violation of the Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or any other violations of the criminal or bankruptcy laws, as was the case in <em>Dixon. </em>The mere fact that in 1994, Gussin and his spouse reported $247,787 in investment income and that, in the mid-1980s, Gussin received $6.7 million, but now claims to have no assets, is not an adequate showing by Sears to sustain its burden of pleading a <em>prima facie </em>showing of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">We make no finding as to whether the documents in the possession of Ernst &amp; Young are in fact covered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>accountant-client privilege. Neither party argued below that the particular documents were not privileged and the trial court did not make any findings of fact on this issue. We note, however, that a client may not immunize otherwise discoverable materials from the reach of another party by transferring possession of those materials to an accountant. <em>See McNair v. District Court, </em>110 Nev. 1285, 885 P.2d 576, 579-80 (1994) (holding that accountant must produce documents because client would be compelled to produce the requested documents); <em>Paper Corp. of America v. Schneider, </em>563 So.2d 1134, 1135 (Fla.Ct.App.1990) (holding that \u201c[f]inancial records and data which are not privileged in the hands of the client cannot be shielded from discovery deposition or subpoena by transferring them to the client\u2019s accountant\u201d); <em>cf. Ashcraft v. Harvey, </em>315 So.2d 530, 531 (Fla.Ct.App.1975) (noting that a client\u2019s documents must be delivered from attorney if the client would be compelled to give up possession of the documents (citing 8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2307, at 591 (McNaughton rev. ed.1961))).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Since the decision in <em>Savino v. Luciano, </em>92 So.2d 817 (Fla.1957), the accountant-client privilege has been substantively modified under Florida law.

Dixon filed suit to recover assets transferred fraudulently or damages. During the discovery stage of the litigation, appellant sought production of documents from Rice's accountant.

The court in <em>Dixon </em>compared the privilege granted to lawyer-client, priest-penitent, and doctor-patient and held that the court should not grant greater protection to the statutorily based accountant-client privilege because the accountant-client privilege by statute is already subject to exceptions based on the criminal and bankruptcy laws of the State. In recognizing the fraud exception to the accountant-client privilege, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">To overcome a claim of privilege using the fraud exception, the seeker of the documents does not have to prove that the fraud has actually taken place.
