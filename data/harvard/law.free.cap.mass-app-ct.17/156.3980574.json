See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>269 Mass. 598, 606 (1930). We hold that the judge acted properly under Mass.R.Crim.P. 4(d), 378 Mass. 849 (1979), and affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment brought under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the statute was unconstitutional in that it permits conviction of a person who \u201csteals, buys, receives, possesses, conceals, or obtains control of a motor vehicle . . . having reason to know the same to have been stolen.\u201d The judge correctly perceived that a clause which permits the imposition of a severe penalty (as much as ten years in State prison) on a mere showing that a defendant had \u201creason to know\u201d the vehicle to have been stolen raises serious due process concerns. See <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>California, </em>355 U.S. 225, 228 (1957); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>354 Mass. 508, 510-512 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass. 228, 235 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 916 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 362-365 (1982). (The discussion of the \u201cprobability of knowledge standard\u201d in notes 6 and 7 of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, supra </em>at 235 &amp; 236, is of particular relevance.)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">To avoid these difficulties, the judge ruled (1) that he would charge the jury that in order to convict the defendant they had to find that the defendant actually knew the car was stolen, and (2) that the indictment would not be sent to the jury, but would be read to them by the clerk with the offending language deleted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The defendant claims that: (1) the judge erred in not dismissing the indictment because of the unconstitutionality of the statute, and (2) by amending the indictment the judge materially altered the process of the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>1. The flaw in the defendant\u2019s first argument is that he has not shown that the remaining portions of the statute under which he was indicted must fall even if a portion, added in 1980, is invalid. No claim can be made that the 1980 addition is \u201cso connected to the rest that they are dependent on each other\u201d or that \u201cthe valid part, if left alone, would . . . change the character of the . . . statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petranich, </em>183 Mass. 217, 220 (1903). \u201c[W]here a statutory provision is unconstitutional, if it is in its nature separable from the other parts of the statute, so that they may well stand independently of it, and if there is no such connection between the valid and the invalid parts that the Legislature would not be expected to enact the valid part without the other, the statute will be held good, except in that part which is in conflict with the Constitution.\u201d <em>Ibid. Mayor of Boston v. Treasurer &amp; Recr. Gen., </em>384 Mass. 718, 725 (1981). 2 Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 44.04 (4th ed. 1973). Accordingly, we conclude that the words inserted by St. 1980, c. 463, \u00a7 4, even if offending, do not defeat the remainder of c. 266, \u00a7 28(a). See <em>Krupp </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Newton, </em>325 Mass. 686, 692 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">2. Somewhat more plausible, but also without force, is the defendant\u2019s claim that the judge impermissibly interfered with the integrity of the grand jury by omitting from the petit jury\u2019s consideration the deleted portion of the indictment. Like the parties, we treat the action of the judge as equivalent to an amendment \u201cupon his own motion,\u201d see Mass.R.Crim.P. 4(d), 378 Mass. 849 (1979),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and recognize that no amendment to an indictment can be made as to a matter of substance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>269 Mass. at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">A test to ascertain if a change is a matter of substance is whether a judgment of conviction or acquittal on the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ment as originally drawn would be a bar to the new indictment as amended. <em>Id. </em>at 609-610. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Binkiewicz, </em>342 Mass. 740, 748 (1961). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 852 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michaud, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 471, 473 (1982), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 389 Mass. 491 (1983). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863, 870 n.8, 871 (1982). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, a judgment on the original indictment would be a bar to the indictment as amended. Where the statute disjunctively prescribes a kind of scienter, that is, knowing <em>or </em>having reason to know, each of which is alleged in the indictment (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>\u201cthen the Commonwealth may prove the violation of the statute by proof of [either] . . . and the defendant could not be prejudiced if the Commonwealth limited its proof\u201d to one. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>304 Mass. 320, 322 (1939). There is here but one offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>121 Mass. 374 (1876); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michaud, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The amendment did not broaden the charges, see <em>Stirone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 215-216 (1960); cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 646-650 (1980); nor did it present the defendant with issues he was not already prepared to meet. See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 763-764 (1962). The deletion merely forced the Commonwealth to a more stringent standard. As stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiStasio, </em>294 Mass. 273, 278 (1936), cert, denied, 302 U.S. 683 (1937), \u201cThe amendment did not change the substance of the crime charged, but restricted the Commonwealth in its proof, to the advantage of the defendant, in much the same way as might have been done by specifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-15\"> As appearing in St. 1980, c. 463, \u00a7 4, \u00a7 <em>28(a) </em>reads: \u201cWhoever steals, buys, receives, possesses, conceals, or obtains control of a motor vehicle or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>trailer, knowing <em>or having reason to know </em>the same to have been stolen, or whoever takes a motor vehicle without the authority of the owner and steals from it any of its parts or accessories, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years or by imprisonment in jail or house of correction for not more than two and one-half years or by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars, or both\u201d (emphasis supplied).
