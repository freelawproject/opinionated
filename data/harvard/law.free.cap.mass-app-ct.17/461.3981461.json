The defendant was arrested and charged with operating a motorized bicycle (moped) upon a public way while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. He filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, contending that because G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1976, c. 261, \u00a7 3, specifically excludes \u201cmotorized bicycles\u201d from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d as that term is used throughout the chapter, a person cannot properly be charged with operating such a vehicle while under the influence of liquor. His motion was denied, and he was convicted and sentenced. The denial of his motion is the sole issue raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">The operation of \u201cmotorized bicycles\u201d on the public ways in the Commonwealth is governed by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 IB, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>serted by St. 1976, c. 261, \u00a7 4. The statute requires that an operator must be at least sixteen years of age and possess a valid driver\u2019s license or learner\u2019s permit. The statute forbids operation of motorized bicycles at speeds in excess of twenty-five miles per hour and specifically states that an operator is \u201csubject to the traffic laws and regulations of the commonwealth.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ceria, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 233 n.3 (1982). At the same time that it inserted G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 IB, the Legislature specifically excluded motorized bicycles from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d as used throughout c. 90. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1976, c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 2 &amp; 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">By inserting G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 IB, the Legislature demonstrated its concern with the operation of motorized bicycles on the ways in the Commonwealth. To protect the safety of the operator and also that of the general public, the statute establishes minimum age and licensing standards to insure that operators \u201care familiar with rules of the road and the safe operation of the vehicle.\u201d Weiss, The Regulation of Mopeds: A Legislative Proposal, 13 New Eng. L. Rev. 303, 320-322 (1977). In addition, the Legislature made operators of motorized bicycles subject to the \u201ctraffic laws\u201d of the Commonwealth. In so doing, the Legislature manifested its intention to make those portions of c. 90 that are concerned with <em>operation, </em>such as G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 <em>24(1)(a), </em>also apply to operators of motorized bicycles. We see nothing in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giannino, </em>371 Mass. 700, 703 (1977), to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Therefore, we hold that the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was properly denied. We add that a contrary result would violate the rule of statutory construction that \u201ca statute should be construed in a fashion which promotes its purpose and renders it an effectual piece of legislation in harmony with common sense and sound reason.\u201d <em>Worcester Vocational Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7-8 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
