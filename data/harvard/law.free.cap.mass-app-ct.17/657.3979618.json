About 8 p.m. Officers Hepburn and Nichols were there on duty. Mandile, a \u201ctrusty,\u201d had been outside his cell sweeping and had managed to turn off the switch which controlled the alarm. Another prisoner, Louis McGrath, also was outside his cell. Mandile suddenly ran toward the officers brandishing a sharpened thick piece of steel over a foot long, which he pressed to the neck of one of them. McGrath, at Mandile\u2019s direction, handcuffed Officer Hepburn. Mandile took Officer Hepburn\u2019s keys, and the two officers were locked in a cell. When the officers were able to leave the cell, Mandile and McGrath were not in the institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Mandile stayed with unidentified acquaintances in Malden. He was arrested on April 11, 1980. At trial he testified that, while not in custody, he took no action at all to let any government authority know where he was or the reason why he had escaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Mandile had been a witness against one Ronald MacDonald at the latter\u2019s trial for murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacDonald (No. 1) said (No. 2), </em>368 Mass. 395, 396-397; and 403, 405-408 (1975). At trial in the present case he testified that following the murder trial he had difficulty protecting himself while in confinement, and had received on the very day of his escape word of threats by a cousin of MacDonald. In 1977, on furlough, he had been attacked and seriously injured by friends of MacDonald. In his opinion, his complaints for greater protection from correction authorities did not receive satisfactory attention. Captain Ward of the Suffolk County sheriff\u2019s department testified that he had seen Mandile in 1977 at Deer Island \u201call bandaged up\u201d and with \u201c[h]is head banged in,\u201d and that \u2018 \u2018 [o]ver the years\u2019 \u2019 Mandile had been \u2018 \u2018more or less\u2019 \u2019 in protective custody (see <em>Blaney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>374 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Mass. 337, 339, 341-342 [1978]) because of \u201cenemies\u201d among inmates. Mandile himself testified to his difficulties in obtaining a transfer to a place of confinement safe for him. His defense at trial was that his escape was a matter of necessity for self-protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">1. The trial judge instructed the jury on the defense of \u2018 \u2018necesity\u201d in relation to escape from custody in language largely based upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Lovercamp, </em>43 Cal.App. 3d 823, 831-832 (1974), as quoted in Commonwealth v. <em>Thurber, </em>383 Mass. 328, 330 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth v. O\u2019Malley, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 314, 319 (1982), which summarized the effect of the <em>Thurber </em>case as drawing attention to \u201ca formulation of the defense [of necessity] which requires the presence of five specified circumstances\u201d mentioned in the <em>Lovercamp </em>case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the <em>Thurber </em>case (at 330-331), the court went on to say that, if the court should \u2018 \u2018apply the doctrine [of necessity] as a justification for escape in a proper case, we think . . . [the Lovercamp] circumstances should at least be taken into account.\u201d Mandile contends that the trial judge in his charge overstated the <em>Lover-camp </em>circumstances, converting them into \u201cessential elements of a defense, the absence of one of which causes the defense to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The judge\u2019s charge included the following: \u201c[C]ompulsion to escape may negate a criminal purpose .... [Necessity may justify an escape. ... If there is evidence that would warrant a reasonable doubt whether the escape was justified by necessity, then the burden ... is on the Commonwealth to prove that this escape was not justified.\u201d The judge then pointed out that the Commonwealth must prove that Mandile was \u2018 \u2018a legal prisoner at a penal institution,\u201d that he left \u201cthe premises without per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>mission, and [that] there was no necessity.\u201d The charge proceeded, \u201cNow, what may you <em>consider </em>in determining the justification. There are five aspects to it\u201d (emphasis supplied). The five <em>Lovercamp </em>circumstances were then stated by the judge. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">As to Mandile\u2019s actions after leaving Deer Island, the judge instructed that, if the jury found that Mandile attained a place safe from immediate threat, when \u201che reached Malden, then . . . [they] must consider, did he immediately report to the proper authorities. . . . [A]n action is justified by necessity only so far as necessity requires it. It is for you to determine whether . .. [Mandile] had attained a position of safety before his recapture ... a few days afterwards. . . . [I]f you find the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of any of those ... five elements, then the Commonwealth has proved the absence of necessity that would justify an escape.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge charged correctly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In the <em>Thurber </em>case, 383 Mass. at 332, reference was made to the fact that the trial judge, whose charge was then being reviewed, \u201cinstructed the jury that necessity means that the . . . [escaped prisoner] must report to the proper authorities as soon as he is in a position of safety\u2019 \u2019 and declined to add \u2018 \u2018that it was for the jury to decide when, and if at all, the cause of the neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>sity had terminated.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The instruction given was approved when taken in connection with another instruction \u201cthat it was for the jury to determine the facts. \u2019 \u2019 The trial judge in the present case fully complied with the <em>Thurber </em>decision and left the facts for determination of the jury. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 322-325, where the whole defense of necessity was prevented on a prosecutor\u2019s pretrial motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The trial judge, after his original charge, instructed, perhaps too broadly, that if the jury should \u2018 \u2018find that... Mandile is not guilty ... of escape and . . . that he only used such force as was reasonable and necessary to effectuate that escape,\u201d then the jury \u201cwould be warranted in finding him not guilty of assault and battery on a correction officer.\u201d Despite this favorable instruction (the propriety of which we do not decide), the jury found Mandile guilty of such an assault (on an indictment tried with the present escape charge), an indication that the jury had found evidence of another aspect of the <em>Lovercamp </em>principles, viz., force or violence used toward prison personnel. See Note 2, clause (4), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">2. Mandile, in the presence of the jury, refused during cross-examination to answer the prosecutor\u2019s questions about the names of the persons in Malden with whom he stayed after his escape. His counsel objected to the questions. Mandile had denied any effort on the night of his escape to call Deer Island or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>any correction official to let them know where he was. Applying the principles discussed in the <em>Thurber </em>case, the trial judge ruled that the question was relevant and, because Mandile had testified, was not open to a Fifth Amendment claim of privilege. The judge ordered the question answered, but no answer was given. The question was relevant in view of Mandile\u2019s attempt to prove necessity as a defense in the very proceeding in which he was testifying. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, </em>388 Mass. 453, 457 (1983). He, by testifying in that proceeding, had waived his privilege against self-incrimination as to questions on cross-examination relevant and material to the charge, on which he then was being tried. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>327 Mass. 491, 493-494 (1951); Liacos, Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence 206 (5th ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">3. Officer Hepburn, on cross-examination, was asked whether he knew that Mandile \u2018 \u2018had some problems with inmates\u201d at Deer Island. The question was excluded as not material. Defense counsel then invited the judge\u2019s attention to the <em>Thurber </em>case, 383 Mass. at 330, but the judge stated that he would \u201cexclude the question <em>at this </em>time\u201d (emphasis supplied). Defense counsel then made a brief offer of proof that Officer Hepburn \u201cdid know of Mandile\u2019 s problems with various inmates. \u2019 \u2019 Thereafter, Mandile himself testified about threats made to him. Testimony about such threats and risks of harm to Mandile also was given by Captain Ward, called by Mandile. Officer Hepburn was not recalled as a witness by Mandile after the Commonwealth had rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We assume (without deciding) that Mandile should have been allowed to inquire further about Officer Hepburn\u2019s knowledge of threats against Mandile, although defense counsel perhaps could have made known to the judge more clearly the precise legal basis of his inquiry. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britland, </em>300 Mass. 492, 496-497 (1938); Mass.R.Crim.P. 22, 378 Mass. 892 (1979). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 889 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCreary, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 694-698 (1981). We view any error as harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, especially in view of the other testimony on the subject, the failure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Mandile to recall Officer Hepburn after the judge had opportunity to study the <em>Thurber </em>case, and the circumstance that Officer Hepburn\u2019s testimony would have had no direct relevance to Mandile\u2019s attack on him during the escape or to Mandile\u2019s failure to get in touch with the authorities promptly after his escape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanger, </em>377 Mass. 503, 510-511 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-15\"> Section 16 reads in part, \u201cA prisoner who escapes ... from any penal institution ... or from the custody of any officer thereof. . . may be pursued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>and recaptured and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years or by imprisonment in a . . . house of correction for not more than two and one half years. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\"> As quoted in the <em>Thurber </em>case (at 330), the <em>Lovercamp </em>circumstances (in part) were \u201c(l)The prisoner is faced with a specific threat of death... or substantial bodily injury <em>in the immediate future-, </em>(2) There is no time for a complaint to the authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints . . .; (3) There is no time ... to resort to the courts; (4) There is no evidence of force or violence used towards prison personnel... in the escape; and (5) The prisoner immediately reports to the proper authorities when he has attained a position of safety from the <em>immediate threat\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\"> Defense counsel objected somewhat generally to this portion of the charge and noted a particular but somewhat ambiguous objection to the judge\u2019s refusal \u201cto instruct the jury that, if they reasonably believe that he was not in a position of safety . ..
