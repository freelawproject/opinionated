We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">1. <em>The Prisoner\u2019s Dock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The day before trial was to commence, counsel for the defendant and D\u2019Agata asked that they be seated during their trial in the same fashion as defendants released on bail, that is, \u201cjust . . . outside the dock, rather than sitting in the dock.\u201d Their request was taken up at a lobby conference. The trial judge considered the facts that the defendant \u201cwas serving time in Florida,\u201d that he also had been defaulted three times, that he had received a notice to surrender on two probation matters, and that D\u2019Agata, who was on parole at the time of the present offenses, was awaiting trial on charges of armed robbery and escape. The trial judge concluded that there were \u201creasonable grounds ... to anticipate that there could be problems if they were removed from the dock.\u201d He went on to state: \u201cI will also articulate one further reason, that I will not make you privy to, but I will impound it so that the appellate court may have the benefit of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">At the conclusion of the lobby conference and in the absence of the defendant, D\u2019Agata, and their attorneys, the trial judge stated for the record the additional basis for his decision to use the prisoner\u2019s dock. That morning, the trial judge related, the court officer in charge of the session had informed him that the sheriff s department had sent word that the defendant \u201cmight attempt to flee.\u201d The trial judge explained that he would not make that information public but would instead impound the record of his statement because \u201c[t]he source of the information . . . would appear to be a source, the disclosure of which could result in physical harm to the informant.\u201d The trial judge expressly found the information was an additional basis and that he \u201cwould have reached the same result in any event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The defendant made several requests throughout the course of the trial to be advised of the trial judge\u2019s additional reason to have the defendant in the dock. The trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>assured defense counsel that it had nothing to do with \u201cany evidence in this case,\u201d that the defendant\u2019s appellate rights had been preserved, and that disclosure of defense counsel would be made \u201cafter the case is over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Upon the jury\u2019s return of the verdicts, the trial judge held a second lobby conference and advised defense counsel that, although he was about to reveal the requested information, defense counsel was not to disclose the matter to the defendant. The trial judge then told counsel that the sheriff had informed a court officer that a conversation to the effect that there might be an attempt to escape during the defendant\u2019s trial had been overheard at a house of correction. The trial judge stated that he took no position on whether there was any truth in the conversation; rather, he had acted in the interests of security and relied on his experience that when potential escapes \u201care a problem . . . they usually come from the back of the courtroom, and it takes about a minute or so.\u201d He explained that in considering the facilities, the personnel, and \u201cthe physical structure that is here, and that I am here, as well as you . . . [i]t seemed prudent to close the doors over behind the bar enclosure . . . and to make use of . . . the dock, just so that we then had about thirty seconds worth of warning.\u201d The impoundment order was lifted in June of 1983, at the Commonwealth\u2019s request in light of the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The defendant argues that the recited facts establish that the trial judge failed to follow the \u201cmore circumspect procedures\u201d set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>364 Mass. 471, 478-480 (1973). We see no error in the trial judge\u2019s decision that some security measures were necessary and that the dock was the least restrictive measure available. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>379 Mass. 106, 111 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The reasons for the trial judge\u2019s decision to employ security measures are fully disclosed on the record. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>364 Mass. at 479; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>379 Mass. at 111. We consider first the need for those measures. The trial judge more than once stated that he had two separate and distinct bases for his action, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>fendant\u2019s criminal record and the multi-level hearsay conversation. However, in reviewing the trial judge\u2019s decision, we look to the circumstances as a totality and do not consider whether the defendant\u2019s record alone would justify use of the prisoner\u2019s dock.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant was serving a prison sentence in Florida at the time of trial, he had a history of defaults, the crimes for which he was being tried involved violence, his codefendant had been convicted of violent crimes and escape, and the trial judge had been alerted to a conversation concerning the possibility of an escape. It is of no consequence that the conversation was hearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>364 Mass. at 479 (\u201cordinary rules of admissibility need not be observed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Though <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown </em>advises that \u201ca judge who contemplates approving such measures should state his reasons (including recommendations received from the custodial authority) in the presence of counsel and defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>. . . [and] [i]f fact questions arise, they should be thrashed out,\u201d we think the rule flexible enough to be tailored to meet a situation such as that here presented, provided a record is made. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">It is obvious from the record that the trial judge was concerned with security. We cannot fault him for his apprehension about the alleged informant\u2019s safety (should disclosure be made) and, hence, making his decision about the dock without \u201cthrashing out\u201d the truth of the conversation. This is not a case where the trial judge delegated his authority to custodial personnel, see e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>431 F.2d 610, 615 (4th Cir. 1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>86 N.J. Super. 159 (1965), or violated the defendant\u2019s absolute right to be present and heard on the matter, see e.g., <em>LaChappelle </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>699 F.2d 560, 565 (1st Cir. 1983); <em>Proffitt </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>685 F.2d 1227, 1256 (11th Cir. 1982) (citing <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105-106 [1934]), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1003 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dupont, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 573 (1974), and cases therein cited. We conclude that the record contains a sufficient showing that some security measures were necessary, and we next consider whether the dock was \u201cthe least restrictive measure available.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>379 Mass. at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The only information appearing in the record on the issue of least restrictive means is the trial judge\u2019s statement to counsel at the second lobby conference \u2014 that in reaching his decision he had considered the facilities, the personnel, \u201cthe physical structure that is here,\u201d and the time needed to thwart an attempt to escape. Although this statement is perhaps more conclusory than descriptive, defense counsel neither questioned nor challenged it, notwithstanding his opportunity so to do at that time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Because the statement was made after the jury had returned its verdicts, the defendant describes this portion of the transcript as <em>\u201cpost hoc </em>justification\u201d for the use of the dock. We think that characterization unwarranted, especially in view of trial counsel\u2019s own failure to qualify the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the facilities and personnel. Moreover, that statement is consistent with (and expansive of) the concern for security which the trial judge read into the record at the conclusion of the pretrial lobby conference. While completed subsequent to the verdicts, the record was established sufficiently close in time to the actual events so as not to be susceptible to attack as a reconstruction of facts and reasons made after a time span which could \u201cerode[ ] evidence and memory.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>364 Mass. at 478. We cannot say on this record that the trial judge\u2019s conclusion, that less restrictive means were unsatisfactory or unavailable, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Assuming, for purposes of decision, that the record on this point is less than clear, we see no risk of prejudice to the defendant. The trial judge gave a forceful instruction to the jury on the presumption of innocence, warning that they were to draw no inference adverse to the defendant from \u201cmatters of no consequence,\u201d such as the facts that he \u201cmay have been arrested or inquired of,\u201d that he \u201cmay have been at some station house or courthouse,\u201d that \u201cthe grand jury has made an accusation,\u201d that he \u201cis here at the bar,\u201d or that he \u201cis in the dock.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>379 Mass. at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">2. <em>Duplicitous Convictions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The defendant claims duplication in the charges against him under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B (assault by means of a dangerous weapon), and G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18A (entering a dwelling while armed with a dangerous weapon and therein assaulting another with the intent to commit a felony). He isolates the weapon and assault elements of each of the statutes to argue that \u00a7 15B is a lesser included offense of \u00a7 18A.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">To support a conviction under \u00a7 15B, the Commonwealth must show that the threat of harm was by means of a dan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>gerous weapon. Under \u00a7 18A, although the defendant must be armed with a dangerous weapon at the time of the entry of the dwelling, there is no requirement that a weapon be used in the necessary assault. It is, however, essential to a conviction under \u00a7 18A (but not \u00a7 15B) that the Commonwealth prove that the threat of harm was made with a specific intent to commit a felony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connors, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1005, 1007 (1982). See generally Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7\u00a7 323 &amp; 324 (1976). \u201cThus each indictment required proof of at least one fact not required for proof of the other indictment.\u201d <em>Salemme </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>370 Mass. 421, 424 (1976). See also <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 501 n.5 (1981) (\u201cAs long as the proof of the elements of the offenses requires different facts, an overlap in the facts offered to establish the crimes is not significant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The defendant\u2019s convictions are not duplicitous in either a technical or a real sense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 662-663 (1979). When the occupants of the apartment heard their front door being banged upon with the baseball bat and smashed open, they ran into a bedroom and shut and held the bedroom door in a futile attempt to protect themselves from the defendant and D\u2019Agata, who, still armed with the bat, pushed open that second door. The occupants were then threatened with a knife as the room was ransacked in a search for pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-15\"> D\u2019Agata was indicted on identical charges to which he pleaded guilty on the second day of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-16\"> The defendant was also convicted on an indictment charging him with malicious injury to personal property. That conviction, however, was placed on file and is not before us. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 438 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\"> There is dispute as to whether at the time of his ruling the trial judge had a complete and accurate understanding of the defendant\u2019s criminal record. The trial judge stated that in reaching his decision he had read the defendant\u2019s history of convictions. It is on this basis that the Commonwealth asked a single justice of this court for leave to supplement the record under Mass.R.A.P. 8(e), as appearing in 378 Mass. 934 (1979), by including a copy of the defendant\u2019s criminal record. Counsel for the defendant (who was not trial counsel) opposed the motion on the ground that the proffered criminal record contains entries made subsequent to the defendant\u2019s trial and provides that the information therein recited \u201cis not certified [and] ... is for [probation] office use only.\u201d The single justice referred the motion to the panel assigned to decide the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Although we think it could be inferred from certain statements made by the trial judge and the defendant\u2019s trial attorney that the defendant\u2019s entire criminal record had been considered by the trial judge at the time of his ruling, it is unnecessary for us to pass upon the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. We think the trial judge\u2019s decision to use the prisoner\u2019s dock is supported by the combination of the defendant\u2019s criminal convictions as they appear in the unsupplemented record <em>and </em>the hearsay conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">We note, however, that the trial judge is in a far better position than we to pass upon a motion under rule 8(e) when the accuracy of the events sought to be reflected in the record is in dispute. It would have been more appropriate for the Commonwealth to have presented its motion to the trial judge. See generally <em>Bechtel </em>v. <em>Paul Clark, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 692-695 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> In his brief, the defendant argues that the trial judge could have had the alleged informant placed in protective custody or transferred to another house of correction. Although these alternatives might have relieved the trial judge of any worry about the informant\u2019s safety upon disclosure of the conversation, they would have done nothing to diminish his concern for courthouse security in the event of an escape attempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
