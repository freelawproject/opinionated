L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(c), inserted by St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4. Each received a sentence of from five to seven years at M.C.I., Walpole.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">1. The defendants\u2019 motions to suppress the introduction of sixty-five glossine bags containing a heroin mixture were properly denied. The defendants argue suppression was required because the search warrant was issued on less than probable cause,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and put this argument in terms of the two-pronged test of <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 112-116 (1964), and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 415-416 (1969). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vynorius, </em>369 Mass. 17, 20 (1975). However, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Illi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>nois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213 (1983), recently adopted a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach in which the informant\u2019s veracity and basis of knowledge are still important but are not elements indispensible to a finding of probable cause where the tip is adequately corroborated. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>390 Mass. 562, 568-574 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nowells, </em>390 Mass. 621, 626 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Regardless of which of these tests is applied in this case, the affidavit here was more than adequate to support a finding of probable cause. Understandably, neither defendant contests the credibility of the informant (contrast <em>Upton, supra </em>at 569-570) for, as the affidavit avers, the informant had given reliable information in the past which had led to one conviction and to an arrest for violations of drug laws. The first-hand character of the informant\u2019s knowledge is evident from the face of the affidavit. (\u201cThe informant further stated that <em>Rojas told him </em>he would be back late tonight or early in the morning . . . and that the informant would be able to purchase heroin at that time. When <em>he last saw </em>Rojas he [Rojas] was operating a 1974 Chevrolet Malibu station wagon green in color.\u201d [Emphasis added.]) Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 876, 877 (1978) (nothing in tip itself showing basis of knowledge) . We may fault the affidavit for failing to specify the precise time and place of the offer, but that is not dispositive (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>362 Mass. 74, 76 [1972]), for the information, particularly as to the departure of the vehicle, was exceptionally detailed (departure time of 1:45 p.m. on July 17th, description of vehicle, exact registration number). Contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertions, the existence of a controlled delivery is not essential to justify the issuance of an anticipatory warrant. See, e.g., <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 217. Nor need an affidavit always be corroborated by police investigation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanague, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 889 (1977). At bottom, the facts alleged in the affidavit \u2014 which was in large part comprised of Rojas\u2019 own statements to a reliable informant giving some detailed matter \u2014 created a substantial proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>bility that the seizable property would be in the vehicle when searched. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>384 Mass. 145, 155 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 194, 197-199 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Moreover, the search could be justified on the alternative basis (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>374 Mass. 132, 140 [1977] , aff\u2019d by an equally divided Court, 439 U.S. 280 [1978] ), that probable cause and exigent circumstances existed justifying a warrantless search of the vehicle. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 246 (1983). The reliable informant information was corroborated the next morning when police officers, who were conducting a surveillance for Rojas, sighted a green Chevrolet Malibu station wagon at a time, and headed in a direction, predicted by the informant. Even if there had previously been a question as to probable cause, it disappeared at the time Lieutenant Blouin, the affiant, recognized Rojas in the vehicle. See <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307 (1959). The ensuing search fell within the scope of a permissible automobile search. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 823-825 (1982). <em>King, supra </em>at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">2. Rojas\u2019 motion for a required finding of not guilty challenged the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on two elements of an offense under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(c): knowledge and possession. \u201cPossession implies \u2018control and power,\u2019. . . exclusive or joint, ... or, in the case of \u2018constructive possession,\u2019 knowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deagle, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 567 (1980) (citations omitted). While constructive possession may be proven by circumstantial evidence, \u201cto warrant a finding of possession of contraband, \u2018it is not enough to place the defendant and the contraband in the same car\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566-567, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Here, there was evidence of the following at both trials: (1) at the time the vehicle was stopped by New Bedford police, four individuals sat in the vehicle \u2014 Rosa (driver), his girlfriend (front passenger\u2019s seat), Rojas (back seat behind driver) and his girlfriend (\u201cluggage area in back of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>seat\u201d); (2) a manila package containing ninety-two grams of a heroin mixture was found in the panel of the driver\u2019s door; (3) the panel had been disassembled during the officer\u2019s search with the use of a Phillips head screwdriver found in the \u201crear tire well\u201d; and (4) Rojas had rented the vehicle the previous day from a New Bedford rental agency. In addition, evidence of inculpatory statements that could have been found to have been made by Rojas were admitted at his trial. At that trial, a New Bedford officer testified that when he approached Rojas to conduct a \u201cskin search,\u201d Rojas said \u201cwe had all the drugs \u2014 we had all the drugs that were in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The jury were warranted in finding from Rojas\u2019 single statement that Rojas knew of the existence and contents of the manila envelope. Furthermore, that Rojas had rented the car the day earlier, was present in the car when the contraband was found, and later made a statement from which knowledge could be inferred, warranted the jury in concluding that Rojas possessed the contraband. See <em>Commonwealth v. Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 134-135 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 299 (1977). Contrast <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 370 (1975); <em>Commonwealth v. Duffy, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 655 (1976). After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational jury could have found the essential elements of knowledge and possession beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth v. Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">3. Rosa contends that use of the term \u201cmixture\u201d to define the offense proscribed by G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(c), is unconstitutionally vague because \u201ca grain of heroin on a stretch of beach could make the entire area subject to controlled substance legislation\u201d and because the \u201cstatute does not suggest whether components of the mixture must combine in a new form or may retain their separate properties.\u201d However, in this case there was evidence suggesting that the quantitative percentage of the mixture was 2.2% heroin and that the mixture was useable as heroin in this potency. Thus, \u201c[a]t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>least as applied to these defendants, we see no unconstitutional ambiguity in the word \u2018mixture\u2019 in the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>389 Mass. 866, 869 (1983). See <em>Lavelle </em>v. <em>State, </em>250 Ga. 224, 226 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">4. Rojas\u2019 equal protection argument was disposed of adversely to him in <em>Beverly, supra </em>at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">5. Among other contentions in these appeals, the defendants argue that the penalty provision of clause 1 of \u00a7 32E(c), as inserted by St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4, under which each defendant was sentenced, violates due process. See now St. 1982, c. 650, \u00a7 11. Applying the reasoning of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrone, </em>387 Mass. 702, 704-707 (1982), which invalidated clause 3 of the same section, we agree that \u201cit would be sheer conjecture on our part to conclude that the Legislature meant the [five-year] term to be either the maximum term or the minimum term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 335 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Varney, </em>391 Mass. 34, 45-47 (1984). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>390 Mass. 763, 764-765 (1984). The same rationale which dissuaded the <em>Marrone </em>court from reading only the word \u201cmaximum\u201d into clause 3 applies with equal force to reading only the word \u201cminimum\u201d into clause 1. Also, the Commonwealth\u2019s prescription to cure the ambiguity in clause 1 (that clause 1 \u201ccan only be construed as a mandatory minimum sentence\u201d) carries the side effect of rendering clause 1 superfluous to the main paragraph. The defendants succeed on this issue, but not on any other. Accordingly, the verdicts are to stand but we vacate the sentences and remand both cases for re-sentencing under the general provisions of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(c), inserted by St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>389 Mass. at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-11\"> Paragraph two of the affidavit averred: \u201cA reliable informant, who proved himself reliable in the past, and his information led to the arrest and conviction of [a named person] in 1981 and the arrest in 1981 of [a named person] for violations of the Controlled Substance Laws. At 2:00 P.M. on this date my informant telephoned me and stated that one Ramon Rojas, dob 3/23/50, having a last known address of 874 Shawmut Ave.; left New Bedford at 1:45 P.M. this afternoon en route to New York City to purchase a large amount of heroin. The informant further stated that Rojas told him he would be back late tonight or early in the morning (7/18/81) and that the informant would be able to purchase heroin at that time. When he last saw Rojas he (Rojas) was operating a 1974 Chevrolet Malibu station wagon green in color and stated that this is what he was driving to New York. The vehicle bore Ma. Reg. #262-BVE.\u201d The affidavit also disclosed that the police had determined that the vehicle was registered to a local automobile rental agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
