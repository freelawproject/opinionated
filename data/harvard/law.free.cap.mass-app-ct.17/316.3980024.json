In the present suit Sterilite sought a declaration that Continental was obliged to undertake its defense in a third-party action in which it was named as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">More particularly: Henry Heide, Inc. (Heide), purchased from WRH Products Co., Inc. (WRH), for a price of about $100,000, some 23,130 plastic \u201cstarch trays,\u201d i.e., trays carrying starch, to be used in the process of candy manufacture. On July 21, 1975, Heide commenced an action in Federal court against WRH, as seller; Sterilite, as manufacturer of the trays; and Dow Chemical Company, as supplier of material entering into the composition of the trays, claiming damages of not less than $600,000 for property damages arising from alleged defects in the trays.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notified by Sterilite of the pending action, Continental provisionally assumed the defense on Sterilite\u2019s behalf, then on August 21, 1975, disclaimed responsibility with regard to any damage to the trays,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and subsequently, on January 5, 1976, disclaimed all responsibility. Accordingly, Sterilite started to defend itself in Heide\u2019s action by engaging and compensating counsel of its own choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">On October 20, 1980, with the Heide action still pending, Sterilite brought the present declaratory suit. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. A judge of the Supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>rior Court, holding for Sterilite, declared that Continental was in breach of its duty to defend the Heide action on behalf of Sterilite, that it was liable for the counsel fees and related expenses already incurred by Sterilite to the time of judgment (fixed at $108,370.74), and was obligated for the future either to undertake the defense itself or to reimburse Sterilite the further expenses of suit. Continental appeals. We modify the disposition in one particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">1. It is settled in this jurisdiction, and generally elsewhere, that the question of the initial duty of a liability insurer to defend third-party actions against the insured is decided by matching the third-party complaint with the policy provisions: if the allegations of the complaint are \u201creasonably susceptible\u201d of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense. See <em>Vappi &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>348 Mass. 427, 431 (1965); <em>Magoun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>346 Mass. 677, 681-682 (1964); <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 166 (1983). See also 7C Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4683 (rev. ed. 1979); 14 Rhodes, Couch\u2019s Cyclopedia of Insurance Law \u00a7 51.42 (2d ed. rev. 1982); 1 Long, Law of Liability Insurance \u00a7 5.03 (1981); Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 4.01 (1982); Annot., 50 A.L.R. 2d 458 (1956).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Otherwise stated, the process is one of envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of the allegations of the complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy. See <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. Co., </em>65 Cal.2d 263, 274-277 (1966). See also <em>Baybutt Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>455 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>A.2d 914, 921-922 (Me. 1983). Cf. <em>Green Bus Lines </em>v. <em>Consolidated Mut. Ins. Co., </em>74 A.D.2d 136, 144, appeal denied, 52 N.Y.2d 701 (1980). Upon such analysis, we agree with the trial judge that there was enough in the Heide complaint to invoke the duty of the insurer to defend under the policy provisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Heide complaint alleged the following: The defendants knew the particular purposes of Heide\u2019s candy manufacturing process for which the starch trays were intended; the defendants were in breach of express and implied warranties, since the trays were unfit for their intended use, were of unmerchantable quality, and did not conform to sample; moreover, the defendants were negligent in the design, manufacture, and testing of the trays. As a result, Heide \u201chas incurred losses and suffered damages including, among other things, lost sales and profits, increased costs of obtaining replacement trays, loss of reasonable return on its capital investment in manufacturing equipment and costs of storage and handling.\u201d The complaint is an instance, although not an extreme instance, of the general or \u201cnotice\u201d style of averment of the Federal Rules, and is not to be read with the literalness or narrowness associated with the name of the late Baron Parke.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cIn order for the duty of defense to arise, the underlying complaint need only show, through general allegations, a possibility that the liability claim falls within the insurance coverage. There is no requirement that the facts alleged in the complaint specifically and unequivocally make out a claim within the coverage.\u201d <em>Union </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Topsham, </em>441 A.2d 1012, 1015 (Me. 1982). See also <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. Co., supra </em>at 276-277; <em>International Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>35 N.Y.2d 322, 325 (1974). Even if a measure of literalness is insisted upon, the reference in Heide\u2019s complaint to loss of return on investment in manufacturing equipment would, in our opinion, embrace and admit proof of physical impairment of such equipment causally related to the failure of the trays that were conveyed and handled in the manufacturing process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And this item of loss fell within the \u201ccoverage\u201d of the policy, specifically, the coverage of the part of the policy definition of \u201cproperty damage\u201d that speaks of \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period, including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom.\u201d The reference in the complaint to costs of replacing trays ought to be enough to allow proof of physical damage of the trays, and we think it would be no impermissible inflation of the complaint to extend this to any damage to the contents of the trays, although the trial judge did not go so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Next, the complaint by the same reference to return on investment in manufacturing equipment would invite proof of causally connected loss of use of the equipment apart from any physical impairment thereof. This item of loss was covered by the further part of the policy definition of \u201cproperty damage\u201d which mentions \u201closs of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy period.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>(There is no dispute that there was an \u201coccurrence,\u201d as defined.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">So much for the stated coverage. Now we go to the \u201cexclusions.\u201d By exclusion (n), \u201cThis insurance does not apply: . . . (n) to property damage to the named insured\u2019s products arising out of such products or any part of such products.\u201d This means that the loss of the trays is withdrawn from coverage. The exclusion appears not to speak to the other items above mentioned.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">An exclusion, often called a \u201cbusiness risk\u201d exclusion, appears in (m), as follows: \u201cThis insurance does not apply: . . . (m) to loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed resulting from ... (2) the failure of the named insured\u2019s products ... to meet the level of performance, quality, fitness or durability warranted or represented by the named insured; but this exclusion does not apply to loss of use of other tangible property resulting from the sudden and accidental physical injury to or destruction of the named insured\u2019s products . . . after such products . . . have been put to use by any person or organization other than the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The language up to the word \u201cbut\u201d removes from coverage standard situations where loss of use of equipment occurs simply by the failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>of the insured\u2019s products to come up to the contract level.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is understandable that the policy should not serve as a guaranty of the quality and suitability of the insured\u2019s products: these risks are of a kind that the insured may be expected to bear itself \u2014 and load into the prices of its products.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The \u201cbut\u201d language of the (m) exclusion, however, removes from the business risk exclusion and retains coverage for instances where there is loss of use of tangible property, e.g., equipment, occasioned by \u201csudden and accidental\u201d damage to the insured\u2019s products (even though, we interpolate, this damage may be related to inadequacies of the insured\u2019s products). The effect of (m) is to distinguish \u201cbetween a physical breakdown of the insured\u2019s product and a mere failure of the product to perform as well as warranted, presumably because the latter is a typical business risk whereas the former is more likely to have catastrophic consequences.\u201d <em>Honeycomb Syss., Inc. </em>v. <em>Admiral Ins. Co., </em>567 F. Supp. 1400, 1407 (D. Me. 1983) (Gignoux, J.) (loss of use of paper manufacturing machine held covered, when insured\u2019s component product cracked, not merely failed to perform as warranted). The allegations of Heide\u2019s complaint seem to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>us, as they evidently did to the trial judge, ample enough to harbor a \u201cbreakdown\u201d situation, and they surely do not expressly bar it. Therefore the insurer\u2019s duty to defend attached. See <em>Carboline Co. </em>v. <em>Home Indem. Co., </em>522 F.2d 363, 367 (7th Cir. 1975); C. <em>Raymond, Davis &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>467 F. Supp. 17, 19 (E.D. Pa. 1979); <em>Spoor-Lasher Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>39 N.Y.2d 875, 876 (1976).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">2. When, as in the present case, the allegations of the third-party complaint find apparent lodgment in the effective coverage of the policy, the insurer is obligated to defend. But it can, by certain steps, get clear of the duty from and after the time when it demonstrates with conclusive effect on the third party that as matter of fact \u2014 as distinguished from the appearances of the complaint and policy \u2014 the third party cannot establish a claim within the insurance. Judge L. Hand suggested that the demonstration of the precise basis on which the third-party action will proceed may be made by discovery or other tactics within the third-party action, whose defense will have been undertaken by the insurer. <em>Lee v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>178 F.2d 750, 752 (2d Cir. 1949).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> An insurer may make the demonstration when brought into the third-party action upon impleader by the insured. See, e.g., <em>Terrio, supra, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. at 164. A declaratory action, in which the necessary interests are represented, may serve for the demonstration. See <em>Atlantic Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>619 F.2d 553, 555 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Firemen\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Chasson, </em>207 Cal. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>2d 801, 807 (1962).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> What is not permitted is that an insurer shall escape its duty to defend the insured against a liability arising on the face of the complaint and policy, by dint of its own assertion that there is no coverage in fact: the insurer then stands in breach of its duty even if the third party fails in the end to support any such claim of liability by adequate proof. See <em>Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>v. <em>Parsons Corp., </em>430 F.2d 531, 538-539 (8th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Here, Continental flatly renounced coverage and liability without taking a demonstrative step, on the lines indicated, to establish that Heide\u2019s claim was in fact without coverage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">3. Pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, Sterilite proved by affidavit with supporting ledger sheets the amounts incurred by it for attorneys\u2019 fees and related expenses over the seven years that the third-party claim had been in litigation. Upon that submission, Continental was entitled by the stipulation to request a hearing. It did not do so, and its opposition consisted, not in any attempted showing, anchored in the detailed needs of the litigation, that the amounts claimed were excessive, but in protestations that it could have con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ducted the defense of the third-party claim by counsel of its own selection at lower rates of compensation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These general contentions are not impressive. The standard evidently applied by the judge was proper,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and his assessment of the facts was not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">4. Besides ordering payment as indicated, the judgment appealed from declares, in substance, that Continental is obligated to defend on behalf of Sterilite or, alternatively, to reimburse Sterilite\u2019s expenses of defense. We think the judgment should be modified to declare, in effect, that Continental may absolve itself of the stated obligation from and after the time it makes an appropriate demonstration, as indicated in this opinion, that the third-party claim does not in fact comprise matters for which there is coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-15\"> Sterilite had also purchased an \u201cexcess umbrella third party liability policy\u201d which served to increase the dollar limit of coverage under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201ccomprehensive\u201d policy but did not itself impose a duty on the part of the insurer to defend third-party actions. Thus we concentrate on the terms of the \u201ccomprehensive\u201d policy which did so obligate the insurer. The dollar limit, as raised, was $1.3 million, and the annual premium payable on both policies was about $15,000; the policies ran from 1973 to 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">See generally on the \u201ccomprehensive\u201d policy Tinker, Comprehensive General Liability Insurance \u2014 Perspective and Overview, 25 Fed\u2019n Ins.

As to whether even solid information reaching the insurer from the insured, and indicating that claimed losses were in fact uninsured, could itself relieve the insurer of its duty to defend, the <em>Lee </em>case says: \u201cThis language [requiring the insurer to defend even a baseless claim] means that the insurer will defend the suit, if the injured party states a claim, which, qua claim, is for an injury \u2018covered\u2019 by the policy; it is the claim which determines the insurer\u2019s duty to defend; and it is irrelevant that the insurer may get information from the insured, or anyone else, which indicates, or even demonstrates, that the injury is not in fact\u2018covered.\u2019\u201d 178 F.2d at 751.
