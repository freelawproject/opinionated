L. c. 268, \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that he did not and reverse his conviction for violating that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">The parties filed an agreed statement of the case pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 8(d), as appearing in 378 Mass. 934 (1979). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>While under arrest on another charge, the defendant gave as his own the name of his older brother, Robert J. Healey, and, as his address, the place where both he and his brother resided. The defendant was later apprehended at that address. At his trial before a jury of six, on this charge and on companion charges,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant twice moved for a required finding of not guilty on each charge. The motions were denied. He also requested jury instructions limiting the term disguise to a change of appearance. Instead the judge gave a broader definition,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to which the defendant objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We think the trial judge unduly extended the scope of this penal statute. Criminal statutes are strictly construed and must give \u201cclear warning\u201d of the particular conduct which is proscribed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>391 Mass. 157, 159, 162 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u201cWords or phrases in a statute are given their ordinary meaning. They are to be construed according to their natural import and . . . are to be given their ordinary lexical meaning unless there be a clear indication to the contrary.\u201d <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Newton, </em>374 Mass. 450, 452 (1978), and cases cited. <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 609 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Without belaboring the point, and recognizing that \u201cdisguise\u201d has extended usages, we think the ordinary meaning of the verb \u201cdisguise\u201d is reflected in the first definition given in two standard dictionaries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Dictionary 649 (1971) (Webster\u2019s), that definition is: \u201cto change the customary dress or appearance of.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The American Heritage Dictionary 377 (1969), lists as its first meaning: \u201cto modify the manner or appearance of in order to prevent recognition.\u201d The order of definitions in Webster\u2019s is historical, and \u201cthe earliest ascertainable meaning is given first.\u201d Webster\u2019s at 6a. By contrast, the American Heritage Dictionary gives as \u201c[t]he first definition . . . the central meaning about which the other senses may be most logically organized.\u201d American Heritage at xlvii. Thus, the central and historical meanings of the verb \u201cdisguise\u201d coincide.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">A person who gives a false name does not, we conclude, \u201cdisguise[ ] himself\u201d within the ordinary lexical meaning of the term, and such conduct does not fall within the ambit of the statute. The only jurisdiction which has, to our knowledge, directly addressed the question, Florida, has reached the same result. In <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>State, </em>372 So.2d 1180 (Fla. App. 1979), after discussing the ordinary meaning of \u201cdisguise\u201d as used in lexicons and judicial opinions, the court stated: \u201cThese definitions all contain some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>reference to physical concealment in dress or appearance, and do not encompass appellant\u2019s conduct of giving police a false name and birth date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1182. Accord <em>D.G. </em>v. <em>State, </em>375 So.2d 868 (Fla. App. 1979); <em>Leland </em>v. <em>State, </em>386 So.2d 622 (Fla. App. 1980).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Other cases requiring a construction of the word \u201cdisguise,\u201d albeit in differing contexts, lay stress on the concept of concealment of identity by physical means such as masks or clothing. See, e.g., <em>Hardyman </em>v. <em>Collins. </em>80 F.Supp. 501, 509 (S.D.Cal. 1948), rev\u2019d, 183 F.2d 308 (9th Cir. 1950), rev\u2019d, 341 U.S. 651 (1951) (wearing American Legion caps does not constitute a \u201cdisguise\u201d) ; <em>Dale County </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>46 Ala. 118, 142-143 (1871) (person in ambush or concealed in the bushes is not a person \u201cin disguise\u201d); <em>Darneal </em>v. <em>State, </em>14 Okla. Crim. 540, 545, 548 (1917) (man dressed as woman with his face partially concealed by clothes and rags is \u201cdisguised\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that, in contrast to the language in G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 34, the Legislature has in another statute specifically made it a crime to \u201cgive a false name\u201d to a police officer in connection with operating a motor vehicle, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 25. We also note that St. 1809, c. 122, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the original forerunner of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 34, suggests that the Legislature intended the use adopted by us. It provided that \u201cif any person . . . shall disguise himself ... in the likeness of Indians, or in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>other manner with intention to obstruct the execution of the laws . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Because of our construction of the statutory term, we hold that the defendant was entitled to a required finding of not guilty as there was no evidence that he \u201cdisguise[d] himself\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>Judgment on no. 2765C reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-15\"> General Laws c. 268, \u00a7 34, provides: \u201cWhoever disguises himself with intent to obstruct the due execution of the law, or to intimidate, hinder or interrupt an officer or other person in the lawful performance of his duty, or in the exercise of his rights under the constitution or laws of the commonwealth, whether such intent is effected or not, shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one year and may if imprisoned also be bound to good behavior for one year after the expiration of such imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\"> The companion charges were breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony and wanton destruction of personal property having a value of less than one hundred dollars. The defendant was acquitted of the breaking and entering. He was found guilty of wanton destruction of personal property as well as of the charge of violating G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 34. The only appeal is from the latter conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\"> As indicated in the agreed statement of the case, \u201cThe judge instructed the jury that disguise could be a change in habit, appearance or dress, but also instructed the jury that a different identity could be a disguise or that a person passing himself off as another person could be \u2018disguising\u2019 himself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\"> We note that the Oxford English Dictionary (1978 reprint) is in accord, stating, at 451, that \u201c[n]ow the leading sense\u201d of the verb \u201cdisguise\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>is \u201c[t]o change the guise, or dress and personal appearance, of (any one) so as to conceal identity; to conceal the identity of by dressing <em>as </em>some one or <em>in </em>a particular garb\u201d (emphasis original). Accord Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 420 (5th ed. 1979), \u201cTo change the guise or appearance of, especially to conceal by unusual dress; to hide by a counterfeit appearance. To obscure the existence or true state or character of a person or thing.\u201d See also Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 239 (1972), which lists as synonyms for disguise: \u201cCLOAK, MASK, DISSEMBLE: DISGUISE typically implies a deceptive change of dress and physical appearance but may extend to a change in manner of speech or behavior that serves to conceal a motive or attitude.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b565-10\"> The remaining portion of the first definition given in Webster\u2019s is: \u201cfurnish with a false appearance or an assumed identity (the noblemen <em>disguised </em>as hall porters look through you or past you \u2014 C.E. Montague).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b565-11\"> Because of this convergence the same definition of \u201cdisguise\u201d was presumably known to the Legislature when the original statute defining the crime, now codified as G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 34, was enacted. See <em>Glennon v. School Comm. of Boston, </em>375 Mass. 757, 763 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> The Florida statute is very similar to G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 34. Florida Stat. \u00a7 843.03 (1979) provides: \u201cWhoever in any manner disguises himself with intent to obstruct the due execution of the law, or with the intent to intimidate, hinder or interrupt any officer, beverage enforcement agent, or other person in the legal performance of his duty or the exercise of his rights under the constitution or laws of this state, whether such intent is effected or not, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> The Commonwealth cites no case, and we have found none, which has used the word \u201cdisguise\u201d to include the furnishing of a false name. The authorities cited in support of the Commonwealth\u2019s position involve statutes not containing the term \u201cdisguise\u201d and specifically make criminal the giving of false information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> Listed in some sources as c. 123.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\"> Earlier English statutes using the word \u201cdisguise\u201d also suggest that the word imports some physical concealment. See, e.g., \u201cAn Act for the more effectual punishing wicked and evil disposed persons going armed in disguise,\u201d 1722, 9 Geo. 1, c. 22, making criminal certain activities of persons armed and having \u201ctheir [f]aces blacked, or being otherwise disguised\u201d; \u201cAn Act against unlawful hunting in forests and parks,\u201d 1485-1486, 1 Hen. 7, c. 7, making it a felony to hunt \u201cwith painted [f]aces, [v]isors, or otherwise disguised.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
