The police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>proceeded to 21 Algonquin Street and a bystander identified Walker, who was on the street. The officers were then able to follow Walker into 24 Algonquin Street, a rooming house. The officers pursued the sound of voices from the second floor to a room in which there were six or seven men. None, in response to the first officer\u2019s (George Travis) question, admitted to knowing David Walker. Officer Travis asked for identifications, \u201c[a]t the same time patting down the occupants of this room for my safety and the safety of my partner . . . [b]ecause I had reason to believe that at least one gun was in that room.\u201d When Officer Travis got to the defendant, the latter identified himself as Walker. Officer Travis said, \u201cI understand you carry a gun.\u201d Walker removed a 22-calibre Llama semi-automatic pistol from his belt and turned it over to Travis. Thereupon the officer executed the default warrant, arrested Walker, and informed him of his Miranda rights. Subsequently, in the police cruiser, Walker admitted brandishing a gun (in self-defense, he said) at the intersection of Washington Street and Bowdoin Street, Dorchester, earlier that evening. This was the incident which had placed the police on his trail. Walker was convicted and sentenced under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a) (unlawfully carrying a firearm), on the basis of evidence stemming from that incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">1. Two answers dispose of the defendant\u2019s argument that he was entitled to a Miranda warning before Officer Travis challenged Walker with: \u201cI understand you carry a gun.\u201d <em>First, </em>Travis had probable cause to arrest Walker on the default warrant outstanding against him and to search the defendant incidentally to that arrest. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 224 (1973). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>353 Mass. 376, 379, cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1010 (1967). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 761, 769 (1978). Here, the police officer\u2019s statement was a verbal prelude to the body search which the officer would have been entitled to make, a physical act which the defendant obviated by handing over his firearm. It does not matter that Officer Travis looked for the weapon slightly before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>official arrest in circumstances where \u201cformal arrest followed quickly on the heels of the challenged search of petitioner\u2019s person.\u201d <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 111 (1980). See also <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>403 F.2d 982, 984 (1st Cir. 1968), cert, denied, 394 U.S. 909 (1969). <em>Second, </em>Travis had excellent reason to believe Walker was armed and dangerous and had committed a crime. The officer was therefore lawfully entitled to frisk the defendant. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30-31 (1968). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cantalupo, </em>380 Mass. 173, 175 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blatz, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 603, 604-605 (1980). That Travis used a less intrusive means to accomplish what he could have done with a pat down (pat downs of the other men in the room had produced two knives) does not invalidate seizure of Walker\u2019s firearm, especially having in mind that the degree of intrusiveness is a factor in weighing whether a <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>frisk is within permissible bounds. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 407-408 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">2. No error attended the refusal of the motion judge to suppress Walker\u2019s post-arrest statements on the ground that he was too drunk to waive his Miranda rights in a knowing and intelligent fashion. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hosey, </em>368 Mass. 571, 576-579 (1975). Cross-examination of Officer Travis at the suppression hearing established no more than that the defendant was \u201cdrunk\u201d and \u201cpretty loaded.\u201d As to the degree of his incapacity, the record lacks material persuasive enough to overcome the deference we accord the judge\u2019s apparent finding that the defendant had his wits sufficiently about him. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tisserand, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 388-389 (1977). As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 786, 795 (1981), we find no basis for rejecting \u201cthe judge\u2019s implicit conclusions that, despite being under the influence of alcohol, [the defendant] retained adequate capacity to understand warnings given him\u201d and intelligently to waive them. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, 380 </em>Mass. 44, 49 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>3. Other grounds of appeal are susceptible to summary treatment. Once the firearm and Walker\u2019s admission that he had carried and brandished it were received in evidence, there was sufficient evidence of unlawful carrying to take the case to a jury. There was no harm in excluding Walker\u2019s firearms identification card. That card allowed him to possess a firearm but not to carry one. G. L. c. 140, c. 129C. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 405-406 (1978). His card gave Walker\u2019s address as 21 Algonquin Street; he was arrested with a firearm at 22 or 24 Algonquin Street and charged with carrying a firearm at Washington and Bowdoin Streets. Admission of the card in evidence would have availed Walker nothing. The defense does not even hint at how it might have been harmed by imperfections in the trial transcript (made from a tape recording) or that counsel made any effort to piece together omissions. Defense counsel, who was present throughout the proceedings, did'not fulfill the requirement placed upon her by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatman, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 228, 232 (1980), to articulate claims with reference to which the inadequacy of the record can be judged.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
