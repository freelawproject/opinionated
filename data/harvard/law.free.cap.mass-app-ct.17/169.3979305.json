A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>judge of a Probate Court concluded, after trial, that the power had not been exercised by the residuary clause of the donee\u2019s will which neither referred to the power nor purported to exercise any power of appointment. We conclude that the judge\u2019s decision was correct and affirm his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The facts are drawn from the judge\u2019s findings. On April 1, 1957, Mary F. Cox executed a will which provided that the residue of her estate be held in trust for the benefit of her daughter Dorothy Cox during Dorothy\u2019s lifetime. Upon Dorothy\u2019s death, the trustee of Mary\u2019s trust was directed to pay the trust principal to such person or persons, including the executor of Dorothy\u2019s will, as Dorothy \u201cshall appoint by her will specifically referring to the power herein given to her.\u201d If Dorothy failed to exercise her general power of appointment, the trust principal was to be paid to the New England Deaconess Hospital. Mary\u2019s will was admitted to probate on August 5, 1968, and, on July 17, 1970, BayBank Merrimack Valley, N.A. (Baybank), was appointed to succeed the original trustee under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">On May 6, 1977, Dorothy Cox executed a will, prepared by the plaintiff Maurice Schwartz, an attorney. The will, insofar as relevant, gave to a friend a life estate in her home and its contents, created a trust to maintain the home, and left specific cash bequests to a niece and a nephew and three charities. The residuary clause of Dorothy\u2019s will read as follows: \u201cThe said residue of my estate will be held in trust by my said Trustee ... to pay the income thereof, to my . . . niece, <em>LOUISA GILBERT, </em>during her lifetime. Upon her death, said residue and any accrued income thereof, shall go to . . . <em>BEAVER COLLEGE, </em>of Glenside, Pennsylvania, outright, and said Trust will terminate.\u201d Dorothy died on January 4, 1980, never having married and leaving no issue. Her will was allowed and, on March 26, 1980, Mr. Schwartz was appointed as her executor and trustee. Dorothy had insufficient assets as the time of her death to fund all the bequests in her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>In addition, Mr. Schwartz, the sole witness at trial, testified as to the circumstances attendant upon his drafting of the will. He indicated that he had asked Dorothy about her assets and the funding of legacies, and that she had made reference to money in Baybank which could be used to pay the legacies. He also testified that he did not ask to see Mary\u2019s will before he prepared Dorothy\u2019s will, that he first became aware of Mary\u2019s trust after Dorothy\u2019s death, and that Dorothy never requested that her will exercise her power of appointment. Finally, Mr. Schwartz testified that Dorothy received substantial sums from another trust created by her father and administered by The First National Bank of Boston as trustee, that Dorothy knew that the residue of the estates of both her parents were managed by trustees, that she received income from both trusts of about $20,000 annually, and that Dorothy had a checking account at a Baybank office.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">1. The facts require examination in light of several general principles pertaining to the exercise of powers of appointment and two Massachusetts decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Generally, when the donor of a power of appointment prescribes a specific formality for the exercise of the power, there will be no effective appointment in the absence of the donee\u2019s compliance with the formalities dictated by the donor. <em>National Shawmut Bank </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>315 Mass. 457, 462 (1944). Restatement (Second) of Property \u00a7 18.2 (Tent. Draft. No. 6, 1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This rule, however, is not absolute. Failure to satisfy the formal requirements imposed by a donor will not cause the appointment to fail if the donee\u2019s action reasonably approximates the prescribed manner of appointment, especially where the appointee is a member of a favored class. Restatement (Second) of Property, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 18.3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 5 American Law of Property \u00a7 23.44 (1952). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Shine </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>354 Mass. 680, 682 (1968). A donor\u2019s requirement of specific reference ordinarily negates any presumption that a general residuary clause may exercise the power and mandates, for effective exercise of the power, an affirmative act by the donee at least approximating the indicated formality.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The reasons behind these rules are simple enough to discern. The donor of the power presumptively intends by the specific reference requirement that the donee (a) focus on the consequence of the appointive act and consider the donor\u2019s wish with respect to the trust remainder if there is a default in exercise of the power, and (b) make an unambiguous written statement expressing a wish to exercise the power. With proper compliance, the specific reference device provides for the reasoned disposition of property by means of written and proven instruments which help to establish an unimpeachable record of title and serve to discourage unnecessary litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">These principles underlie two decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court within the last fifteen years which, while not directly on point, instructively discuss the subject of successful exercise of powers of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">In <em>Shine </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>354 Mass. 680 (1968), the donor of an inter vivas trust required that a general power of appointment be exercised \u201cby specific reference in her [donee\u2019s] will to the full power hereby created.\u201d The donee\u2019s will provided for the distribution of \u201c[a]ll the rest, residue and remainder of my property, including all property of which I have a power of appointment by virtue [of] any will or testament or inter vivas trust executed by my husband [the donor].\u201d An effective exercise of the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>was found, under the principles of approximation, because the donor\u2019s purpose (to prevent inadvertent exercise of the power) had been satisfied by the donee\u2019s deliberate references to all powers of appointment given by her husband, the donor. Not to be overlooked in the decision, is the court\u2019s careful distinction from the case before it of situations, as in <em>National Shawmut Bank </em>v. <em>Joy, supra, </em>where the donor required a specific reference and the donee simply referred in general terms to any power of appointment the donee might possess. 354 Mass. at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In <em>McKelvy </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>370 Mass. 328 (1976), the donor conferred on the donee a limited testamentary power of appointment to be exercised \u201cby reference [in the donee\u2019s will] to the limited power of appointment herein given to him.\u201d The donee\u2019s will provided for distribution of \u201c[a]ll of the residue of my estate, including lapsed legacies and devises (and also including any property over which I may have a power of appointment under any instrument, it being my intention to exercise all such powers which I may have at my death).\u201d The court found this residuary provision to be a sufficient exercise of the power, commenting (at 332) that \u201cthe meaning or design of the relevant clause of the [donee\u2019s] will sufficiently matches any requirement of the [donor\u2019s] trust instrument. That instrument calls for a \u2018reference\u2019 to the power, <em>not a specific reference, </em>and we think . . . that the residuary clause of the will is an adequate reference although it is inclusive of any power created by any instrument in the donee\u2019s favor\u201d (emphasis supplied). Referring to <em>Shine </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>the court said (at 333): \u201cWe thought that there need not be exact compliance with the formality indicated by the donor where the approximation would satisfy his basic purpose. Less indulgence may be needed in the present case because the donor did not in terms require a specific reference.\u201d These excerpts from the <em>McKelvy </em>case imply the special nature of a specific reference requirement and emphasize that compliance with such a requirement cannot be easily circumvented.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>These principles and decisions provide the guidelines necessary to dispose of this case. The general testamentary power of appointment granted to Dorothy by Mary\u2019s will expressly required that it be exercised by Dorothy\u2019s will \u201cspecifically referring to the power.\u201d The critical inquiry is \u201cnot whether [the] donee intended to appoint but rather whether [the] donee <em>manifested </em>her intent in the manner prescribed by [the] donor, <em>i.e., </em>by making specific reference \u2018in her will\u2019 to the power granted by [the] donor\u2019s will\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Holzbach </em>v. <em>United Virginia </em>Bank, 216 Va. 482, 485-486 (1975). See also Restatement (Second) of Property, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17.1. Unlike the situations in the <em>Shine </em>and <em>McKelvy </em>cases, the residuary clause of Dorothy\u2019s will made no reference at all to any power. Lacking any attempt at compliance with the requirement of specific reference, there is simply no testamentary framework which will allow application of a rule of approximation. We conclude that Dorothy\u2019s will fails to exercise the power of appointment given to her by her mother.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">2. Some brief comment is in order on the plaintiffs several arguments seeking to avoid the conclusion that there has been a default in the exercise of the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">(a) The plaintiff s reliance on the decision in <em>Amory </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>7 Allen 397 (1863), is misplaced. The rule in <em>Amory </em>provides that a general testamentary power of appointment will be deemed to have been exercised by a general residuary clause in the donee\u2019s will, unless a contrary intention is demonstrated. The rule does not apply where the donor requires that the power be exercised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>means of specific reference.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>McKelvy </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>370 Mass. at 331-332. See also <em>National Shawmut Bank </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>315 Mass. at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">(b) The fact that Dorothy\u2019s will includes several pecuniary bequests which in total may have exceeded her assets at the time of death does not, in these circumstances, imply that the power has been exercised by implication. See <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Prindle, </em>290 Mass. 577, 584 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"Av-\">(c) The plaintiff\u2019s argument that property subject to a donee\u2019s general power is actually the donee\u2019s property is misplaced. Mary\u2019s will clearly did not grant a general power of appointment exercisable without restriction. We find the plaintiff\u2019s assertion to the contrary both untenable on the facts and unsupported by any authority dealing with a requirement of specific reference.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>(d) While the testimony of Mr. Schwartz may have been properly admitted to show the circumstances attendant upon the execution of Dorothy\u2019s will, see 2 Newhall, Settlement of Estates \u00a7 361, at 470 (1958), the pertinent texts of the wills of Mary and Dorothy, when laid side by side and read together, manifest no ambiguity. Extrinsic evidence is not admissible to contradict or control unambiguous language in a will. See <em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Svenson, </em>373 Mass. 273, 275 (1977); <em>Gove v. Hammond, </em>385 Mass. 1001, 1001-1002 (1982). Nor is it admissible to correct an inadvertent omission by Dorothy or a mistake by the attorney who drafted the will.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Gustafson </em>and <em>Gove, supra. </em>Finally, extrinsic evidence, in the absence of an ambiguity, is not admissible to show Dorothy\u2019s intent, even if the result is the failure of the intended gift. <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Shawmut Bank of Boston, </em>378 Mass. 137, 144 (1979).

See Restatement (Second) of Property, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 18.3(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> This conclusion receives solid support in decisions of other States which have considered specific reference clauses in contexts like the one before us.

That statute provided and (as appearing in St. 1977, c. 637, \u00a7 1) still provides: \u201cNo general residuary clause in a will and no will making general disposition of all of the testator\u2019s property shall exercise a power of appointment created by another instrument which does not specify a specific method of exercise unless reference is made to powers of appointment or there is some other indication of intention to exercise the power.\u201d Since Dorothy executed her will on May 6, 1977, G.L. c. 191, \u00a7 1A(4), would appear to have no application to this case. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the statute pays attention to references in the instrument which require a specific method of exercise. The statute indicates that such references are not to be brushed aside on vague assertions of the donee\u2019s true intentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\"> The relevant decisions in the Commonwealth apparently indicate that the property over which a donee has a general power becomes the donee\u2019s property only after the donee has actually exercised the power. For example, it has consistently been held that \u201cwhere a person has a general power of appointment and exercises it the appointed property becomes available to his creditors. This is upon the theory that he could have appointed it to himself or his executors or otherwise could have devoted it to the payments of his debts, and therefore that the creditors have an equitable right to reach it.\u201d <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Wordell, </em>319 Mass. 118, 120 (1946), and cases cited.
