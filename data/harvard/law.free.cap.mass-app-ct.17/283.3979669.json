L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, seeking a declaratory judgment, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant school committee violated G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43, as amended through St. 1972, c. 464, \u00a7 4, when it reduced the plaintiff\u2019s salary in the 1980-1981 school year. The defendant now appeals from a judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">The plaintiff was appointed to a teaching position on April 9, 1969, as an instructor in the Metals Program. He began to serve at discretion (on tenure) on September 5, 1973. In July of 1977, the defendant voted to phase out the Metals Program and the plaintiff was subsequently dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>as a full-time instructor in July, 1980. He was reassigned (apparently at the same meeting at which his dismissal was approved finally) to \u201cthe part-time instructor\u2019s position in the Metals Program effective September, 1980, at a prorated salary\u201d of $11,720.00. In the prior school session, 1979-1980, the plaintiff\u2019s salary had been $17,423.00. The plaintiff did not consent to this reduction nor did any other full-time teacher have his or her salary reduced during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The judge\u2019s findings of fact amply support his conclusions of law and the judgment for the plaintiff. With the exception of \u201ca general salary revision affecting equally all teachers of the same salary grade in the town\u201d (G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43), \u201ca tenured teacher may have his salary reduced in only two situations: (1) if, as here, he is subject to a collective bargaining agreement, it may be reduced in accordance with the agreement; (2) if he is not subject to a collective bargaining agreement, he must individually consent to a reduction.\u201d <em>Setterlund v. Groton-Dunstable Regional Sch. Comm., </em>382 Mass. 328, 330 n.3 (1981). The defendant maintains that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Setterlund </em>because here the plaintiff was validly dismissed from his full-time position prior to being rehired as a nontenured, part-time instructor.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The defendant seems to elevate form over substance. The fact situation is analogous to those instances where courts, in reviewing certain Internal Revenue Service matters, have applied the so-called \u201cstep transaction\u201d doctrine. \u201cThe objective of that doctrine is to give . . . effect to the substance, as opposed to the form of a transaction, by ignoring . . . steps of an integrated transaction that separately are without substance.\u201d <em>Dietzsch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 F.2d 1344, 1346 (Ct. Cl. 1974). In determining whether to apply this doctrine the courts have looked to whether \u201cpurportedly separate transactions [can] be amalgamated into a single transaction . . . intended from the outset to be taken for the purpose of reaching the ultimate result.\u201d <em>King Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>418 F.2d 511, 516-517 (Ct. Cl. 1969). The ultimate result and purpose of the defendant\u2019s actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>were to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s salary. The reduction occurred without the consent of the plaintiff and was not made pursuant to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement. This was a violation of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
