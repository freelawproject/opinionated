L. c. 40, \u00a7 8C) of the town of Canton is required by the first, sixth and seventh paragraphs, respectively, of G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B (as most recently amended by St. 1980, c. 220, \u00a7 3), to hold open meetings, to give notice of its meetings, and to maintain accurate records thereof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court thought not and entered judgment accordingly. The plaintiffs, who are three registered voters of the town (see \u00a7 23B, eleventh par.), have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The portions of the record which relate to these questions are sketchy, but it appears that the subcommittee in question is concerned in some way with the implementation or the enforcement of the so called conservation easement which the town of Canton owns in the Prowse Farm and which was considered in <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Codex Corp., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 493, 495-496, 499 (1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the chairman of the commission, whose testimony the trial judge appears to have regarded as credible, the subcommittee\u2019s jurisdiction extends to making factual investigations, reporting its findings to the full commission, and making verbal recommendations as to actions which should be taken by the commission. Nothing more appears as to the functions or duties of the subcommittee. There is no dispute that the subcommittee has not in the past complied with the notice and records requirements of the sixth and seventh paragraphs of \u00a7 23B.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The answers to our questions turn on the proper construction of the definitions of the terms \u201cDeliberation,\u201d \u201cGovernmental body\u201d and \u201cMeeting\u201d which are set out in G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23A, as most recently amended by St. 1978, c. 372, \u00a7 9, and particularly on the proper construction of the word \u201cdecision\u201d as employed in the first and third of those defin\u00ed - tians. We start with the definition of \u201cGovernmental body\u201d and find that it includes \u201cevery board, commission, committee or <em>subcommittee </em>of any . . . city ... or town, however elected, appointed or otherwise constituted\u201d (emphasis supplied) . As there is no such legal entity as a \u201csubcommittee of [a] . . . city ... or town,\u201d the only way to avoid stripping \u201csubcommittee\u201d of all meaning iii its present context is to read \u201cGovernmental body\u201d to include a \u201csubcommittee of any board, commission or committee of any city or town.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> So far there is no real dispute among the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Their positions diverge when it comes to the proper construction of the terms \u201cDeliberation\u201d and \u201cMeeting.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>former is defined as \u201ca verbal exchange between a quorum[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] of members of a governmental body attempting to arrive at a <em>decision </em>on any public business within its jurisdiction\u201d (emphasis supplied). The latter is defined as \u201cany corporal convening and deliberation of a governmental body for which a quorum is required in order to make a <em>decision </em>at which any public business . . . over which the governmental body has jurisdiction ... is discussed or considered . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">As we have already noted, the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the subcommittee extends to making factual investigations and reporting its findings and making recommendations to the full commission. Except in the unlikely event that the members constituting the statutory quorum conduct their exchanges of ideas by convening and then pushing notes to each other across the table, they cannot perform their intended functions without engaging in what a layman would regard as deliberation at a meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">All of which brings us to the meaning of the word \u201cdecision\u201d as it is employed in the definitions of \u201cDeliberation\u201d and \u201cMeeting.\u201d The judge based his conclusion as to the nonapplicability of the sixth and seventh paragraphs of G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, on the following reasoning: \u201cThe subcommittee here is involved only in the process of making educated recommendations to the full [commission]. Final decision^] upon whatever alternatives are suggested by the subcommittee are deliberated by the full [commission]. The subcommittee in this case makes no governmental decisions. Its recommendations are considered in open session by the parent body.\u201d We think it too clear for discussion that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>three-member subcommittee cannot make a decision which the law entrusts to a seven-member commission (see G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Fifth), and we have no quarrel with the distinction between a recommendation which the subcommittee can make and a decision which can only be made by the requisite majority of the full commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We think, however, that the judge\u2019s reasoning and the commission\u2019s arguments fail to come to grips with the actual language of the definitions of \u201cDeliberation\u201d and \u201cMeeting.\u201d Once we accept the proposition that a subcommittee is one form of \u201c[governmental body\u201d and then reread the other relevant definitions, it is readily apparent that the Legislature contemplated that a subcommittee itself can \u201carrive at a decision\u201d (definition of \u201cDeliberation\u201d) or \u201cmake a decision\u201d (definition of \u201cMeeting\u201d) on any matter which the parent body can and does entrust to the subcommittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Comes now the question whether the particular subcommittee in this case is making \u201cdecisions\u201d within the meaning of the statutory definitions. We think it axiomatic that any report of facts which the subcommittee may make to the full commission after conducting whatever investigation may be appropriate in the circumstances is necessarily grounded on one or more decisions as to what the facts are. And, of course, the subcommittee cannot formulate a recommendation without deciding what it should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and in accordance with the provisions of the eleventh paragraph of G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, a new judgment is to enter which orders the members of the subcommittee to comply in the future with the applicable requirements of the first, sixth and seventh paragraphs of that section whenever the subcommittee engages in making findings of fact which are to be reported to the commission or in formulating recommendations to the commission. Costs of appeal are not to be awarded to any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-15\"> See also G.
