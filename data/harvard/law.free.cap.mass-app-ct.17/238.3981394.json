L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A) and assault by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B). In addition to claiming errors in his trial, the defendant asserts that the sentence imposed did not reflect the intention of the sentencing judge, and that he was unfairly deprived of credit for time spent by him in custody prior to trial and for time spent in Bridgewater State Hospital after conviction. We affirm the convictions but, in the unusual circumstances of this case, order that the sentence be revised to conform to the intentions of the judge as to eligibility for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">1. <em>Alleged errors at trial, (a) </em>The defendant argues that he was entitled to a required finding of not guilty on the charge of assault by means of a dangerous weapon \u2014 to wit, a knife. The victim testified that the defendant threw her down on a box, struggled with her, and told her \u201cthat he had a knife in his back pocket and that if I screamed one more time, he was going to kill me.\u201d She was \u201creally scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the offense may be established even in the absence of evidence that he actually displayed or brandished a weapon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 436, 439 (1975). Here, the defendant\u2019s warning \u201cinforming the victim of the presence and possession\u201d of the knife took \u201cthe place of a threatening movement or gesture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 436. The judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>(b) </em>In closing argument the prosecutor referred to the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant found some beer behind a meat market and added: \u201cMr. McGuire (defense counsel) says he doesn\u2019t know where [the defendant] got the beer from. Here we have a market which is closed. There are many possibilities where the beer could have come from.\u201d Claiming that these statements unfairly raised the inference that he had broken into the market, the defendant sought a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The judge was correct in considering the claim to be baseless. Taken in context, the prosecutor\u2019s statement did not suggest that a break had occurred. Indeed, the victim had testified that the beer had probably been hidden behind the market. Moreover, after the defendant had objected and had asked for a mistrial, the judge asked defense counsel whether he wished the court to make a statement concerning the market. Counsel said no. Having refused an instruction, which could have explained that the meat market did not sell alcohol (as the prosecutor was willing to concede), the defendant is not entitled to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">2. <em>Claims with respect to sentencing. </em>Noting that the defendant was only seventeen at the time of the crimes, had had no prior convictions, had allegedly committed three rapes within a single month, and that further evaluation of the defendant had been recommended by a physician, the judge, on February 4, 1982, ordered the defendant sent to Bridgewater State Hospital for thirty days under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15(e). After receiving reports from the institution, including a petition for an additional period of commitment, the judge, on March 5, ordered the defendant committed for six months to Bridgewater State Hospital. Defense counsel requested that sentencing be deferred until after the information from the six-month commitment should become available, but the judge indicated that would pose problems, as he would no longer be on the bench at that time. Accordingly, on March 5, he also sentenced the defendant to eighteen years at M.C.I., Concord, on the rape charge and to a concurrent five-year sentence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the assault with a dangerous weapon charge. The warrant of commitment (mittimus) ordered \u201cexecution of sentence stayed until the expiration of the six month commitment to Bridgewater State Hospital\u201d and also ordered that \u201cafter a hearing by order of the court,\u201d the prisoner is \u201cdeemed to have served zero days as a portion of said sentence under the provisions of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33[A].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><em>(a) Credit for time spent in custody prior to trial. </em>At the sentencing hearings of February 4 and March 5, the judge was informed of the uncontroverted circumstances relating to the defendant\u2019s incarceration for a period of sixteen months prior to trial. A series of five indictments had issued against the defendant on account of three separate incidents of rape during the month of August, 1979. Two arose out of an August 7, 1979, occurrence and charged the defendant with rape and assault with a dangerous weapon; two are involved in the present appeal and arose out of events occurring on August 23, 1979; the remaining indictment charged the defendant with rape on August 26, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Bail of $10,000 was set on the indictment charging the August 7 rape and separate bail of $10,000 was set on the indictment charging the August 26 rape. That those indictments and not the ones involved here were the ones on which bail was set appears to have been purely fortuitous. Because the police officer familiar with this case was unavailable on the day the witnesses for the other charges appeared before the grand jury, the indictments involved in this appeal issued at a later time, and the defendant was arraigned upon them on September 26, 1979, sixteen days after his arraignment on the other charges. At the September 26 arraignment no additional bail was set; the defendant was already incarcerated and unable to post the bail previously set. Prior to the trial on the instant charges, the defendant was found not guilty of the August 26 rape, and, sometime after that acquittal, the defendant was able to post bail on the August 7 rape charge, which was subsequently dropped.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Relying on <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Massachusetts Correctional Inst., Norfolk, </em>372 Mass. 387, 392 (1977), the defendant argued, at the sentencing hearings, that he should receive credit for the sixteen months spent by him in custody prior to trial. The judge agreed that credit should be given. He specifically rejected the principle, now espoused by the Commonwealth on appeal, that the defendant is not entitled to credit for time attributable to his inability to make bail on the unrelated rape charges. The judge nevertheless denied the defendant\u2019s motion for credit, \u201cbecause that would reduce the sentence I am imposing. I will state on the record that I have considered [the sixteen months] in making the sentence; and I would have increased the sentence by that amount.... I would have imposed a greater sentence . . . had he not spent sixteen months in jail. So technically on the record, your motion is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues, once again relying on <em>Manning, </em>that automatic credit is required \u201ceven if the judge took into consideration the time already served.\u201d 372 Mass. at 394-395. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s reading of <em>Manning, </em>we shall first dispose of the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the defendant is not entitled to any credit on the ground that the charges on which he was sentenced were unrelated to the charges which kept him in jail pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The statute relating to credit for jail time, G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A (addressed to the sentencing judge),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> see also G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129B (addressed to the Commissioner of Correction),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was enacted pursuant to a recommendation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the Report and Recommendations of the Governor\u2019s Committee to Study the Massachusetts Correctional System, 1955 Senate Doc. No. 750. \u201c[T]he basic purpose of the statute was to provide for relief to those defendants who have served any jail time prior to their sentences.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>366 Mass. 272, 274 (1974). Under the statute, a prisoner shall be deemed to have served as a portion of his sentence \u201cthe number of days spent ... in confinement prior to such sentence\u201d awaiting trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The statute is not to be examined in an overly technical manner but is rather to be read \u201cagainst the backdrop of fair treatment of the prisoner.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>366 Mass. at 275. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 618, 620 (1980). Indeed, even where the statutes do not apply they serve as \u201ca strong indication by the Legislature that a prisoner is entitled to credit for the time he has spent in prison.\u201d <em>Manning, </em>372 Mass. at 392. In all cases \u201cfairness is the appropriate measure in determining whether and to what extent\u201d credit for time spent in custody should be given. <em>Chalifoux </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>375 Mass. 424, 427 (1978). See also <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>329 Mass. 445, 448 (1952); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>336 Mass. 718, 721 (1958); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aquafresca, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 975, 976-977 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Here, as was recognized by the sentencing judge, it was mere happenstance that bail was not set on the present indictments. Moreover, since the defendant was acquitted of one of the rape indictments and the other was dropped by the prosecutor, if the defendant were not to receive credit, the sixteen months served in jail would be \u201cdead time.\u201d <em>Manning, </em>372 Mass. at 396.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fairness requires that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>prisoner not be penalized or burdened by a denial of credit because he has been acquitted or because the prosecutor has seen fit not to go forward on the charges on which bail has been set. Cf. <em>Manning, </em>372 Mass. at 396-397. The cases have not established the technical rule suggested by the Commonwealth. Where fairness demands, credit is given even where different offenses are involved. <em>Manning, 372 </em>Mass. at 396-397. See <em>McCormack </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>345 Mass. 514, 515 (1963), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>366 Mass. at 275 (both, however, involving related offenses). See also ABA Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures \u00a7 3.6(d) (1968).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, the only cases since the passage of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A, by St. 1955, c. 770, which deny credit for unrelated offenses are cases where double credit has been sought. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 621; but see <em>id. </em>at 620 n.4; <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>353 Mass. 472, 476 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We turn next to the defendant\u2019s contention based on a sentence in <em>Manning, 372 </em>Mass. at 395, that \u201ceven if the judge took into consideration the time already served,\u201d credit is still required. We think the defendant misreads Manning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That case (at 395) indicates that where, as here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the judge discloses on the record that, in imposing sentence, full credit has been given for the time the defendant was incarcerated prior to trial, the defendant is entitled to no further reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><em>(b) Credit for time spent in Bridgewater State Hospital. </em>As indicated earlier, the judge ordered the defendant committed for six months to Bridgewater State Hospital and ordered the eighteen-year sentence to begin on the expiration of that commitment. He also indicated his intent that, if the defendant needed additional time at Bridgewater after the six-month period, such additional time would be counted against the Concord sentence. Since the period of commitment, when added to the length of sentence, did not exceed the maximum sentence which the judge could legally have imposed, we see no merit in the defendant\u2019s claim, based on <em>Stearns, petitioner, </em>343 Mass. 53, 56 (1961), that he should receive credit for the time spent after conviction in Bridgewater State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\"><em>(c) Intention of judge in imposing sentence. </em>After the judge committed the defendant to Bridgewater State Hospital and imposed the eighteen-year sentence to M.C.I., Concord, the judge expressly stated, \u201cIt is my intent ... to have the parole provisions . . . apply with respect to an eighteen year sentence.\u201d The judge was in error as to those provisions (perhaps misled by defense counsel), because it is evident from his comments, made on several occasions during the hearing, that he thought that an eighteen-year sentence would have an eighteen-month parole eligibility period. Both the Commonwealth and the defendant agree that under the parole board\u2019s guidelines the minimum parole eligibility date for a M.C.I., Concord, sentence of eighteen years is two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In view of this error by the judge and his express statement of intent as to parole, \u201cit appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d Mass.R.Crim.P. 29(a), 378 Mass. 899 (1979). See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>313 F.2d 817, 820-822 (7th Cir. 1963). We think that the sentence should be revised to conform to the judge\u2019s intent. Normally, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>opinion would suggest that the defendant, after rescript, file a motion pursuant to rule 29(a) before the same judge to reconsider his sentence. In these special circumstances, however, where the judge is no longer on the bench, and where his intention can be as readily discerned by us from the transcript as by another judge of the Superior Court, we think it more appropriate to remand the matter for a revision of sentence to the longest sentence which would make the defendant eligible for parole within eighteen months from the commencement of his sentences.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The convictions remain undisturbed, but the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-11\"> The defendant here had the opportunity to dispose of the knife.

The court, in refusing to presume that credit had been given on resentencing for the time served on the conviction which had been reversed, pointed out that such a presumption would not allow a defendant \u201cto insist on credit as a matter of right . . . and would not provide credit where a prisoner is acquitted upon retrial of a case instead of pleading guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395. In no way did the court indicate that if the judge on resentencing clearly showed the amount of credit given, such credit would be given a second time. To the contrary, implicit in <em>Manning </em>is a rule that double credit is not to be given, and the court specifically urged that on resentencing \u201cthe judge should take care to have the record disclose what consideration has been given to the time already served.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\"> We note that there are at least two ways to effect this result: 1) by leaving the Concord sentence in place but crediting the defendant with the six months spent in Bridgewater State Hospital, or 2) by reducing the Concord sentence to a period of slightly less than eighteen years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
