G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41. She had been in Framingham for eleven years and, in other school systems, for a long enough additional period to have made her by 1979 a contributing member of the teachers\u2019 retirement fund for more than twenty years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>In August, 1979, the Framingham superintendent of schools (Dr. Benson) notified Miss Haskell by letter that at a school committee meeting on October 9, 1979, he intended \u2018\u2018to recommend to the [s]chool [c]ommittee that . . .[she] be terminated due to the elimination of the teaching position ... [she] filled. \u2019 \u2019 At that meeting Miss Haskell was represented by counsel. Dr. Benson stated to the meeting that the termination resulted from an earlier decision of the committee in December, 1978, to discontinue the eighth grade typing program, which would eliminate four positions, of which Miss Haskell held one. The minutes of the October 9 meeting reveal (1) that, at the next prior budget session about $1,300,000 had been cut from the town\u2019s school department budget, of which about $50,00 was as a result of the elimination of grade 8 typing, and (2) that Dr. Benson stated he and his staff had considered whether Miss Haskell should be transferred to do high school commercial teaching and it was their unanimous opinion that Miss Haskell had not had the training in the last ten years which would enable her to displace an already tenured person teaching in the high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Dr. Benson\u2019s recommendation was accepted by a five to one vote (with one member absent), more than a two-thirds vote of the whole committee. See appendix to this opinion (Appendix) G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, at point [A]. He, on October 12, 1979, gave Miss Haskell notice of the termination of her employment as of October 31, 1979, \u201cdue to the elimination of the position you filled. \u201d The letter stated that the \u2018 \u2018 action in no way reflects on ... [her] performance\u201d and that she was most welcome to apply for any vacancy which might occur in her field.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">On November 6, 1979, Miss Haskell filed in the Superior Court this complaint against the school committee, purporting to proceed under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, as amended by St. 1977, c. 671, to obtain a de nova hearing to set aside her dismissal, first, on the ground that \u201cit was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with . . . G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42,\u201d and, second, seeking declaratory relief or relief in the nature of mandamus, based on tile alleged invalidity of the dismissal because the school committee had \u201cnot filed with the teachers\u2019 retirement board, . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>[see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), quoted in the Appendix, at point [E] in part 3(a)], a written notice that\u2019 \u2019 Miss Haskell, a member of the teachers\u2019 retirement system, had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The case was heard de nova in the Superior Court by a District Court judge sitting by statutory authority. He found that the school committee \u201ccomplied with the procedural requirements of\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42 (see Appendix, part 1, especially at point [B]), and that the dismissal was for \u201cgood cause.\u201d He also found that Miss Haskell was \u201cneither discharged [n]or removed, but rather [was] on a leave of absence, in a nonpaid status with an important right of recall.\u201d This right, the trial judge apparently thought, was contained in the collective bargaining agreement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> then in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Upon this appeal from the judgment dismissing the complaint (on November 1, 1982), the case has been presented on the issue whether, after a dismissal under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, for budgetary reasons from which an appeal has been taken under c. 71, \u00a7 43 A (see Appendix to this opinion, part 2), failure to give notice to the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board, see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), invalidates the dismissal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">1. The action of the school committee in December, 1978, eliminating funding for Miss Haskell\u2019s position, and on Oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>tober 9, 1979, terminating Miss Haskell\u2019s employment with the Framingham schools, was a complete separation for \u201cgood cause\u201d from the service of the schools. See <em>Nutter </em>v. <em>School Committee of Lowell, 5 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 77, 81 (1977). See also <em>Setterlund </em>v. <em>Groton-Dunstable Reg. School Comm., </em>382 Mass. 328, 331-332 (1981). Compare <em>Black </em>v. <em>School Committee of Malden, </em>365 Mass. 197, 203-205, 213 (1974). The recall provisions of the collective bargaining agreement (see note 2, <em>supra) </em>do not indicate such a definite likelihood of reemployment as should affect a decision about the date of Miss Haskell\u2019s separation from the school service. It has not been shown, in any event, that she was recalled during her two years on the recall list. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>See <em>Clark v. Mt. Greylock Reg. School Dist., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 549, 551-553 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">2. It seems to be now recognized that the abolition of the middle school typing positions was a matter of budget economy. In <em>Boston Teachers Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Committee of Boston, </em>386 Mass. 197, 216 (1982, hereafter \u201cthe 1982 B.T.U. case\u201d) it was held that the notice and hearing requirements of c. 71, \u00a7 42, do not apply to dismissals of tenured teachers \u201csolely because of budgetary considerations provided, of course, that such reasons are not proffered by the school committee as a sham or subterfuge.\u201d Miss Haskell was afforded a hearing which complied with \u00a7 42, as the trial judge found.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">From the school committee\u2019s action, Miss Haskell seasonably claimed an appeal under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, originally inserted by St. 1958, c. 462.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to the 1958 statute, an inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>pendent review of her dismissal could have been obtained under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), and we assume that a written notice under \u00a7 16(2), see Appendix to this opinion part 3(a) at point [E], then would have been a necessary condition precedent to such a review. <em>See Duncan </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Springfield, </em>331 Mass. 738, 740-741 (1954); <em>O\u2019Day </em>v. <em>School Comm. of West Brookfield, </em>343 Mass. 122, 123 (1961). See also <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>343 Mass. 502, 511-512 (1962). The 1958 statute plainly was designed to give a more expeditious, independent, de nova review by the courts of an allegedly wrongful teacher\u2019s dismissal. See <em>Springgate </em>v. <em>School Committee of Mattapoisett, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Miss Haskell contends that the explicit language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), see Appendix, part 3 (a) at point [E], to the effect that the discharge of a teacher \u201cshall not become effective . . . until a written notice thereof \u2019 is filed with the teachers\u2019 retirement board, prevented her discharge by the school committee from becoming effective so that she is entitled to reinstatement with full pay from the date of her purported discharge. She relies on <em>Chartrand </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>347 Mass. 470, 472, 476 (1964), which dealt not with a teacher, but with an employee of the Registry of Motor Vehicles, who had been dismissed on charges \u2018 \u2018that he had improperly licensed five applicants.\u201d The provisions of c. 71, \u00a7\u00a741, 42, and 43 A, dealing with teachers, were not discussed. Compare <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>343 Mass. at 511-512, where the brief, peripheral discussion of these sections of c. 71 is not decisive of the present question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>It is obvious that, in the course of legislative revision, over the years, of two separate, comprehensive regulatory schemes (cc. 31 and 32, civil service, and c. 71, schools), confusing and somewhat conflicting statutory sets of remedies have developed, probably as a consequence of wholly understandable oversight. We must reconcile them as well as we can.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Even if the older form of review under c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), now survives at all for teachers who can obtain review under c. 71, \u00a7 43 A, it seems unlikely that the Legislature intended in 1958 to permit two successive or simultaneous forms of review of action under c. 71, \u00a742. When a discharged teacher seeks review under c. 71, \u00a7 43A, it would seem to be the probable purpose to give effect to the provisions of \u00a7 42 (see the language following point [C] in the Appendix, part 1), and of \u00a7 43A (Appendix, part 2, at point [D]), rather than the remedy under c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), see Appendix, part 3 (a) at point (E). At most the two remedies, designed to accomplish the same objective, should be regarded as alternative. See <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Walter E. Fernald State School, </em>353 Mass. 331, 333 (1967). By invoking one remedy, Miss Haskell should be deemed to have relinquished the other, particularly in a case, where under the 1982 B.T.U. case her removal under c. 71, \u00a7 42, was for budgetary \u201cgood cause\u201d (see Appendix, part 1, at point [B]) rather than for disciplinary reasons. There was, after the 1958 statute, no discernible special social policy or labor policy for granting more than one remedy in circumstances like those before us. <em>Compare Dedham v. Labor Rel. Commn., </em>365 Mass. 392, 400-406 (1974), where occasion arose to reconcile old procedures under civil service with new statutory provisions for collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>bargaining with municipal employees. We treat the present case as controlled by the provisions of c. 71, \u00a7 43A, and the 1982 B.T.U. case.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">[Note: The letters in brackets have been inserted to permit convenient reference to the language immediately following the bracketed letters, respectively.]</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Pertinent statutory provisions include:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">1. <em>General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42, </em>as amended through St. 1972, c. 464, \u00a7 2, which reads in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">\u201cThe school committee may dismiss any teacher but [A] no teacher . . . shall be dismissed unless by a two thirds vote of the whole committee....

In case a decrease in the number of pupils in the schools of a town renders advisable the dismissal of one or more teachers, a teacher who is serving at the discretion of a school committee under section forty-one shall not be dismissed if there is a teacher not serving at discretion whose position the teacher serving at discretion is qualified to fill.

X) provided generally that, in the event of a reduction in force, all affected teachers would be eligible to apply for recall to fill any vacancy, if still on a recall list which was to be maintained for two years after the date of layoff. Cf. <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>338 Mass. 628, 630-631 (1959). Under art. X, \u2018\u2018teachers recalled shall be considered to have been on a non-paid leave of absence for the term of the layoff. \u2019 \u2019 Recall of a teacher to fill a vacancy was to be made by the school committee upon nomination of the superintendent, who could not hire any new employee until every eligible person on the recall list had been given opportunity to apply. If the superintendent should find that no person on the recall list was qualified to fill the vacancy and nominate a person not on the list, the Framingham Teachers Association was to \u201chave the right to grieve\u2019 \u2019 the appointment under a complicated grievance procedure (art. III).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\"> Following the arguments, opportunity to file briefs as amici curiae was given to the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which filed a brief, and to the Attorney General, in his capacity as counsel for the Civil Service Commission and for the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board. The Attorney General filed no brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> Statute 1958, c. 462, grew out of 1958 House 1600, a petition by the Massachusetts Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO. As introduced, the bill contained a section 2 which read: \u201cAny teacher . . . referred to in section one of this act who has satisfied the requirement for the minimum period of creditable service under... [G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2)] may elect to avail himself of either the remedies provided for in said section sixteen or of the remedy provided for in said section one of this act. \u2019 \u2019 On April 22, 1958, Senate Bill 683, which contained no section 2, was substituted for House 1600, and was enacted without change. No legislative history has come to our attention which sheds light on the reasons for the omission of \u00a7 2 of 1958 House 1600. In the face of the provision by what is now c. 71, \u00a743A, of a complete method of statutory review of action under \u00a7 42, section 2 may have been regarded as unnecesssary, especially in view of the provision of c. 32, \u00a7 16(5), quoted below in the Appendix, part 3(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\"> It should be noted that, at 512, the <em>Welch </em>case suggests that the \u2018 \u2018dismissal of a teacher upon a ground stated in c. 71, \u00a7 42, presents a substantive issue (viz., whether the ground in fact exists) reasonably adapted to an independent review,\u201d and distinguishes \u201cthe unrestricted power of removal,\u201d given under the separate statute then under consideration. In the present case, Miss Haskell was discharged for purely budgetary reasons, and the 1982 B.T.U. case makes it clear that such a discharge (absent a \u201csham or subterfuge\u201d) in effect presents (see the <em>Welch </em>case, 343 Mass. at 512) \u201cno substantial issue appropriate for independent review. \u201d Certainly, such a dismissal ordinarily should not present ground for <em>two </em>separate types of review by <em>different </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>bodies. Although Miss Haskell\u2019s discharge took place before the adoption of Proposition <em>2\u00bd </em>(see St. 1980, c. 580, as amended by St. 1981, c. 782), some weight must be given to the circumstance that Miss Haskell\u2019s contention, if accepted, would tend to frustrate the school committee\u2019s effort to effect reasonable economies, purely because of what may have been an inadvertent failure to comply precisely with c. 32, \u00a7 (16) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
