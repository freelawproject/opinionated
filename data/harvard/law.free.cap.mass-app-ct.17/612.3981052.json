An action was brought on the Michigan judgment against Chrome in the Superior Court in Massachusetts. Chrome admitted in its answer that it had received in June, 1981, a summons and complaint in the Michigan action. These it apparently disregarded. Splaine and Chrome each filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in the Massachusetts action. The docket shows that each such motion was denied. The trial judge seems to have treated the motions essentially as seeking summary judgment, which he granted for Splaine. From that judgment, in the amount of the Michigan judgment plus interest, Chrome has appealed. The facts are stated on the basis of the pleadings and affidavits of Splaine and of Fred J. Saltzberg, general manager of Chrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Splaine\u2019s letterhead shows him to be operating in Grand Rapids, Michigan, apparently as a dealer in \u201cparts . . . and other items of interest to . . . collectors of Mercedes cars\u201d. He had seen advertisements by Chrome \u2018 \u2018in magazines directed toward persons interested in refurbishing automobiles,\u201d including Hemming\u2019s Motor News, a magazine which circulates to the group indicated. In response to such an advertisement, Splaine inquired of Saltzberg (then apparently in Massachusetts at Chrome\u2019s only place of business) about the cost of replating chrome parts for a 1961 Mercedes automobile. Saltzberg, in reply to Splaine\u2019s inquiry, suggested that the parts be sent to Chrome so that an estimate could be given. Shortly after the parts were submitted to Chrome, one of its employees gave Splaine an estimate for the work of a maximum of $850 plus $15.58 for shipping and insurance. There was an agreement that the work would be \u201cshow quality\u201d and \u201cwould be completed within four to six weeks.\u201d Splaine \u201creceived the parts . . . eleven weeks later . . . with ac.o.d. shipping charge of $494.16.\u201d Splaine \u2018\u2018determined that the parts had been ruined by\u201d Chrome and complained to Saltzberg about \u2018 \u2018the unsatisfactory work. \u2019 \u2019 Saltzberg asked that the parts be returned to Chrome for inspection. The parts again were sent to Chrome and, \u201cafter several additional phone calls and conversations,\u201d they were returned to Splaine about three months later in the same condition they had been in when first sent by Chrome to Splaine. There is no showing that Chrome directly acted outside of Massachusetts at any time and one of Saltzberg\u2019s affidavits asserts that Chrome has engaged in no commercial or other activity in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Splaine initiated all contacts with Chrome, except that Chrome \u2018 \u2018may have\u2019 \u2019 called Splaine once in response to the latter\u2019s request for an estimate. By affidavit Chrome claimed not to advertise in the publications mentioned by Splaine to solicit business in Michigan but only to solicit business in Massachusetts and that it had no contact with Splaine \u201cthrough the mail except for the return shipment of\u201d Splaine\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>1. We assume that Michigan by enacting Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 600.705 and 600.715 (1979),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has attempted to subject nonresidents to Michigan\u2019s full potential limited jurisdiction over nonresidents. See <em>Sifers </em>v. <em>Horen, </em>385 Mich. 195,198-200, and dissent at 204 (1971). See also <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Fedders Corp., </em>643 F.2d 1229, 1236-1237 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 893 (1981), and cases cited. We may give full faith and credit to the Michigan judgment, however, only if Chrome had \u201cminimum contacts \u2019 \u2019 with Michigan sufficient to permit the Michigan court to exercise jurisdiction over it, as a matter of due process, under the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Judicial Court. See <em>McDade </em>v. <em>Moynihan, </em>330 Mass. 437, 442-443 (1953); Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 100, but contrast \u00a7 103 (1971), and Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 81, comment a (1982). See also <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Columbian Natl. Life Ins. Co., </em>232 Mass. 224, 229-231 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">2. In <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 291-292 (1980), the relevant decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States are reviewed. The opinion states the general rule as follows (citations omitted): \u2018 \u2018 [A] state court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only so long as there exist \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 between the defendant and the forum State. . . . The concept of minimum contacts . . . per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>form[s] two related, but distinguishable, functions. It protects the defendant against the burdens of litigating in a distant or inconvenient forum. And it acts to ensure that the States, through their courts, do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system .... [T]he defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum State must be such that maintenance of the suit \u2018does not offend \u2018 \u2018 traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. \u201d \u2019 . . . The relationship between the defendant and the forum must be such that it is \u2018reasonable... to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The facts of the present case are near the border line between those recognized as conferring upon a forum State (as matter of due process) jurisdiction over a nonresident corporate defendant and the facts in cases denying such jurisdiction. We regard the contacts of Chrome with Michigan as possibly somewhat more significant than those considered in the <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>case, 444 U.S. at 297-299. Those contacts with Michigan, however, seem somewhat less than the quasi-in-rem contacts of the then defendants with Delaware, dealt with in the several opinions in <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 200-228 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\"><em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 250-256 (1958), rests on special facts. Jurisdiction of the Florida courts over a Delaware trust company was denied where the trust company\u2019s contacts with Florida were merely that Florida was the residence of some beneficiaries of a trust held by that company as trustee and the place where a power of appointment under the trust was exercised.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>In <em>McGee </em>v. <em>International Life Ins. Co., </em>355 U.S. 220, 221-223 (1957), the nonresident corporate insurer (at 221) had solicited a \u201creinsurance\u201d contract from a resident of California, who had paid premiums by mail to the insurer at its Texas office. The contacts with California in the <em>McGee </em>case, held adequate in the circumstances to confer jurisdiction on the California courts to enforce the contract, are to be compared with those treated as inadequate to confer jurisdiction on the California courts, in <em>Kulko </em>v. <em>Superior Court of California, </em>436 U.S. 84, 94-97 (1978). There a separated wife of a husband resident in New York sought in California, where she resided, a modification of a separation agreement made in New York. The <em>McGee </em>case was distinguished<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the <em>Kulko </em>case (436 U.S. at 97-98) as one where the nonresident defendant had \u201csought a commercial benefit from solicitation of business from a resident of California that could reasonably render [the defendant] hable to suit in state court.\u201d In the <em>Kulko </em>case, it was mentioned also (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>that, unlike the <em>McGee </em>situation, \u201cCalifornia has not attempted to assert any particularized interest in trying such cases [separation agreement modifications] in its courts by, e.g., enacting a special jurisdictional statute\u201d (436 U.S. at 98).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <em>McGee </em>case appears to be the Supreme Court decision most favorable to Splaine\u2019s contentions before us.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The relevant Massachusetts decisions adhere closely to the principles stated in the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. The basis on which Splaine asserts that Chrome is subject to Michigan\u2019s long-arm statute seems to be that Chrome has met the requirement (see note 1, <em>supra) </em>of \u2018 \u2018the transaction of any business within\u201d Michigan. In comparable cases under the Massachusetts long-arm statute (see note 1, <em>supra) </em>the same question has arisen, under G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3(a), as amended through St. 1976, c. 435, when it has become necessary to determine whether a foreign corporation may be subjected to the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts courts because of that corporation\u2019s \u201ctransacting any business in this commonwealth. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The question before us is essentially whether the record shows that Chrome has transacted business in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. 1 (1979), a Massachusetts corporation engaged a Texas corporation to appraise leasehold interests in oil properties owned in Texas by the Massachusetts corporation and its affiliates. The Texas corporation made nine such reports to the Massachusetts company in the course of a year, during which it initiated fifty-two telephone calls to persons employed by the Massachusetts company and sent seventeen invoices to it. The Supreme Judicial Court recognized (at 7) that the controlling principle was \u201cwhether there was some minimum contact with the Commonwealth which resulted from an affirmative, intentional act of the . . . [Texas corporation], such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>that it is fair and reasonable to require . . . [it] to come into the State to defend the action. \u2019 \u2019 The court distinguished (at 8) earlier decisions in which it had held \u2018 \u2018the defendants\u2019 contacts with Massachusetts . . . insufficient to ground jurisdiction under . . . \u00a7 3(a)\u201d and reversed a judgment ordering the action dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The earlier cases thus distinguished are very close to the present one. <em>\u201cAutomatic\u201d Sprinkler Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Seneca Foods Corp., </em>361 Mass. 441 (1972), dealt with the purchase of a machine from the plaintiff by a nonresident corporation in Dundee, New York. The plaintiff, a Massachusetts company, had an office in New Jersey, and a division in Ohio where the machine was to be made. The court (at 444) pointed out that the New York \u2018 \u2018defendant\u2019s contacts in Massachusetts simply consisted of the signing of the purchase order and the mailing of it by the defendant\u2019s agent from Dundee, New York, to Worcester, Massachusetts, the receipt by the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s invoice mailed from the Worcester division, the receipt by the defendant of a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s Worcester division acknowledging and accepting the defendant\u2019s purchase order, and the defendant\u2019s payment by mail to the plaintiff\u2019s Worcester division of a sum in excess of $3,000 in response to invoices and in part payment of the purchase price.\u201d Jurisdiction of the defendant under G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 3(a), was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In <em>Droukas </em>v. <em>Divers Training Academy, Inc., </em>375 Mass. 149, 151-152 (1978), the plaintiff in Massachusetts \u201csaw the defendant\u2019s advertisement for the sale of two marine engines in a nautical publication . . . distributed in Massachusetts.\u201d From Massachusetts he called the defendant\u2019s place of business in Florida by telephone and ordered the engines. He then sent a check for the purchase price to the defendant and received in Massachusetts a letter confirming the sale and later several other letters. The defendant shipped the engines from Florida to Massachusetts under a bill of lading stating that shipping \u201ccharges are to be collect.\u201d From a scant record (at 153) and the showing of no prior business done by the defendant or its officers in Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that the defendant had insufficient contacts with Massachusetts to constitute the transaction of business in Massachusetts within \u00a7 3(a) or (at 157-160) to constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\u201ccontracting to supply services or things in this commonwealth\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 <em>3(b). </em>The court interpreted (at 157) the <em>Droukas </em>arrangement as one \u2018 \u2018for the shipment of the engines . . . by means of an independent carrier, with the burden of. . . delivering the engines in the Commonwealth on the carrier. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Referring to <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U.S. at 235, the <em>Droukas </em>court stated (at 154) that it viewed the sale of the engines \u201cas an isolated transaction, with slight effect on the commerce of the Commonwealth and as void of any purposeful intent on the\u2019 \u2019 defendant\u2019s part to avail itself of the privilege of conducting activities in Massachusetts. The court went on to say (at 154, n.5) that \u201cthe effect of a nonresident\u2019s activity on . . . commerce ... is still an important factor to be considered in deciding the sufficiency of contacts with Massachusetts. \u201d See also <em>Nichols Assocs. </em>v. <em>Starr, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 91 (1976), viewed by the court in the <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>case, 378 Mass. at 9, as based only on two contacts \u201cfor the purpose of the jurisdictional question,\u201d neither of which seems relevant in the present case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The present case, we think, lies closer to the <em>Droukas </em>case than any other decision. Splaine initiated discussion of the somewhat specialized work he wanted Chrome to undertake. There is no indication in this record that Chrome (or its principal corporation) has ever had any other contact with Michigan. The transaction was an isolated one (as <em>in Nelligan </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>546 F. Supp. 337, 339-340 [E.D. Mich. 1982]) and not large, as shown by Chrome\u2019s quotation of $850 for the work. Chrome\u2019s modest advertisements in Hemming\u2019s Motor News (a journal comparable to that in the <em>Droukas </em>case) did not exclude non-Massachusetts purchasers of Chrome\u2019s services but (as suggested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>one affidavit) it may have been inserted with the expectation that principally Massachusetts or New England purchasers of those services would be attracted. <em>Compare Herman Miller, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mr. Rents, Inc., </em>545 F. Supp. 1241, 1245 (W.D. Mich. 1982). There was no showing of any continuing relationship by Chrome with Michigan. The transaction had slight, if any, effect on commerce in Michigan and suggests no significant intention to use any privilege of conducting activities in Michigan. Certainly Michigan has not been shown to have engaged in legislative regulation of the type of services conducted by Chrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The case is obviously close. We do not regard the <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>case, 378 Mass. at 8-9, as overruling the \u2018 <em>'Automatic\" Sprinkler Corp. </em>case, 361 Mass. at 441, and the <em>Droukas </em>case, 375 Mass. 149 (1978), each of which it purports to distinguish. This indicates continuing vitality in the <em>Droukas </em>case, so we must follow it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The present isolated transaction is insufficient to constitute the transaction of business by Chrome in Michigan or otherwise to establish contacts there sufficient to subject Chrome to suit there as a matter of due process and fairness. The Michigan court had no jurisdiction to enter the judgment upon which this action is brought. Massachusetts is not required to give it full faith and credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The judgment is reversed and, unless the complaint is promptly amended to assert Splaine\u2019s claims on their merits, summary judgment for Chrome is to be entered in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\"> In pertinent part the Michigan long-arm statutes (\u00a7 600.705, individuals, and \u00a7 600.715, corporations; see \u00a7 600.711) authorize long-arm jurisdiction in that State based (\u00a7 600.715) upon the existence of any relationship between a nonresident corporation and the State <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018arising out of the act or acts which create any of the following relationships: (1) The transaction of <em>any business </em>within the state .... (5) entering into a contract for services to be performed or for <em>materials to be furnished in the state </em>by the defendant\u201d (emphasis supplied). These statutes bear a very close similarity to the Massachusetts long-arm statute, found in G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 <em>3(a) </em>and <em>(b), </em>as amended through St. 1976, c. 435. This statute provides (in part) that a Massachusetts \u201ccourt may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person\u2019s <em>(a) </em>transacting any business in this commonwealth; [or] <em>(b) </em>contracting to supply services or things in this commonwealth . . . .\u201d For interpretations of the Michigan statute, see <em>Kiefer </em>v. <em>May, </em>46 Mich.
