The weapons in question were seized as a result of a warrantless search. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress the evidence. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>allowing the motions to suppress, the judge concluded that the Commonwealth had not shown a \u201csufficient foundation for a suspicion that unknown occupants of an automobile were engaged in wrongdoing.\u201d Pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 15 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 884 (1979), the case was reported to the Appeals Court by a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, who, after hearing, allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to appeal from the allowance of the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Specific and articulable facts and reasonable inferences which flow therefrom are necessary to justify a stop motivated by suspicion that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almeida, </em>373 Mass. 266, 270-272 (1977). In addition, where the stop is of an automobile, such information must be shown to have been available before the automobile is stopped. In this regard, a stop of a vehicle will be deemed to have begun once the pursuit calculated to effect that stop has begun. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. 762, 764 (1981). Where a trial judge has made factual findings in support of his denial or allowance of a motion to suppress, \u201cthey will be accepted by an appellate court absent clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>375 Mass. 349, 354 (1978). In addition, while a trial \u201cjudge\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion ... is entitled to substantial deference, . . . such an ultimate legal conclusion, . . . drawn from the facts developed at the suppression hearing, is a matter for review . . . , particularly where the conclusion is of constitutional dimensions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra. </em>Thus, a trial judge\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress may be reversed where the facts found are clearly erroneous or \u201cwhere justice requires [that the appellate court] substitute its judgment for that of a trial judge at the final stage.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 756 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The clear error standard is a very limited form of review in this context. Where there has been conflicting testimony as to a particular event or series of events, a judge\u2019s resolution of such conflicting testimony invariably will be accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 354. \u201cThe determination of the weight and credibility of the testimony is the function and responsibility of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses, and not of [an appellate] court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, supra </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">With regard to the motion judge\u2019s findings, there is no question, with perhaps one exception, that his subsidiary findings were warranted by the evidence. The critical problem here relates to an absence in the judge\u2019s findings of a particular event which allegedly occurred and for which there is no contradictory testimony. In this regard, it is unclear whether the judge\u2019s failure to mention this event was inadvertent or whether he chose not to believe that the event occurred so that his failure to mention it was purposeful. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 83, 90-91 (1980). The event in question is crucial in determining whether the officer\u2019s decision to follow and subsequently stop the automobile in which the defendants were riding was based upon a reasonable inference drawn from specific and articulable facts or whether it was based upon a constitutionally impermissible hunch or guess. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almeida, </em>373 Mass. at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">We summarize the judge\u2019s findings. On September 4, 1981, Detective Michael Cutillo, a Revere police officer with eight years of experience, three in the rank of detective, was in an unmarked police vehicle with his partner, Detective Nunez, both in plain clothes. At some time during the early evening hours Detectives Cutillo and Nunez received a radio report of a disturbance at Zeke\u2019s Lounge. In response, Cutillo and Nunez drove to Zeke\u2019s Lounge, where they observed a large crowd of approximately twenty persons drunk and disorderly outside of the lounge. The detectives also observed that one Maureen Simone had been injured. She was bleeding and appeared to have a broken nose. Detectives Cutillo and Nunez spoke with Simone in an effort to learn the identity of her assailant, but they had no success. Prior to the officers\u2019 arrival Simone had been inside Zeke\u2019s Lounge. As she was attempting to make her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>way through a crowd which had assembled, she was struck and knocked down. Apparently she lost consciousness. She could not recall either who struck her or what occurred after she had been struck. Cutillo did learn that Simone had been kicked in the nose by another woman. The lounge\u2019s proprietor, one Zalenda, had telephoned the Revere police department as a consequence of the disturbance, although he had not observed the events which had occurred outside the lounge. Cutillo and Nunez dispersed the crowd and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Approximately twenty minutes later, Cutillo and Nunez received another radio communication of yet another disturbance at Zeke\u2019s, and they returned to the lounge. Upon their arrival the officers observed a large crowd outside which included the four defendants who, because of their neat attire, \u201cstuck out like a sore thumb.\u201d In response to Cutillo\u2019s question whether \u201cthere had been any problem with the four defendants,\u201d Zalenda said \u201cno.\u201d Zalenda further stated that \u201cthey were friends of his\u201d and that everything was \u201cfine.\u201d As the two officers began to disperse the crowd, Cutillo observed the four defendants and Zalenda go around the corner out of his view. About five minutes later, Zalenda returned, bleeding from the left ear. Cutillo asked Zalenda what had occurred. Zalenda denied that the defendants had struck him and denied that the defendants had guns. As Detective Cutillo was leaving the scene, after having dispersed the crowd and after the defendants had left, he heard a female voice yell, \u201cthey got guns.\u201d From another person in the crowd the officers learned that one of the four defendants was the injured woman\u2019s brother-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Deciding that it would be important to determine whether the four defendants in fact possessed guns and whether they were looking for Simone\u2019s assailant, Detectives Cutillo and Nunez began to drive around searching for the defendants. After driving around the area for a few minutes, Cutillo observed a 1980 Lincoln Continental travelling in a direction away from the Lounge. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>vehicle was proceeding at a moderate rate of speed south on Ocean Avenue and was not engaged in any activity which would have alerted Cutillo\u2019s suspicions. Despite that, Cutillo began to follow that vehicle, \u201cguessing\u201d that the four defendants were riding in it. Cutillo then radioed ahead to alert another police vehicle. Cutillo directed the other officers to follow the Lincoln and to put on the blue flashing lights when both of their vehicles were behind the Lincoln. When Cutillo\u2019s vehicle and the other police vehicle were appropriately positioned, the operator of the other police vehicle turned on the flashing lights, and as the Lincoln pulled over it was cut off by Cutillo\u2019s vehicle. As Cutillo was passing the Lincoln he recognized the four defendants. Detective Cutillo had previously learned from a radio communication from the other police vehicle that four persons were in the Lincoln.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Just before Detective Cutillo pulled over in front of the Lincoln, he observed that the driver was one of the four suspects and that a person sitting in the front passenger seat leaned forward as if to place something under the front seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">As the four defendants left the Lincoln, leaving the front and rear doors open, Cutillo and his partner approached them with drawn guns and ordered them to raise their hands. Cutillo pat-searched the defendants and found nothing. He then looked into the front seat of the Lincoln and observed the butt of a pistol sticking out from under the front seat and retrieved it. Nunez then searched under the front seat from the rear and seized another pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">At the time he arrested the defendants, Detective Cutillo testified that he feared for his own personal safety, and the judge found his testimony credible. Cutillo testified further that he stopped the Lincoln to determine if the four men were the same men who were at Zeke\u2019s Lounge, and to determine if they had guns and whether they were looking for Simone\u2019s assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Based on these findings the judge determined that the detectives\u2019 reason for pulling over the defendants\u2019 car was because it was \u201cthe first car they <em>guessed </em>[emphasis supplied] the defendants might be riding in.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the judge\u2019s finding that the totality of the circumstances \u201cmay arguably have provided the detectives with the quantum of articulable suspicion necessary to support an investigatory stop of the defendants,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the judge concluded that, since \u201cthe Detectives [had] observed nothing suspicious about either the car or its occupants . . . [and since] there [was nothing] peculiar about the car and its direction of travel which would tie it to what happened at Zeke\u2019s,\u201d the detectives\u2019 action in stopping the car was essentially random and unsubstantiated by any reasonable suspicion that the car indeed contained the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Apart from the unsettling determination that the stop was not \u201cin any way connected to the event at Zeke\u2019s,\u201d there is a more significant problem with the findings. There was testimony that Detective Cutillo, simultaneously with hearing that \u201cthey got guns,\u201d observed a Lincoln turn the corner of Shirley Avenue and approach his location at the corner of Garfield Avenue. Cutillo made this observation <em>prior </em>to entering his vehicle. Cutillo and his partner initially drove off in the direction the four men had taken on foot with Zalenda and, not finding them still in that general area, decided to follow the Lincoln previously sighted in order to ascertain whether it contained the four men.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The judge found that, after hearing the shout \u201cthey got guns\u201d the detectives \u201cbegan to drive around searching for the defendants [and] after driving around ... for a few minutes . . . observed a . . . Lincoln . . . travelling in a direction away from the lounge.\u201d That finding, however, is contextually and chronologically deficient. Cutillo never testified nor did the judge find that the <em>first </em>time Cutillo observed the Lincoln was after he and his partner began to drive around searching for the defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, Cutillo\u2019s testimony that he had first observed the Lincoln while standing on the corner of Garfield Avenue stood uncontradicted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge should have made a specific finding indicating his belief or disbelief of the testimony. The confusion caused by this deficiency is compounded by the judge\u2019s conclusion that there was nothing \u201cpeculiar about the car and its direction of travel which would tie it to what happened at Zekes.\u201d Certainly, sighting the Lincoln coming from the direction which the four men and Zalenda had taken on foot, viewed in the context of a simultaneous shout \u2014 \u201cThey got guns\u201d \u2014 and a subsequent check of the area to make sure the four men were not still on foot, could reasonably be said to warrant Detective Cutillo\u2019s \u201cguess\u201d that the car probably contained the four men and should, therefore, be followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is to be noted that, prior to the point at which a stop can be said to have begun, see <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. at 764, Cutillo learned, as the judge found, that the Lincoln did contain four men.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These facts warranted the police officer\u2019s inference<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that the Lincoln contained <em>the </em>four men whom the judge found were \u201carguably\u201d the reasonable objects of a Terry-type<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> stop and frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Finally, taking into account Detective Cutillo\u2019s experience, it seems highly (we would hope) unlikely that he or any other police officer would have begun stopping cars at random in order to find the four men eventually. The stop here would plainly have been justified if the officer, by his first observation, indeed had connected the Lincoln in time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>and proximity with criminal activity which may have occurred,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was likely occurring,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or which might occur.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In view of the foregoing, the motion judge must make additional findings. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\"> Although neither side challenges this finding, it does not appear to be supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\"> The judge also stated that \u201cthe decision to pull over the Lincoln Continental was based solely upon a guess, i.e., a hunch . . . not connected in any way to the event at Zeke\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\"> The judge\u2019s full statement was: \u201cThe Detectives\u2019 suspicion that the defendants had assaulted Mr. Zalenda, a fact which Mr. Zalenda himself denied, coupled with the assumption that an unidentified female was referring to the defendants when she said \u2018they got guns,\u2019 and the uncorroborated assertion of someone in the crowd outside of Zeke\u2019s that one of the defendants was related to Ms. Simone may arguably have provided the detectives with the quantum of articulable suspicion necessary to support an investigatory stop of the defendants. See <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981)] (Police entitled to draw inferences and make deductions about \u2018modes ... of operation[ ] of certain kinds of lawbreakers\u2019).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b548-5\"> There is testimony in the transcript which, if viewed uncritically, might seem to indicate when Officer Cutillo first saw the Lincoln. However, these instances relate to when Officer Cutillo first observed the Lincoln <em>after </em>taking off in the unmarked cruiser, first, to determine if the four men were still on foot and, second, to follow the Lincoln should the four men not be found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\"> Moreover, nearly all of that testimony was elicited on cross-examination by counsel for defendants Carrozza and Simone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> The choice of the word \u2014 guess \u2014 is not dispositive. The task for the court is to determine the underlying basis of the officer\u2019s decision. A mere \u201chunch\u201d is constitutionally invalid, but reasonable \u201cinferences\u201d and rational deductions therefrom may yield a \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d in the total circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 658, 660 (1981). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405-407 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\"> Notwithstanding the lack of specific evidence on the point, the Commonwealth, the defendants, and the judge all seem to accept it as an established fact. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>On remand, this factor, if established, must be evaluated by the judge and included in the calculus of determining reasonable police conduct in the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> The word used to characterize this inference, by Detective Cutillo himself, was \u201cguess\u201d or \u201cassumption.\u201d However, mere use of these words should not control if Detective Cutillo\u2019s admitted guess or assumption was in context a reasonable inference to be drawn from specific and articulable facts. In addition, in all but one of the instances when Detective Cutillo admitted he was guessing or assuming, those very words were the only choices presented to him for the purpose of characterizing the basis for his singling out the Lincoln for investigation. The one instance when another choice was given to him was when the motion judge asked: \u201cDid you follow [the Lincoln] as a consequence of recognizing the four men who are the defendants being in that car at that time? Or did you just guess that they were in it?\u201d Whereupon Detective Cutillo responded: \u201cAgain, your Honor, I\u2019d have to say I guessed they were.\u201d (The word \u201cagain,\u201d referred to previous testimony by Detective Cutillo that he had assumed the four men had come to Zeke\u2019s in a car.) The problem with relying on Detective Cutillo\u2019s use of the word \u201cguess\u201d here is that the choice to which he was responding was deficient. Furthermore, given the judge\u2019s finding that it was reasonable for Detective Cutillo to suspect the four men had committed a crime at Zeke\u2019s [i.e., the assault of Zalenda], the officer\u2019s inference that the suspects would make their getaway in a vehicle and along a likely route can also be said to be reasonable. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 944, 945-946 (1978); <em>Commonwealth v. Tosi, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1029, 1029-1030 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 16-19 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\"> The judge found that, despite Zalenda\u2019s denial (see <em>Almeida, supra </em>at 268),' the officers might reasonably have suspected that the four men had assaulted him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> The judge found that the officers might reasonably have suspected that the defendants were armed. The exigencies of the circumstances would seem to justify the officers\u2019 reliance on the shout that \u201cthey got guns.\u201d For cases dealing with the adequacy of uncorroborated anonymous tips, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>366 Mass. 394, 397-400 (1974). \u201cHere the law coincides with the necessities of police investigation, for it would make no sense to leave an officer wringing his hands awaiting full confirmation while a car under such a cloud sped away.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cosme, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 452-453 (1983). In addition, police officers are always warranted in presuming that a person armed does not have a license to carry a firearm and is, therefore, committing a crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrioli, </em>10 Mass.
