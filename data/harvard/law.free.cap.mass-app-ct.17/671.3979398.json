(Telecon) and the defendant (E-S) made a written contract under which Telecon was to survey E-S\u2019s telephone system in an effort to achieve \u201cthe same or an improved service [to E-S] at a reduced cost based on rates . . . in effect [on] the date of\u201d the contract. The contract provided (by par. 4 of E-S\u2019s undertakings) that E-S would \u201cforward a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>cision to\u201d Telecon within thirty days after Telecon\u2019s recommendations were received, \u201cwhich recommendations . . . [would] be deemed accepted if written rejection\u201d was not tendered by E-S \u201cwithin the [thirty-day] period\u201d by mail to a specified address . This contract provision is hereinafter called the \u201crejection requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Telecon\u2019s complaint alleged that it had fully performed the agreement but had not been paid the agreed compensation by E-S. The trial judge, sitting by agreement without a jury, found that Telecon submitted to E-S recommendations (reports numbered #2 through #5 and a further report #6 for which Telecon never sent a bill), but that E-S never within \u201cthirty days after receipt of each report\u201d objected in writing to Telecon\u2019s recommendations. The trial judge decided that E-S had not performed its part of the contract and ordered judgment for Telecon for $3,578.86, plus interest, from the date of E-S\u2019s receipt of Telecon\u2019s bill, and costs. E-S appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">1. E-S contends that the trial judge erred in excluding evidence (as to which E-S made an offer of proof) about a conference on or about March 23, 1978, at which Telecon\u2019s general manager, John T. Hearon, allegedly told Joseph Swan of E-S, that Telecon would accept an oral statement by E-S, that it was \u201cnot going to implement\u201d Telecon\u2019s recommendations. This apparently was to be in lieu of the written notice of such rejection called for in the \u201crejection requirement,\u201d already mentioned. If authorized by Telecon, such an oral modification of the written contract, or waiver of the requirement, could have been found to have been effective. See <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Arnold, 3 </em>Met. 486, 489-494 (1842); <em>Lampasona </em>v. <em>Capriotti, </em>296 Mass. 34, 37-38 (1936); <em>Capitol Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Pre-Schools, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1980); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 84, 89, 150 (1981); Corbin, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 574 (at 372-373), 752-753, 759, 1294 (1960). Evidence of an oral agreement to modify the original contract, or of an oral waiver of a condition of that contract, would not have been inadmissible as hearsay, for such evidence would have been attempted proof of an \u201coperative\u201d statement not within the hearsay rule. See <em>Glassman </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>277 Mass. 376, 382 (1931); 6 Wig-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>more, Evidence \u00a7 1770 (Chadbourn rev. 1976); Liacos, Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence 265 (5th ed. 1981); McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 249 (2d ed. 1972); Hughes, Evidence \u00a7 453(1) (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">No portions of the transcript appear in the record appendix. To show that the trial judge wrongly excluded evidence of an oral modification or waiver of the \u201crejection requirement,\u201d some resort to the transcript is necessary. At least as a discretionary matter, we could decline to pass upon the issue argued where the necessary portion of the transcript has not been included in the record appendix. <em>Kunen </em>v. <em>First Agricultural Natl. Bank, 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 684 (1978). See <em>S. Kemble Fischer Realty Trust </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Concord, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 477, 478-479 n.3 (1980); <em>Iverson </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dedham, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 951 (1982). No leave to refer to portions of the record not included in the appendix was obtained by E-S prior to argument. See Mass.R.A.P. 18(a), as appearing in 378 Mass. 940 (1979), reading in part, \u201cThe fact that parts of the record are not included in the appendix shall not prevent the parties <em>or the court </em>from relying on such parts, provided that the court may decline to permit the parties to refer to portions of the record omitted from the appendix, <em>unless leave be granted prior to </em>argument\u201d (emphasis supplied). Unless such leave is obtained, litigants should not assume that this court will take advantage of its freedom to make use of portions of the record not included in the appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajb\">See the cases just cited, and <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 851 (1980); <em>Plakas </em>v. <em>Plakas, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 922 (1981), and the <em>Iverson </em>case, 14 Mass. App. Ct. at 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">E-S, in its brief, has reproduced the portion of the transcript which contains (a) the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of the evidence about what Telecon\u2019s general manager told E-S\u2019s representative on March 23, 1978, and (b) the offer of proof, already mentioned, made by counsel for E-S. Telecon in its brief apparently does not contend that these excerpts from the transcript in E-S\u2019s brief are inaccurate. Telecon suggests, however, that preceding material in the transcript (not reproduced in E-S\u2019s brief) may have been in part the basis of the judge\u2019s ruling. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ruling seems to have rested on his mistaken impression that the conversation constituted an admission (of a type which is an exception to the hearsay rule) rather than an oral operative statement resulting in modification of the contract, or waiver of one of its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We could treat the E-S excerpt from the transcript as essentially an agreed addition to the record appendix in order to prevent the trial judge\u2019s mistaken impression from causing a possible injustice. We do not do so, in part because there must be a new trial in any event. This will permit reconsideration, on the evidence then presented, of the issue whether the substance of what was said at the conference on March 23, 1978, resulted in modification of the contract or a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">2. Telecon was to receive $ 1,000 as initial compensation for its services. Telecon might also become entitled to an additional contingent fee based on E-S\u2019s savings and refunds on its telephone services during the twenty-four months beginning on the date of E-S\u2019s acceptance of Telecon\u2019s recommendations. There was, however, to \u201cbe no contingent fee until . . . [E-S] <em>realizes </em>[$1,000 of] agreed savings . . . or refunds\u201d (emphasis supplied) based on Telecon\u2019s recommendations. Thereafter Telecon was to be entitled to thirty percent of such savings and fifty percent of such refunds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">E-S contends that (because it did not carry the recommendations into effect at all and thus has not <em>realized </em>any savings or refunds) it has not become subject to any liability to Telecon under the contract. We perceive no undertaking in the contract by E-S to carry out any of Telecon\u2019s recommendations unless such an undertaking can be implied from the \u201crejection requirement.\u201d On the present record, that provision is too ambiguous and too general in terms to be viewed as more than E-S\u2019s acknowledgement that the ideas for refunds or savings originated with Telecon. Such an acknowledgement would have the consequence that, if E-S should make use of any recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>tians within the stipulated period of twenty-four months, it would become liable to Telecon for the agreed contingent compensation for savings and refunds <em>realized.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">E-S\u2019s inaction upon Telecon\u2019s recommendations does not impress us as amounting to prevention of any performance by Telecon. Compare <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Markus, </em>339 Mass. 766, 768-769 (1959); <em>Frank Fitzgerald, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacella Bros. Inc., </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 240, 242 (1974); Corbin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 767-771. It also does not seem to us to be, in itself, a breach of contract by E-S. We think that, by the contract, Telecon assumed the risk that E-S might decide that the results of Telecon\u2019s recommended changes were too uncertain, speculative, or costly to warrant any effort by E-S to put them into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Our interpretation of the contract on this record, of course, is made without the benefit of any evidence which might explain and clarify the \u201crejection requirement.\u201d Accordingly, we merely reverse the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\"> E-S also had agreed that rejected Telecon recommendations would \u201cnot be implemented\u201d for twelve months and if \u201cimplemented prior to this,\u201d Telecon would receive its share of the consequent savings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
