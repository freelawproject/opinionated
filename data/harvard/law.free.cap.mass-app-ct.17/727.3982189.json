L. c. 152. The judgment reversed the decision of the reviewing board, which had affirmed the decision of a single member denying the employee compensation. The sole issue upon appeal is whether the employee sustained a compensable personal injury arising out of and in the course of her employment when, in August 1977, she suffered an emotional breakdown after being informed by her employer that she had been laid off from her current department and that she would be transferred to another department. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">We summarize the facts found by the single member and adopted by the reviewing board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The employee, Helen J. Kelly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>was employed by her employer for twenty-two years prior to August of 1977. At the time of the incidents she worked as an associate training specialist and was totally responsible for the running of the employer\u2019s training center. Kelly was happily married, had two grown children, and got along extremely well with her supervisor. Her monthly gross pay, as of August, 1977, was $1,301.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">On Friday, August 19, 1977, Kelly\u2019s supervisor called her aside to an isolated area in the plant and informed her that the company was cutting back in her department and that she would be laid off. Kelly began to cry and went home early on that date, being unable to compose herself and continue work. Kelly remained upset and cried most of the weekend. On Monday, August 22, 1977, she returned to work and was told she could work as a foreperson in the cable department. Kelly was not pleased to be assigned to that department, and on that date became depressed, developed chest pains, was put in a wheel chair, and was taken to a hospital. She was examined and subsequently put on medication (darvocet and valium). Kelly remained out of work for over six weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">On October 5, 1977, Kelly returned to work in the cable department. However, on October 14 she again developed severe chest pains and was taken to the hospital. She thereafter underwent regular psychiatric treatment, lost fifteen pounds, began to have trouble eating and sleeping, and suffered from depression. The single member also found, based upon the testimony of the psychiatrist who had treated her for depression, that Kelly has been totally disabled and unable to work since August 22, 1977, and that her psychiatric problems were \u201ccaused by her hearing that she was to be laid off from one department and transferred to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The single member decided that Kelly had suffered no industrial injury on either August 22, 1977, or October 14, 1977.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>The reviewing board affirmed this decision. In setting aside the board\u2019s decision and ordering the payment of temporary total incapacity compensation benefits under \u00a7 34 of the act, the judge in the Superior Court expressly relied upon <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Our workers\u2019 compensation act offers very broad protection to employees. See <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 592-593 (1982). It has been consistently held that the act should be liberally construed and interpreted wherever possible in favor of the injured employee. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 29 (2d ed. 1981). Unlike the compensation acts of many other States, our act does not contain a requirement that an injury occur \u201cby accident,\u201d see <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 592, and the term \u201c[p]ersonal injury has been broadly defined to include \u2018whatever lesion or change in any part of the system produces harm or pain or a lessened facility of the natural use of any bodily activity or capability.\u2019\u201d <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, 31A </em>Mass. 633, 637 (1978), quoting from <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 8, 12 (1914). Entitlement to compensation does not depend on the fault of the employer or upon the foreseeability of harm. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 496 (1916). It is settled that the employer must take the worker \u201cas is\u201d with existing disabilities and propensities to injury, <em>see Madden\u2019s Case, supra; Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 593; Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation at \u00a7 173, and without regard to whether a reasonable person would have suffered the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn to this case. The insurer does not dispute that Kelly became disabled directly as a result of a mental or emotional disorder. It argues, however, that Kelly\u2019s mental disorder is not within the coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>of the act. In support of this contention, the insurer presents two theories which, in essence, attempt to distinguish the <em>Albanese </em>and <em>Fitzgibbons </em>cases from this case. We are not persuaded by either theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The insurer argues first that Kelly\u2019s emotional disturbance is not a compensable \u201cpersonal injury\u201d under c. 152, citing <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57 (1917), and <em>Begin\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 594 (1968). However, as explained in <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case </em>(374 Mass. at 638), those two decisions \u201chave come to stand for the doctrine of wear and tear.\u201d Under this doctrine, the \u201cgradual breaking down or degeneration of tissues caused by long and laborious work is not the result of a personal injury within the meaning of the act.\u201d <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. at 61. See generally <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 590. While in some cases \u201c[t]he line between compensable injury and mere \u2018wear and tear\u2019 is a delicate one\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 594, the Supreme Judicial Court has explicitly recognized that a mental injury arising from either a specific stressful work-related incident or a series of such incidents does not fall within the \u201cwear and tear\u201d doctrine and, therefore, is compensable. See <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 638; <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 594-595. The board\u2019s findings expressly state that Kelly\u2019s psychiatric disorder \u201cwas caused by her hearing that she was to be laid off from one department and transferred to another.\u201d Thus, her incapacity is directly related to two specific and stressful work-related incidents coming three days apart and not to general tension or stress of the job occurring over a period of months or years. These differences take the case out of the \u201cwear and tear\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The insurer\u2019s remaining argument relies on <em>Korsun\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 124, 128 (1968), for the proposition that an employee\u2019s apprehension over the prospect of being laid off or transferred does not arise \u201cout of the nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of employment.\u201d As the court noted in <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 639, \u201cthere was a lack of evidence [in <em>Korsun\u2019s Case] </em>with which to connect the alleged precipitating event to Korsun\u2019s employment.\u201d There is no such failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>prove causation in the present case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And as further noted in <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 594, the language in <em>Korsun\u2019s Case </em>(at 128) concerning apprehension about losing one\u2019s job refers to injuries caused by the general stress of work which are rendered noncompensable by the \u201cwear and tear\u201d doctrine. We consider <em>Korsun\u2019s Case </em>to have been limited by later opinions and to be inapplicable to the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We have given consideration to other theories which might preclude liability. The reference in <em>Albanese\u2019s Case </em>(378 Mass. at 18) to mental injuries involving \u201ceveryday stress\u201d being noncompensable must be taken, when read in the context of the discussion which precedes it, and in connection with the discussion and cases cited in note 4, <em>supra, </em>as a reference to whether compensation should be paid for gradually developing mental injuries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, it is this category of cases (designated \u201cgradual stimulus\u201d cases by Professor Larson, see 1B Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 42.23[b], at 7-637 - 7-640 [1982]) which has caused courts elsewhere the most difficulty, principally because of the potential for fraudulent claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is clear, however, that the \u201cgradual stimulus\u201d cases are inapposite to the facts before us, for the reasons made apparent in the <em>Fitzgibbons </em>and <em>Albanese </em>cases. We have also examined the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>elsewhere and have not found it to be helpful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor are we persuaded by the notion that compensation should be denied because mental injuries are more difficult to substantiate, and therefore more prone to fabrication.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See discussion in Cohen, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Awards for Psychoneurotic Reactions, 70 Yale L.J. 1129, 1137 (1961). \u201cIn the last analysis, the problem of malingering is one of fact, which must be left to the skill and experience of medical and psychiatric experts, and of compensation administrators, who usually manage in time to develop considerable facility in detecting malingerers at the factfinding level.\u201d Larson, Mental and Nervous Injury in Workmen\u2019s Compensation, 23 Vand. L.Rev. 1243, 1259 (1970). We conclude that the facts in this case are governed by the <em>Alt\u00e1nese </em>and <em>Fitzgibbons </em>cases, which permit compensation for mental injuries caused by \u201cidentifiable stressful work-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>related incidents\u201d (378 Mass. at 18), occurring in employment looked at \u201cin any of its aspects\u201d (374 Mass. at 638).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We must, however, say that we find the result troubling and one which may involve a larger extension of liability than the last cited cases contemplated. In this regard, it may be that a rule is called for which would exclude from compensation mental injuries brought about by good faith decisons by an employer to lay off or transfer employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The possible adoption of such a rule would necessarily have to consider (as a matter of policy) whether mental injuries like the one suffered by Kelly should be compensated under G. L. c. 152 as a legitimate cost of doing business or whether they should instead be borne by the public under programs such as unemployment compensation and social security disability (keeping in mind that medical benefits under the latter programs may not exist or may be more limited than the benefits payable under c. 152). In view of the <em>Fitzgibbons </em>and <em>Albanese </em>cases, the limitations of compensation on facts like those before us are more properly made by the Legislature or by the Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. Costs and expenses of appeal shall be allowed by a single justice. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A; <em>Albanese\u2019s </em>Case, 378 Mass. at 19, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-15\"> \u201cThe findings of the reviewing board are final unless they are wholly lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law.\u201d <em>Korsun\u2019s Case, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>354 Mass. 124, 125 (1968). See <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14, 15 n.2 (1979). The findings of fact made here are supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-9\"> In so deciding, the single member rejected testimony by Kelly concerning her treatment in the cable department, which, if believed, would have made the facts closer to those in <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\"> The judge was mindful of the rule that the board\u2019s decision \u201cis not to be reversed unless it is lacking in evidentiary support or a different conclusion is required as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Corraro\u2019s Case, </em>380 Mass. 357, 359 (1980). The judge\u2019s decision makes clear, however, that he accepted the facts determined by the board (as he was required to do) and that he concluded, under the principles stated in <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, supra, </em>that those facts required the payment of compensation as matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b757-6\"> The court also noted in <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case </em>that the fact the injury may have been caused in part by the employee\u2019s personal idiosyncracy is not enough to bring the case within the rule of <em>Korsun\u2019s Case. </em>It noted that \u201cthe event triggering the [personal idiosyncracy] is the relevant criterion in determining whether the injury is compensable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\"> In this regard attention should also be directed to <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>a physical injury case disposed of adversely to the employee under the \u201cwear and tear\u201d doctrine, which suggests, without deciding, that a stricter standard of proof might apply to cases involving gradually developing mental illness. 385 Mass. at 595 n.3. See <em>Pomerleau </em>v. <em>United Parcel Serv., </em>464 A.2d 206 (Me. 1983), which applies a clear and convincing evidence standard to these types of injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\"> Although various approaches have been adopted to deal with this problem, the emerging trend seems to follow the so-called \u201cWisconsin rule\u201d or \u201cobjective test.\u201d To be compensable under this rule, the injury must result from gradual stimuli that are sufficiently more damaging to the employee than the day-to-day stresses which all employees must face. See e.g. <em>Sloss </em>v. <em>Industrial Commn., </em>121 Ariz. 10 (1978); <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Maine Bureau of Pub. Safety, </em>404 A.2d 1014 (Me. 1979); <em>Swiss Colony Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations, 12 </em>Wis.2d 46 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b758-5\"> The majority of jurisdictions which have dealt with sudden stimuli cases have awarded compensation. See e.g., <em>Pathfinder Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commn., </em>62 Ill. 2d 556 (1976); <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Sibley, Lindsay &amp; Curr. Co., </em>36 N.Y. 2d 505 (1975); <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>American Gen. Ins. Co., </em>154 Tex. 430 (1955); <em>Burlington Mills Corp. </em>v. <em>Hagood, </em>177 Va. 204 (1941). Those few decisions which deny compensation for injuries caused by sudden stimuli tend to do so either because the employee failed to prove causation, e.g., <em>DeAdwyler </em>v. <em>Industrial Commn., </em>86 Ill. 2d 106 (1981), or because of the court\u2019s interpretation of particular statutory requirements in its State\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation act, such as requirements that the condition result from an \u201caccident\u201d or that a physical stimulus be the precipitating event. See, e.g., <em>Hanson Buick Inc. </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>163 Ga. App. 127 (1982); <em>School Dist. No. 1 </em>v. <em>Department of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations, </em>62 Wis.2d 370 (1974). See also <em>Seitz </em>v. <em>L.&amp;R. Indus. Inc., </em>R.I. (1981) (437 A.2d 1345 [R.I. 1981]) (denying compensation under a statute like c. 152 on facts analogous to those in <em>Albanese\u2019s Case). </em>By contrast, in the instant case causation has been established. Moreover, c. 152 contains no requirement that an injury occur by \u201caccident\u201d in order to be compensable, nor does it distinguish between mental and physical injuries. As a general matter, decisions elsewhere must be viewed with caution because of the differences between other worker\u2019s compensation statutes and c. 152, either by reason of statutory text or as interpreted by decisional law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\"> It is important to note that considerations which may support a stricter standard of proof of causation in gradual stimulus cases are not present here since there was no evidence that Kelly had a preexisting mental disorder or was subject to outside stress and since the single member found, based on the psychiatric testimony, that the layoff and transfer were the sole cause of Kelly\u2019s mental illness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b759-8\"> See, however, <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545 (1980), where a claim by an employee for intentional infliction of emotional distress arising out of an alleged wrongful termination from work while criminal charges were pending was held to be exclusively covered by worker\u2019s compensation. The facts in <em>Foley </em>appear to be closer to the facts in <em>Albanese\u2019s Case.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
