Mr. Kerlinsky thereupon brought an action against the State Department of Public Welfare asserting an attorney\u2019s lien. Both parties moved for summary judgment on the main counts in the complaint and the Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>motion was allowed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judgment entered accordingly, triggering this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Some grasp of the connection between SSI payments and reimbursement of interim assistance payments under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(g) (1976) helps in understanding the role of the Commonwealth in this case. SSI is designed to meet basic subsistence needs of aged, blind, and disabled persons. To bridge the delay between the time of application for SSI and receipt of the first check \u2014 this can run to more than six months \u2014 Congress provided in \u00a7 1383(g) that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) may reimburse States which have advanced money (\u201cinterim assistance\u201d) against anticipated SSI payments. The Social Security Administration\u2019s check travels directly to the State, which reimburses itself for interim assistance, and pays the balance, if any, to the SSI recipient. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(g)(4) (1976) .<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That is what happened here with Mr. Kerlinsky\u2019s clients. As to one of them, the Commonwealth retained the entire SSI check ($5,819.97); as to the other, the record is unclear whether any balance was left to the SSI claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">It is readily apparent that the Commonwealth profited from Mr. Kerlinsky\u2019s labors, a subject about which we comment later in this opinion. His exertions, however, were on behalf of the clients who employed him and he cannot, under the pertinent Federal and State statutes and regulations, look to the Commonwealth for redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">1. <em>Federal law provisions. </em>Congress foresaw that the pursuit of entitlement to SSI might require legal assistance and, in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(d)(2) (1976), authorized the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the recognition and pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ment of claimant\u2019s representatives. Those regulations appear in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.1500 et seq. (1981). Specifically, the attorney must file a request for a fee;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Social Security Administration approves the fee; but the Social Security Administration is not responsible for paying the fee. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.1520, 416.1525, &amp; 416.1540 (1981). Returning to the statute, the first subparagraph of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(d) applies the provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 (1976) to the payment of attorney\u2019s fees. The latter statute provides that \u201cThe right of any person to any future payment . . . shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this sub-chapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\u201d The statutory language is broadly phrased and announces a legislative objective of assuring that the flow of SSI funds to the ultimate recipient, by definition a person severely on the financial ropes, is not subject to attachment by creditors. <em>Philpott </em>v. <em>Essex County Welfare Bd., </em>409 U.S. 413, 415-416 (1973). Indeed, it was in reaction to the <em>Philpott </em>decision that Congress in August, 1974, enacted the interim assistance reimbursement provisions which now appear in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(g)(1) (1976). <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Colautti, </em>483 F. Supp. 357, 363 (E.D. Pa. 1979), aff\u2019d, 633 F.2d 210 (3d Cir. 1980). As to lawyers\u2019 fees, however, there was no retreat from the policy articulated in the House Conference Report on the SSI legislation: \u201c. . . if the benefits which would be provided under this program are to meet the most basic needs of the poor, the benefits must be protected from seizure in legal processes against the beneficiary. Therefore, any amounts paid or payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>under this program would not be subject to levy, garnishment, or other legal process, except the collection of delinquent Federal taxes. Also, entitlement to these benefits would not be transferable or assignable.\u201d 1972 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admn. News 5142. See also <em>Baim </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>515 F. Supp. 227 (N.D. Ohio 1981); <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>525 F. Supp. 398, 399 (E.D. Mich. 1981), which make the point that Congress excluded from application to the SSI program the machinery contained in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406 (1976) for withholding funds to pay an attorney\u2019s fees in disability insurance cases under Title II of the Social Security Act. Compare <em>In re Treadwell, </em>699 F. 2d 1050, 1052 (11th Cir. 1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Devall, </em>704 F.2d 1513, 1516-1517 (11th Cir. 1983). Contrast <em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Califano, </em>442 F. Supp. 185, 187-188 (E.D. Tenn. 1977); <em>Dolin </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>501 F. Supp. 97, 98 (D. Md. 1980). SSI funds in the hands of the Commonwealth are not subject to attachment or lien by creditors and no exception was carved out in the statute for an attorney\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">2. <em>State law. </em>Had Federal law not precluded an attorney\u2019s lien in cases of this kind, no attorney\u2019s lien was preserved in any event. In order to assert an attorney\u2019s lien (see G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50) against the Commonwealth, it is a condition that the lawyer serve written notice on the Treasurer of the Commonwealth that he claims such a lien. G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50A. Mr. Kerlinsky left uncontroverted the Commonwealth\u2019s affidavits (in support of summary judgment) that the Treasurer had received no such notice as to either of Mr. Kerlinsky\u2019s clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">As we observed earlier, the Commonwealth benefits from reimbursement of interim assistance by SSI payments. It would seem that the Department of Public Welfare, therefore, has an interest in having lawyers represent SSI claimants. It might wish to explore with the Secretary the adoption of procedures providing for payment of an attorney\u2019s fee appropriate in light of circumstances such as these.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-14\"> Title XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1385 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"> A motion to dismiss under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), was allowed as to counts claiming relief on behalf of a class of persons similarly situated and under G.
