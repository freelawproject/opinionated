He argues four alleged errors which fall into three distinct categories: (1) the denial of motions for required findings of not guilty on the indictments that charged burglary and assaults <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>with intent to rob, (2) the denial of a motion to suppress identification testimony, and (3) the admission in evidence of certain testimony. We find no error and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We summarize the evidence. On August 12, 1981, two young women registered at a motel in Dartmouth. They were assigned a room and, because of a long automobile drive that day, fell asleep. At about 10:50 p.m., one of the victims was awakened by a noise which she thought came from the bathroom. She got up, turned off the lights and television, and went back to bed. Shortly thereafter she was awakened by an intruder who, as he approached her bed, said, \u201cDon't scream or I\u2019m going to kill you and your girlfriend.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He placed a hand over her mouth and continued to say that he would kill her. She bit his hand and he punched her in the face for about thirty to forty seconds. The other victim fled out the door, as did the intruder. Subsequent investigation disclosed that entrance into the motel room had been gained through the bathroom window, after the screen had been removed. The victims\u2019 pocketbooks were found outside the bathroom window.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">1. (a) <em>Required finding of not guilty on the burglary indictment. </em>The defendant contends that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the indictment that charged burglary. He argues that the crime occurred in a motel, a place that is not a \u201cdwelling house,\u201d one of the essential elements of the crime of burglary as stated in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14, as amended by St. 1966, c. 330.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The issue raised by the defendant appears to be a matter of first impression in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>dealing with the crime of burglary (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7\u00a7 14 &amp; 15) do not define the words \u201cdwelling house.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Kingsbury, 378 Mass. 751, 756 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where a statute does not define its words, we will give them \u201ctheir usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). In order to derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meaning we use \u201csources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, statutes are to be construed in the light of preexisting common law, <em>Ferullo\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 635, 637 (1954); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 552-553 (1974), which is of importance in this matter because the burglary statutes are of ancient vintage.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Burglary is a common law crime which historically was considered an offense against a person\u2019s right of habitation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Brooks, 4 </em>Conn. 446, 449 (1923). See also 43 A.L.R.2d 827, 835 (1955). Therefore, in order to convict a person of burglary at common law, the invaded structure had to be a place of habitation. <em>Devoe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 44 </em>Mass. 316, 325 (1841). LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law \u00a7 96, at 711 (1972). One test that has been used, for the purposes of a burglary prosecution, is whether a structure is \u201ca place to sleep in.\u201d Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 404 (1976). Thus, legal dictionaries and treatises have considered hotels, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>boarding houses, and other similar structures to be \u201cdwellings\u201d or \u201cdwelling houses\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for the purposes of burglary prosecutions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A motel is similar to a hotel and is a place of habitation. Because of the historical background of the burglary statutes, the traditional meaning given to \u201cdwelling\u201d and \u201cdwelling house\u201d by legal dictionaries and treatises, and the definition of \u201cdwelling house\u201d found in the arson statute (see note 4, supra), we hold that in the circumstances a motel is a \u201cdwelling house\u201d under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">(b) <em>Required findings of not guilty on the indictment that charged assaults with intent to rob. </em>The defendant next contends that the judge erred in denying his motion for required findings of not guilty on the indictment that, in two counts, charged assault with intent to rob. The basis of his argument is that, on his interpretation of the facts, the larceny was completed prior to the assaults and therefore the assaults were not committed with the specific intent to rob. The defendant\u2019s argument is without merit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The intention of the defendant in committing the assaults was a question of fact to be determined from all the circumstances. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>312 Mass. 553, 557 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>(1942). Intent generally can be proved only by inferences from the facts, and those inferences need only be reasonable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>387 Mass. 644, 647 (1982). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>388 Mass. 789, 797 [1983]), we consider there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the defendant returned to the bedroom with a continuing intent to steal from the victims and that the assaults were committed in furtherance of that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The defendant also contends that the judge erred in failing to give a requested instruction on the assault with intent to rob indictment. We have examined the judge\u2019s instructions and conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">2. <em>Motion to suppress identification. </em>The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress pretrial photographic identifications and subsequent in-court identifications. The judge filed findings in regard to his decision. We have examined the evidence and determine that the findings are fully supported by the record. We conclude, as did the judge, that the defendant did not meet his burden of establishing that the identifications were unnecessarily suggestive. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 97, 101-102 (1981). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1032, 1034 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">3. <em>Admission of certain evidence. </em>The defendant objected, on the ground of hearsay, to the testimony of a witness that he observed his father write on a piece of paper a license plate number which, it subsequently developed, was the same as on the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle. There was no error. The witness had identified the defendant and had testified as to the license plate number. If his testimony as to his observation of his father\u2019s actions was hearsay, a point we do not reach, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> That remark was heard by the other victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> General Laws, c. 266, \u00a7 14, provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever breaks and enters a dwelling house in the night time, with intent to commit a felony, or . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\"> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Breese, </em>10 Mass: App. Ct. 757 (1980), this court upheld a conviction of armed assault in a dwelling house. G. L. c. 265. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u00a7 18A. The crime took place in a motel room. The issue whether a motel was a dwelling house under the statute was not raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\"> In contrast, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 1 (as amended by St. 1974, c. 281), which is concerned with the crime of arson contains a definition of \u201cdwelling house.\u201d The definition includes, \u201call buildings used as dwellings such as apartment houses, tenement houses, hotels, boarding houses, dormitories, hospitals, institutions, sanatoria, or other buildings where persons are domiciled.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> Statutorily, burglary is now classified as a crime against property because it includes offenses relating to the breaking and entering into structures other than dwellings, such as vessels, ships, vehicles (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 16) and railroad cars (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 19). See Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 401 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\"> At common law, the dwelling house was called the mansion house. For the purposes of burglary, the mansion house not only included the dwelling house but also other buildings within the curtilage. See <em>Devoe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\"> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 454 (rev. 5th ed. 1979) states that \u201c[i]n criminal law (e.g. burglary) [a dwelling] means a building or portion thereof, a tent, a vehicle or other enclosed space which is used or intended for use as a human habitation, home or residence.\u201d In accord is Ballantine\u2019s Law Dictionary 385 (3d ed. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">See also 12A C.J.S. Burglary \u00a7 31, at 216-217 (1980). (\u201cHotels and boarding houses, and houses in which rooms are let to lodgers, are undoubtedly dwelling houses [citations omitted] so as to make it burglary. . . .\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> The defendant also claims that because the other victim was not touched there was no force and violence as required by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 20. However, the jury could find that the threat made by the defendant, combined with the assault and battery on the first victim, was sufficient force to produce a \u201creasonable apprehension of bodily injury\u201d on the part of the second victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>362 Mass. 83, 88 n.4 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
