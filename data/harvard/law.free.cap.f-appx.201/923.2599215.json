The district court sentenced Malloy as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000), which carries a statutory minimum of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment and a maximum of life imprisonment. Malloy received 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of the range provided for by the sentencing guidelines, which were made advisory by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-24\">On appeal, Malloy\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there exist no meritorious issues for appeal but contending that Malloy\u2019s armed career criminal designation violates the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The use of prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence does not violate <em>Booker. See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 282-84 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that, where the defendant does not dispute any facts related to his prior convictions, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>court\u2019s determination of the criminal history category does not violate the Sixth Amendment), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that this challenge to Malloy\u2019s sentence is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Malloy\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Malloy, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. Accordingly, we deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from representation. If Malloy requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may again move in this court for leave to withdraw from further representation. Any such motion filed by counsel must state that a copy thereof was served on Malloy. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-17\">. Although notified of his right to do so, Malloy has not submitted a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b952-9\"><em>. </em>Additionally, Malloy has not rebutted the presumption that his sentence was reasonable. See <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (stating a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
