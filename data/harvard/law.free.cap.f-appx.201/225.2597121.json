He appeals the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application. We granted a certificate of appealability to determine whether Holzwarth received ineffective assistance of counsel during the punishment phase of trial due to his counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the victim\u2019s medical records. The medical records could have been used to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony that she had contracted genital warts, suffered a miscarriage, and had to have a hysterectomy following the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a state court\u2019s adjudication of an issue on the merits is entitled to deference. <em>Hill v. Johnson, </em>210 F.3d 481, 485 (5th Cir.2000). The petitioner has the burden of rebutting the state court\u2019s findings by clear and convincing evidence. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). We must defer to the state court\u2019s decision unless it \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(d)(2); <em>see Price v. Vincent, </em>538 U.S. 634, 639, 123 S.Ct. 1848, 155 L.Ed.2d 877 (2003). Holzwarth has not met his burden of showing that the state court\u2019s determination that he was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the victim\u2019s medical records was unreasonable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 694, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Holzwarth\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
