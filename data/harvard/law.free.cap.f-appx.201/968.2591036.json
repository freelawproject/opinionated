St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), and of amended immigration regulations providing for the filing of \u201cspecial\u201d motions to reopen pursuant to the rationale of <em>St. Cyr. See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen under a \u201c \u2018highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Motions to reopen removal proceedings are \u201c \u2018disfavored,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthe moving party bears a \u2018heavy burden.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We review the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law de novo, but \u201cdefer to the BIA\u2019s interpretations of immigration regulations if that interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 28, 2006) (No. 05-1251).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Wilson\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d motion to reopen. First, Wilson was prohibited by the very regulation on which he relies from filing a <em>second </em>motion to reopen based on <em>St. Cyr. See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(g)(3). In any event, Wilson\u2019s <em>St. Cyr </em>claim was meritless. The \u201caggravated felony\u201d forgery offense to which Wilson pleaded guilty on May 31,1996, did not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R) at the time he entered the plea. However, Congress explicitly included Wilson\u2019s offense as an aggravated felony as part of an explicitly retroactive redefinition of his offense, in \u00a7 321 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which became effective on April 1, 1997. <em>See St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 319, 121 S.Ct. 2271.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Wilson\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b996-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
