He argues that the district court\u2019s 15-month upward departure was plainly unreasonable. We need not decide whether Montes\u2019 sentence was a Guidelines or non-Guidelines sentence because, in either case, his sentence was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 441 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2958, 165 L.Ed.2d 970 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-26\">If the district court imposed a Guidelines sentence, the nature of Montes\u2019 prior offense and the six-month period within which he reoffended after deportation were factors present to an exceptional degree warranting a departure, even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>period within which he reoffended had already been taken into consideration when calculating his criminal history score. <em>See United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 309-10 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 810, 163 L.Ed.2d 637 (2005). If the district court instead imposed a non-Guidelines sentence, it used the advisory guideline range as a reference, and its reasons for the departure were fact specific and consistent with the directives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A) that in determining the sentence to impose, the court \u201cconsider ... the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and \u201cpromote respect for the law.\u201d <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Consequently, the decision to upwardly depart from the advisory range was not plain error under either scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Montes\u2019 reliance on <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc), for the proposition that the extent of the departure was plainly unreasonable is unpersuasive. The record does not support a determination that the district court upwardly departed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, and <em>Lambert </em>is therefore inapposite. Finally, we reject Montes\u2019 contention that the district court\u2019s written reasons for the departure were insufficient. By specifying that Montes returned to the United States illegally within six months of being deported, the court adequately complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
