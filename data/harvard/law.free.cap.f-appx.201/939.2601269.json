We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-22\">Carter argues that the district court incorrectly applied the cross-reference to unlawful restraint, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1), 2A4.1(a) (2004), because the facts underlying the allegation of unlawful restraint were not established by reliable evidence. We find a preponderance of the evidence supports the cross-reference. <em>See United States v. Crump, </em>120 F.3d 462, 468 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-23\">Carter also asserts his sentencing enhancements were not factually supported in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In a <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing, like Carter\u2019s, a district court must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006) (citing <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005)). In addition, \u201ca district court need not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>Eura, 440 F.3d 625, 632 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W.(U.S. June 20, 2006) (No. 05-11659). We find Carter\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309,164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">We therefore affirm Caller\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
