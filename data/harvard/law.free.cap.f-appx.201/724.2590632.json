On appeal, Garcia argues that the district court erred by concluding that the government did not breach the plea agreement by failing to file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-27\">\u201cWhether the government has breached a plea agreement is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir. 1998). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether the government can be compelled to make a substantial-assistance motion. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993) (reviewing the government\u2019s refusal to file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K 1.1 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>The Sentencing Guidelines provide that \u201c[u]pon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. \u201c[T]he decision to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines ... lies within the sound discretion of the Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>115 F.3d 839, 841 (11th Cir.1997). The Supreme Court has made clear that \u201c \u00a7 5K1.1 ... gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Of course, the prosecutor\u2019s discretion when exercising that power is subject to constitutional limitations. <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1501 (11th Cir.1993). While we have \u201cauthority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive,\u201d such as the defendant\u2019s race or religion, we will not review the government\u2019s decision to file, or not to file, a substantial-assistance motion in the absence of an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Put another way, our review is generally appropriate only when \u201cthere is an allegation and a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Here, by the plea agreement\u2019s own terms, the government reserved the unfettered right to evaluate the nature and extent of Garcia\u2019s cooperation, and to decide whether Garcia\u2019s cooperation warranted the filing of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Garcia agreed \u201cthat nothing in the agreement may be construed to require the government to file such a motion\u201d and \u201cthat the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida\u2019s assessment of the nature, value, truthfulness, completeness, and accuracy of the defendant\u2019s cooperation shall be binding on the defendant.\u201d Garcia makes neither an allegation nor a substantial showing of a constitutionally impermissible motivation, taking issue <em>only </em>with the government\u2019s assessment of her assistance. On this record, particularly in light of the plain terms of the plea agreement, the government\u2019s decision not to file a substantial-assistance motion was entirely permissible and did not amount to a breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
