This court lacks jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary decision regarding cancellation of removal. <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Although this court has jurisdiction to review Donatti\u2019s constitutional argument that his due process rights were violated because a three-member panel decided his appeal, <em>see Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 277-78 &amp; 278 n. 11 (5th Cir.2001), his argument is unavailing. Assuming for the sake of argument that the BIA did not comply with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6), the failure of an agency to follow its own regulations is not a per se denial of due process unless the regulation is required by the constitution or a statute. <em>See Arzanipour v. INS, </em>866 F.2d 743, 746 (5th Cir.1989). The BIA\u2019s regulation governing three-member panels is not required by statute. Nor does the constitution require compliance with \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6). <em>See Manzano-Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 470 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Donatti\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated when the BIA did not give what he terms \u201cany deference\u201d to the immigration judge\u2019s decision is in essence a challenge to the merits of the BIA\u2019s reversal of the immigration judge\u2019s grant of cancellation of removal, which this court lacks jurisdiction to review. <em>See Rueda, </em>380 F.3d at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Accordingly, Donatti\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
