Manna raises two issues on appeal: whether the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 373 establishes a maximum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for soliciting another to travel interstate to commit murder-for-hire and whether the district court abused its discretion under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3663A(a)(l), (c)(l)(A)(ii) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006), when it ordered restitution for counseling expenses and travel expenses absent bodily injury. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the 240-month incarceration sentence, but reverse the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-19\">Manna\u2019s indictment charged him with solicitation to commit a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 373(a), and identified the crime of violence solicited as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958 (2000), use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire. The indictment did not charge that personal injury or death resulted. The jury found Manna guilty as charged in the single-count indictment, and Manna was sentenced to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court also imposed restitution to the victims in the amount of $815 to cover the costs of counseling expenses and travel expenses related to counseling. The parties dispute the applicable statutory maximum penalty and the authority to compensate victims for costs and expenses related to counseling, absent physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-20\">Manna first questions whether the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 373 es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>t\u00e1blishes a maximum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for soliciting another to travel interstate to commit murder-for-hire. Two statutes are at issue here: \u00a7 373, the \u201csolicitation\u201d statute, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958 (2000), the \u201cmurder-for-hire\u201d statute. The pertinent language of \u00a7 373 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">Whoever ... solicits, commands, induces, or otherwise endeavors to persuade such other person to engage in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment ... of the crime solicited ... or if the crime solicited is punishable by life imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 373. Section 1958 provides for graduated maximum penalties depending upon the harm suffered by the victim: a maximum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment for the use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire without resulting injury; a maximum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for the use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire resulting in personal injury; and a maximum sentence of death or life imprisonment for the use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire resulting in death. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958(a). We review questions of statutory construction de novo. See <em>United States v. Davis, </em>98 F.3d 141, 144 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Manna argues that without proof of death or serious bodily injury, the maximum penalty for solicitation to violate the murder-for-hire statute must be one-half of the ten-year maximum for a violation of \u00a7 1958 that does not result in any injury. The reference point when analyzing \u00a7 373, however, is the \u201ccrime solicited,\u201d not the sentence of the resulting crime. <em>See United States v. Devorkin, </em>159 F.3d 465, 467 (9th Cir.1998). For example, \u00a7 373 imposes a maximum sentence of twenty years if \u201cthe crime solicited\u201d is punishable by life imprisonment or death, while the maximum prison term <em>\u201cfor all other solicitations\u201d </em>prohibited under \u00a7 373 is one-half of the prison term for \u201cthe crime solicited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, \u00a7 373 does not instruct courts to look to the actual sentence that would be imposed for the underlying violation according to the particular facts of each case. Based on the statutory language, we conclude the district court did not err when it imposed the maximum sentence for solicitation to travel interstate to commit murder-for-hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Manna next contends that the district court erred in ordering him to pay $815 to the victims, his ex-wife and son, to cover the costs of counseling and travel expenses. The MVRA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, governs here, because Manna was convicted of a crime of violence. Section 3663A(b)(2)(A) requires proof of bodily injury to a victim before a court may order restitution for counseling. It is undisputed that the victims of the solicitation sustained no bodily injury; the solicitation never proceeded beyond the point of a discussion between Manna and the undercover agent. In the absence of bodily injury, Manna correctly argues that restitution could not be ordered pursuant to \u00a7 3663A(b)(2)(A). <em>See United States v. Follet, </em>269 F.3d 996, 1001 (9th Cir.2001). Likewise, under the particular facts here, we conclude that restitution was not authorized by either \u00a7 3663A(b)(1) or \u00a7 3663A(b)(4). We therefore reverse the court\u2019s restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm Manna\u2019s sentence of incarceration and reverse the restitution order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
