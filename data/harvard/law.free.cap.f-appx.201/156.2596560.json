Mills appeals the twelvemonth plus one day prison term imposed upon revocation of his supervised release. He argues that his prison sentence is unreasonable because it does not further the goals of supervised release, and that drug treatment serves the purpose of transitioning Mills into the community under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (2000). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-25\">In imposing sentence, the court considered the statutory maximum, the advisory guideline range, and Mills\u2019 history of violations, and imposed a sentence at the bottom of the advisory range. The court properly considered the number and nature of Mills\u2019 supervised release violations in determining this sentence, in accordance with 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), 3583(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). We conclude that Mills\u2019 sentence was not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-26\">We deny as moot Mills\u2019 motion to expedite his appeal. We grant Mills\u2019 motion to dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
