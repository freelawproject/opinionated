Bell, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s order denying as moot his motion for discovery, which he filed after the district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Bell\u2019s counseled \u00a7 2255 motion raised numerous ineffective assistance of counsel claims. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge recommended denying Bell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits. Over Bell\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and denied Bell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on March 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">On April 8, 2005, Bell deposited in the prison mail a <em>pro se </em>motion for reconsideration. On May 2, 2005, the district court denied reconsideration, noting that Bell had merely reiterated claims raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion. On April 21, 2005, while Bell\u2019s motion for reconsideration was pending, Bell deposited in the prison mail a <em>pro se </em>motion for discovery. Bell\u2019s discovery motion alleged that the government had failed to turn over exculpatory documents relating to a confidential informant\u2019s history as a drug dealer, in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Although Bell argued that this <em>Brady </em>material supported his contention that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate his case, he also admitted that he was not certain the requested <em>Brady </em>material existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">Bell\u2019s discovery motion was stamped filed on May 5, 2005. On May 6, 2006, the district court denied the discovery motion as moot, noting that the case had been closed in light of the district court\u2019s March 31 order denying Bell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and its May 2 order denying his motion for reconsideration. Bell filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied as moot Bell\u2019s discovery motion. Under the mailbox rule, Bell\u2019s discovery motion was deemed filed on April 21, 2005, when Bell placed it in the prison mail. <em>See Adams v. United States, </em>173 F.3d 1339,1341 (11th Cir.1999). By that date, however, the district court already had denied Bell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits. Although Bell\u2019s motion for reconsideration remained pending, the district court\u2019s intervening decision to deny reconsideration rendered his discovery motion moot. <em>See De La Teja v. United States, </em>321 F.3d 1357, 1362 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that a case is moot \u201cwhen it no longer presents a five controversy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-10\">.
