That judgment dismissed with prejudice her Title VII<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suit in which she claimed that her employer, the United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, had discriminated against her on the basis of her sex when it suspended her for one day based on acknowledged misconduct. Having carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the applicable case law, and the record on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing Dileo\u2019s complaint for failure to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-23\">On <em>de novo </em>review we conclude, as did the district court, that Dileo failed in her effort to establish a prima facie case of sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>discrimination. She relied solely on \u201ccomparator evidence,\u201d yet none of the three male employees whom Dileo offered as comparables were in fact \u201csimilarly situated.\u201d The relevant aspects of their employment were not \u201cnearly identical\u201d to hers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As Dileo did not present any other evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment was proper. Based on our determination of this threshold issue, we do not reach the other arguments presented in the parties\u2019 briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Dileo\u2019s employer is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
