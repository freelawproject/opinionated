Nguyen was sentenced to concurrent 57-month terms of imprisonment as to counts one and four and to a consecutive 60-month term for count five. He was also sentenced to concurrent five-year periods of supervised release for each count. He contends that the sentences are unreasonable because the district court declined to depart downward based on cultural assimilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-23\">Nguyen does not challenge the calculation of the advisory guideline range. The district court considered the sentencing guidelines, along with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>determined that sentences at the low end of the guidelines range were appropriate. Nguyen\u2019s sentences within the properly calculated guidelines range are presumptively reasonable, and he has failed to demonstrate that his sentences are unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). Nothing in the record indicates that the district court based its decision not to depart downwardly on an erroneous belief that it lacked authority to depart. <em>See United States v. Landerman, </em>167 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
