Caton argues that his sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court sentenced him based on facts neither admitted by Cat\u00f3n nor found by a jury and the district court sentenced him under the pr <em>e-Booker, </em>mandatory Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">The lack of an objection in the district court on these issues requires this court to review his arguments for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005); <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600-01 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). In Caton\u2019s case there was clear or obvious <em>Booker </em>error because the district court imposed a sentence based on judge-found facts that were neither admitted by Cat\u00f3n nor found by a jury. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520. However, Cat\u00f3n cannot establish that this error affected his substantial rights. To meet this prong of the plain error test, \u201cthe error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-18\">To demonstrate that the error affected his substantial rights, Cat\u00f3n argues that the district court attempted to be lenient in determining his sentence and states that the district court imposed the minimum Guidelines sentence. However, imposition of a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range is not sufficient to demonstrate that a lower sentence would have been imposed if the Guidelines had been advisory rather than mandatory. <em>United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 318 n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005). Cat\u00f3n also relies upon various comments made by the district court. The district court\u2019s comments, when read in context, do not indicate displeasure with the pr <em>e-Booker </em>Guidelines scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">Moreover, the district court stated that the Guidelines calculations it was using were set forth in the presentence report, which the district court found reasonably addressed the criminal conduct in question. There is no evidence in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>which suggests that the district court felt constrained by the Guidelines and that if the judge had sentenced Cat\u00f3n under an advisory sentencing regime rather than a mandatory one, Cat\u00f3n would have received a lesser sentence. Cat\u00f3n has therefore failed to establish that the judicial findings of fact upon which his sentence is based is plain error under <em>Booker. See United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 395 (5th Cir.2005). Caton has likewise failed to establish that the district court committed plain eiTor when it sentenced him under the pr <em>e-Booker, </em>mandatory Guidelines. <em>Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 600-01. Finally, this court has rejected the argument made by Cat\u00f3n that the error in applying the Guidelines as mandatory is a structural exror that should be presumed prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 601 (neither <em>Booker </em>error nor <em>Fan-fan </em>error is structural).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
