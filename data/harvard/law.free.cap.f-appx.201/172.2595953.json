Accordingly we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\"> Miles's notice of appeal listed only the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration. His informal brief states that he is also appealing the district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised release and a subsequent order denying his motion for clarification. In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir. 1985). The district court entered its order revoking supervised release on June 10, 2005, and its order denying Miles\u2019 motion for clarification on December 6, 2005. The notice of appeal was filed on April 19, 2006. Because Miles failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s orders revoking Miles\u2019 supervised release and denying his motion for clarification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
