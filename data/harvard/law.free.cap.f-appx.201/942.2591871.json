Because the district court found White had attempted an escape before his sentencing, White was sentenced to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment. White appeals the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">White contends his sentence is unreasonable as the district court erroneously concluded he had obstructed justice. White\u2019s contention rests solely on his belief that his testimony should have been believed over that of the Government\u2019s witnesses. Credibility determinations, however, are within the sole province of the factfinder and will not be reassessed on appeal. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">Likewise, White contends his sentence is unreasonable \u201cbecause it is greater than necessary to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d Because the district court properly calculated and considered the advisory guideline range and weighed the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors, we conclude White\u2019s 292-month sentence, which was below the statutory maximum and at the bottom of the advisory guideline range, is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir. 2005); <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (stating a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309,164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">Accordingly, we affirm White\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
