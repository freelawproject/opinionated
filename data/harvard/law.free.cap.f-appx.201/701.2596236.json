First, Petitioners challenge the IJ and BIA decisions denying their application for asylum and withholding of removal. Second, Petitioners argue that the BIA erred when it denied their motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-20\">By statute, we may only review \u201cfinal order[s] of removal.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1); <em>Jaggernawth v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2005). An order of removal becomes final \u201c[u]pon [the] dismissal of an appeal by the [BIA].\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). \u201cTo seek judicial review of an order of removal, an alien must file a petition for review with the federal appellate court within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s issuance of the final order.\u201d <em>Jaggernawth, </em>432 F.3d at 1350 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1)-(2)). This limitation period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Dakane v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). An order of removal \u201cis not affected by the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. at 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-22\">Because Petitioners did not file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, the merits of that order, as well as the merits of the underlying IJ\u2019s decision, are outside our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-23\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-24\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321,1341 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 917, 125 S.Ct. 38, 160 L.Ed.2d 200 (2004). Motions to reconsider are disfavored in removal proceedings. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (discussing motions to reopen and explaining that such motions are disfavored because \u201cas a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States\u201d). \u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Having reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, we find no reversible error. In this case, other than their assertions that the BIA\u2019s conclusions regarding their case were incorrect, Petitioners did not raise any specific allegations of error in their motion for reconsideration. Since rearguing the merits of a case is not the purpose of a motion for reconsideration, the BIA did not err in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Accordingly, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
