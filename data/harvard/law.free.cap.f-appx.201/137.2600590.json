Hartono claims substantial evidence supports the finding that there is a pattern or practice in Indonesia of persecuting Chinese Christians such as himself. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating his eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant can establish refugee status based on past persecution in his native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2006). \u201cAn applicant who demonstrates that he was the subject of past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Ngarurih, </em>371 F.3d at 187. The well-founded fear of persecution standard contains both a subjective and an objective component. \u201cAn applicant may satisfy the subjective element by presenting \u2018candid, credible, and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 201-02 (4th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Berroteram </em>\u2014 .Melendez <em>v. INS, </em>955 F.2d 1251, 1256 (9th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The objective element requires a showing of specific, concrete facts that would lead a reasonable person in like circumstances to fear persecution. <em>Huaman-Comelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992). An alien need not provide evidence \u201cthat there is a reasonable possibility that he or she would be singled out individually for persecution\u201d if he or she establishes there is a \u201cpattern or practice in his country or her country of nationality\u201d of persecution of a group of similarly situated persons. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(iii) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We will reverse the Board \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio, </em>979 F.2d at 999 (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">We find the evidence does not compel a different result. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
