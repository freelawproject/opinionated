We review the decision of the immigration judge as the BIA relied upon it in its decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We review factual conclusions for substantial evidence and questions of law de novo. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-21\">Butt first challenges the validity of the notice to appear because it was signed by an \u201cInterim District Director.\u201d Butt argues that Interim District Directors are not authorized to issue notices to appear because they are not listed in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1. This argument is meritless. The regulation allows for another officer, such as the Interim District Director in Butt\u2019s case, to act in the \u201ccapacity\u201d of the District Director until the position is permanently filled. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-22\">Butt also argues that he has been denied equal protection and that he was the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>of selective enforcement. These claims apparently stem from Butt\u2019s registration with the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), which permits the Department of Homeland Security to monitor aliens \u201cwho may present elevated national security concerns\u201d because they hail from countries associated with active terrorist organizations. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 678, 679 (5th Cir.2006); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303. To the extent Butt is challenging the constitutionality of the NSEERS program itself, such a challenge is meritless. <em>See Ali, </em>440 F.3d at 681 n. 4. Any selective enforcement claim also is without merit. <em>See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, </em>525 U.S. 471, 488, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Butt argues that immigration officials failed to comply with an internal memorandum that suggested removal proceedings should not be initiated against aliens similarly situated to Butt. Even if Butt had produced a copy of this memorandum, which he has not, such internal personnel guidelines do not establish judicially enforceable rights. <em>See Loa-Herrera v. Trominski, </em>231 F.3d 984, 989 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Butt also challenges the denial of his motion for a continuance to allow additional time for processing of his wife\u2019s pending application for labor certification. Both the immigration judge and the BIA determined that a pending application for labor certification filed by Butt\u2019s wife did not constitute good cause to continue the removal proceedings. This determination was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 438-39 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1006-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
