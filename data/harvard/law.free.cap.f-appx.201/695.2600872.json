Rodriguez, </em>898 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). This standard requires that there be error, that it be plain, and that it affect substantial rights. <em>Id </em>at 1298. If these conditions are met, then we may exercise our discretion to notice the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-25\">The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), provides for an increased sentence for a defendant who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and has three or more prior violent felony or serious drug offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>convictions. There is no Sixth Amendment violation in a judicial determination that prior convictions are violent felonies or serious drug offenses under the ACCA, so long as the district court does not \u201clook beyond the statutory elements, charging documents, any plea agreement and colloquy or jury instructions, or comparable judicial record.\u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-76 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">There is no allegation that the district court looked at impermissible materials when determining that Wicke\u2019s prior convictions were violent felonies or serious drug offenses. Therefore, there was no violation of the right to jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
