We vacate the orders of the district court and remand for consideration of the merits of Bledson\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-18\">Bledson was convicted of possession of a hazardous tool. He received a variety of sanctions, including the loss of forty days\u2019 good conduct time, for this offense. Bled-son appealed the decision and asked that the conviction be expunged from his record. At each level in the appeals process, the representative of the Bureau of Prisons denied Bledson\u2019s appeal, specifically finding that \u201csanctions were\u201d \u201cappropriate.\u201d We read these administrative denials to mean that all the sanctions imposed for the offense, including the loss or revocation of good time credits, were before each reviewing authority and that the loss of good time credits, like all the sanctions, was upheld at each step of the review process. Accordingly, we conclude that Bledson has exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-19\">We therefore vacate the orders of the district court and remand for consideration of the merits of Bledson\u2019s claims. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-20\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
