We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 744 (4th Cir. 2006). Denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor such motions. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). This court reverses the Board\u2019s denial of such a motion only if the denial is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Barry, 445 F.3d </em>at 745. We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
