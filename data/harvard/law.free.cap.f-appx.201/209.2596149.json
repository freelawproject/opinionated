He contends that the prosecutor made impermissible closing remarks which deprived him of a fair trial; that the district court erred in preventing him from cross-examining Government witness Randal Hickman about any charges of sexual assault Hickman faced; and that the sentence imposed violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">Wishork\u2019s challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks indicating that he and his girlfriend, Tonya Lillie, broke up because she was aware he sexually assaulted the victim in this case fails for lack of resulting substantial prejudice because the challenged statements were not pervasive throughout closing argument and were limited by the district court\u2019s cautionary instruction to the jury that argument by counsel was not evidence. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>406 F.3d 337, 356 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 375, 163 L.Ed.2d 163 (2005). Moreover, the evidence of Wishork\u2019s guilt was strong, including the medical evidence indicative of sexual assault; the victim\u2019s testimony that Wishork was her attacker, which testimony was corroborated by the testimony of her family members, the investigating officer, and the nurse who examined her; Officer Butler\u2019s testimony that, at his initial interview, Wishork denied being at home on the night in question, then changed his story, saying that he had gone out with Randal Hickman and returned home to sleep in his room; and Hickman\u2019s testimony that he spent the night in Wishork\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>room and did not see Wishork that evening, which contradicted Wishork\u2019s story to the police. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">To the extent that Wishork additionally challenges, for the first time on appeal, the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding his flight to New Mexico after his initial police interview, the claim is similarly unavailing. The remarks regarding Wishork\u2019s flight to New Mexico were made in explanation of why he had not been tested for chlamydia and were proper comments on the trial evidence. <em>See United States v. Binker, </em>795 F.2d 1218, 1224 (5th Cir.1986). Moreover, the comments were proper rebuttal to the defense counsel\u2019s closing argument suggesting that the investigators were at fault for failing to test Wishork for chlamydia. The remarks were not plainly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Knezek, </em>964 F.2d 394, 400 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Wishork next contends, also for the first time on appeal, that the district court improperly limited his cross-examination of Hickman. Even if it is assumed that the district court\u2019s ruling prohibiting Wishork\u2019s proposed question on cross-examination was error, Wishork\u2019s substantial rights were not affected, given the strength of the direct evidence of his guilt, including the victim\u2019s unwavering identification of him as her assailant, as well as the lack of any evidence pointing to Hickman as a suspect and the jury\u2019s clear rejection of Lillie\u2019s alibi testimony. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Wishork additionally challenges his sentence. For the first time on appeal, he contends that the sentence violates <em>Booker </em>because the district court apparently considered the guidelines to be mandatory and because it increased his sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on judicially determined facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Wishork\u2019s conclusional allegation that the district court mistakenly considered the guidelines to be mandatory is unsupported by the record, which establishes that sentence was imposed after <em>Booker. </em>Because sentencing occurred <em>post-Booker, </em>there is no Sixth Amendment violation in connection with the district court\u2019s factual findings. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Further, because the sentence imposed fell within a properly calculated advisory guidelines range, it was neither unreasonable nor plainly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
