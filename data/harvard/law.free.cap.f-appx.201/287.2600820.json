He argues that the district court clearly erred by applying a two-level enhancement for possession of a weapon under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-28\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court continues to review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-03 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). A defendant\u2019s base offense level is to be increased by two levels \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). \u201cThe adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3). The Government must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant. <em>United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 770 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The district court\u2019s determination that it was not clearly improbable that the weapon seized from Carmelo Hernandez\u2019s vehicle was connected to Loya\u2019s offense of conviction was plausible in light of the record read as a whole. The presentence report (PSR) established that Loya was a passenger in a car and that while he and Hernandez were riding in that car, Loya had methamphetamine on his person. The PSR also stated that Hernandez and Loya admitted that the drugs in the car belonged to both of them and that they were trying to sell the drugs. Hernandez testified at the sentencing hearing that he placed the firearm in the car while Loya was sitting right next to him. Thus, the district court could infer that Loya knew the firearm was in the car. Further, it is not clearly improbable that the weapon was used to protect the drug trafficking activities. <em>See United States v. Westbrook, </em>119 F.3d 1176, 1193 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 574 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, the Government established a sufficient temporal and spatial relation between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and Loya, and the district court did not clearly err when it increased his base offense level for possession of a dangerous weapon under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
