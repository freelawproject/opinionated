Muhammad appeals the district court\u2019s order remanding the attorney disciplinary petition filed against him by the Maryland Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cAGC\u201d) to the Maryland Court of Appeals. The district court granted the AGC\u2019s motion to remand the petition after finding no basis for removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441,1442, or 1443 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (2000), \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 ... shall be reviewable ...\u201d The Supreme Court has limited \u00a7 1447(d) to insulate from appellate review only those remand orders based on the grounds specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) (2000): a defect in the removal procedure and a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 711-12, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996) (instructing that \u00a7 1447(c) and (d) must be read in conjunction with one another). Thus, because the district court concluded it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1442, that portion of the remand order is not subject to appellate review. <em>Severonickel v. Gaston Reymenants, </em>115 F.3d 265, 266-69 (4th Cir.1997); <em>Mangold v. Analytic Sens., Inc., </em>77 F.3d 1442, 1450 (4th Cir.1996); <em>Noel v. McCain, </em>538 F.2d 633, 635 (4th Cir.1976). Accordingly, to the extent Muhammad challenges the district court\u2019s jurisdictional determination under \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1442, his appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that removal was also improper pursuant to \u00a7 1443 is reviewable, however. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). After a thorough review of the record and the district court\u2019s order, we find no reversible error; accordingly, we affirm this portion of the district court\u2019s order on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Muhammad, </em>No. l:05-cv03144-MJG, 2006 WL 351783 (D.Md. Jan. 19, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
