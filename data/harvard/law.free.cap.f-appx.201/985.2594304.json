She appeals, arguing that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict on either count. She notes that government agents, who in their undercover capacities loaded marijuana from her residence and into a tractor-trailer, had not seen her before the day they removed the marijuana from her residence and that her name had not been mentioned in any investigative reports that they had read before seeing her. She also contends that the evidence established only that she was present when the marijuana was removed from her residence, that she asked why the tractor-trailer had not been pulled closer to her residence, and that she asked that the tractor-trailer be loaded faster because they were drawing too much attention. She asserts that her mere presence, even with knowledge that a crime was being committed, was insufficient to support her convictions, that any involvement by her lasted no more than one minute, and that her statements were consistent with an innocent person who wanted drug smugglers to leave as soon as possible because they were attracting attention. Dominguez-Juarez properly preserved these issues by moving for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case and at the close of all evidence. Therefore, this court reviews her convictions to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Ortega Reyna, </em>148 F.3d 540, 543 (5th Cir.1998). To support Dominguez-Juarez\u2019s aiding and abetting conviction, the Government had to establish that she aided and abetted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>both possession of the marijuana and the intent to distribute it. <em>See United States v. Delagarza-Villarreal, </em>141 F.3d 133, 140 (5th Cir.1997). That is, the Government had to establish that she \u201cbecame associated with, participated in, and in some way acted to further the possession and distribution of drugs.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>256 F.3d 264, 274 (5th Cir.2001). Dominguez-Juarez must have shared in the intent to commit the offense, and she must have played an active role in its commission. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">The testimony established that Dominguez-Juarez owned and had dominion and control over the premises where the marijuana was stored. Therefore, the jury reasonably could have found that she aided in the possession of the marijuana or constructively possessed it. <em>See United States v. Onick, </em>889 F.2d 1425, 1429 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">The jury reasonably could have concluded that Dominguez-Juarez had knowledge that marijuana was being stored in her residence because a co-defendant informed an undercover government agent that Dominguez-Juarez had been paid to store marijuana. Finally, the jury could infer an intent to distribute because of the large amount of marijuana involved. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>979 F.2d 1024, 1031 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">The evidence also established that Dominguez-Juarez asked why the tractor-trailer had not been pulled further toward the back of her residence and ordered the men loading the tractor-trailer to move faster because they were drawing suspicion and needed to leave. Based on these statements and the fact that Dominguez-Juarez was paid to store marijuana, the jury reasonably could have determined that Dominguez-Juarez \u201cknew that a drug transaction was occurring, that she associated herself with the actors involved in the transaction, that she participated in the venture with the desire that the venture succeed, and that she perform[ed] some designed or intended action to achieve the goal of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Jaramillo, </em>42 F.Bd 920, 923 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the aiding and abetting conviction. <em>See Ortega Reyna, </em>148 F.3d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">To convict Dominguez-Juarez for maintaining a place to manufacture, distribute, or use drugs, the jury had to find that she \u201cmanage[d] or controlled] any place, whether permanently or temporarily, ... as an owner ... [or] occupant, ... and knowingly and intentionally rent[ed], lease[d], profit[ed] from, or [made] available for use, with or without compensation, the place for the purpose of unlawfully ... storingf or] distributing ... a controlled substance.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2) (2003); <em>see Onick, </em>889 F.2d at 1431 n. 1 (citing \u00a7 856(a)(2) (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">The evidence established that Dominguez-Juarez owned and exercised dominion and control over the apartment where the marijuana was stored. Further, a co-defendant told an undercover government agent that Dominguez-Juarez was paid to store marijuana. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to support Dominguez-Juarez\u2019s conviction of making a building available for unlawfully storing or distributing a controlled substance. <em>See Ortega Reyna, </em>148 F.3d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1014-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
