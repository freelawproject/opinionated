R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and vacating its pre-trial conference and trial schedule in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action. We have re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>viewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Helmbright v. Davis, </em>No. 5:04-cv-00069-FPS, 2006 WL 160810 (N.D.W.Va. Jan. 20, 2006; Mar. 23, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
