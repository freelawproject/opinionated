We construe the motion as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Contrary to Patrick\u2019s argument, the district court\u2019s written reasons sufficiently show that its certification decision was based on its conclusion that the underlying complaint is frivolous. <em>See id. </em>at 202 n. 21. Patrick\u2019s argument that denial of IFP status would deny him access to the courts also is meritless. <em>See Day v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>788 F.2d 1110, 1114 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Carson v. Johnson, </em>112 F.3d 818, 821 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Patrick\u2019s motion does not directly challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for finding his complaint frivolous. Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis has the same effect as though the appellant had not appealed at all. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are liberally construed, even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments <em>to </em>preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. Accordingly, Patrick\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Patrick is cautioned that the dismissal of his complaint by the district court and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Patrick also is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">MOTION FOR IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
