We conclude these orders are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">In 1999, a jury convicted Mohammed of bank robbery and possession and use of a firearm during a crime of violence; Mohammed was sentenced to 117 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">In 2002, Mohammed filed an initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to file a requested direct appeal. The district court dismissed Mohammed\u2019s motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">Mohammed then filed a motion for reduction of sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). That motion was properly denied, as was Mohammed\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration. Mohammed next filed a motion to reinstate his appeal, which asserted the same ineffective assistance of counsel claim and sought to reserve the right to raise two other issues upon the reinstatement of his appeal: insufficient evidence and <em>Booker </em>error; that motion was properly denied. All of these motions appear to be attempts to circumvent the requirement that Mohammed obtain prefiling authorization prior to filing a second or successive habeas motion. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 </em>U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Mohammed has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Mohammed\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b179-13\"> To the extent Mohammed\u2019s motion is construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, that claim fails, as Mohammed has failed to allege: (1) newly-discovered evidence or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005) (holding <em>Booker </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
