Rumbullaku argues that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not based on specific, cogent reasons and, even if this finding was not erroneous, the BIA failed to consider the record as a whole when denying her claims for relief. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-20\">Rumbullaku\u2019s claims are based on threats she received due to her father\u2019s support of the Democratic Party of Albania. Rumbullaku claimed that she was threatened by the National Intelligence Service (\u201cSHISH\u201d) and socialist militants after her father, who was living in the United States, made a $5,000 contribution to the Democratic Party in May 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-21\">Both Rumbullaku her father, Trifon, testified at the hearing on her application for relief. However, the IJ found both Rumbullaku and Trifon lacking in credibility. As grounds for the finding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the IJ cited contradictions in Rumbullaku and Trifon\u2019s testimony regarding: (1) whether Trifon sent money to support Rumbullaku and her mother; (2) the timing of Trifon\u2019s contributions to the Democratic Party; and (3) the reason Rumbullaku obtained a passport. The IJ also rejected Trifon\u2019s claim regarding his contributions based on: (1) the lack of evidence that he had the financial ability to make such substantial donations; (2) the $10,000 donation receipt, which was not contemporaneous with any donation and which was issued before Trifon\u2019s final contribution; (3) the absence of any mention of his contributions in the Democratic Party\u2019s verification letter; and (4) the lack of any records showing his ability to make contributions and that those contributions were in fact made. The IJ further found that the summons was insufficient to corroborate Rumbullaku\u2019s claims. Citing background materials, the IJ rejected Rumbullaku\u2019s claim that she had problems with the SHISH. The IJ concluded that Rumbullaku failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because Rumbullaku could not establish eligibility for asylum, the IJ found that she failed to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The BIA dismissed Rumbullaku\u2019s appeal. The BIA first found that the IJ\u2019s decision \u201caccurately sets forth the facts asserted by the respondent in support of her claim for relief from removal.\u201d The BIA then: (1) agreed with the IJ that Rumbullaku had not demonstrated eligibility for asylum; and (2) affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and the IJ\u2019s finding that Rumbullaku failed to establish grounds for granting the other forms of relief requested. The BIA found that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, \u201cwhich was based on inconsistencies involving matters such as the nature and extent of the respondent\u2019s father\u2019s support for the Democratic Party which allegedly led to the persecution on the respondent by socialists, as well as the timing and reasons for the respondent\u2019s obtaining a passport,\u201d was supported by the record. It further found that the concerns raised by the IJ were not adequately rebutted on appeal. The BIA found that Rumbullaku had not demonstrated past persecution, a well-founded fear of persecution, or that she would more likely than not be persecuted or tortured. The BIA concluded that, \u201c[a]s the record fully supports the outcome of the [IJ\u2019s] decision, we affirm the conclusion that the respondent failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">\u201cWhen the BIA issues a decision we review only that decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the immigration judge\u2019s decision. To the extent that the BIA does adopt the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s reasoning as well.\u201d <em>Savoury v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1312 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision and, therefore, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Arboleda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>434 F.3d 1220, 1222 (11th Cir.2006) (\u2018We review only the BIA\u2019s decision in this case, as it did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s findings below.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">We review factual determinations, including credibility determinations, using the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). We will affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). We review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Id. </em>To conclude that the BIA should be reversed, we \u201cmust find that the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>not only supports that conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). To the extent the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Rumbullaku first argues that the BIA\u2019s reasons for its adverse credibility finding do not go to the heart of her claims for relief and, therefore, are not proper grounds for an adverse credibility finding. As to her father\u2019s contributions to the Democratic Party, she argues that the only relevant contribution was the $5,000 contribution in May 2002, as it led to and was referenced in the threats and incidents she suffered. As to her acquisition of a passport, she asserts that the date and reason she obtained the passport are irrelevant as to whether and why these incidents occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">\u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the [BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cThe trier of fact must determine credibility, and this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Rumbullaku\u2019s claim is premised on her father\u2019s financial support of the Democratic Party. Notwithstanding the internal consistency of Rumbullaku\u2019s testimony and its consistency with her asylum application, the inconsistencies between Rumbullaku\u2019s testimony and her father\u2019s testimony are not incidental to her claim. The inconsistencies regarding the nature and extent of her father\u2019s support provide a specific, cogent reason for an adverse credibility finding. Rumbullaku claimed that her problems began after her father made a $5,000 contribution in May 2002. However, in his testimony Trifon stated that he made the following contributions: $500 on September 10, 2000, $3,000 in June 2001, $5,000 in May 2003, and $1,500 on May 9, 2004. Thus, they provided conflicting testimony as to the contribution forming the basis of Rumbullaku\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">In this case, inconsistent explanations as to the reason why Rumbullaku obtained a passport is also a specific, cogent reason for an adverse credibility finding because it exposes conflicting testimony about when she began receiving threats. Rumbullaku obtained a passport in March 2002. This is before she alleged that she had any problems due to her father\u2019s activities, and she claimed that she got the passport because it was a necessity. In contrast, her father testified that one of the main reasons that Rumbullaku obtained a passport was the threats being made against her demanding money from him. However, according to Rumbullaku, these threats were not made until almost a year later, in March 2003. Therefore, we hold that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on specific, cogent reasons and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Rumbullaku next argues that, even if the BIA\u2019s credibility determination is correct, the BIA erred by denying her claims based only on that finding, without considering the record as a whole. When only the applicant\u2019s testimony is offered in support of her claim, an adverse credibility determination, by itself, is sufficient to support the denial of asylum. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. However, if the applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>offers \u201cother evidence of persecution, whatever form it may take, the [BIA] must consider that evidence, and it is not sufficient ... to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In doing so, the BIA need not discuss every piece of evidence presented. <em>See Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1376 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cAlthough the Immigration Judge is not required to discuss every piece of evidence presented before him, the Immigration Judge is required to consider all the evidence submitted by the applicant.\u201d) (citations omitted). Our review of the BIA\u2019s decision as a whole and, in particular, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[a]s the <em>record fully supports </em>the outcome of the [IJ\u2019s] decision, we affirm the conclusion that the respondent failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT,\u201d (emphasis added), convinces us that the BIA did not rely solely on an adverse credibility determination when it denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In light of the foregoing, the petition is</p>\n<p id=\"Ap8\">DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
