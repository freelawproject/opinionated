Himel appeals the 24-month sentence imposed following her guilty-plea conviction of harboring illegal aliens. Himel argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred by not awarding her an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). A review of the record shows that the prerequisites for a \u00a7 3E1.1(b) reduction were not satisfied in this case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3El.l(b). Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err by refusing to award the reduction. <em>See United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 647 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Himel also argues that the district court based its sentence on an improper factual finding and that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. Himel\u2019s argument regarding the erroneous factual finding is without merit. The record reflects that the district court acknowledged and corrected its interpretation of Himel\u2019s testimony. The record further reflects that the initial, erroneous finding was not a factor in the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Himel outside of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The district court followed the proper procedure for imposing a non-guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-09 (5th Cir.2006). Additionally, the district court\u2019s upward deviation was supported by proper 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 710. Himel has not shown that the six-month deviation from the advisory guideline range was unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
