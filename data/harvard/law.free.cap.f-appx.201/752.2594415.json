U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). We will affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). We review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Id. </em>To conclude that the IJ should be reversed, we \u201cmust find that the record not only supports that conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). To the extent the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A); INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-11\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In order to carry this burden, the alien must establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005). The applicant must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (citation and quotation marks omitted). The persecution must be on account of Campino\u2019s political opinion, whether actual or imputed, and not the beliefs or opinions of his persecutors. <em>See I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (holding that persecution on account of political opinion is \u201cpersecution on account of the <em>victim\u2019s </em>political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s\u201d); <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that the petitioner must establish past or future persecution because of his actual or imput<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>ed political opinion). \u201cIt is not enough to show that [he] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [his] refusal to cooperate.... \u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438. \u201c \u2018[A]n imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed,\u2019 may constitute a ground for a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 of political persecution within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1289 (citations omitted). \u201cAn asylum applicant may prevail on a theory of \u2018imputed political opinion\u2019 if he shows that the \u2018[persecutor falsely attribute[d] an opinion to [him], and then perseeute[d][him] because of that mistaken belief about [his] views.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA, the applicant must show that his life or freedom would be threatened based on a protected ground. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe burden of proof for withholding of removal, however, is \u2018more likely than not,\u2019 and, thus, is \u2018more stringent\u2019 than the standard for asylum relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). An applicant who fails to establish eligibility for asylum on the merits necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Campino, who was a cashier at a bank, applied for asylum and withholding of removal, alleging that members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) sought to obtain information about bank customers from him. Campino testified regarding a series of threats and other incidents directed at himself and his family by the FARC, beginning about four months after his wallet, which contained a card certifying that he worked at the bank, was stolen. Campino described the following events: On September 8, 2002, he received a threatening letter from the FARC, signed by a Commander Padilla, requesting confidential information about bank clients. The letter informed him that if he did not cooperate things would go \u201cvery badly\u201d for himself and his family. On September 26, 2002, upon leaving the bank, Padilla confronted him, asked him if he had decided to cooperate, and threatened to hurt his daughter if he refused. On October 25, 2002, as he was picking up his daughter from school, Padilla again approached him, asked about his daughter, and again told Campino that, for the good of his family, Campino had to \u201cdo the work,\u201d which he understood meant to give them the requested bank information. On November 5, 2002, he removed his daughter from school because people unconnected to his family were asking questions about his daughter. On December 27, 2002, he received a threatening phone call. Finally, on January 9, 2003, as he was driving home from the bank, Padilla began following him on a motorcycle and, as Padilla passed him, Padilla fired two shots into the hood of his car. He received another threatening phone call that night. Campino then took his family to his mother-in-law\u2019s house, where he stayed without incident until he left Colombia in April 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Among other reasons, the IJ denied asylum on the ground that Campino failed to establish any nexus to any of the protected grounds because the FARC\u2019s only motivation was to obtain financial information about the bank\u2019s clients. The IJ further found that Campino did not submit adequate evidence from which he could find that the FARC\u2019s interest was on account of Campino\u2019s imputed political opinion. Because Campino did not establish asylum eligibility, the IJ found that he, therefore, did not meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. Campino contends that the denial of his claims was in error, arguing that his refusal to provide the FARC with access to bank records imputed to him an anti-FARC political opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>and that the FARC targeted him because of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The IJ\u2019s finding that Campino failed to establish persecution on account of a protected ground is supported by substantial evidence. Campino\u2019s testimony that the FARC initially approached him about the bank records and threatened him if he would not cooperate, as well as his belief that he was an enemy of the FARC because he did not do what they wanted, provide substantial evidence in support of the IJ\u2019s finding that the FARC\u2019s only motivation was to obtain financial information about the bank\u2019s clients. Persecution due to Campino\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the FARC is not persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258 (\u201c[Ejvidence that ... is consistent with ... the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas ... does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground\u201d); <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Nor does the record compel the conclusion that the FARC believed that Campino\u2019s refusal to cooperate was politically based as no mention was made of Campino being perceived as anti-FARC, and the only reason Campino gave for his belief that he was an enemy of the FARC was his refusal to cooperate. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum is supported by substantial evidence. As a result, Campino also failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4. In light of the foregoing, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-18\">. Campino\u2019s wife and daughter are derivative beneficiaries of Campino\u2019s claims for relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Accordingly, only Campino is mentioned in reference to these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\">. Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ without an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Campino does not argue that the IJ erred in denying relief under the CAT. Accordingly, he has abandoned the issue. <em>Huang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1007 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
