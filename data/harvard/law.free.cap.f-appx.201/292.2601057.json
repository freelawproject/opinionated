Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 229-31 (5th Cir. 2002), which held that an immigration judge\u2019s failure to inform an alien of his eligibility for discretionary waiver of removal at his removal proceeding did not render the proceeding fundamentally unfair. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
