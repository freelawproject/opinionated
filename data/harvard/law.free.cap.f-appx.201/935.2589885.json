On August 24, 2004, Plumber was sentenced to serve concurrent terms of thirty-one months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-21\">Plumber appealed and alleged the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the court imposed a sentence based on facts neither found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted by himself. This court found that the district court erred by applying the sentencing guidelines as mandatory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, this court affirmed the conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded for resentencing under <em>Booker. See United States v. Plumber, </em>138 Fed. Appx. 519 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-22\">At the resentencing hearing, the Government conceded the Presentence Report added the multi-count adjustment to the adjusted offense level in error. The court agreed with the Government\u2019s position and found the new total offense level to be fifteen. With a criminal history category of III, the court found the proper guidelines imprisonment range to be twenty-seven to thirty-three months, and sentenced Plumber to thirty-one months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-23\">On appeal, counsel filed an Anders<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> brief, in which he states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but that his client directed him to raise the issue of whether the sentence was unreasonable under <em>Booker. </em>Plumber was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>The district court sentenced Plumber within the applicable advisory guideline range and well below the ten-year statutory maximum set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1029(a)(2), (c)(l)(A)(I), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312. We cannot conclude that, under these circumstances, Plumber\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (finding that sentence imposed within properly calculated advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Plumber\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Plumber, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Plumber requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Plumber. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-18\">. Plumber was sentenced before the <em>Booker </em>decision, and the district court correctly applied the law at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b963-24\">. <em>Anders v.
