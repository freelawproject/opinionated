Ogle argues that the indictment improperly subjects him to criminal liability for a civil regulatory violation. Ogle also challenges the indictment on the ground that his prosecution under the CSA constitutes an impermissible federal regulation of medical practice, an area traditionally reserved to the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-16\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Ogle\u2019s motion to dismiss his indictment <em>de novo. See United States v. Wilson, </em>249 F.3d 366, 371 (5th Cir.2001). Ogle, a physician, was indicted for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 by conspiring to dispense hydrocodone over the internet in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Hydrocodone, a Schedule III controlled substance, can only be legally dispensed either directly by, or through the prescription of, a practitioner. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 829(b). 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04, a regulation promulgated by the Attorney General, provides that only those prescriptions \u201cissued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice\u201d may be used to legally dispense controlled substances under \u00a7 829(b). 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-18\">Ogle argues that the indictment reflects an attempt to impermissibly \u201cbootstrap\u201d a violation of 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04(a), which he characterizes as a civil regulation, into a criminal offense. This argument is without merit. \u00a7 1306.04(a) is not a civil regulation but instead an interpretive one that defines the circumstances subjecting practitioners to criminal prosecution. <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>595 F.2d 258, 259 (5th Cir.1979). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>Further, the indictment only charges Ogle with violating \u00a7 846 by conspiring to violate \u00a7 841(a)(1), and does not rely on \u00a7 1306.04(a) at all. It is well established that \u201cregistered physicians can be prosecuted under \u00a7 841 when their activities fall outside the usual course of professional practice.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>423 U.S. 122, 124, 96 S.Ct. 335, 46 L.Ed.2d 333 (1975); <em>United States v. Rosen, </em>582 F.2d 1032, 1033 (5th Cir.1978). The fact that the elements of Ogle\u2019s conduct necessary to prove the criminal offense under \u00a7 846 and \u00a7 841(a)(1) also encompass facts sufficient to prove a violation of \u00a7 1306.04(a) does not invalidate the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Ogle also contends that his prosecution under the CSA constitutes an impermissible federal regulation of medical practice. This issue was raised by Ogle below in a motion to reconsider his motion to dismiss the indictment but shares no common legal ground with the arguments made in the original motion to dismiss. The motion to reconsider was filed after Ogle pleaded guilty and waived most of his rights of appeal. After the district court denied this motion, Ogle failed to move to modify the original waiver of appeal, which only reserves the right to appeal the original order denying the motion to dismiss, to add an exception for the argument raised in the motion to reconsider. He also made no attempt to withdraw his guilty plea and accompanying waiver of appeal. Ogle\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of the argument raised in the motion to reconsider is therefore barred by the waiver. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005) (enforcing defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal and barring consideration of issue on appeal where defendant did not seek to amend waiver or withdraw plea after court denied sentencing objection, and instead sought on appeal to modify the waiver while retaining the benefits of the government\u2019s concessions in the plea agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
