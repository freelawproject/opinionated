After the BIA adopted and affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying Wenas\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal, he filed a motion to reopen. Wenas argued that his previous attorney, who represented him in proceedings before the IJ and BIA, was ineffective because he failed to submit any documentation supporting Wenas\u2019s claim that Chinese Christians are persecuted in Indonesia. In support of his motion to reopen, Wenas submitted several documents concerning religious violence in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-21\">On appeal, Wenas argues that the BIA relied on the wrong standard for determining prejudice in an ineffective assistance claim, requiring him to show that \u201cit [was] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>likely that [he] would have prevailed\u201d below. Citing to <em>Dakane v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), he contends that the correct standard is a reasonable probability of a different outcome, which is less stringent than the \u201cmore likely than not standard.\u201d Moreover, he argues, we subsequently corrected our initial opinion in <em>Dakane, </em>clarifying that the reasonable probability standard is the correct standard, but the BIA cited to the earlier, uncorrected opinion. Consequently, Wenas asserts, we must remand the case because it cannot be upheld on any grounds not articulated in the record. Next, he contends that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s representation because there was a reasonable probability that the omitted supporting documentation would have shown that there was a pattern or practice of discrimination against Chinese Christians in Indonesia, entitling him to a presumption that he would face future persecution if he returned to Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">We have construed 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) to give us jurisdiction to review orders on motions to reopen, implicitly considering such orders to be \u201cfinal order[s] of removal\u201d under the statute. <em>Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2003). We review the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). We will overturn the BIA\u2019s decision only if it exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">An alien can move to reopen proceedings on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, but \u201cto establish the ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of a deportation hearing, an alien must establish that his or her counsel\u2019s performance was deficient to the point that it impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing such that the alien was unable to reasonably present his or her case.\u201d <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1274 (quotations and citations omitted). To do this, the petitioner must show prejudice, which means that the petitioner must demonstrate a \u201creasonable probability that but for the attorney\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Wenas\u2019s argument that the BIA relied on an incorrect standard for determining ineffective assistance of counsel, holding him to a stricter \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard, is meritless. The BIA explicitly stated that prejudice in this context \u201cmeans that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed\u201d \u2014 not that the alien \u201cmore likely than not\u201d would have prevailed, as Wenas claims. Moreover, in <em>Dakane, </em>we cited with approval several variations of the above-stated standard, including: (1) \u201c[An] alien must show ... actual prejudice by making a prima facie showing that he would have been eligible for the relief,\u201d and (2) \u201c[P]roving prejudice requires the Petitioner to make a prima facie showing that ... he would have been entitled to relief....\u201d 399 F.3d at 1274 (quotations and citations omitted). Thus, the BIA\u2019s substitution of the term \u201clikely\u201d for \u201creasonable probability,\u201d when it otherwise correctly stated the law, is insufficient to show that the BIA applied an incorrect standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Wenas\u2019s argument that there was a reasonable probability that the omitted documentation would have led to a different outcome in his proceedings is similarly unpersuasive. Before denying Wenas\u2019s application, the IJ considered the 2002 Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Indonesia and the 2003 Department of State International Religious Freedom Report for Indonesia (\u201cthe Reports\u201d), both of which adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>conveyed Indonesia\u2019s history of religious violence against Chinese Christians. The additional materials Wenas filed with his motion to reopen predate the Reports and are largely generalized accounts of religious violence in Indonesia. These additional materials do not demonstrate a reasonable probability of a different outcome in Wenas\u2019s proceedings. Therefore, because the IJ adequately considered Indonesia\u2019s history of religious violence, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Wenas\u2019s attorney\u2019s failure to file supporting documentation did not prejudice Wenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Because Wenas has not established that the BIA applied an incorrect standard of review or that his attorney\u2019s omission of supporting documentation prejudiced him, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Wenas\u2019s motion to reopen its order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">. To the extent that Wenas challenges the IJ\u2019s and BIA's underlying decision denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal, Wenas did not file a petition for review of the original BIA decision on appeal, and, thus, the merits of that appeal, as well as the merits of the IJ decision, Eire outside of our jurisdiction. <em>See Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citing INA \u00a7 242(b)(1)-(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1)-(2)) (\u201cTo seek judicial review of an order of removal, an alien must file a petition for review with the federal appellate court within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s issuance of the final order.\"); <em>see also Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3 (holding that this limitation period is \" 'mandatory and jurisdictional\u2019 \") (quoting <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
