Collins argues that the district court erred by denying him a reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2), which provides that provides that a defendant\u2019s base offense level should be decreased to six \u201c[i]f the defendant ... possessed all ammunition and firearms solely for lawful sporting purposes or collection, and did not unlawfully discharge or otherwise unlawfully use such firearms or ammunition.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2). He contends that the Government presented no evidence which contradicted his testimony as to his use of the firearm and the district court\u2019s findings were insufficient to support its decision denying him the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). The district court agreed with the Government\u2019s conclusion that Collins\u2019s testimony that he used the firearm for sporting purposes was not credible. The district court\u2019s credibility determination was supported by ample record evidence and thus was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 593 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court did not err by denying Collins a \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) reduction. Collins\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
