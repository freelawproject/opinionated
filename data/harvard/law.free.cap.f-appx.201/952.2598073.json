Parker appeals his sentence. In <em>United States v. Parker, </em>162 Fed.Appx. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>235 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished), we affirmed his conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, but vacated and remanded his sentence for resentencing in light of the rules announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). At the resentencing, Parker objected to a four-level increase to his offense level for having possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense, possession of a stolen vehicle. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2001). On appeal, Parker contends the district court clearly erred in finding his unlawful firearm possession was in connection to another felony offense. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We review a district court\u2019s findings at sentencing for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir. 1989). Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provides for a four-level enhancement if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIQ\">the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">We have noted that \u201c[t]he purpose of this enhancement is to ensure that a defendant receives more severe punishment if, in addition to committing a firearms offense within the scope of \u00a7 2K2.1, he commits a separate felony offense that is rendered more dangerous by the presence of a firearm (or facilitates another person\u2019s commission of an offense involving a firearm).\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 406 (4th Cir.2003). There must be evidence that the firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the predicate felony and its presence cannot be the result of accident or coincidence. <em>Id. </em>at 411. The Government can meet its burden by showing that the gun was present for protection or to embolden the actor. <em>United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 266 (4th Cir.2000) (analyzing \u201cin relation to\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">We find the district court did not clearly err in finding Parker possessed the firearm, found underneath the front seat, in connection to the stolen car. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b981-7\"> The \"in connection with\u201d is analogous to \"in relation to\u201d contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000). <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 411 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
