We granted Berry a certificate of appealability regarding whether the state court\u2019s determination that counsel was not ineffec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>tive for faffing to call a potential alibi witness at trial was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In his petition, Berry asserted he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial attorneys failed to call a witness, Latonya James, in support of his alibi defense. He stated prior to his trial he and his attorneys decided an alibi defense would be his sole affirmative defense, and in their opening statement, the attorneys told the jury about James and her testimony before deciding not to call her. The state court denied Berry\u2019s habeas petition, concluding the decision not to call James was a strategic decision, and the district court concluded the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, or did not involve an unreasonable application of, federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a habeas corpus petition <em>de novo. McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1828, 164 L.Ed.2d 522 (2006). \u201cThe district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, while mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>\u201cAn ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a mixed question of law and fact subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">A federal court may issue a petition for habeas corpus relief only if the state court\u2019s ruling was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, a state court\u2019s factual determinations are presumed correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-12\">Under the \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. The \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause suggests that the state court\u2019s decision must be substantially different from the controlling legal precedent. A state court\u2019s decision that applies the correct legal rule would not fit within the \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause even if the federal court might have reached a different result relying on the same law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-13\"><em>Wellington v. Moore, </em>314 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir.2002) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">Under the \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 clause, a federal habeas court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-15\">may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [a applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case]. In deciding this issue, the federal court should consider whether the state court\u2019s application of the law was objectively unreasonable and should not apply the subjective \u2018all reasonable jurists\u2019 standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 1261 (quotations and citation omitted). \u201c[W]hether a state court\u2019s decision was unreasonable must be assessed in light of the record the court had before it.\u201d <em>Holland v. Jackson, </em>542 U.S. 649, 124 S.Ct. 2736, 2737-2738, 159 L.Ed.2d 683 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-17\">\u201cIt is well established that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>[Strickland] </em>is the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>trolling legal authority to be applied to ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\u201d <em>Wellington, </em>314 F.3d at 1260 (internal quotations omitted). To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under the performance prong, the relevant inquiry is whether counsel\u2019s representation was \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Head, </em>311 F.3d 1288, 1311 (11th Cir.2002). \u201c[Cjounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2066. A petitioner can rebut this presumption only by proving his attorney\u2019s representation was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms. <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 n. 15 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cTherefore, where the record is incomplete or unclear about [counselj\u2019s actions, we will presume that he did what he should have done, and that he exercised reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). \u201c[Sjtrategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support limitations on investigation.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\">The petitioner\u2019s burden of demonstrating prejudice is high. Under the prejudice prong, it is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding. Instead, the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-6\"><em>Wellington, </em>314 F.3d at 1260 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The state court\u2019s determination that counsel was not ineffective for failing to call a potential alibi witness at trial was not contrary to, or did not involve an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. The state court recognized <em>Strickland </em>was the controlling law with regard to Berry\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and its decision was not contrary to <em>Strickland. </em>Recognizing Berry had to show his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the state court found his attorneys\u2019 decision not to call James dining his trial was a strategic decision. Although Berry presented evidence regarding his attorneys\u2019 initial decision to pursue an alibi defense, the evidence does not clearly and convincingly show the attorneys did not subsequently determine that it would be more beneficial to Berry\u2019s defense not to call James in light of the evidence presented during the trial. As such, the court reasonably applied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>strong presumption of effective performance and concluded that Berry failed to establish his ineffective assistance claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-10\">. Because Berry filed his federal habeas petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the provisions of that act apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\">. While its underlying facts may be similar, <em>Lee v. Kemna, </em>534 U.S. 362, 122 S.Ct. 877, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>151 L.Ed.2d 820 (2002), has no bearing on the instant case as it considered a different unrelated issue. <em>Lee </em>also involved a criminal defendant whose sole defense was an alibi defense. <em>Id. </em>at 880. Although Lee had three alibi witnesses scheduled to testify on his behalf, he could not locate the witnesses when he sought to present their testimony. <em>Id. </em>Lee requested a continuance so that he could locate the witnesses; however, the trial court denied his motion. A jury convicted Lee, and the state appeals court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance, finding Lee had not conformed with procedural rules regarding the requirements of a motion for a continuance. <em>Id. </em>Unlike the instant case, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lee </em>considered the issue of whether the state ground indicated by the state appellate court for denying Lee\u2019s claim was adequate to preclude federal habeas corpus review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
