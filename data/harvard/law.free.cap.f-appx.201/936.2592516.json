He appeals, arguing that his sentence is un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>reasonable because the district court refused to rely on the absence of a fast-track program as a basis for sentencing him below the guidelines range. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts still are required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005). <em>Id. </em>We will affirm a post-<em>Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id. </em>A sentence imposed within the properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">We find that the district court properly calculated the guideline range and appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory. The court sentenced Kafka-Banderas only after considering the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), rejecting his argument that he should be sentenced below the guidelines range based on the absence of a fast-track program. We find the district court\u2019s decision was not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Perez-Pena, </em>453 F.3d 236 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that the sentence disparity between a non-fast-track defendant and one who received a fast-track sentence is not \u201cunwarranted\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find Kafka-Banderas\u2019 sentence reasonable. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
