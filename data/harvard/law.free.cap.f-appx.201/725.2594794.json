No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). On May 25, 2000, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed Brooks\u2019 conviction, but remanded the case for resentencing. Brooks\u2019 \u00a7 2254 petition only attacked his original conviction, not his resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">Brooks asserts the district court erred in calculating the statute of limitations under the AEDPA from the date the Florida Supreme Court decision became final. Brooks contends the statute of limitations should have been calculated beginning with the date of his resentencing. The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) limited to this specific issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a petition for habeas corpus was time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). <em>Jones v. Nagle, </em>349 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2003). The one-year statute of limitations for filing a writ of habeas corpus runs from the latest of four triggering dates, including \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). A state prisoner\u2019s conviction becomes final when the U.S. Supreme Court denies <em>certiorari </em>or issues a decision on the merits, or when the 90-day period in which to file a <em>certiorari </em>petition expires. <em>Bond v. Moore, </em>309 F.3d 770, 773-74 (11th Cir.2002). This time period is tolled during the pendency of a properly filed motion for post-conviction relief in state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). \u201cWhen a petitioner who has been resentenced brings an application challenging only his original judgment of conviction, the one-year statute of limitations under the AEDPA runs from the date the original judgment of conviction became final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>and not the date the resentencing judgment became final.\u201d <em>Rainey v. Sec\u2019y for the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>448 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">This case is controlled by our decision in <em>Rainey. </em>Because Brooks\u2019 habeas petition challenged only his judgment of conviction, without any challenge to his resentencing judgment, the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations began when his judgment of conviction became final. <em>Id. </em>Measuring the limitations period from that date, Brooks\u2019 habeas petition was untimely. We decline to consider any other argument Brooks attempts to raise on appeal because those arguments fall outside of the scope of the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
