See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b171-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Adrian Maurice Hudgins appeals the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge, which construed a letter that Hudgins sent to the court as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, and dismissing the \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">In 1997, Hudgins was convicted in the Southern District of West Virginia for possession of contraband (marijuana) in prison. The district court sentenced him to a twenty-one-month term of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, and imposed a $500 fine. The court also imposed a $100 assessment fee. On March 3, 2003, Hudgins sent a letter to the district court, claiming that the court improperly delegated the timing and amount of payments to the Bureau of Prisons in violation of <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Because a \u00a7 2255 motion may not be used for the sole purpose of challenging fines or restitution orders, we conclude that the district court should have treated Hudgins\u2019s claim as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). <em>See United States v. Bernard, </em>351 F.3d 360, 361 (8th Cir.2003) (collecting cases). A \u00a7 2241 petition, however, must be brought in the district of incarceration, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a); <em>In re: Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 332 (4th Cir.2000), and Hudgins is incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Ashland, Kentucky. The district court therefore does not have jurisdiction over this \u00a7 2241 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">We vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for the court to determine whether transferring Hudgins\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition to the proper federal district court would serve the interests of justice, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (2000), or whether the action would be more appropriately dismissed without prejudice to Hudgins\u2019s right to file his action in the appropriate district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
