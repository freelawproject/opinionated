Dr. Dixon\u2019s conclusions were not accepted by the administrative judge for substantial reasons. No clinical findings are shown in Dr. Dixon\u2019s examination records to support his statements of radiating pain and numbness etc. The specialist did not find these symptoms. No other doctor reached the same conclusion as Dr. Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">2. While Ms. Richardson may suffer from disc deterioration and some nerve root compression, the record does not show motor or sensory loss and the impairment listed in \u00a7 1.04(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">3. We are unable to say that the evidence does not support the findings of the administrative law judge. We must therefore affirm the judgment that affirms the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
