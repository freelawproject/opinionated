The district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-26\">The district court determined that diversity of citizenship between the parties did not exist and that a United States Government plaintiff was not a party to the action, despite Blalock\u2019s contrary indication when he filed his complaint. Blalock has abandoned his appeal with respect to these determinations by failing to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>them. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Blalock argues that the district court had jurisdiction because State Farm\u2019s denial of his personal injury claims violated his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). No indication of any ADA claim \u201caffirmatively appear[ed]\u201d on the face of Blalock\u2019s complaint. <em>Margin v. Sea-Land, Servs., Inc., </em>812 F.2d 973, 976 (5th Cir.1987). Thus the district court did not err in dismissing the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332; <em>Nauru Phosphate Royalties, Inc. v. Drago Daic Interests, Inc., </em>138 F.3d 160,163 n. 1 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Margin, </em>812 F.2d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. Blalock\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
