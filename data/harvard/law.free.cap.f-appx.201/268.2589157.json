He argues that the district court erred by departing upwardly from the advisory Sentencing Guidelines based upon his criminal history. As Mena-Segoviano concedes, the departure is reviewed only for plain error because he did not object on this basis in district court. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 436 (5th Cir.2006). Because Mena-Segoviano has failed to show that the district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly was clear or obvious, he does not warrant relief on this issue. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-23\">Mena-Segoviano also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Mena-Segoviano contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Mena-Segoviano properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here solely to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
