On appeal, Robinson argues that, because the district court sentenced him above the Chapter 7 advisory policy statement range to the statutory maximum without explanation, his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">This court recently held in <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2006), that it reviews sentences imposed upon the revocation of supervised release to determine whether the sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d If the court determines that a revocation sentence is proeedurally or substantively unreasonable, it must then decide whether the sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>Crudup </em>at 439-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">In this case, Robinson\u2019s sentence was within the applicable statutory maximum and the court expressly stated that it considered the Chapter 7 advisory policy statement range of eight to fourteen months. The district court questioned Robinson and heard from defense counsel, as well as the probation officer. The district court, however, did not explicitly state any reasons for its decision to sentence Robinson above the policy statement range to the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">In <em>Crudup, </em>we reiterated that, although a district court must consider the Chapter 7 policy statements and the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006) factors applicable to revocation sentences, the court has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum. <em>Crudup </em>at 438-39. We further reaffirmed that \u201c (a court\u2019s statement of its reasons for going beyond non-binding <em>policy statements </em>in imposing a sentence after revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release term need not be as specific as has been required when courts departed from <em>guidelines </em>that were, before <em>[United States v.]Booker, </em>[543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005),] considered to be mandatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439 (quoting <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>424 F.3d 239, 245 (2d Cir.2005)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">Although the district court did not articulate at the hearing its reasons for sentencing Robinson beyond the policy statement range, we find that the sentence is not plainly unreasonable. The record indicates that Robinson received two downward departures on his original sentence based on his substantial assistance. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4, p.s., comment, (n.4) (2005). Furthermore, the probation officer stated to the court that Robinson has an \u201cappalling\u201d record and is \u201cnothing less than a professional criminal.\u201d Given the broad latitude afforded the district court to impose statutory maximum revocation sentences, the court\u2019s consideration of the relevant policy statement range, and substantial support for the court\u2019s decision in the record, we find that the sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Robinson\u2019s supervised release and imposing a twenty-four-month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
