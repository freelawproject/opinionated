On appeal, Ruiz argues that he demonstrated past persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia on account of his political opinion and a well-founded fear of future persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>tion. Because Ruiz failed to file a timely appeal from the former order, we lack jurisdiction over his petition as to the underlying BIA order. We deny the petition as to the motion to reopen and reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Ortega v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>416 F.3d 1348, 1350 (11th Cir.2005). By statute, an alien seeking review of a final order of the BIA must file a petition for review within 30 days of the issuance of the final order. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Moreover, an order of removal becomes final upon the BIA\u2019s dismissal of an appeal. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). \u201cSince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). And the finality of a removal order is <em>not </em>affected by the filing of a motion to reconsider. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">On February 28, 2006, the BIA entered its final order of removal. Ruiz did not file his petition for review until May 24, 2006, which was well after expiration of the 30-day time period. Ruiz\u2019s intervening motion for reconsideration did not toll the deadline for filing a petition for review with this Court. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, his petition was not timely, and we lack jurisdiction to address the merits of the IJ\u2019s decision denying asylum and withholding of removal. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition, in part, for lack of jurisdiction to the extent that Ruiz seeks review of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Ruiz\u2019s notice of appeal was timely as to the BIA\u2019s order denying Ruiz\u2019s motion to reopen and reconsider. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review that order. Our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>Mohammed Salim Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (motion to reopen); <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003) (motion to reconsider). \u2018We employ a very deferential abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the BIA\u2019s decision on a motion to reopen regardless of the underlying basis of the alien\u2019s request for relief.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 808 (internal quotation omitted). Motions to reconsider and reopen are disfavored in removal proceedings. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). A motion to reopen shall state \u201cnew facts\u201d that would be proven at a new hearing but \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing....\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">Here, Ruiz did not present evidence or argument that the BIA committed an error of law or fact in denying his asylum petition. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Instead, Ruiz chose to reargue the merits of his already-rejected claims. Moreover, he did not present new evidence that warranted reopening the proceedings. Athough Ruiz presented new evidence that provided further sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>port for his credibility, in the IJ\u2019s order denying relief, which was adopted by the BIA, the IJ assumed Ruiz\u2019s testimony was credible but nevertheless found that Ruiz had not established persecution on account of his political opinion. Simply put, the new evidence did not state \u201cnew facts\u201d that had not already been considered by the BIA and IJ. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). On this record, we can discern no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s order denying Ruiz\u2019s motion to reopen or to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss the petition as to the BIA\u2019s final order of removal and deny the petition as to the denial of Ruiz\u2019s motion to reopen or reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
