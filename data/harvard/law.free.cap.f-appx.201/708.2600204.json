The district court imposed the sentence pursuant to Vargas\u2019s plea of guilty to one count of conspiracy to transport illegal aliens for financial gain and one count of transporting illegal aliens for financial gain. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Vargas pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to transport illegal aliens for financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(v)(D and (a)(l)(B)(i), and one count of transporting illegal aliens for financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) and (a)(1)(B)\u00ae. R2 at 5-15. Each count carried a maximum possible sentence of ten years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(B)\u00ae. Following the plea hearing, a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) was prepared. The PSI stated, among other things, that in 1989 Vargas was charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child, and that adjudication of the charge was deferred. Later, an Addendum to the PSI described the charges as resulting in a felony conviction. The PSI also noted that Vargas had been charged in 1990 with indecency with a child, but that charge had been dismissed. Vargas had the opportunity to object to the PSI, but did not do so. R3 at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Applying the United States Sentencing Guidelines, the district court calculated a criminal history category of I and an offense level of 11, resulting in an advisory sentencing range of eight to fourteen months. U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 2005). At sentencing, the government requested a 12-month sentence based upon the nature of the offenses as well as Vargas\u2019s \u201cprior criminal history.\u201d R3 at 2-3. Vargas requested a sentence at the low end of the Guideline range, noting that his role in the offense was minor, he would probably be deported to Mexico after serving his sentence, and he had been a legal resident of the United States since 1989. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The court stated that it had considered the statements of the parties, the PSI, the advisory Guidelines, the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 6. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">Despite being a criminal history category [one], the defendant is not a first time offender. He has a prior conviction for aggravated assault on a minor, and although dismissed, there was also a prior arrest with respect to a child. I will impose a sentence within the advisory guidelines, but not at the bottom of the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 6. The court then sentenced Vargas to concurrent terms of 12 months of imprisonment for each count, to be followed by three years of supervised release. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">We review a sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). \u2018We do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process\u201d; rather, our review is limited to the reasonableness of the final sentence. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citing <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005)). This reasonableness inquiry is guided by the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the applicable Guidelines range. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246; <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 766. After <em>Booker, </em>the district court is not bound by the Guidelines, but still must consider the properly-calculated Guidelines range in determining a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">In this case, the district court correctly calculated an advisory Guidelines range of eight to fourteen months, and Vargas does not challenge that determination. Rather, Vargas argues that his sentence of 12 months is unreasonable in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors, and he discusses specific factors that he believes warrant a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range. Unlike the district court, we do not weigh the individual factors under \u00a7 3553(a), and we do not determine an appropriate sentence <em>de novo. See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Our role is to ensure that the sentence imposed by the district court is within the range of reasonable sentences. <em>See id. </em>Because the district court properly considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and arrived at a reasonable sentence, Vargas\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The sentence imposed by the district court was within the correctly-calculated Guidelines range, and was far lower than the aggregate statutory maximum sentence available to the district court, which was ten years of imprisonment as to each count. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(i). While the court did not individually discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we have held that nothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to do so. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329. It is enough that the court acknowledge that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. At Vargas\u2019s sentencing hearing, the court stated \u201cI have considered the statements of all the parties, the presentence investigation report, ... the factors set forth in 18 U.S.Code, Section 3553(a)(1) through (7), as well as ... the plea agreement of the parties.\u201d R3 at 6. This statement is sufficient evidence that the court properly considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the sentencing factors. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Vargas also argues that the court erred in characterizing his 1989 arrest as resulting in a \u201cconviction,\u201d and in relying on the circumstances of his prior arrests in determining a sentence. The first addendum to the PSI characterizes the 1989 incident as a \u201cprior felony conviction,\u201d and describes the underlying facts of that offense. Vargas was given the opportunity to object to the contents of the PSI, and failed to do so. It is the law of this circuit that failure to object to the factual allegations set forth in the PSI operates as an admission thereof. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006). The existence of a prior conviction is a question of fact. <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2911, 165 L.Ed.2d 931 (2006) (discussing \u201cthe fact of [the defendant\u2019s] prior convictions\u201d). Because Vargas did not object to the contents of the PSI, he effectively admitted to the conduct described in the PSI, and that the 1989 arrest resulted in a conviction. <em>See Wade, </em>458 F.3d at 1277. Accordingly, the district court did not err by referring to Vargas\u2019s prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Finally, Vargas contends that the court did not consider the possibility that he will be deported to Mexico as a result of his conviction in this case. The record shows that Vargas did ask for leniency on the ground that he could be deported as a result of his conviction, and the court stated that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments. As discussed above, the court\u2019s statement that it considered his arguments is sufficient evidence that it in fact did so. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Upon a thorough review of the record on appeal, and after consideration of the briefs of the parties on appeal, we find no reversible error. The district court correctly calculated Vargas\u2019s advisory Guideline range and considered the arguments presented by the parties and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court then sentenced him within the Guideline range to a total term substantially lower than the ten-year statutory maximum sentence avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>able as to each count. Accordingly, Vargas\u2019s sentence was reasonable, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
