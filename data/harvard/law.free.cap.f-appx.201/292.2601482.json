Nava-Perez, </em>242 F.3d 277, 279 (5th Cir. 2001), which held that an alien\u2019s removal, on reinstatement of a prior order of removal, was a separate and distinct event from his original removal, such that the alien had been removed subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction, and by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision and not a separate criminal offense. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
