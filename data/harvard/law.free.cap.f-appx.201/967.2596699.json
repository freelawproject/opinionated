Romo argues that the original order of removal is void in light of our decision in <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir.2001), and that res judicata prevents the Government from attempting to deport him.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">The REAL ID Act did not alter the jurisdictional requirement that administrative remedies must be exhausted prior to seeking judicial review of a removal order. <em>Ramirez-Molina v. Ziglar, </em>436 F.3d 508, 514 (5th Cir.2006). This court lacks jurisdiction over Romo\u2019s claims because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Although Romo contends that we retain jurisdiction despite his failure to exhaust administrative remedies because he has shown a gross miscarriage of justice, the standard regarding a gross miscarriage of justice does not apply to cases wherein the petitioner seeks direct review of an original removal order. <em>See generally, Ramirez-Molina, </em>436 F.3d at 514-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Romo\u2019s petition for review is therefore DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b996-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
