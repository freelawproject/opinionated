Sujono challenges the Board\u2019s finding that she failed to qualify for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-27\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Sujono fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Sujono cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
