J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6f\">It is admitted by the demurrer that the gift of the residue to \u201c be divided among the poor colored people of the City of Lynn,\u201d is a good charity. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>14 Allen, 539, 551. <em>Attorney General </em>v. Pearce, 2 Atk. 87, 88. <em>Attorney General </em>v. Clarke, 1 Amb. 422. <em>Bishop of Hereford </em>v. Adams, 7 Ves. 324. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>1 Beav. 370. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>American Peace Society, </em>49 Maine, 288, 305. But if this is so, then according to the case last cited and the intimations in this State, the gift would not be allowed to fail for want of a trustee. The doubts which have been felt whether this court could take jurisdiction to enforce and carry out a trust that in England would have fallen upon the king as <em>parens patrice </em>do not touch a case like the one at bar. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>158 Mass. 400, 401, and cases cited. <em>Moggridge </em>v. <em>Thackwell, </em>7 Ves. 36, 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">There is no question before us concerning the appointment of a trustee, a matter upon which the defendant spent considerable time. The court is asked to declare the gift to be a public charity, and, if necessary, to frame a scheme for its administration. This is within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
