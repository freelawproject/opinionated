It appeared, that the plaintiff was partially blind and, after alighting from a street car on Washington Street in Boston at the crossing of Springfield Street, undertook to cross the street behind the car and fell into a hole somewhere between the tracks of the street railway and near the crossing; that the hole was about four feet deep and from twelve to eighteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>inches wide; how long it was did not appear; that earth was piled up on both sides of it; that the plaintiff\u2019s aunt got off the car after him, and when she looked for him he was in the hole; that the plaintiff and his aunt saw no one guarding the hole or in charge of it, and there were no barriers around it; that the accident happened about half-past twelve in the afternoon; that the plaintiff and his aunt did not leave the scene of the accident for about ten minutes, and during that period no one appeared to take charge of the hole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">This was all the evidence that the defendant had reasonable notice of the defect, or might have had notice thereof by the exercise of proper care and diligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the judge at\u00b0 the defendant\u2019s request ruled, that there was not sufficient evidence for the jury that the defendant had reasonable notice of the defect, or might have had notice thereof by the exercise of proper care and diligence.
