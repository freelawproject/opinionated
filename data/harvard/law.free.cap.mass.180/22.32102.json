While auditors\u2019 reports are made evidence by statute, and while it is the usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>practice to allow them to go to the jury room, the statute prescribes no rule as to whether they shall be taken to the jury room, and if in the discretion of the presiding judge, an audit- or\u2019s report is not allowed to be taken by the jury when they retire to consider of their verdict, no exception lies to the refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
