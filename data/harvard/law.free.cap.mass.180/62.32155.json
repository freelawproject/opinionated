And in consideration of the introduction and sale of said goods as above-stated, the parties of the first part hereby agree to grant to the parties of the second part the exclusive right to act as their selling agents in the foregoing Republics for the period of 18 (eighteen) months from date hereof, and in the event of the parties of the second part selling and paying for a minimum amount of $1,000 (four thousand dollars) worth of said goods within the above-stated eighteen months, then, at the option of the parties of the second part, this contract may be renewed for a further period of 5 (five) years, <em>provided, </em>that in each one year the amount \u25a0 of sales secured by the party of the second part must reach the minimum of $5,000 (five thousand dollars). The parties of the first part agree to deliver Bell-cap-sic Plasters free on board steamers at New York or Brooklyn docks at the agreed prices of $15 per gross.

The trade likewise told him that such things went slow down there, and that very likely if he would wait patiently and increase his advertising he would succeed, and that goods down there had to be pushed more than a year and much advertising done. That on receiving back the consignments at the end of the year, it was found that less than a gross had been sold, and that he then wrote to his principals that he could not introduce them. He testified further as follows: \u201c <em>Q. </em>What do you mean by introducing articles? <em>A. </em>I mean making every effort a man can make. <em>Q. </em>Then you mean by introducing goods, trying to introduce them ? <em>A. </em>I mean to create a demand in such way that they can be introduced.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">There was further testimony that the plaintiffs continued their efforts for the full period of eighteen months, and that altogether forty-four dozen were sold, and that in July, 1901, the defendants ordered the return of the plasters unsold, and they were returned. The plaintiffs put in evidence samples of the plasters at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">The defendants asked the judge to rule that the plaintiffs had broken their contract by failing to introduce the plasters, and could not recover, and that the defendants were entitled to recoup their damages for such breach, but the judge refused so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>to rule, and found that the plasters had been introduced, and found for the plaintiffs in both cases in the amounts claimed; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-5\"><em>J. D. Thomson, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-6\"><em>H. E.

What it meant was shown by the specific agreement \u201cto use due diligence in the introduction,\u201d etc.\" It was satisfied if the goods were put on the market, brought to the attention of the public, and an effort made to induce the public to purchase them. There was evidence warranting a finding that this was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
