Elections.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b569-9\">Mandamus will not lie to enforce the caucus or election laws, the remedy for a violation being given by St. 1898, c. 548, \u00a7 417. R. L. c. 11, \u00a7 421.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-10\">Petition for a writ of mandamus by six citizens of the town of Millbury against the chairman and secretary of a republican caucus of that town and five other persons declared at the caucus to have been elected the republican town committee of Mill-bury, praying that the chairman and secretary be ordered to count the votes cast for the petitioners and others and to declare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the seven or eight having the highest number' of votes' to be elected members of the committee, filed October 12, 1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\">The petition alleged, that a majority of the voters had determined to elect a new committee and had prepared a ticket with eight names; that the day before the caucus the old committee met and changed the number of the committee from eight to seven, giving no notice of their action; that at the caucus the ballot for eight was thrown out although it received a majority of the votes cast and the committee\u2019s ticket of seven perpetuating themselves was declared elected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-6\">The respondents demurred to the petition, on the grounds, among others, that the writ of mandamus would not lie for the matters alleged and that an adequate and exclusive relief was afforded by the laws of the Commonwealth for the wrongs, if any, of which the petitioners complained.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b570-7\"><em>B.

We assume further, but without so deciding, that the decision of the chairman and secretary of the caucus may be revised by the courts in proper proceedings. But the demurrer was rightly sustained because mandamus will not lie where the petitioners have another remedy by bill or petition given by statute. <em>Hill </em>v. McKim, 168 Mass. 100. In that case a judge of a court of insolvency having refused to order a hearing upon a proposal for composition it was held that the proper remedy was by bill or petition under Pub. Sts. c. 157, \u00a7 15, and not by mandamus. The remedy of the present petitioners wa,s under St. 1898, c. 548, \u00a7 417. See R. L. c. 11, \u00a7 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">\n<em>Orders sustaining demurrer and dismissing petition affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
