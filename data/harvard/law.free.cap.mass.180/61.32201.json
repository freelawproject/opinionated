After a verdict for the petitioner, the petitioner moved for allowance of the fees of the appraisers who had testified. This motion after hearing was denied by the judge; and the petitioner alleged exceptions to the denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-11\">The exceptions were allowed by the judge with the following statement: \u201cThe foregoing exceptions are conformable to the truth. The respondent objects that the bill does not contain any subject-matter of exception. If exception lies to the denial of the motion stated in the bill, then I allow the bill of exceptions. The exceptions, however, appear to me to be, and I find that they are, frivolous and intended for delay.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-12\"><em>3.
