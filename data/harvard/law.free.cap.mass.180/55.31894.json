The undersigned hereby applies to Cornelius Herlihy, of Boston, for a loan of $26,000 for a term of five years, on promissory note signed by Mary McGrath, widow, with interest at the rate of seven per cent on six thousand dollars, and on the balance five per centum per annum, payable semi-annually, secured by first mortgage, with power of sale and insurance clauses, of real estate described as follows. [Description.] In consideration of this proposition being entertained by Cornelius Herlihy, I promise and agree t\u00f3 pay interest on said sum from the date of the acceptance of said loan, also to pay to the counsel appointed by them his charges for the examination of the title and for conveyancing, and also all expenses of recording, and also to pay him a commission of $300.

The question whether on the facts a contract might be found to have been made between the plaintiff and defendant on the terms of that clause is not open. We have to do only with the construction of the written paper. It is quite plain that the ruling asked could not be made. The written promise must be read as made to Herlihy. The whole document is addressed to him in terms, and the consideration contemplated as the inducement of the promise is to move from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
