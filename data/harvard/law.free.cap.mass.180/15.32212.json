M. by a bill in equity sought to enforce, against the administrator of the signer, an agreement dated January 11,1898, and in substance as follows : \u201cIn consideration of business and test sittings received fromMme. S.,the clairvoyant, otherwise known as Mrs. J. M., on numerous occasions, I hereby agree to give the above named J. M. or her heirs, if she is not alive, the balance of her mortgage note [described] witli interest on the same on or after the last day of January, 1900, if my death occurs before then which she has this day predicted and claims to be the truth, and which I the undersigned strongly doubt. Wherein if she is right I am willing to make a recompense to her as above stated, but not payable unless death occurs before 1900.\u201d The bill alleged that the death of the signer of the agreement occurred before the year 1900, and further, that before the execution of the agreement the plaintiff gave to the deceased at his request the business and test sittings referred to as the consideration of the agreement, and at his request devoted much time and labor thereto. On demurrer, <em>held, </em>that there was no consideration for the promise of the defendant\u2019s intestate. The allegation that the sittings were given to the intestate at his request, did not import that they were given with an understanding that they were to be paid for, and past services although asked for, if rendered as a favor, cannot support a promise made at a later time. Moreover, if there had been a previous liability, it was not alleged that the agreement was received in satisfaction of it, even conditionally. <em>Semble, </em>that, if the alleged contract had been made upon a consideration, it would have been a wager.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-11\">Bill in equity by the owner of certain land subject to a mortgage assumed by her, to restrain the administrators of Willard Elmer, the holders of \"the mortgage, from foreclosing it, or disposing of it and the note secured thereby, and for an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>to the defendants to discharge the mortgage and cancel the note, filed July 7,1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">The bill alleged that the plaintiff was the owner of a tract of land to which she derived title by a deed of one Herman E.

Willard Elmer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">The bill alleged, that by the foregoing instrument the premises were released and discharged from the operation of the mortgage deed, and the note secured thereby was paid in full and became null and void, upon the death of Willard Elmer, which occurred before the year 1900, to wit, on September 15,1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">The bill also alleged, that before the execution of the above agreement, at the request of Willard Elmer, the plaintiff gave to Elmer the business and test sittings referred to in the agreement as the consideration for the agreement,.and at his request devoted much time and labor thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\">The defendants demurred, and among the causes of demurrer alleged, that the above agreement annexed to the bill was a wagering contract and against public policy and void, and that it was without consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">In the Superior Court the case was heard by Lawton, J., who made a decree sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill. The plaintiff appealed; and, at the request of the plaintiff, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>judge reported the case for the determination of this court. If the demurrer was sustained rightly, the bill was to be dismissed; otherwise, the demurrer was to be overruled and the defendants were to answer to the plaintiff\u2019s bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-5\"><em>W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_B\">It is hard to take any view of the supposed contract in which, if it were made upon consideration, it would not be a wager. But there was no consideration. The bill alleges no debt of Elmer to the plaintiff prior to the making of the writing. It alleges only that the plaintiff gave him sittings at his request. This may or may not have been upon an understanding or implication that he was to pay for them. If there was such an understanding it should have been alleged or the liability of Elmer in some way shown. If, as we must assume and as the writing seems to imply, there was no such understanding, the consideration was executed and would not support a promise made at a later time. The modern authorities which speak of services rendered upon request as supporting a promise must be confined to cases where the request implies an undertaking to pay, and do not mean that what was done as a mere favor can be turned into a consideration at a later time by the fact that it was asked for. See Langdell, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 92 <em>et seq.; Chamberlin </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>102 Mass. 448, 450 <em>; Dearborn </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>3 Met. 155, 158; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>172 Mass. 398, 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">It may be added that even if Elmer was under a previous liability to the plaintiff it is not alleged that the agreement sued upon was received in satisfaction of it, either absolutely or conditionally, and this again cannot be implied in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s bill. It is not necessary to consider what further difficulties there might be in the way of granting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
