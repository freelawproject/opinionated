The <em>money </em>paid for <em>it </em>was charged by the city to its water loan account. The city proceeded to construct a reservoir occupying substantially the same position as Wyman\u2019s reservoir and a dam and gatehouse. The city\u2019s principal sources of water supply, authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the last named act, were Wachusett lake in Princeton and Meeting-house pond in Westminster, great ponds whose natural outlets flow through Wyman\u2019s reservoir and thence into a branch of the Nashua River which runs through Fitchburg. In 1895, the city made an agreement with the owners of mills on the branch of the Nashua River flowing through the city, by which, in consideration of the release of damages on the part of the mill owners, the city agreed to maintain Wyman\u2019s reservoir for the use of such owners, and to allow the water to flow only into the natural channel of the Nashua River, except in case of a serious conflagration or in case of a break in the pipes above Wyman\u2019s reservoir. In such case the city reserved the right to withdraw the waters of the reservoir into the pipes which supplied the city with water, and also reserved the right to withdraw the waters of the reservoir, when necessary, for the purpose of repairing the pipes laid upon the bottom of it. Wyman\u2019s dam and gatehouse were necessary in order to turn the waters of Wyman\u2019s reservoir into the distributing pipes and would always be necessary, if it were desired to utilize the waters of Wyman\u2019s reservoir for distribution to the inhabitants of the city, but the dam at Wyman\u2019s reservoir was not necessary in order to store the water of Meeting-house pond or Wachusett lake for distribution to the inhabitants, nor to aid in its distribution, and was built at a lower level than the point at which the water for the city was admitted to the distributing pipes at the distributing basin then in use, called Smith\u2019s basin. In 1899, the property of the city of Fitchburg at Wyman\u2019s reservoir was assessed by the town of Westminster as \u201cdam and land flowed\u201d and the collector sued the city for the tax. It was agreed, that the city did not receive any revenue in the nature of rent or otherwise for the use of the dam or gatehouse or the waters or land of Wyman\u2019s reservoir, except such rights or benefits, if any, as accrued to it under the mill owners\u2019 agreement. <em>Held, </em>that the land and dam were purchased by the defendant \u201c for the purposes of its water supply \u201d and that the exemption from taxation in St. 1893, c. 352, applied to it, and on the facts it could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>be said that the defendant received any \u201crevenue in the nature of rent\u201d from any person occupying or using the property; therefore, that the action under Pub. Sts. c. 11, could not be maintained.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">Contract, by the collector of taxes of the town of Westminster, to recover the amount of a tax assessed in 1899, under Pub.

Said city is authorized to contract with mill owners whose rights are affected, in relation to the manner and mode of using, controlling and operating said compensating reservoir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Wachusett lake and Meeting-house pond are great ponds whose natural outlets flow through Wyman\u2019s reservoir, and thence into a branch of the Nashua River, carrying the waters through the defendant city.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">On April 26, 1892, in pursuance of the power given by \u00a7 4, above cited, and of a vote of the city council, the city bought of one Wyman various tracts of land in Westminster, including therein the whole of Wyman\u2019s reservoir, together with all the rights of Wyman in the waters of the pond and reservoir. The purchase money so expended was charged by the city to its water loan account. After this purchase, the city proceeded to construct a reservoir, occupying substantially the same position as Wyman\u2019s reservoir, and a dam, gatehouse, etc. The new dam was built where the old dam of Wyman\u2019s reservoir had stood. \u25a0 ,</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">This land in 1899 was assessed by the town of Westminster as \u201c dam and land flowed,\u201d and this is the tax sought to be collected in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">The city also bought land above the reservoir, and constructed therein a basin, now known as Smith\u2019s basin, a dam and a gatehouse. This was for the purpose of turning the waters of Meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ing-house pond into the distributing pipes for the use of the inhabitants of the city, which are laid from this basin to, through and beyond Wyman\u2019s reservoir. These pipes go into a chamber of the gatehouse at the dam of Wyman\u2019s reservoir in such a manner that, by shutting certain gates and opening certain other gates, the waters of Wyman\u2019s reservoir can be drawn into the pipes leading from Meeting-house pond to the city, and distributed to its inhabitants, though in fact no water has yet been drawn from this reservoir for use by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">On April 10, 1895, the city made an agreement with the owners of mills on the branch of the Nashua River flowing through the city, by which, in consideration of the release of damages on the part of the mill owners, the city agreed to maintain the reservoir for the use of such owners, and to allow the water to flow only into the natural channel of the Nashua River, except in case of a serious conflagration in West Fitchburg or in the city of Fitchburg proper, or in case of a break in the pipes above Wyman\u2019s reservoir. In such case the city reserved the right to draw the waters of the reservoir into the pipes which supply the city with water. The city also reserved the right to withdraw the waters of the reservoir, when necessary, for the purpose of repairing the pipes laid upon the bottom thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The agreed facts contain also the following statements :</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u201c Said Wyman\u2019s dam and gatehouse is necessary at the present time in order to turn the waters of Wyman\u2019s reservoir into the distributing pipes and would always be necessary if it were desired to utilize the waters of Wyman\u2019s reservoir for distribution to the inhabitants of the city; but said dam at Wyman\u2019s reservoir, as a mechanical proposition, is not necessary at the present time in order to store the water of Meeting-house pond or Wachusett lake, for distribution to the inhabitants, nor to aid in its distribution, and is built at a level lower than the point at which water for the city is and was admitted to the distributing pipes at Smith\u2019s basin.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u201c All the lands, waters, and water rights conveyed by said Franklin Wyman to the city of Fitchburg were purchased by the city at its sole expense and became the property of the city. All the dams, gates, and gatehouses erected or maintained thereon by the city, and the Wyman dam, have been so erected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>and maintained at the sole expense of the city and are the property of the city. All the water pipes laid or maintained by the city in, through and upon said premises, have been so laid and maintained at its own expense by the city, and are the property of the city. The city has also at its own expense provided for the adjustment of the gates at said Wyman\u2019s reservoir at Wyman\u2019s dam and the regulation of the flow of the waters thereof in the manner stipulated in the aforesaid agreement with the mill owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u201c The city has never received, nor does the city now receive, any revenue in the nature of rent or otherwise from any person occupying or using the Wyman dam, gates and gatehouses at the Wyman\u2019s reservoir, the waters and water rights in said reservoir and the land flowed by said waters, except such rights or benefits, if any, as have accrued to the city under said mill owners\u2019 agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">By the St. of 1893, c. 352, \u00a7 1, it is provided: \u201c Any city or town holding property, taken by purchase or otherwise, for the purposes of its water supply, whether for domestic, manufacturing or other purposes, in another city or town, shall not-pay any tax on such property, but shall hereafter in the month of September annually pay to such other city or town for each lot of land held therein for said purposes an amount of money equal to the rate of taxation per thousand dollars in such other city or town, for every one thousand dollars of the average of the assessed valuations of the land, without buildings or other structures, for the three years next preceding the taking thereof, the \u2022said assessed valuation for each year being first reduced by the amount of all abatements allowed thereon: provided, however, that any land or building from which any revenue in the nature of rent is received from any person occupying or using the same shall be subject to taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">If this act applies to the land sought to be taxed in this case, it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot recover a tax assessed under the Pub. Sts. c. 11. The question is, therefore, whether the land and dam were purchased by the defendant \u201c for the purposes of its water supply.\u201d- We are of opinion that this question must be answered in the affirmative. What was done by the defendant in the case before us was authorized, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Legislature, and was in pursuance of a scheme to supply the city with pure water. It was as much a part of the scheme as any other part, and was not a measure standing by itself. It cannot be questioned that it is for the Legislature to decide whether a public exigency or necessity existed for the establishment of the reservoir, although it is for the court to determine whether the use is or is not a public one. <em>Wayland </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>4 Gray, 500. <em>Talbot </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>16 Gray, 417. <em>Commissioners on Inland Fisheries </em>v. <em>Holyoke Water Power Co. </em>104 Mass. 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Before the St. of 1893, c. 352, lands and structures owned and used by a city or town for the purposes of its water supply, and situated in another city or town, were held to be exempt from taxation as public works. <em>Wayland </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>4 Gray, 500. On the same principle land and structures of a railroad corporation, included within its location and used for railroad purposes are exempt from taxation, and from special assessments. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Western </em>Railroad, 4 Met. 564. <em>Charlestown </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>1 Allen, 199. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>170 Mass. 95, and cases cited. So as to gravel pits owned by one city within the limits of another, and used for public purposes. <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>170 Mass. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The question remains whether the case falls within the proviso at the end of \u00a7 1 of the St. of 1893, c. 352. We are of opinion that it cannot fairly be said that any \u201c revenue in the nature of rent \u201d is received by the defendant \u201c from any person occupying or using the same.\u201d This applies to a case where a parcel of land or building not used for water purposes is let to a person, or used by him, and the city derives revenue therefrom in the nature of rent. It does not seem to us to have any bearing upon the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
