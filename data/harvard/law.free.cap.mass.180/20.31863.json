Writ dated April 25, 1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-12\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Lawton, </em>J., without a jury, it appeared, that the plaintiff at the time of her exclusion-from the school in April, 1900, was five years and ten months old, that she applied for admission to a public school for beginners taught by one teacher, and that at the time of the application there were children younger than the plaintiff attending this school. The rule under which the plaintiff was excluded was as follows: That \u201c All pupils must enter this school at the beginning of the fall term, or within three or four weeks thereafter ; and that pupils desiring to enter at any other time were excluded unless found qualified to enter the classes then in said school.\u201d This rule did not apply to children between the ages of seven and fourteen years, and children between those ages had the right to attend the public schools at any time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-13\">The rule was not recorded in the permanent record book provided for in Pub. Sts. c. 44, \u00a7 27, and there was no record in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>book of any vote or order regulating the time of admission to the respective schools.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-5\">The plaintiff requested rulings, that the plaintiff was excluded unlawfully because the regulation was not recorded in the permanent record book, that the regulation was not a lawful one, and that the plaintiff being of school age had the same right to attend the public schools as if she had been between seven and fourteen years of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">The judge refused to give the rulings and found for the defendant ; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-7\"><em>C.

Children under seven years of age, although allowed to attend the public schools, are not required to attend. St. 1898, c. 496, \u00a7 12. Grading is a permitted if not an essential feature of the public school system. The introduction, late in the school year, of a very young scholar not qualified to enter the existing classes, would tend to impair the efficiency of the school, and so to prevent the other scholars from obtaining such advancement in learning and in training as would enable them to proceed with their education in due course. The right given to every child by St. 1898, c. 496, \u00a7 7, to attend the public schools is not unqualified but is \u201c subject to such reasonable regulations as to the numbers and qualifications of pupils to be admitted to the respective schools, and as to other school matters, as the school committee shall from time to time prescribe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">Nor was it essential to the validity of the regulation that it should be recorded in the permanent record book of the school committee, required by Pub. Sts. c. 44, \u00a7 27. That section directs the committee to appoint a secretary and directs the secretary to keep a permanent record book in which all the votes, orders and proc\u00e9edings of the committee shall be recorded. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>this does not make invalid all rules and orders of the committee not so recorded. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Lynnfield, </em>116 Mass. 365, 367.
