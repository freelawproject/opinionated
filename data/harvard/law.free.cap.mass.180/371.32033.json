Declaration filed July 3, 1900, under a decree of the Superior Court changing a suit in equity into an action at law as to these defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-13\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Hopkins, J., it appeared, that the note was as follows : \u201c $750.00. Boston, Mass., April 21, 1898. One year from date on demand we promise to pay to the order of Eliza P. Huntington seven hundred and fifty dollars. Value received. Interest at 3\u00a3 per cent per annum. Charles S. Shute. Rosetta E. Shute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-14\">The defence was want of consideration. The judge instructed the jury that the words \u201cvalue received\u201d incorporated in the note were equivalent to a declaration and admission on the part of the defendants that they had received full value, and that where as here the makers had admitted consideration in the note itself, the burden of proof was on the defendants, the makers of the note, to show that there was no consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-15\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-16\"><em>E. B. Powers D. L. </em>Smith, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-17\"><em>J. W.

While the production of the note, with the admission or proof of the signature, makes a <em>prima facie </em>case, yet if the defendant puts in evidence of a want of consideration, the burden of proof does not shift, but remains upon the plaintiff, who must satisfy the jury, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that the note was for a valid consideration. <em>Morris </em>v. Bowman, 12 Gray, 467. <em>Estabrook </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>1 Allen, 412. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Edgeworth, </em>3 Allen, 233. <em>Perley </em>v. <em>Perley, </em>144 Mass. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\">It does not appear from the reports of these cases whether the note declared on in each contained the words \u201c value received.\u201d These words, however, were in the note in suit in the case of <em>Delano </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>6 Cush. 364, but the case was decided on the general rule. See also <em>Noxon </em>v. <em>De Wolf, </em>10 Gray, 343, 346; <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>119 Mass. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">We can see no reason for changing the rule so well established, merely because the note contains the words \u201c value received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ahr\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
