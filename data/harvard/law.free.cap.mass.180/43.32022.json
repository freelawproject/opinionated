The plaintiff signed the bond on March 29,1898. His payment as surety was on <em>J </em>une 12,1900. The defendant\u2019s petition in bankruptcy was filed on February 13, 1900, and on April 10, 1900, he received his discharge. <em>Held, </em>that the debt due the plaintiff was contingent upon a breach of the bond and his payment as surety, which did not occur until after the defendant\u2019s discharge. Therefore at the time of the adjudication of bankruptcy the plaintiff\u2019s claim was a contingent one and as such not provable under the bankruptcy act of 1898, and so not discharged.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b65-11\">The assumption in <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Wordell, </em>178 Mass. 350, that the Supreme Court of the United States would decide, that under the bankruptcy act of 1898 claims contingent at the time of the adjudication of bankruptcy cannot be proved, was followed in this case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-12\">Contract to recover for the amount paid by the plaintiff on account of his liability as surety on the defendant\u2019s bond, dated March 29, 1898, to dissolve an attachment in another suit brought by one Sarah Aug.

This obligation was in force when on February 13, 1900, the present defendant\u2019s petition in bankruptcy was filed. It was an obligation founded upon an implied contract, and it was evidenced by an instrument in writing, and in one sense it was a fixed liability. But \u2022no debt was absolutely owing at the time of the,petition. The obligation was contingent upon the happening of a breach of the bond and a payment by the surety. The payment by the surety was not until June 12, 1900, and there seems to have been no breach of the bond before that date. Therefore neither the obligee in the bond nor the surety could prove in the bankruptcy proceedings a claim founded upon the bond unless merely contingent claims are provable under the bankruptcy act of 1898. The ultimate decision of that question is yet to be made by the Supreme Court of the United States. But in <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Wordell, </em>178 Mass. 350, this court assumed that such claims, were not provable under the act, and we follow that view in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
