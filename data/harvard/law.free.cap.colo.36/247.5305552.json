Thereafter plaintiff moved to restrain the clerk from entering the order as modified, which motion was odenied, and plaintiff excepted and made application to this court for a writ of error to review the judgment, assigning as error the court\u2019s refusal to restrain the clerk from entering the modified judgment, and alleging that the order for modification was void because not rendered in open court. Defendant in error urges that the writ of error in this case does not run to a final judgment, and, therefore, this record cannot be reviewed.

On the same day, a temporary injunction was granted in accordance with the prayer of the complaint. On the 14th day of October, 1899, defendants filed their answer and a motion to dissolve the injunction. Upon the hearing of the motion, the court made the following order:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\">\u201cIt is therefore ordered by the court that the injunction heretofore issued in this cause on September 25, A. D. 1899, be and the same is hereby modified in this, to wit: That said defendants, their agents, employees and assigns, be enjoined and restrained from using the said ditch, to wit, the O\u2019Brophy Ditch, or allowing the water of Wilson creek to be conveyed through and along said ditch to the place where said water is to be used by said defendants, in any such manner as to interfere with the mining operations of the plaintiff. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-10\">On November 13, 1900, the cause was tried to the court, and taken under advisement, and after-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>wards, and on January 4, 1901, the conrt made the following order:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-4\">\u201cAt this day, in open court, come said defendants by J. J. McPeely, Esq., their attorney. Thereupon, this cause having been heretofore submitted to the court upon the trial of the issue herein joined, and the court being now sufficiently advised in the premises, doth find and order that the temporary injunction heretofore issued herein, and as thereafter modified by order of this court, be, and the same isr hereby made perpetual, and that said plaintiff have judgment for its costs in this behalf expended, and that judgment be entered herein in accordance with such finding, and that the same be recorded in the judgment book.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">After the making of said order, Hon. E. C. Stimson, the trial judge, adjourned the court and returned to Colorado Springs on the evening of that day. On the following day, by telephone, he instructed the clerk to modify the judgment rendered on the 4th, to read as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\">it Thereupon, this cause having been heretofore submitted to the court upon the trial of the issues herein joined, and the court being now sufficiently advised in the premises, doth find the issues herein joined in favor of said plaintiff and against said defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">\u201cAnd orders that said defendants, their agents, servants and employees, be, and each of them is hereby enjoined and restrained from in any manner conducting water through their ditches or conduits over and across the Era lode mining claim, the property of plaintiff, or any part thereof, and that judgment in accordance with such finding be entered herein and for costs of suit, and the same be recorded in the judgment book.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>On February 4, 1901, the defendants, by permission of the court, filed as of January 8, 1901, the following motion:</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-4\">\u201cCome now the defendants by their attorney, J. J. McFeely, and move the court to make an order to prevent the clerk of this court from inserting .in the records of this case a pretended order received by the clerk of this court, by telephone from Colorado Springs, El Paso County, Colorado', from the Honorable E. C. Stimson, who, at the time1, was one of the judges of the district court of this judicial district, for the following reasons, to wit: That heretofore, to wit, on January 4, A. D. 1901, in the district court of Teller County, Colorado, the said Hon. E. C. Stimson, who at the time was one .of the judges of this district, did, in open court on said date, render his final judgment in said cause, the said cause having been tried before the said Judge Stimson at a former day of this term of court, to wit, November, 1900, which judgment was by the clerk of this court then and there entered into the'minute book of said court, as he was required to do under the rules of this court, which minute book and order is hereby referred to and made a part of this motion. That said order above referred to, which the clerk of this court is about to insert in the records of this case, and which was received by him by telephone as aforesaid on the evening of January 5, 1901, and while the district court of Teller County was not in session, and neither of the judges of this district were in the county of Teller, and without the knowledge of defendants or their attorney, and without notice to them. Which order so received, if allowed to be entered, in the records, makes a distinct and different judgment from that rendered by this court on January 4, 1901, for the following reasons, to wit: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>(1) That said pretended order so received by telephone is absolutely void and is not the judgment of this court. (2) Because said order or judgment was not rendered in open court. (3) Because the Hon. E. C.

(4) Because said order is void and of no force or effect whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b273-4\">\u201c J. J.

Because said order of January 5th was not rendered in open court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-6\"><em>\u201c6. </em>Because the Hon. E. C.

Because the judgment rendered in open court on January 4, A. D. 1901, should stand as the final judgment in this cause, until .the same is reversed or modified according to law.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b279-9\">Mr. Justice GoUdakd</author>\n<p id=\"Atq\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">It is insisted by counsel for defendant in error that this record does not present for review any of the rulings complained of by counsel for plaintiff in error for the reason, as it is claimed, that the writ of error does not run to a final judgment; and, assuming this to be true, the decision in <em>Schmidt v. Dreyer, </em>21 Colo. 100, is relied on as conclusive of this proposition. That case was an action in replevin. A final judgment was rendered in favor of Dreyer at the November term, 1891, of the county court of Arapahoe county, which, by mistake of the clerk, was incorrectly entered. On January 12, 1895, upon dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>covery of this mistake, he applied for an order to amend and correct the entry so as to make the record express the judgment which was, in fact, pronounced by the court. The court heard the testimony and made an order directing such correction to be made. This court held that from the record presented it appeared that the writ of error was taken to review this order and not to the final judgment theretofore rendered, and, for the reason that this essential statutory requirement had not been complied with, dismissed the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">It will be observed that the record before us is not objectionable fof the reasons given in that case, but contains all the proceedings had and all orders made in the case, including the judgments of the Ith and 5th of January, 1901, and all the proceedings had in relation to the latter judgment subsequent thereto, and by the errors assigned the validity of the latter judgment is directly challenged, and the correctness of the ruling of the trial court in denying the motion to restrain the clerk from entering the same of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We think, therefore, the validity of what purports to be a final judgment, to wit, that of January 5, 1901, is properly presented for our consideration and determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Counsel for defendant in error devote considerable space to the discussion of the power of a court to amend or correct a judgment during the term at which it was rendered. We concede the rule to be well settled that a court has power to not only correct, but also to change, its judgment during the term, and has power at any time to correct the record to make it speak the truth. Suffice it to say that the exercise of such a power is not involved in this cale; but the question' presented is whether a judge is vested with authority, acting outside the court, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>change or alter a judgment theretofore duly rendered in open court. In other words, has he authority, by telephone or otherwise, to render a judgment when not present in court? -As was said in <em>Cooper v. Amer. Central Ins. Co., </em>3 Colo. 318: \u201cA judgment is the sentence of the law pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction, as the result of proceedings instituted. It is a judicial act, and to be valid must be pronounced by the <em>court, </em>at a time and place appointed- by law, and in the form it requires. \u201d It is clearly shown by the affidavits of Mr. McFeely and Mr. Gaylord, and also Judge Stimson admits in his affidavit, that, as a matter of fact, the judgment was pronounced in open cour' ' day of January, A. D. 1901, as shown ir _utes 'of the clerk, to wit, \u201cThat the injunction as modified heretofore be made perpetual.\u201d Judge Stimson further states that he did not at the time he rendered the judgment have in mind the fact that the injunction, as originally issued, had been modified, and through an inadvertence he directed the clerk to enter the judgment making the temporary injunction as modified perpetual. That on the next day, to wit, the 5th day of January, 1901, while at Colorado Springs, he became aware that said judgment as entered upon the clerk\u2019s minutes was not the proper judgment in said cause, and was not the judgment which he had actually intended to render in said cause. But nevertheless he did pronounce the judgment so entered, and it became then and there the judgment of the court. As was said in <em>Schuster v. Rader, </em>13 Colo. 329, 334:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201cThe judgment having been so pronounced in open court, the act of entering the same in-the record by the clerk was purely ministerial, and was not essential to the existence of the judgment SO' rendered, though the entry was necessary to preserve it, and, as a matter of proof, was the best evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>of its existence. The judgment derived its force and effect from the fact that it had been so considered, adjudged and decreed by the court; and it became effective from the time of such adjudication and promulgation in open court, though the ministerial act of entering the same in the records of the court might be delayed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The judge was, therefore, without authority, while the court was not in session, to direct the clerk to enter another or different judgment in conformity with an unexpressed intention he may have had in mind at the time the former judgment was rendered. The judgment, therefore, as entered of the 5th of January, 1901, is void, and may be vacated at the same or subsequent term. \u2014 1 Black on Judgments, secs. 318, 326; Current Law; vol. 4, p. 300 and cases cited in notes 96 and 97.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\u201cThe court will always, upon motion, strike from its record a judgment void for <em>irregularity.\u201d </em>\u2014 Wil<em>liamson v. Hartman, </em>92 N. Car. 236.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">And in this state such a judgment may be reviewed on <em>error. </em>\u2014 Hoehne <em>v. Trugillo, </em>1 Colo. 161; <em>Skinner v. Beshoar, </em>2 Colo. 383; <em>Cooper et al. v. Am. Cent. Ins. Co., </em>3 Colo. 318; <em>Bean v. The People, </em>6 Colo. 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The plaintiffs in error were entitled to the relief sought, and the court below erred in denying their motion to r\u00e9strain the clerk from entering the judgment of January 5, 1901, and its ruling thereon is reversed, and it is ordered that the court below sustain said motion, and in case said order shall have been entered, that the same be declared void, and expunged from the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Chief Justice Gabbert and Mr. Justice Bailey concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
