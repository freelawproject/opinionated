The Internal Revenue Service then sought discovery of records relating to the deductions claimed by Eisele. Eisele, claiming that these records were privileged under the fifth amendment, refused to produce them. On May 25,1977, the Tax Court determined that the records were not privileged and ordered Eisele to produce them on or before June 8, 1977. Despite this order, Eisele still failed to produce the documents. Accordingly, on June 17, 1977, the Tax Court dismissed the petition and ordered a judgment in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-23\">The Tax Court\u2019s sanctions for failure to comply with discovery are explicitly authorized by Tax Court Rule 104(c)(3), which provides that the court may enter an order \u201cdismissing the case or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party.\u201d We therefore conclude that the Tax Court\u2019s response to Eisele\u2019s continued refusal to produce the documents was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
