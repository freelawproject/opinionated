Finding that this motion did not meet the standards set forth in <em>Anders v. California, </em>1967, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493, and <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>1976, 5 Cir., 527 F.2d 1328, we directed counsel to search the record and submit an adequate brief. Appellant\u2019s counsel has now filed a proper <em>Anders </em>brief challenging the propriety of admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s pri- or convictions. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>The facts are not complicated. A policeman observed appellant walk up to a locked Toyota, remove a plywood panel from the vent window, and enter the automobile. Three policemen subsequently found appellant in the car and pulled him out. They found a pair of sunglasses, belonging to the owner of the car, in Jimenez\u2019s hip pocket. At trial, appellant tried to establish, through his own testimony, that he had not intended to burglarize the car but had merely been seeking refuge from some men who had beaten him up in a fight earlier that evening. On cross-examination the prosecutor asked appellant if he had ever been \u201cconvicted of stealing,\u201d but never introduced any evidence of prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">On appeal appellant argues first that the trial judge should have made a preliminary determination that the probative value of this evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. Second, he claims that the prosecutor, by referring to prior convictions without proving that they were felonies, offered misleading and incomplete evidence. Finally, appellant insists that this Court may consider both of these alleged errors even though his trial counsel made no objection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Since appellant\u2019s case was tried before a Judge, we do not have to determine whether this evidence was admissible. As we stated in <em>United States v. Impson, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 562 F.2d 970,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-6\">[a] judge, sitting as a trier of fact, is presumed to have rested his verdict only on the admissible evidence before him and to have disregarded that which is inadmissible. <em>United States v. Masri, </em>547 F.2d 932, 936 (5 Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Dillon, </em>436 F.2d 1093, 1095 (5 Cir. 1971). Any error is thus harmless if there exists other admissible evidence sufficient to support the conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Having examined the record, we are convinced that there is sufficient clearly admissible evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction. He committed the acts proscribed by C.Z.C. \u00a7\u00a7 502-503. The trial judge, whose job it is to pass on the credibility of witnesses, <em>United States v. Impson, supra </em>at 971, apparently did not believe that defendant lacked <em>mens rea. </em>The conviction is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-26\">. 6 C.Z.C. \u00a7\u00a7 502-503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b954-19\">. Appellant argues that these errors were so prejudicial that they constituted \u201cplain error.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
