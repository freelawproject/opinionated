We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">Petitioner was removed from state custody in Mississippi after a U. S. Marshal lodged a detainer and then a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum with the state penitentiary. After arraignment on two federal charges, petitioner was returned to state custody. Another writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum was issued to transfer Robinson for trial on the first of the two federal charges (mailing a threatening letter (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876)), in which he was acquitted. A third writ removed the prisoner for the trial of his second federal charge, conspiring to pass and passing forged postal money orders in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 500, which resulted in his conviction. Petitioner now claims that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (18 U.S.C. App. pp. 1395-1398 (1976)) \u00a7 2, Art. IV(e) was violated by the Government\u2019s failure to try him on both federal counts before returning him to Mississippi state custody. Art. IV(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-15\">(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information, or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner\u2019s being returned to the original place of imprisonment . . . such indictment . shall not be of any further force or effect</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-17\">Robinson contends that he asked his court-appointed attorney to raise this claim in the trial court, and that counsel\u2019s refusal to do so constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">As Mississippi is not a party to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, the procedures of that Act do not apply to the United States in its dealings with that state. The language of Art. IV of the Agreement indicates that the terms of the Agreement are only operative in transactions between party states.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-19\">(a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information, or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and <em>who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party State .</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-20\">(emphasis added) 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 2, Art. IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-21\">Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>United States v. Mauro, </em>- U.S. -, -, 98 S.Ct. 1834, 1848, 56 L.Ed.2d 329 (1978) that a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum issued after a detainer has been lodged should be treated as a \u201cwritten request for temporary custody\u201d within the meaning of Art. IV of the Agreement, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>not apply in dealings with nonparty states, since there is no danger of permitting the United States \u201cto circumvent its obligations under the Agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because we find that the agreement has no application to this case, petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure to raise this issue is, of course, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
