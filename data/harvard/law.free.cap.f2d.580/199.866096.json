Salvatierra seeks to vacate a final default judgment of $8,458.53 entered in favor of plaintiffs James Turner and Linda Chase. Since plaintiffs did not meet the notice requirements of Fed.R. Civ.P. 55(b)(2) when applying to the court for the default judgment, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">Plaintiffs Turner and Chase were hired by a boat delivery service to transport a yacht owned by defendant Salvatierra from Pompano Beach, Florida to Venezuela, defendant\u2019s native land. The yacht sank en route, and plaintiffs brought suit against Salvatierra to recover wages and damages for loss of personal effects. They filed their complaint on March 5, 1976, serving defendant with process pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 48.161, 48.19<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by serving the Florida Secretary of State on March 12 and notifying defendant of such service by registered mail on March 29. The case lay dormant until August 31, when the District Court, pursuant to Rule 13 of the Local Rules for the Southern District of Florida, entered an order of dismissal for lack of prosecution, providing that the action would be dismissed without prejudice on September 15 unless plaintiffs filed before that date with the clerk of the court an affidavit showing good cause and the court determined that plaintiffs had demonstrated good cause for their lack of diligence. Without having filed that affidavit, on Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tember 15 plaintiffs moved for entry of default. That same day, defendant filed an answer and affirmative defenses. Although the complaint was dismissed for lack of prosecution on September 15, later in the year plaintiffs took depositions from officials of the yacht brokerage company that had sold the sunken vessel to defendant and defendant deposed those individuals as well as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Plaintiffs refiled their complaint on December 28, 1976, and by permission of the court the complaint was reassigned the same docket number as that of the original action. On January 4,1977, plaintiffs again served process on defendant by serving the Florida Secretary of State and on January 25 they informed defendant of that service by registered mail. After four months passed, without response by defendant, on May 4 plaintiffs moved for entry of default against defendant; the clerk entered the default on the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Plaintiffs filed a motion for entry of final judgment on May 25. The District Court issued an order granting the motion for default judgment, limited to the issue of liability, on July 5, and scheduled a hearing on the damages issue for July 15. The District Court entered its final judgment on July 18, awarding plaintiffs aggregate damages of $8,428.53 plus costs. On July 28 defendant moved to vacate the final judgment and filed both a motion to vacate default and a third party complaint. The District Court denied defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the final judgment on January 30, 1978 and defendant filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">This Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he entry of judgment by default is a drastic remedy and should be resorted to only in extreme situations. [Citations omitted] It is only appropriate where there has been a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct.\u201d <em>E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. v. Moffatt, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 460 F.2d 284, 285; <em>Charlton L. Davis &amp; Co. P.C. v. Fedder Data Center, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 556 F.2d 308, 309. Moreover, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2), \u201c[i]f the party against whom judgment is sought has appeared in the action, he (or, if appearing by representative, his representative) shall be served with written notice of the application for judgment at least 3 days prior to the hearing on such application.\u201d To qualify as an appearance and thereby trigger the foregoing notice requirement, defendant\u2019s actions must \u201cat least\u201d \u201cbe responsive to plaintiff\u2019s formal Court action.\u201d <em>Baez v. S. S. Kresge Company, 5 </em>Cir., 1975, 518 F.2d 349, 350, <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 1495, 47 L.Ed.2d 754 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Here, defendant filed an answer and affirmative defenses and deposed prospective witnesses in connection with plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint of March 5, 1976. The two complaints received the same docket number, appear on the same record and are identical in content. Thus, the two are \u201creally one and the same,\u201d <em>Press v. Forest Laboratories, Inc., </em>45 F.R.D. 354, 356 (S.D. N.Y.1969), so defendant\u2019s actions in response to the first complaint constitute an appearance for purposes of Rule 55(b)(2). Plaintiffs were therefore required to comply with the notice provisions of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Rule 55(c) provides that judgments of default may be set aside in accordance with Rule 60(b) \u201c[f]or good cause shown.\u201d Because plaintiffs\u2019 failure, in violation of Rule 55, to notify defendant of their default motion \u201cprovides sufficient reason for [defendant\u2019s] failure to respond,\u201d and because defendant claims that he has a meritorious defense by his denial of privity of contract or any other relationship creating any liability to defendants, the District Court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion for relief from the final default judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6). <em>Charlton L. Davis &amp; Co. P. C. v. Fedder Data Center, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 556 F.2d 308, 309. Accordingly, that judgment is hereby vacated and the case remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\">. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 48.161.
