Robinson while employed as a carpenter by \u201cDavid Fyne &amp; Ruth Papkin, a co-partnership, doing business as Two-Minute Auto Car Wash\u201d at San Francisco, California, on January 7, 1954, sustained an injury arising out of and occurring in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the course of said employment, and that at the time of the injury the employers were uninsured for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits but were not wilfully uninsured; awarded temporary disability indemnity of $35 a week beginning January 8 and ending March 21, 1954, also reasonable medical expenses incurred by the employee and an attorney\u2019s fee of $150 against \u201cDavid Fyne and Ruth Papkin, a co-partnership, doing business as Two-Minute Auto Car Wash\u201d; and dismissed Industrial Indemnity Company, real party in interest herein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The employee was injured while working as a carpenter in the repair of fire damage which had occurred at an apartment house at 15th and Mission Streets, San Francisco.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The sole issue presented is whether or not the employers were insured for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits in respect to the operation, occupation and employee here involved. If so, it was error to dismiss Industrial Indemnity Company and not the employers; if not so insured, no error was committed and the decision should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">There was in effect at the time of the injury a certain workmen\u2019s compensation and employers' liability policy issued by Industrial Indemnity Company for the period November 18, 1953, to November 18, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The first page of this policy contains seven items of \u201cDeclarations.\u201d Item I designates the employer as \u201cDavid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Fyne &amp; Ruth Papkin, a copartnership, DBA Two-Minute Auto Car Wash, 590-20th Street, Oakland, California.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Following these declarations, under the head of \u201cInsuring Agreements,\u201d the policy states that the company \u201cagrees with the Employer in respect to injury sustained by employees during the policy period, including death at any time resulting therefrom, as follows: ... I. ... To pay promptly benefits as required by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws of the State of California to any person entitled thereto. . . . [II \u2014 Employers\u2019 Liability coverage \u2014 III \u2014 Longshoremen\u2019s compensation coverage\u2014IV\u2014 extraterritorial liability coverage] ... V. ... To defend in the name and on behalf of the Employer, claims or suits against the Employer for compensation or damages because of injuries insured against hereunder ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Then follow four paragraphs of <em>\" </em>exclusions, \u2019 \u2019 such as: Serious and wilful misconduct not insured; not applicable to liability of employer as member of any partnership not named in Item I of the declarations; executive officers, members of firm, and relatives not insured unless specifically included in Item V of declarations; does not cover additional compensation for injuries to illegally employed minors under 16; if employer is a partnership, individual operations are not insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Next come 13 paragraphs of \u201cconditions, the first of which, designated \u201cA,\u201d provides for payment of \u201cthe premium earned under this policy,\u201d which shall be computed \u201cfor all operations or exposures (whether or not specified in the declarations) with respect to which insurance is afforded under any one or more of the Insuring Agreements. Remuneration upon which premium is based is the entire remuneration earned during the policy period by all employees covered. ... At the end of each premium adjustment period [in this case annually] and upon termination of this policy, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Employer shall report to the Company the remuneration or other data upon which premium is based and the earned premium shall be computed and paid to the Company. If, at termination of this policy, the earned premium exceeds the premium paid, the Employer shall pay the excess to the Company; if less, the Company shall return the unearned portion except that the Company shall retain the Minimum Premium ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The employers, the insurance company and the commission concur in the view that the \u201cclassifications\u201d mentioned in Item IV of the declarations were listed for premium rating purposes and do not of themselves restrict the scope of the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The company and the commission contend that the designation and the principal location of the employer as stated in the declarations (\u201cDavid Fyne &amp; Ruth Papkin, a co-partnership, DBA Two-Minute Auto Car Wash, 590 - 20th Street, Oakland, California.\u201d) are restrictive both as to type of operations and place of work. Without discussing the provisions of Insuring Agreement I or those of Condition A, they seem to assume that the provisions of Items I and III of the declarations clearly impose limits upon the scope of the insurance coverage or at least produce an ambiguity which justifies resort to extrinsic evidence to ascertain the intent of the parties. Their discussion is devoted principally to the extrinsic evidence. The employers claim that Items I and III of the declarations are not thus restrictive, particularly in view of the broad sweep of other provisions of the policy, especially those of Insurance Agreement I and Condition A. We think the employers have the better of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Resort to extrinsic evidence cannot, of course, be had unless there is an ambiguity. The parol evidence rule, a rule of substantive law, imposes that requirement. Here the parties have emphasized the importance of that requirement by Condition M of their contract in which they declare: \u201cThis policy, including all endorsements or riders hereon, constitutes the entire contract of insurance. No condition, provision, agreement, or understanding not set forth in the policy or in such endorsement or rider shall affect such contract or any rights, duties or privileges arising therefrom. \u201d  As said in <em>Laventhal </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y., </em>9 Cal.App. 275, 276 [98 P. 1075], \u201cThe policy is but a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>tract, and, like all other contracts, it must be construed from the language used; when the terms are plain and unambiguous, it is the duty of courts to hold the parties to such contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">A reading of the contract does not indicate an ambiguity. Items I and III of the declarations name the employer and designate the employer\u2019s principal location. Item IV lists the employer\u2019s principal operations. In paragraph I of the insuring agreements the insurer \u201cAgrees with the Employer in respect to injuries sustained by employees during the Policy Period, ... To pay promptly benefits as required by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws of the State of California to any person entitled thereto.\u201d Paragraph A of conditions states that the premium shall be based upon remuneration \u201cfor all operations or exposures (whether or not specified in the declarations) with respect to which insurance is afforded under any one or more of the Insuring Agreements\u201d including of course Paragraph I of the insuring agreements. The expression \u201cwhether or not specified in the Declarations\u201d literally refers to each and all of the 7 paragraphs of declarations (not merely to paragraph IV which contains the \u201cclassification of principal operations\u201d) and thus states that the operations assertedly specified by the use of the expression \u201cDBA Two-Minute Auto Car Wash\u201d and by the designation of the employer\u2019s principal location (Items I and III) do not restrict or limit the all-inclusive scope of \u201call operations or exposures\u201d of \u201cany\u201d employee of this employer who may become \u201centitled\u201d to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits under the laws of California. In short, a reading of this insurance contract seems to compel the conclusion that it clearly, certainly and without ambiguity affords workmen\u2019s compensation insurance coverage for each and every employee of this employer without regard to the nature of the work or the place of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">This interpretation finds support also in the provisions of sections 11657-11660 of the Insurance Code as implemented by sections 2250-2268 of title 10 of the Administrative Code. Section 11657 provides that \u201cSubject to the provisions of sections 11658, 11659 and 11660, limited workmen\u2019s compensation policies may be issued insuring either the whole or any part of the liability of any employer for compensation. Subject to those provisions, any such policy <em>may restrict, or limit such insurance in any manner whatsoever.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This language clearly comprehends restrictions or limitations as to operations, exposures, persons, occupations, and locations as well as limitation of the amount or kind of compensation payable to a person rightfully claiming under the policy. Policies must be approved by the insurance commissioner as to substance and form (\u00a7 11658). An approved form of policy, \u201climited pursuant to section 11657, shall not be otherwise limited except by endorsement thereon in accordance with a form prescribed by the commissioner or in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner.\u201d (\u00a7 11659.) Failure to observe the requirements of sections 11658 and 11659 renders \u201cany such policy, issued under section 11657 and not complying therewith, unlimited.\u201d (\u00a711660.) As reported in 20 I.A.C. 118, <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>the District Court of Appeal (1st Dist., Div. 2) by denying a petition for review (without opinion) in effect held that a certain compensation policy was not \u201climited\u201d <em>as to </em>location, \u201cthere being no stipulations or endorsements in form prescribed by the Insurance Commissioner or in accordance with his rules and regulations. ...\u201d (P. 118 of 20 I.A.C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The insurance commissioner\u2019s regulations and various approved forms appear in the sections of the Administrative Code above cited. They are designed to govern the \u201cLimitation or restriction of coverage under workmen\u2019s compensation insurance policies ...\u201d (10 Cal. Admin. Code, \u00a7 2252.) Among the approved forms of endorsements set forth in section 2268 of title 10 is No. 10, a form for the exclusion of \u201cEmployees and/or Operations and/or Locations\u201d .with spaces for the insertion of \u201coptional fillers.\u201d Section 2260 sets forth 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>types or forms of optional fillers<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and declares that form No. 10 may be completed by the insertion of one of these \u201coptions <em>and none other.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">When, despite these emphatic and meticulously detailed requirements governing the \u201climitation or restriction of coverage,\u201d an insurer writes a policy with the all-inclusive coverage of the policy here involved and attaches no endorsements or riders of any kind to it, the conclusion is irresistible that the insurer intended full coverage without limitation or restriction of any kind whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">A photostatie copy of a printed circular bearing the legend \u201cPublished For Producers By Industrial Indemnity Company\u201d is annexed to the petition herein as Exhibit D. The petition, which is verified, alleges and the answer of the company does not deny<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the form of policy here involved was put into effect on November 21, 1949, and was announced by Industrial Indemnity Company in said circular. That does not make the circular or the circumstances of its issuance a part of the record upon this review, for such facts were not put in evidence at the hearing before the respondent com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>mission, those facts allegedly having come to petitioner\u2019s notice subsequent to that hearing and just prior to the filing of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">However, since the circular is available as an expression of opinion and is couched in such clear and cogent terms, we are persuaded to quote the following portions of it, not as a basis for estoppel against raising the issues which the company has presented nor as extrinsic evidence of the intent of the parties but as a statement of legal conclusions based upon the very words used in the contract: \u201cIndustrial Indemnity Company\u2019s new Workmen\u2019s Compensation policy contract, designed specifically for full coverage for California employers, will be available for your use beginning November 21st. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201cFollowing are highlights of the most important coverage extensions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\u201c1\u2014Undisclosed Operations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201cUnder the \u2018standard\u2019 form no coverage exists for the operations of an employer when such operations are not described in the policy and not incidental to the operations described. This is true regardless of where the operations were performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\n<em>\u201cSuch undisclosed operations are fully covered under our new policy.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201c2\u2014Domestic Employees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">\u201c(a) Under the \u2018standard\u2019 form, an individual employer whose policy describes a business operation has no coverage for a domestic employee who works more than 52 hours a week and thus comes under the Compensation Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">\n<em>\u201cSuch domestics are automatically covered under our new policy.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">\u201c(b) An employer with a \u2018standard\u2019 form policy on his business operations has no coverage on a domestic employee who works less than 52 hours a week; or on employees otherwise exempt from the Compensation Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\n<em>\u201cThe Employers\u2019 Liability section of our new policy protects the employer against damage suits from such employees.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">\u201c3\u2014Extra-territorial or \u2018All State' Operations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az8\">\u201cThe \u2018standard\u2019 policy follows employment for California-hired employees but does not cover the employer in the event an employee injured outside of California elects to recover under the Compensation laws of the state in which he was injured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>\u201cThe new Industrial Indemnity Company policy extends coverage to the employer in such cases.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u201c4\u2014Longshore Exposure</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201cThe \u2018standard\u2019 policy does not include insurance under the Federal Longshoremen and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act. There is a fine dividing line as to when any employer may be subject to that Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\n<em>\u201cOur new policy removes any doubt as to protection by automatically providing specific coverage for the employer.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">\u201c5\u2014Trade Names</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">\u201cNo coverage has existed under the \u2018standard\u2019 form policy for an employer doing business under a trade name when, under a different trade name, he engages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-5\">\u201c (a) in the same operation elsewhere, or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">\u201c(b) in a different business operation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWmq\">\n<em>\u201cCoverage in both of the above cases will continue to be afforded under our new policy.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">\u201c6\u2014Other Features of the new policy which will interest producers and their clients are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">\u201c (a) It places Employers\u2019 Liability coverage on an \u2018occurrence \u2019 rather than an \u2018accident\u2019 basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-14\">\u201c(b) It does not exclude illegal employment under Employers\u2019 Liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-15\">\u201c(e) It is probably the only short-form Compensation poljcy issued by any carrier which automatically covers related Longshore exposure, includes \u2018Liability Over\u2019 provisions, specifically includes U. S. territories and possessions and provides \u2018All States\u2019 or extraterritorial coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-16\">The apparent newness of this form of policy perhaps explains the lack of reported judicial decisions interpreting it or similar policies. The cases upon which the company and the commission rely involve policies markedly different from this one because of patently narrow coverage or by reason of restrictive clauses embodied in the policy or annexed to it by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>endorsement. For example, in <em>National Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., 21 </em>Cal.App.2d 156 [68 P.2d 748], the court annulled an award against the petitioning insurance carrier because the employee was injured while engaged in an operation not covered by the policy. It appears from the decision that this operation \u201cTo have been properly covered, . . . would have required an additional classification of operation. ...\u201d (P. 158.) Perusal of the petition for writ of review in that case discloses the fact that a certain endorsement on the policy expressly excluded from coverage injuries \u201csustained by any employees engaged in any operations other than those operations specifically rated and described as covered hereunder in the Classification of Operations schedule herein\u201d and expressly limited coverage to \u201csuch operations of this Employer which are performed upon the following described premises or directly in connection with such operations.\u201d (Pet. p. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Somewhat similar restrictions and limitations in varying forms precluded coverage in <em>Western Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>43 Cal.App. 487, 488 [185 P. <em>306]; Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>29 Cal.App.2d 414, 415 [84 P.2d <em>793]; </em>and <em>Paulson </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>44 Cal.App.2d 511, 513 [112 P.2d 710],</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In <em>National Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>3 Cal.App.2d 410 [39 P.2d 477], it was \u201cconceded that the insurance policy covered only the hardware business\u201d (p. 411) and there was no evidence upon which to predicate a finding that the injured employee was doing work in connection with the hardware business. <em>Ogburn </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>207 Cal. 50 [276 P. 1004], involved a travel insurance policy that covered injuries \u201c \u2018sustained while riding as a passenger on any public conveyance provided by a common carrier and such conveyance is being propelled on land or water by mechanical power . . .\u2019 \u201d (P. 52.) Obviously, that did not cover injuries sustained when the insured fell down a hotel elevator shaft. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>31 Cal.App.2d 122 [87 P.2d 377], involved a public liability policy which specifically excluded injuries which occurred when the automobile was being driven \u201c . . by any person in violation of any state . . . law as to age applicable to such person. \u2019 \u201d (P. 123.) This clearly excluded coverage while the car was being driven by the insured\u2019s 14-year-old son without a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The company and the commission suggest that petitioners are bound by the testimony of one of their witnesses, Peter L. Davey, secretary of the California Inspection Rating Bureau, testimony to the effect that the coverage of this policy was limited to operations bearing some relation to the trade name used by the insured, \u201cTwo-Minute Auto Car Wash.\u201d We do not see that petitioners were bound by such testimony. The witness was neither a member nor an agent of this partnership and, therefore, could not make an admission or stipulation in their behalf, and the subject matter of the testimony was essentially in the nature of legal conclusions which it is the function of the commission and of the reviewing court to draw from their reading of this contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In Number 16861, the award is annulled with directions to the respondent commission to revise the findings of fact in accordance with the views herein expressed, to make the awards against Industrial Indemnity Company in lieu of the employers, and to dismiss and discharge the employers from the proceeding. In Number 16874, the petition being predicated upon a void order of the commission (see <em>Crowe Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>84 Cal.App. 287 [258 P. 130], and <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com,., </em>22 Cal.2d 604, 611 [140 P.2d 405]), the proceeding is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Peters, P.
