The district court sentenced him to a term of 270 months imprisonment. Hammond appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in finding that he possessed a firearm in connection with a crime of violence pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B 1.4(b)(3)(A) (2001). Hammond specifically insists that the evidence presented at sentencing was insufficient to support a finding that he in fact committed a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that the district court\u2019s finding that Hammond committed felony assault with a deadly weapon on a government official was not clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>81 F.3d 498, 503 (4th Cir.1996). Likewise, we reject Hammond\u2019s claim that the district court erred in declining to award him a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>79 F.3d 14, 17 (4th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Falesbork, </em>5 F.3d 715, 721-22 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">We accordingly affirm Hammond\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
