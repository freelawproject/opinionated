Smith appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely. Smith seeks to challenge his California state conviction and life sentence for one count of kidnapping to commit robbery, one count of robbery with a dangerous weapon, and one count of fleeing the scene of an accident. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Based on our de novo review, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), we affirm in part, and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) imposes a one-year statute of limitations on the filing of \u00a7 2254 petitions. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Absent any tolling, Smith\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, filed on October 5, 1999,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is untimely. <em>See Tillema v. Long, </em>253 F.3d 494, 498 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Smith first contends that unconstitutional state action prevented him from filing on time. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B). Citing <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 821, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), he argues that the state denied him access to the courts because they failed to provide him, an illiterate prisoner, with adequate assistance from someone trained in the law. We disagree. Smith is only entitled to a reasonably adequate opportunity to present his claims to the courts, <em>see Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996), not to the assistance of someone trained in the law, <em>id. </em>at 356, 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">Smith next contends that with the benefit of equitable tolling, his petition is timely. Equitable tolling of the statute of limitations is appropriate only if extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time. <em>Miles, </em>187 F.3d at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">Smith first argues that the limitations period should be equitably tolled because at the time he filed his petition, jurists interpreted \u00a7 2244(d)(2) to mean that the filing of a state habeas petition resets the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. We are not persuaded. An incorrect interpretation of the law is not an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tolling. <em>See Green v. White, </em>223 F.3d 1001, 1003 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Smith next argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling because the prison law library did not have materials on the AEDPA until mid-1998. We have concluded that an inadequate prison law library may justify equitable tolling, or it might be an \u201cimpediment\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B). <em>Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146, 1148 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (per curiam). However, based on the limited record before us, we cannot determine whether tolling is appropriate in this case. <em>See Herbst v. Cook, </em>260 F.3d 1039, 1044 (9th Cir.2001). We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s ruling on this claim, and remand for further development of the record and to allow the district court to determine in the first instance whether the alleged inadequate prison law library prevented Smith from filing his \u00a7 2254 petition on time. <em>See Whalem/Hunt, </em>233 F.3d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Smith\u2019s final contention is that if his petition is indeed untimely, it should still be considered because he is actually innocent. We cannot agree. Under the actual innocence gateway of <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995), a petitioner\u2019s proeedurally barred claim may be considered on the merits if his claim of actual innocence is sufficient to implicate a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>Majoy v. Roe, </em>296 F.3d 770, 775-76 (9th Cir.2002). Even if the actual innocence gateway could override the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, <em>see id. </em>at 776, Smith has failed to present sufficient evidence to show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him, <em>see Sistrunk v. Armenakis, </em>292 F.3d 669, 673, 677 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-15\">.
