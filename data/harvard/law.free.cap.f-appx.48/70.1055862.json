We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-17\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-19\">To establish a Title VII retaliation claim, Drotleff must show: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action was taken against her; and (3) there was a causal connection between the first two elements. <em>Hopkins v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>77 F.3d 745, 754 (4th Cir.1996). If Drotleff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to Miehelin to produce evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Bur-dine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). If Miehelin meets this burden, Drotleff must show the employer\u2019s proffered reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination. <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 147-48, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-20\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and the district court\u2019s order. The district court properly concluded Drotleff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII because she failed to produce evidence that she suffered from an employment action that adversely effected the terms, conditions, or benefits of her employment. <em>See Von Gunten v. Maryland, </em>243 F.3d 858, 865 (4th Cir.2001). Furthermore, even if we conclude Drotleff established a prima facie case of retaliation, Drotleff has not shown Michelin\u2019s reasons for its various employment decisions were a pretext for illegal retaliation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Drotleffv. Michelin N. Am., Inc., </em>No. CA-01-2496-6-25AK (D.S.C. Apr. 1, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
