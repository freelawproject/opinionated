The transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) apply, and we have jurisdiction to review a final order of the BIA pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Padilla-Agustin v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir.1994), <em>overruled on other grounds by Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-18\">Marin-Morales was deported in absentia when he failed to appear at his deportation hearing. The immigration judge denied Marin-Morales\u2019s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings, and the BIA dismissed his appeal. Marin-Morales subsequently moved the BIA to reconsider, and the BIA denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-19\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider because it had fully considered in its initial decision whether Marin-Morales had received legally adequate notice of the deportation hearing. <em>See Padilla-Agustin, </em>21 F.3d at 977-78; <em>see also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-20\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s initial decision dismissing Marin-Morales\u2019s appeal because he did not timely file a petition for review of that decision. <em>See Narayan v. INS, </em>105 F.3d 1335 (9th Cir. 1997) (order) (pursuant to IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(C), all petitions for review must be filed within 30 days of the final BIA</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>decision); <em>Martinez-Serrano v.
