When the district court directed Maul to identify the basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction, she alleged that Indiana Bell\u2019s deficient service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>violated her First and Fourth Amendment rights, and that the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>authorized her to sue Indiana Bell in federal court. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 207. Indiana Bell filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), arguing that its conduct could not be construed as state action, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and that the private right of action authorized by the Communications Act did not apply to suits against local telephone service providers, <em>see </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 152(b), 153(10), 207. The district court agreed and granted Indiana Bell\u2019s motion. Maul now appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Sapperstein v. Hager, </em>188 F.3d 852, 855 (7th Cir.1999). District courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the Constitution, the laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. On appeal Maul does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that she failed to raise an actionable constitutional claim, but she insists that the district court erred in concluding that no federal statute establishes subject matter jurisdiction for her dispute with Indiana Bell. Specifically, Maul argues that section 207 of the Communications Act authorizes her to file a federal lawsuit to recover damages for Indiana Bell\u2019s failure to furnish her reasonably adequate local residential telephone services. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Section 207 provides, in pertinent part, \u201c[a]ny person claiming to be damaged by any <em>common carrier </em>subject to the provisions of this chapter [47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq.] ... </em>may bring suit for recovery of the damages ... in any district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Maul equates the term \u201ccommon carrier\u201d with \u201ctelephone service provider,\u201d and therefore argues that \u00a7 207 authorizes her to sue Indiana Bell in federal district court. But the statute does not define \u201ccommon carrier\u201d so broadly. In another provision of the Act, \u201ccommon carrier\u201d is defined as \u201cany person engaged ... in interstate or foreign communication by wire.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(10). This definition does not mention local or \u201cintrastate\u201d communications providers, of which, Maul admits in her brief on appeal, Bell is one. Moreover, elsewhere the Communications Act expressly limits the scope of its regulation to interstate communications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">[Njothing in this chapter [47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, <em>et seq.] </em>shall be construed to apply ... [to] claims arising out of charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or regulations for or in connection with <em>intrastate </em>communication service by wire or radio of any carrier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">47 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(b) (emphasis added). Because Maul concedes that Bell is only a local (intrastate) telephone service provider and not a long distance (interstate) carrier, the district court did not err in concluding that Maul\u2019s action does not fall within the express language of \u00a7 207, and that she failed to establish federal subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
