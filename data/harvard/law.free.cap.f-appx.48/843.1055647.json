On December 4, 2001, the District Court sentenced appellant to a 57-month term of incarceration. The length of appellant\u2019s sentence was due, in part, to his prior conviction, which constituted an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is aptly summarized in his brief: \u201cMr. Rossis-Lopez argues that his alleged prior aggravated felony conviction should not have been used to enhance his sentence, because it was not treated as an element of the offense at the change of plea or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr. Rossis-Lopez acknowledges that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi </em>... and <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) foreclose his position. However, Mr. Rossis-Lopez raises this argument to preserve it in the event that the state of the law in the Supreme Court changes.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. Accordingly, appellant freely acknowledges that current Supreme Court precedent \u201cclearly repudiates [his] position,\u201d <em>id., </em>and simply appeals to preserve this issue in case the law changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-18\">We recently faced a similar situation in <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>267 F.3d 231 (3d Cir.2001), <em>cert, denied, </em>534 U.S. 1152, 122 S.Ct. 1118, 151 L.Ed.2d 1011 (2002). In <em>Weaver, </em>we concluded that \u201c[d]espite speculation about the future of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we heed the words of the Supreme Court in <em>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc.: </em>\u2018If a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250-51 (quoting <em>Rodriguez, </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989)) (footnote and citation omitted). As we did in <em>Weaver </em>and as appellant acknowledges we must, we will follow Almendarez-Torres\u2014 and <em>Apprendi </em>\u2014 and affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
