We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision, and we review for substantial evidence and legal error the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1097 (9th Cir.1999). We conclude that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding, which discredited the treating physician\u2019s report and Medhi\u2019s subjective complaints of disabling pain. <em>See id. </em>at 1098. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The ALJ failed to give specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting the treating physician\u2019s opinion, which concluded that Medhi is disabled from working. <em>See Edlund v. Massanari, </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1157 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The ALJ also failed to provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Medhi\u2019s testimony. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">First, because Medhi provided evidence of an underlying impairment, she did not need to support the severity of her pain with additional evidence. <em>See Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 347-48 (9th Cir. 1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Second, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Medhi drove a car and cared for her two children is unsupported in the record. Further, her testimony that she rarely drove and required help with childcare is not inconsistent with Medhi\u2019s subjective complaints of pain. <em>See Vertigan v. Halter, </em>260 F.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Considering the record as a whole, the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting Medhi\u2019s pain testimony are not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Tackett, </em>180 F.3d at 1098 (holding that the Commissioner\u2019s decision cannot be affirmed \u201csimply by isolating a specific quantum of supporting evidence\u201d). Accordingly, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b729-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
