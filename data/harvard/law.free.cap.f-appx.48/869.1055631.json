The notice of appeal was received in the district court shortly after the expiration of the appeal period. Under Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) and <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), the notice is considered filed as of the date Jasper properly delivered it to prison officials for mailing to the court. The record does not reveal if or when Jasper complied with the requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1). Accordingly, we remand the case for the district court to obtain this information from the parties and determine the timeliness of the filing under Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) and <em>Houston v. Lack. </em>The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration. We deny Jasper\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for an extension of time to file an informal brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
