He contends on appeal the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-23\">Dusenbury first contends he should not have been sentenced under the ACCA because he lacked the requisite number of qualifying convictions under the statute. We find this argument to be without merit. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d as a crime that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d or \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-24\">Dusenbury next contends he should not have been sentenced under the ACCA because the predicate convictions were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>alleged in the indictment or submitted to the jury to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216, 219-20 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2606, 153 L.Ed.2d 792 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Dusenbury\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
