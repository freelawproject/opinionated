Singh, </em>Inter. No. 102,728, Paper No. 199 (Bd. Pat.App. &amp; Inter. June 19, 2001). Because the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and was not contrary to law, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">This case arises out of an interference declared on November 12, 1991, involving a count corresponding to all thirty-seven claims of Brake\u2019s U.S. Patent 4,870,008 (hereinafter \u201cthe Brake patent\u201d) and claims 8 and 19-21 of Singh\u2019s U.S. Application 07/552,719.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">The Brake patent issued from U.S. Application 07/081,302, filed August 3, 1987, which was a continuation of, and was accorded the benefit of, U.S. Application 06/522,909 (hereinafter \u201cBrake 2\u201d), filed August 12, 1983, assigned to Chiron Corporation. Singh\u2019s Application 07/552,719 was filed July 16, 1990, and was accorded the benefit of U.S. Application 06/506,098 (hereinafter \u201cthe Singh application\u201d), filed June 20, 1983, and U.S. Application 06/488,323, filed April 25, 1983, both assigned to Genentech, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">Because the earlier Singh application predated Brake 2, Singh was initially designated the senior party in the interference. However, Brake 2 was a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application 06/457,325 (hereinafter \u201cBrake 1\u201d), filed January 12, 1983, and Brake successfully moved for the benefit of the filing date of Brake 1 with respect to the count in the interference. Brake also successfully moved to attack the benefit accorded Singh of the April 25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>1983 filing date of U.S. Application 06/488,-323. Brake was then designated as the senior party.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The count, which is identical to claim 1 of Brake 2, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">1. A DNA construct comprising a sequence of the following formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0B\">5\u2019-L-S-Gene*-3\u2019,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABU\">where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-6\">L encodes a Saccharomyces alpha-factor leader sequence recognized by a yeast host for secretion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">S encodes a spacer sequence providing processing signals resulting in the enzymatic processing by said yeast host of a precursor polypeptide encoded by L-S-Gene* into the polypeptide encoded by Gene*, S containing the sequence 5-RJ-R2-3\u2019 immediately adjacent to the sequence Gene*, Rj being a codon for lysine or arginine, R2 being codon for arginine, with the proviso that S not contain the sequence 5\u2019-R3-R4-X-3\u2019, where R3 =Ri, R4=R2, and X encodes a processing signal for dipeptidylaminopeptidase A; and Gene* encodes a polypeptide foreign to Saccharomyces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aoc\"><em>Brake, </em>Paper No. 199 at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The DNA construct of the count thus includes three basic components: (1) a segment, \u201cL,\u201d which encodes an alpha-factor leader sequence;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) a segment, \u201cS,\u201d which includes a first codon,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R1( encoding either lysine or arginine, followed by a second codon, R2, encoding arginine; and (3) a gene, \u201cGene*,\u201d which encodes a protein of interest, in particular, a polypeptide foreign to (i.e., not naturally produced by) <em>Saccharomyces. See </em>Brake patent, col. 2, ll. 11-16, 38-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">After the DNA construct has been introduced into the yeast cell, <em>e.g., </em>via a plasmid vector, the cell \u201ctranslates\u201d the construct, producing a polypeptide having the sequence of amino acids encoded by the DNA. The sequence of the resulting polypeptide, like the DNA encoding it, is divided into three regions: the alpha-factor leader, the spacer sequence including either a lysine-arginine or an arginine-arginine two-amino acid block, and the amino acid sequence of the protein of interest (\u201cgene product\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">According to the record in this case, the leader sequence functions to target the polypeptide for secretion from the yeast cell. During secretion, the yeast enzyme KEX-2 recognizes the lysine-arginine or arginine-arginine spacer sequence in the polypeptide and cleaves the polypeptide at the junction between the spacer and the gene product. As a result, the desired gene product is released into the extracellular medium, free of the leader and spacer portions of the polypeptide. <em>See Brake, </em>Paper No. 164 at 2. Because the yeast cell exports rather than retains the desired protein, protein purification is considerably simplified. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">The following is a statement of the facts as set forth in our earlier opinion in this case. <em>Singh v. Brake, </em>222 F.3d 1362, 55 USPQ2d 1673 (Fed.Cir.2000). As we not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>ed in that opinion, the factual context of Singh\u2019s alleged conception of the claimed DNA construct is based on his statements to the PTO and other record evidence. Absent qualification, the facts set forth here are not disputed by the parties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">In the course of Singh\u2019s attempts to design the claimed DNA construct in August 1982, he prepared plasmid p57, a circular DNA molecule containing the alpha-factor leader sequence and a spacer sequence directly adjacent to it. <em>See </em>Singh Decl. \u00b6 21. During that same month, Singh incorporated the gene for human protein interferon D (\u201cIFN-D\u201d) into p57, thereby yielding plasmid p58. <em>See id. </em>In p58, the gene was also positioned adjacent to the spacer sequence, such that the leader, spacer, and gene sequences were all oriented in a fashion identical to the claimed construct. From September 6 to 11, 1982, Singh\u2019s assistant, Dr. June Lugovoy, isolated the DNA segment from p58 containing the alpha-factor leader, spacer, and IFN-D sequence, and inserted that segment (hereinafter \u201cthe p60 DNA construct\u201d) into yeast plasmid YEp9PT (\u201cp60\u201d). <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 26. Plasmid p60 was then introduced into yeast cells to determine whether the p60 DNA construct would generate IFN-D. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 27.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">On October 1, 1982, protein sequencing chemist Bill Kohr informed Singh that the IFN-D expressed by yeast cells transformed with p60 contained eight additional amino acids not normally present in natural IFN-D. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 33. On approximately that same date, Singh alleges that he conceived the claimed DNA construct, <em>i.e., </em>he devised a plan to redesign the p60 DNA construct in order to obtain the desired gene product, IFN-D, free of those additional amino acids. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 34. Specifically, Singh claims that he realized that he would need to remove eight unwanted codons (twenty-four nucleotides) from the p60 DNA construct, and that he planned to accomplish this deletion by use of a technique known as \u201cloop deletion mutagenesis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-10\">On November 24, 1982, Singh wrote a laboratory notebook entry setting forth the undesired eight codons in the p60 DNA construct, as well as the twelve nucleotides on either side of that eight codon segment (the \u201cflanking sequences\u201d). <em>See </em>Singh Decl. \u00b6 45. On that date, Singh also ordered a linear, 24-nucleotide sequence (a \u201c24-mer\u201d) that comprised the nucleotides of the flanking sequences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This order was canceled on the same day, and a notation in Singh\u2019s laboratory notebook stated that Singh would perform the deletion experiment in a different way \u201cwithout changing codons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On December 1, 1982, Singh ordered another 24-mer for the deletion experiment. This 24-mer was precisely complementary to the flanking sequences set forth in the November 24 entry. <em>See </em>Singh Decl. \u00b6 47. DNA chemist Peter Ng testified that he synthesized the 24-mer for Singh on December 20,1982. <em>See </em>Ng Decl. \u00b6 11; Ng Dep. at 36. Singh affixed the order into his notebook on December 21,1982, with a notation \u201coligonucleotide for making in-frame deletion of alpha pro-IFN-D junction.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Singh alleges that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>facts corroborate his testimony that he conceived the claimed DNA construct before January 12, 1983, the filing date of Brake 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1364-65, 222 F.3d 1362, 55 USPQ2d at 1674-75 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">At final hearing on May 11, 1998, Singh sought: (1) to contest the interlocutory order granting Brake the benefit of Brake 1; (2) to prove Singh\u2019s conception of the invention of the count prior to Brake l\u2019s January 12, 1983 filing date; and (3) to show diligence throughout the \u201ccritical period\u201d from just prior to January 12, 1983, until actual reduction to practice. Singh was unsuccessful with respect to all three issues, and final judgment was issued in favor of Brake on August 31, 1998. <em>Brake, </em>Paper No. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Singh appealed to this court, contesting Brake\u2019s entitlement to the benefit of Brake 1 and contesting the Board\u2019s finding that Singh had failed to prove conception prior to the Brake 1 filing date. We held that certain of the Board\u2019s key findings underlying its conclusion that Singh had failed to prove conception of the subject matter of the interference prior to the effective filing date of Brake were unsupported by substantial evidence, and we vacated and remanded. <em>Singh, </em>222 F.3d at 1370, 55 USPQ2d at 1679. We also found that the Board did not address whether Brake 1 adequately described and enabled the disputed subject matter of the count under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 1, and we remanded for determination of those issues as well. <em>Id. </em>at 1371, 222 F.3d 1362, 55 USPQ2d at 1679.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">On remand, the Board permitted the parties to submit briefs on the remanded issues, but returned Singh\u2019s enablement and written description briefs (as well as Brake\u2019s corresponding reply briefs) with its opinion, stating that Singh had failed to comply with the requirements of 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.655(a) and (b) by presenting new arguments not raised in the original opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">In an 89-page opinion with an additional 17-page concurrence, <em>Brake, </em>Paper No. 199, the Board addressed each of the issues on remand and concluded: (1) that Brake 1 adequately described and enabled the invention of the count, and Brake was therefore entitled to the benefit of Brake l\u2019s filing date; (2) that Singh had not met his burden of proving conception prior to the filing date of Brake 1; and (3) that even if it were assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that Singh had conceived the invention prior to Brake\u2019s filing date, Singh had not met his burden of demonstrating diligence between conception and reduction to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Singh now appeals again. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b824-13\">A <em>Return of Briefs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">Pursuant to our earlier decision\u2019s remand \u201cfor determination of those issues that were properly raised during the earlier proceedings,\u201d <em>Singh, </em>222 F.3d at 1371, 55 USPQ2d at 1679, the Board invited the parties to submit briefs on the issues of Singh\u2019s case for priority and Brake\u2019s sustenance of his burden of proof with respect to written description and enablement. <em>Brake, </em>Paper No. 199 at 12. After the parties submitted the invited briefs, the Board determined that Singh had presented new arguments in derogation of the Board\u2019s reminder that only issues that were properly raised in the original opposition were entitled to review at final hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 13. In response, the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>returned all of the newly submitted briefs to the parties without further consideration, holding that the briefs contained, \u201calmost exclusively, new arguments, and lack the showing that Preliminary Motion 2 [concerning the Brake patent\u2019s entitlement to the Brake 1 filing date] should be modified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Singh argues that the Board erred in refusing to consider briefs submitted by Singh on remand. We review the Board\u2019s application of its rules for an abuse of discretion. <em>Brown v. Barbacid, </em>276 F.3d 1327, 1332, 61 USPQ2d 1236, 1238 (Fed. Cir .2002). Although returning the briefs to the parties is a rather extraordinary measure, we do not find any abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s doing so. 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.655(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">A party shall not be entitled to raise for consideration at final hearing any matter which properly could have been raised by a motion under \u00a7 1.633 or 1.634 unless the matter was properly raised in a motion that was timely filed by the party under \u00a7 1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was denied or deferred to final hearing, the matter was properly raised by the party in a timely filed opposition to a motion under \u00a7 1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was granted over the opposition or deferred to final hearing, or the party shows good cause why the issue was not properly raised by a timely filed motion or oppositions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.655(b) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">Because the Board found that Singh was attempting to raise in his briefs matters that could have been but were not raised at the outset of the interference, <em>see Brake, </em>Paper No. 199 at 12, the Board was acting properly within its discretion when it refused to consider the briefs. Singh could have raised his written description and enablement arguments at the outset of the interference; to the extent that he did not do so, those arguments have been waived. As we held in <em>Credle v. Bond, </em>25 F.3d 1566, 30 USPQ2d 1911 (Fed.Cir. 1994), the Board does not abuse its discretion when it declines to consider untimely arguments. <em>Id. </em>at 1572 n. 14, 25 F.3d 1566, 30 USPQ2d at 1916 n. 14. Furthermore, because the Board explicitly stated in its November 2, 2000 order that additional briefing was optional, <em>Brake, </em>Paper No. 179 at 5, it is difficult <em>to </em>see how the subsequent refusal to consider the briefs could have been an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">Singh also asserts that the Board refused to consider certain arguments made in his \u201coriginal\u201d Main Brief. We find no abuse of discretion. Again, Singh did not show good cause for failing to raise these arguments at the preliminary motion stage, and the Board was entitled to decline to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">\n<em>B. Conception and Reduction to Practice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">\u201cConception is the formation \u2018in the mind of the inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention, as it is therefore to be applied in practice.\u2019\u201d <em>Kridl v. McCormick, </em>105 F.3d 1446, 1449, 41 USPQ2d 1686, 1689 (Fed.Cir.1997) (citations omitted). A conception must encompass all limitations of the claimed invention, <em>see id., </em>and \u201cis complete only when the idea is so clearly defined in the inventor\u2019s mind that only ordinary skill would be necessary to reduce the invention to practice, without extensive research or experimentation,\u201d <em>Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr Labs. Inc., </em>40 F.3d 1223, 1228, 32 USPQ2d 1915, 1919 (Fed.Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">Priority of invention and its constituent issues of conception and reduction to practice are questions of law predicated on subsidiary factual findings. <em>Brown, </em>276 F.3d at 1332, 61 USPQ2d at 1238; <em>Hitze</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number><em>man v. Rutter, </em>243 F.3d 1345, 1353, 58 USPQ2d 1161, 1166 (Fed.Cir.2001). Accordingly, we review <em>de novo </em>the Board\u2019s legal conclusions with respect to priority, conception, and reduction to practice, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706; <em>Brown, </em>276 F.3d at 1332, 61 USPQ2d at 1238; <em>Hitzeman, </em>243 F.3d at 1353-54, 58 USPQ2d at 1166-67, and we review factual findings by the Board for substantial evidence, <em>Dickinson v. Zurko, </em>527 U.S. 150, 119 S.Ct. 1816, 144 L.Ed.2d 143 (1999); <em>In re Gartside, </em>203 F.3d 1305, 1315, 53 USPQ2d 1769, 1775 (Fed.Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">A junior party seeking a determination of priority must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence either reduction to practice before the senior party\u2019s priority date, or prior conception coupled with reasonable diligence in reducing the invention to practice from a time just prior to the senior party\u2019s entry into the field to the junior party\u2019s own reduction to practice. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(g); <em>Griffin v. Bertina, </em>285 F.3d 1029, 1032, 62 USPQ2d 1431, 1433 (Fed.Cir.2002); <em>Mahurkar v. C.R. Bard, Inc., </em>79 F.3d 1572, 1577, 38 USPQ2d 1288, 1290 (Fed.Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">It is well established that when a party seeks to prove conception via the oral testimony of a putative inventor, the party must proffer evidence corroborating that testimony. <em>See Mahurkar, </em>79 F.3d at 1577, 38 USPQ2d at 1290; <em>Price v. Symsek, </em>988 F.2d 1187, 1194, 26 USPQ2d 1031, 1036 (Fed.Cir.1993). That rule addresses the concern that a party claiming inventorship might be tempted to describe his actions in an unjustifiably self-serving manner in order to obtain a patent or to maintain an existing patent. <em>See Kridl, </em>105 F.3d at 1450, 41 USPQ2d at 1689 (\u201cThe tribunal must also bear in mind the purpose of corroboration, which is to prevent fraud, by providing independent confirmation of the inventor\u2019s testimony.\u201d); <em>Price, </em>988 F.2d at 1194-95, 26 USPQ2d at 1036-37; <em>Eibel Process Co. v. Minn. &amp; Ont. Paper Co., </em>261 U.S. 45, 60, 43 S.Ct. 322, 67 L.Ed. 523 (1923). There is no particular formula that an inventor must follow in providing corroboration of his testimony of conception. <em>See Kridl, </em>105 F.3d at 1450, 41 USPQ2d at 1689. Rather, whether a putative inventor\u2019s testimony has been sufficiently corroborated is determined by a \u201crule of reason\u201d analysis, in which \u201can evaluation of all pertinent evidence must be made so that a sound determination of the credibility of the inventor\u2019s story may be reached.\u201d <em>Price, </em>988 F.2d at 1195, 26 USPQ2d 1031 at 1037. However, that \u201crule of reason\u201d analysis does not alter the requirement of corroboration of an inventor\u2019s testimony. <em>Brown, </em>276 F.3d at 1335. Evidence of the inventive facts must not rest alone on the testimony of the inventor himself. <em>Cooper v. Goldfarb, </em>154 F.3d 1321, 1330, 47 USPQ2d 1896, 1903 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Singh argues that the Board did not consider the totality of the corroborative evidence establishing Singh\u2019s conception, but only considered individual pieces of evidence in \u201ctotal isolation from one another.\u201d Specifically, Singh argues that his November 24, 1982 notebook entry and his ordering of the specific 24-mer oligonucleotide ultimately used to carry out the loop deletion mutagenesis method (in February 1983) establish that he had a definite and permanent idea of the structure of a DNA construct within the count and of an operative way of making it prior to Brake l\u2019s filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">We disagree. First, as we stated in our earlier opinion, <em>Singh, </em>222 F.3d at 1368, 55 USPQ2d at 1677, the Board correctly held as a matter of law that Singh faded to prove that he conceived the claimed construct prior to December 1, 1982. In his November 24, 1982 notebook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>entry, Singh identified the twenty-four nucleotides encoding the eight extraneous amino acids present in the IFN-D generated by the p60 DNA construct, labeling them with the notation, \u201csequence to be removed.\u201d He also identified in that entry the twelve nucleotides immediately upstream and the twelve nucleotides immediately downstream from those twenty-four, <em>i.e., </em>the flanking segments. Accordingly, he may have articulated in that entry the problem to be solved, namely, the need to eliminate the twenty-four nucleotides encoding the extraneous amino acids. Nonetheless, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that that entry alone was insufficient to corroborate Singh\u2019s testimony. Even if the entry expressed the problem, it did not provide the solution. <em>See Brake, </em>Paper No. 164 at 22-24. The Board\u2019s key findings in this regard, both of which are supported by substantial evidence in the notebook entry itself, are: (1) that a linear 24-mer other than the one necessary to accomplish the deletion was first ordered, and (2) that the order was canceled the same day, with a notation \u201cwill do in a different way and w/o changing codons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Secondly, as noted above, the 24-mer sequence that Singh initially ordered on November 24, 1982, was not identical to the nucleotides of the flanking sequences. Instead, he included several \u201cpreferred co-dons,\u201d casting doubt on the accuracy of Singh\u2019s statement that he ordered that 24-mer \u201c[i]n order to remove this sequence by oligonucleotide deletion mutagenesis.\u201d While it remains unclear exactly what Singh \u201cplanned\u201d to do on November 24, 1982, his identification of preferred codons suggests to us that his plans may not have included the use of loop deletion mutagenesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The Board duly considered the fact that the 24-mer ordered by Singh on December 1, 1982, was indeed complementary to the four codons on each side of the sequence Singh allegedly desired to delete. <em>See, e.g., Brake, </em>Paper No. 199 at 13-14, 19, 58-59, 77-78. The Board also reviewed Singh\u2019s notebook pages purporting to demonstrate conception. The Board concluded, and we agree, that \u201cSingh\u2019s entire case for conception rests on the order of a 24-mer and an uncorroborated notation in a corner of Dr. Singh\u2019s notebook.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">There is nothing in Singh\u2019s notebook that corroborates his testimony that the November 24, December 1, and December 21 entries were meant to be read together. Even viewing all of these entries together, however, we find that the sum falls short of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Singh had a definite and permanent idea of an operative method of making the DNA construct of the count prior to Brake 1\u2019s filing date. As the Board observed, the notebook entries do not provide any protocol or outline of the loop deletion mutagenesis procedure: \u201cAt best, the notation states a goal which Dr. Singh hopes to achieve; i.e., an in-frame deletion of the alpha pro-IFN-D junction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61. Adelman et al., In Vitro <em>Deletional Mutagenesis for Bacterial Production of the 20,000-Dalton Form of Human Pituitary Growth Hormone, </em>2 DNA 183 (1983), which described the loop deletion mutagenesis procedure, also described using oligonucleotides complementary to nucleotide sequences flanking codons to be deleted <em>as probes </em>for identifying plasmids <em>from </em>which the codons had been deleted. <em>Id. </em>at 188. We find it no less plausible that Singh was ordering the 24-mer for use as a probe than it was that he was ordering it for use in the loop deletion mutagenesis procedure. Indeed, Singh has pointed to no evidence in the record in support of his assertion that loop deletion mutagenesis was developed at Genentech in late 1982 (the Adelman et al. paper was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>published in 1983), let alone that Dr. Singh knew of any such developments prior to Brake l\u2019s filing date. The burden was on Singh to prove that he as the inventor had a definite and permanent idea of how to make the construct. <em>See Coleman v. Dines, </em>754 F.2d 353, 360, 224 USPQ 857, 863 (Fed.Cir.1985). That he did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Finally, we address Singh\u2019s argument set forth in his brief that, \u201c[w]ith respect to the issue of conception, this Court previously made specific findings ... that Singh articulated a specific plan to design the claimed construct by the loop deletion method on November 24, 1982.\u201d That statement is a mischaraeterization of our earlier opinion, in which we simply said that the Board needed to consider the totality of the evidence. We are satisfied that the Board has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Thus, after review of the record evidence in light of the proper legal standards, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s key finding that no evidence links the nucleotide Singh ordered on December 1, 1982, with a plan to design the claimed construct prior to January 12,1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Because we find that Singh did not meet his burden of demonstrating conception prior to Brake l\u2019s filing date by a preponderance of the evidence, we need not address Singh\u2019s arguments regarding reduction to practice. However, we note the Board\u2019s finding that, apart from attorney argument, \u201cSingh\u2019s evidence of diligence primarily consists of various pages from Dr. Singh\u2019s laboratory notebook which are (i) unexplained as to content and relevance to the invention of the Count, and (ii) uncorroborated.\u201d <em>Brake, </em>Paper No. 199 at 88. We agree that Singh\u2019s activities completed on December 20, 1982, were the only relevant, corroborated activities performed by Singh prior to Brake l\u2019s January 12, 1983, filing date, and, as a result, Singh failed to prove reasonable diligence toward reduction to practice by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">\n<em>C. Written Description and Enablement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">Whether a specification supports a claim corresponding to a count, and thus satisfies the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 1, is a question of fact, <em>Vas-Cath v. Mahurkar, </em>935 F.2d 1555, 1562, 19 USPQ2d 1111, 1116 (Fed.Cir. 1991), and is, in appeals from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>In re Gartside, </em>203 F.3d at 1315, 53 USPQ2d at 1775. Singh argues that the Board erred in concluding that Brake is entitled to the benefit of the Brake 1 application. First, Singh contends that Brake did not provide an adequate written description of the invention of the count in the Brake 1 application, and should not be entitled to its benefit. According to Singh, Brake 1 disclosed a large genus, allegedly encompassing over 9000 species<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (n is 0 or 1 to 4), of which the count is directed to only two <em>(i.e., </em>those where n = 0). Secondly, Singh asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>that Brake 1 does not provide an enabling disclosure with respect to the invention of the count, arguing that Brake 1 does not disclose how to make and use the \u201cn = 0\u201d embodiment, and that \u201cthe techniques which were available to Brake at the time of filing the Brake 1 Application were not sufficient to obtain the DNA constructs of the Count.\u201d Singh also argues that Brake 1 \u201cis replete with passages which guide one of ordinary skill in the art to constructs wherein n &gt; 0, which constructs are not encompassed by the Count.\u201d Finally, Singh argues that \u201cduring prosecution of the Brake <em>2 </em>Application, Brake argued that the results obtained with the n = 0 construct were unexpected, because those of ordinary skill in the art believed that the Glu-Ala sequences were required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Singh\u2019s arguments are not persuasive. First, we disagree with Singh\u2019s argument that the invention of the count represents just two of 9000 + species disclosed in Brake 1. Singh\u2019s calculation of 341 permutations for (GAXYCX)n is apparently based on an unwarranted assumption that each iteration of the parenthetical sequence is independently chosen. However, as Brake pointed out, because the variable \u2018n\u2019 is outside the parentheses, (GAXYCX)n can code for either no amino acids (ie., when n = 0), or 1 to 4 copies of one of four different amino acid sequences (ie., Asp-Pro, Asp-Ala, Glu-Pro, or GluAla). <em>Brake, </em>Paper No. 199 at 20-21 n. 13. Thus, there are at most only 4\u00b0 + 41 + 41 + 41 + 41 = 17 permutations of that sequence. Even among those 17, however, we agree with Brake that there are only two meaningful embodiments: one in which a dipeptidylaminopeptidase A (DPAP) signal is present (ie., n = 1 to 4), and one in which it is not (ie., n = 0).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Moreover, Singh\u2019s calculation of 28 possibilities for the Lys/Arg sequences is artificially inflated because it ignores the disclosure of claim 5 of Brake 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-8\">5. A DNA construct comprising a sequence of the following formula:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATK\">L-(R-S-(GAXYCX)n-Gene*)y wherein:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-9\">L is a leader sequence recognized by yeast for secretion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-10\">R and S are codons coding for arginine and lysine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-11\">X is any nucleotide;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-12\">Y is guanosine or cytosine; y is an integer of from about 1 to 10;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-13\">Gene* is a gene foreign to yeast; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-14\">n is 0 or 1 to 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">U.S. Application 06/457,325 at 16, ll. 20-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">In claim 5, spacer R-S encodes four possible sequences (ie., Lys-Arg, Arg-Arg, Arg-Lys, or Lys-Lys), not 28. Of these four, two permutations, Lys-Arg and Arg-Arg, are within the scope of the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-17\">Singh cites <em>Fujikawa v. Wattanasin, </em>93 F.3d 1559, 39 USPQ2d 1895 (Fed.Cir. 1996), for the proposition that an application disclosing a generic chemical formula must provide adequate direction to those of ordinary skill in the art to lead them to a subgenus of the proposed count. We find Singh\u2019s reliance on <em>Fujikawa </em>to be unsound. In <em>Fujikawa, </em>we held that disclosure of a generic quinoline structure with four variable groups, each of which could be independently chosen from a list of functional groups, provided insufficient written description support for a count directed to a subgeneric structure having a single combination of the four groups. <em>Id. </em>at 1569-71, 39 USPQ2d at 1904-05. However, Brake l\u2019s formula does not present the same issue as did the quinoline in <em>Fujikawa. </em>First, replacing a functional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>group on a chemical compound can often have highly unpredictable results. We noted in <em>Fujikawa </em>that even a change as seemingly trivial as replacing an isopropyl group with the isosterie cyclopropyl group at issue in that case could result in either a significant improvement or reduction in the activity of the compound against a particular biological target. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, on the other hand, as mentioned above, there are only two subgenera that are biologically relevant: one in which a DPAP signal is present <em>(i.e., </em>n = 1 to 4), and one in which it is not <em>(i. </em>a, n = 0), a simpler case than in <em>Fujikawa. </em>Here, moreover, claim 5 of Brake 1 discloses that \u201cn is 0 or 1 to 4,\u201d which is a clear \u201cblaze mark\u201d providing <em>in ipsis verbis </em>support for \u201cn = 0\u201d in the count. <em>See In re Ruschig, 54 </em>C.C.P.A. 1551, 379 F.2d 990, 994-95, 154 USPQ 118, 122 (CCPA 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>In re Gartside, </em>203 F.3d at 1312, 53 USPQ2d at 1773 (citing <em>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966)). In <em>Fujikawa, </em>we said that \u201c[w]hile Fujikawa\u2019s arguments are not without merit, we cannot say, on this record, that the Board\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous.\u201d 93 F.3d at 1571. Likewise, on the record in the present case, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision, and we decline to find legal error in the Board\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Singh\u2019s reliance on <em>Bigham v. Godtfredsen, </em>857 F.2d 1415, 8 USPQ2d 1266 (Fed. Cir.1988), is also unavailing. In <em>Bigham, </em>Godtfredsen\u2019s first application disclosed a compound having a substituent \u201cX\u201d, where X was defined as \u201ca halogen atom.\u201d The appbcation provided as its only example a compound in which X was chloro. <em>Id. </em>at 1416, 857 F.2d 1415, 8 USPQ2d at 1267. This court ruled that that application\u2019s disclosure of \u201chalogen\u201d did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 112 as a written description of bromo or iodo species, particularly where Godtfredsen had earber argued in the same ease that bromo and iodo were patentably distinct from chloro in order to urge bifurcation of the count. <em>Id. </em>at 1417, 857 F.2d 1415, 8 USPQ2d at 1268. In the present case, in contrast, \u201cn = 0\u201d was disclosed in Brake 1. If Godtfredsen had provided examples of fluoro, bromo, and iodo compounds in addition to the chloro compound, that case might have been decided differently, even in spite of Godtfredsen\u2019s \u201cpatentably distinct\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Singh\u2019s arguments with respect to enablement are likewise unconvincing. Enablement is a question of law based on underlying factual determinations. <em>In re Swartz, </em>232 F.3d 862, 863, 56 USPQ2d 1703, 1704 (Fed.Cir.2000). We review the Board\u2019s underlying findings of fact for substantial evidence, and review <em>de novo </em>its ultimate conclusion whether a disclosure is enabbng. <em>Id. </em>Singh argues in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5O\">The Board takes internally inconsistent positions with respect to whether methods for obtaining a construct of the Count using Brake\u2019s starting material were available to those of ordinary skih in the art at the time the Brake 1 Appbcation was filed. To support its finding that Brake is entitled to benefit, the Board finds that such methods existed. However, to support its finding that Singh had not conceived of the invention prior to the Brake 1 Appbcation filing date, the Board makes the contrary finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">We find no error or inconsistency in the Board\u2019s analysis. As we wrote in <em>Glaxo Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd., </em>52 F.3d 1043, 1050, 34 USPQ2d 1565, 1569 (Fed.Cir. 1995), \u201cthe enablement requirement ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>looks to the objective knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Spectra-Physics, Inc. v. Coherent, Inc., </em>827 F.2d 1524, 1532, 3 USPQ2d 1737, 1742 (Fed.Cir.1987)). Thus, whereas the test for determining whether or not Singh conceived the construct of the count depended on Singh\u2019s own personal knowledge of methods for making the construct and his formulation of a definite and permanent idea therefor, whether Brake 1 enables an invention within the count does not depend on what Brake knew, but rather on whether the application enables one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, <em>Hybritech Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc., </em>802 F.2d 1367, 1384, 231 USPQ 81, 94 (Fed.Cir.1986), \u201cat the time the patent application was filed.\u201d <em>Ajinomoto Co. v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., </em>228 F.3d 1338, 1345, 56 USPQ2d 1332, 1337 (Fed.Cir.2000). The Board found that the testimony of Brake\u2019s witness, Dr. Patricia Tekamp-Olson, demonstrated that those of ordinary skill in the art had in their possession in 1982 various molecular biological methods sufficient to make and use the \u201cn = 0\u201d construct, including site-directed mutagenesis. <em>Brake, </em>Paper No. 199 at 24-27. The Board also found that Singh\u2019s expert, Dr. Joseph Falkinham, mischaracterized the teachings of the Fritz article on which he relied in his attempts to discredit Tekamp-Olson\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">As further \u201cproof\u2019 that Brake 1 does not provide an enabling disclosure of the invention of the Count, Singh also alleges, for example, that \u201cthe Brake 1 Application actually steers the artisan to species clearly outside the Count,\u201d that \u201cduring prosecution of the Brake 2 Application, Brake argued that the results obtained with the n = 0 construct were unexpected,\u201d and that \u201cDr. Brake did not realize the disadvantages of the n &gt; 0 constructs until well after the Brake 1 Application was filed.\u201d We are not persuaded by any of these arguments, and conclude that Singh has apparently confused the criteria for proving obviousness with those for demonstrating that a disclosure is nonenabling. Although the questions (1) whether or not a reference \u201cteaches away\u201d from a claimed invention and (2) whether or not a claimed invention provides \u201cunexpected results\u201d are relevant in determining whether or not a claimed invention would have been obvious, <em>W.L. Gore &amp; </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. Garlock, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 1540, 1550, 220 USPQ 303, 311 (Fed.Cir.1983), they are not the primary questions bearing on enablement. The fact that the Brake patent states that n in the construct is \u201cpreferably 2 or 3\u201d is also irrelevant to the question of enablement of the n = 0 construct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Similarly, the fact that the n = 0 construct might have had after-discovered advantages over the n &gt; 0 constructs has no bearing at all on whether or not Brake 1 contained an enabling disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">We thus conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Brake was entitled to the benefit of the Brake 1 application. We have considered Singh\u2019s other arguments and do not find them persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Because the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and contained no errors of law, the Board did not err in concluding that Singh failed to show (1) that Brake was not entitled to the Brake 1 filing date and (2) that Singh reduced the invention to practice before Brake\u2019s priority date. The Board\u2019s decision to award judgment to Brake is therefore <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-9\">. Alpha-factor, also known as alpha-mating factor, is a peptide released by the budding yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </em>when a haploid cell is prepared to mate. <em>See </em>Bruce Alberts et al., Molecular Biology of the Cell 722 (3d ed.1994). The yeast cell exports alpha-factor by way of a \"leader sequence,\u201d which is attached to alpha-factor and signals that the peptide is to be exported from the cell. <em>See </em>U.S. Application 06/506,098 at 3, 11. 3-5. That sequence is typically removed from alpha-factor upon secretion. <em>See id. </em>at 3, 11. 1-3. It is the alpha-factor leader sequence alone that is incorporated into the claimed construct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-16\">. A \"codon\u201d is a set of three nucleotides that codes for a particular amino acid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">. Actually, this statement is incorrect. The 24-mer sequence that Singh ordered on November 24, 1982, was not identical to the nucleotides of the flanking sequences, but instead included several \"preferred codons.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b823-11\">. This point is disputed. Singh has provided no corroboration of his assertion that this notation was actually made on December 21, 1982. Like the other pages of Singh\u2019s notebook, this page was not witnessed until 1986, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>and, even then, there is no proof that the notation existed at the time of the witnessing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b828-7\">. Singh bases that number on the formula \"((R)r-(GAXYCX)n-Gene*)y\u201d disclosed at page 3, line 33, of Brake 1, in which R = CGX or AZZ; r = \"an integer of from 2 to 4, ..., preferably <em>2\u201d; </em>X = T, G, C, or A; Y = G or C; y = \"an integer of least one and usually not more than 10, more usually not more than four ...Z = A or G; and n = \"0 or an integer which will generally vary from 1 to 4, usually 2 to 3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">According to Singh, Each \"R\u201d can encode either Lys or Arg, so (R)r can encode 22 + 23 + 24 = 28 different amino acid sequences. In addition, each \u201cGAXYCX\u201d sequence can encode any of four amino acid sequences: Asp-Pro, Asp-Ala, Glu-Pro, or Glu-Ala, so (GAXYCX)n can encode 4\u00b0 + 4* + 42 + 43 + 44 = 341 different amino acid sequences. Thus, Singh argues that the Brake 1 formula covers 28 x 341 = 9548 different species.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\">. The Board properly discredited Falkinham\u2019s testimony on that point. Paragraph 9 of Falkinham\u2019s Declaration states: \u201cAlthough there was a theoretical presentation of the n=0 construct in the Brake 1 application, there was a clear statement that 'n' in the construct was 'preferably 2 or 3\u2019 (column 3, line 25) or 'usually 2 or 3\u2019 (column 2, line 68) ... One skilled in the art would have determined from the Brake specification that the n=0 construct was not desirable.\u201d As the Board noted, <em>Brake, </em>Paper No. 199 at 36, Falkinham\u2019s citations to \"columns\u201d 2 and 3 obviously refer to the Brake patent (of which claim 1 is identical to the Count in this interference), and not to Brake 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
