R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Petitioner Ivan Stamps is before this court seeking a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) so he can appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of the habeas petition he filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Stamps is not entitled to a COA unless he makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). Stamps also seeks to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Stamps challenged the imposition of a mandatory parole period as part of the sentence he received after his felony conviction. Stamps claimed the mandatory parole provision violates the separation of powers doctrine, constitutes double jeopardy, and denies him due process of law. The district court rejected the issues raised by Stamps on their merits and denied the \u00a7 2254 petition. Stamps raises the same issues in his application for a COA and appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">This court has reviewed Stamps\u2019 application for a COA, his appellate brief, and the entire record on appeal. That <em>de novo </em>review clearly demonstrates the district court\u2019s dismissal of Stamps\u2019 \u00a7 2254 petition is not deserving of further proceedings or subject to a different resolution on appeal. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Therefore, he has not demonstrated the denial of a constitutional right. Accordingly, this court denies Stamps\u2019 request for a COA for substantially those reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order dated March 11, 2002, and dismisses this appeal. Stamps\u2019 application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal is denied. All remaining pending motions are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
