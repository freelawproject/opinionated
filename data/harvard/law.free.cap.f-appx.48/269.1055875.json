We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>de novo, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Valencia contends that an undercover police agent engaged in sentencing entrapment and sentencing manipulation by suggesting to Valencia\u2019s co-conspirator an increase in the amount of cocaine involved, and that the agent\u2019s action constitutes outrageous government conduct in violation of Valencia\u2019s due process rights. His claim is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Valencia can assert a claim of sentencing entrapment based on conversations between a government agent and Valencia\u2019s co-conspirator, the record shows that the co-conspirator readily agreed to the suggestion of an increase in the amount of cocaine involved. <em>See United States v. Naranjo, </em>52 F.3d 245, 250 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that a defendant must demonstrate both lack of intent and lack of capability to provide the quantity of drugs at issue to sustain a claim of sentencing entrapment). Furthermore, the agent\u2019s suggestion does not qualify as outrageous conduct. <em>Cf. United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 431-32, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973) (concluding that undercover narcotics agent\u2019s contribution to defendants of an essential and difficult-to-obtain ingredient for drug manufacture did not constitute outrageous government conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Because the state court\u2019s decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, nor was it based on an unreasonable determination of the facts, the district court properly dismissed Valencia\u2019s habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b323-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
