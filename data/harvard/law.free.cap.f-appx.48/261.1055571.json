The district court dismissed the petition as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-17\">Fairly\u2019s conviction became final on July 7, 1998, so his federal habeas petition, filed on February 23, 2000, is untimely unless he is entitled to tolling of the one-year AEDPA statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-20\">Fairly first contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling because he was denied an extension to file a pro se supplemental brief to the California Court of Appeal after his lawyer filed a no-issues brief pursuant to <em>People v. Wends, 25 </em>Cal.3d 436, 158 Cal.Rptr. 839, 600 P.2d 1071 (1979). He also claims that his attorney did not timely return his transcripts after filing the <em>Wende </em>brief. Assuming that those facts are true, the events occurred well before Fairly\u2019s conviction became final and, therefore, before the AEDPA statute of limitations had even started to run. Fairly fails to make a connection between these events and an inability to file his federal petition on time. <em>See Miles </em>at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-21\">Next, Fairly contends that the filing of a <em>Wende </em>brief constitutes an extraordinary circumstance. Specifically, Fairly claims that a <em>Wende </em>brief is not an appeal under \u00a7 2244(d), so his conviction is not final and the AEDPA statute of limitations has not yet been triggered. No precedent supports his contention. <em>See Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 321 n. 6,107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987) (stating that \u201cfinal\u201d with regard to a conviction refers to a case in which a judgment of conviction has been rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a petition of certiorari elapsed or a petition for certiorari finally denied); <em>cf. Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 276, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000) (holding that California\u2019s <em>Wende </em>procedure provides a criminal appellant an adequate and effective direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-22\">Finally, Fairly claims that he is \u201cactually innocent.\u201d Even if a sufficient showing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>actual innocence could override the AED-PA statute of limitations, Fairly fails to make such a showing. <em>See Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 316, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">As Fairly fails to demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances beyond his control prevented him from timely filing his petition, the district court properly dismissed Fairly\u2019s petition as time-barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Miles </em>at 1107; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b315-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-18\">. Fairly also contends that, pursuant to Rule 9(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, respondent must show prejudice when moving to dismiss a \u00a7 2254 petition on timeliness grounds. Although that was true before the enactment of AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) now provides for a one-year limitation period and does not require a showing that the state was prejudiced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
