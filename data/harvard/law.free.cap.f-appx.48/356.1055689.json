Fiacco, following a jury trial, of three counts of constructive possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The government challenges the district court\u2019s decision at sentencing to depart downward from the criminal history category (\u201cCHC\u201d) as calculated in the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) on the ground that it overrepresented the seriousness of Fiacco\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">At sentencing, the district court adopted the PSR\u2019s finding that Fiacco\u2019s base offense level was 24, pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d), and that this level was increased by one point, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, because the crime at hand involved at least three firearms. The district court declined the PSR\u2019s recommendation to add two offense level points for obstruction of justice and the government has not appealed that decision. With respect to Fiacco\u2019s CHC, the PSR calculated that Fiacco had 7 criminal history points: 8 points for a 1987 conviction for attempted reckless endangerment based on Fiacco\u2019s shooting a slingshot ball at a moving car; 3 points for a 1991 conviction for selling controlled substances to an undercover policeman; and 1 point for his 1999 conviction for threatening and assaulting his estranged wife. The 7 criminal history points placed Fiacco in a CHC IV. The PSR also detailed convictions and arrests that did not count towards Fiacco\u2019s CHC, including a conviction for a burglary of a motorcycle from a garage when Fiacco was 16, a conviction for Fiacco\u2019s participation in another burglary, in which for a payment of $10 he dropped off two co-defendants who then committed the burglary, and several convictions, arrests, and parole violations stemming from assaults, including assaults against police officers and a child, disorderly conduct, and failure to report. The district court determined that a CHC of IV overstated the seriousness of Fiacco\u2019s criminal history and departed down to a CHC of III, which resulted in a Guidelines range of 70-87 months. The district court then imposed a 70-month sentence, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and also ordered Fiacco to pay a $300 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to depart from the applicable Guideline range for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Franklyn, </em>157 F.3d 90, 97 (2d Cir.1998) (citing <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). In so doing, we apply a three-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">First, we determine whether the reasons articulated by the district court for the departure are of a kind or a degree that may be appropriately relied upon to justify the departure. Second, we examine whether the findings of fact supporting the district court\u2019s reasoning are clearly erroneous. Finally, we review the departure for reasonableness, giving considerable deference to the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\"><em>United States v. Riera, </em>298 F.3d 128, 132 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Khalil, </em>214 F.3d 111, 124 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Abu Mezer v. United States, </em>531 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 326, 148 L.Ed.2d 262 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">The first part of this test is conducted <em>de novo. See United States v. Bauers, </em>47 F.3d 535, 538 (2d Cir.1995). Section 4A1.3 of the U.S.S.G. expressly authorizes a district court to downwardly depart with respect to a defendant\u2019s criminal history category if \u201cthe defendant\u2019s criminal history was significantly less serious than that of most defendants in the same criminal history category.\u201d Therefore, a defendant\u2019s past criminal record and background clearly are factors that a sentencing court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>rely upon in determining whether a downward departure is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Because we conclude that the factors relied upon by the district court were proper as a matter of law, we next review the district court\u2019s factual determinations in support of the downward departure for clear error. <em>See Riera, </em>298 F.3d at 132. After hearing arguments from both sides with respect to Fiacco\u2019s CHC, including the government\u2019s review of Fiacco\u2019s entire criminal history, the district court noted that \u201c[b]y one point,[Fiacco had] come within a category IV criminal history,\u201d and concluded that CHC IV was \u201ca little high and overstated] the seriousness of [Fiacco\u2019s] criminal conduct.\u201d In accordance with the Guidelines, the district court \u201cconsidered] the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number,\u201d which the Guidelines instruct \u201cis often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal record.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3; <em>see also United, States v. Ashley, </em>141 F.3d 63, 69 (2d Cir.1998). In doing so, the district court found that Fiacco\u2019s criminal history consisted of \u201ca number of infractions\u201d that demonstrated that Fiacco had \u201ca total disregard for authority and doing what\u2019s right,\u201d but that were \u201cpetty in nature ____A lot of stupid conduct ... [that was] irresponsible.\u201d The district court therefore departed downward to CHC III and sentenced Fiacco to the low end of the resulting Guidelines range. While this court, had we been standing in the district court\u2019s shoes, might have viewed Fiacco\u2019s criminal history differently, \u201cit is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Galante, </em>111 F.3d 1029, 1036 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 205, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)). Rather, we accord substantial deference to the district court\u2019s \u201c \u2018institutional advantage over appellate courts,\u2019 \u201c who see but a small fraction of the sentencing issues that arise under the Guidelines, \u201cin determining whether or not a given case, considering all of its circumstances, is within the heartland of typical cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Delmarle, </em>99 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\u2019s factual determinations in support of its conclusion that Fiacco\u2019s criminal history warranted a downward departure were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Finally, in determining whether the extent of the district court\u2019s departure was reasonable, \u201c[t]he central question is whether the reasons given by the district court ... are sufficient to justify the magnitude of the departure.\u201d <em>Ashley, </em>141 F.3d at 70 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). In placing Fiacco into a CHC of III, the district court essentially reduced Fiacco\u2019s criminal history points by one. There could be no smaller departure and, thus, having found that a departure was permissible based on the factual findings of the court, we see no basis for finding that the magnitude of the departure was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
