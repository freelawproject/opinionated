L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 <em>et. seq. </em>(1996), and the Illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 <em>et. seq. </em>was improper. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">I.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Chukwuezi was lawfully admitted into the United States as a non-immigrant visitor on September 21, 1990, and he became a lawful temporary resident of the United States on December 22, 1992. On March 31, 1995, he was interviewed by an INS agent as part of a criminal investigation being conducted by the INS. Chukwuezi executed INS Form 1-214 as part of that interview. That form was entitled \u201cWaiver of Rights,\u201d and it explained various rights the signatory was waiving by participating in the interview. Those rights included the rights usually referred to as <em>\u201cMiranda </em>rights.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By signing the form, Chukwuezi agreed to proceed with the interview and answer questions. In doing so, he was aware of his constitutional rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to counsel, and he also knew that any statements he made during the interview could be used against him in any subsequent court or immigration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">On May 14, 1997, Chukwuezi was granted lawful permanent resident status. However, on June 16, 1997, he was charged with two counts of possessing forged or counterfeited alien registration cards, social security cards and other forged government documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a) in the District of Maryland. He was found guilty of those charges on October 30, 1997, and subsequently sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Upon completion of that sentence in May of 1999, the INS served Chukwuezi with a Notice to Appear charging him with being deportable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) &amp; 1101(a)(43)(P). An Immigration Judge subsequently ruled that Chukwuezi\u2019s conviction made him deportable as an \u201caggravated felon\u201d and ordered his removal to Nigeria. The judge also concluded that Chukwuezi was ineligible for Cancellation of Removal because his conviction constituted an aggravated felony. The Immigration Judge also held that Chukwuezi was not eligible for a waiver under INA \u00a7 212(c), formerly codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), because that provision had been repealed before Chukwuezi was placed into removal proceedings. Chukwuezi appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and while that appeal was pending, he also filed a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in the District Court. Although the District Court addressed some of the procedural claims Chukwuezi asserted in his <em>habeas </em>petition, the court did not address the merits of his challenge to being classified as an aggravated felon because the court believed that that issue was still pending before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">The Board subsequently affirmed the Order of Removal, and Chukwuezi attempted to appeal the Board\u2019s ruling directly to this court as a \u201cfinal order\u201d of removal. However, by order dated August 2, 2001, we granted the INS\u2019 motion to dismiss his petition for review. In dismissing his petition, we stated that we \u201clacked jurisdiction over Chukwuezi\u2019s peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>tion for review because he is an aggravated felon and he has failed to allege facts that would impeach that conclusion.\u201d <em>Chukwuezi v. INS, </em>No. 00-1707 (citing <em>Drakes v. Zimski, </em>240 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2001)). App. at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The District Court denied Chukwuezi\u2019s amended <em>habeas </em>petition in all respects, except that the court granted Chukwuezi a hearing on his due process challenge to his continued detention, and this appeal of the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for <em>habeas </em>relief is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">The District Court held that Chukwuezi\u2019s conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a) after the effective date of IIRI-RA, (September 30, 1996), brought him within the definition of \u201caggravated felony.\u201d The District Court also relied on our opinions in <em>Steele v. Blackman, </em>236 F.3d 130, 132 (3d Cir.2001); <em>DeSousa v. Reno, </em>190 F.3d 175, 178-79 (3d Cir.1999); and <em>Scheidemann v. INS, </em>83 F.3d 1517, 1522 (3d Cir.1996); holding that Chukwuezi was not entitled to the discretionary relief previously available under INA \u00a7 212(c) even though he committed his offense before that provision was repealed. Dist. Ct. Op. at 18-19. In addition, as noted above, the District Court relied upon <em>Drakes v. Zimski, </em>240 F.3d 246 (3d Cir.2001), in refraining from deciding if Chukwuezi\u2019s conviction qualified as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d because Chukwuezi\u2019s appeal to the BIA appeared to still be pending. Id.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">Chukwuezi presents two issues to us on appeal. He first contends that the definition of \u201caggravated felon\u201d as revised and expanded by AEDPA and IIRIRA, cannot be applied to him because he committed his offense before the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d was changed. He also contends that he is entitled to seek relief under the former INA \u00a7 212(c). We address each contention in turn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">Chukwuezi argues that because the government contacted him in 1995 and he signed the 1-214 waiver prior to the IIRI-RA amendments changing the definition of \u201caggravated felon,\u201d only the pre-IIRIRA definition applies to him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">IIRIRA became effective on September 30, 1996. Section 321(a)(3) of IIRIRA amended INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(P) to extend the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d to any violation of \u00a7 1546(a) for which the term of imprisonment was at least 12 months. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(P). As noted above, Chukwuezi was convicted of Fraud and Misuse of an Alien Registration Card in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a), and this conviction resulted in a term of imprisonment of 18 months. Thus, under the current definition, it is clear that Chukwuezi would qualify as an aggravated felon, though he would not have qualified before the definition was broadened.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Chukwuezi argues that he was arrested and detained by the INS on March 31, 1995, (when he signed a Waiver of Rights Form 1-214), and he committed his felony offense in 1995. Therefore, he insists that the applicable law is that which existed in 1995, and he does not qualify as an aggravated felon under the statute as it existed then. If Chukwuezi is not an aggravated felon, he may be considered for \u201cCancellation of Removal\u201d under INA \u00a7 240A(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The Attorney General contends that the August 2, 2001, order of the motions panel of this court rejecting his earlier appeal is conclusive, and binds our resolution of Chukwuezi\u2019s retroactivity argument citing <em>Gavilan-Cuate v. Yetter, </em>276 F.3d 418, 420 (8th Cir.2002) (\u201cBecause our dismissal [of the petition for review] was premised on the fact that Gavilan-Cuate was convicted of an aggravated felony, that decision is binding on this [habeas appeal].\u201d); and <em>Santos v. Reno, </em>228 F.3d 591, 597 (5th Cir.2000). Chukwuezi counters by attempting to distinguish his appeal from the circumstances in Gavilan-Cuarte and <em>Santos </em>based upon a purported procedural distinction between the posture of his appeals and the procedural posture in Gavilan-Cuarte and <em>Santos. </em>As noted above, Chukwuezi\u2019s <em>habeas </em>petition was pending in the District Court when a motions panel of this court dismissed his earlier appeal based upon the panel\u2019s conclusion that Chukwuezi\u2019s status as an aggravated felon precluded this court\u2019s jurisdiction. That is the distinction Chukwuezi argues upon us. However, Chukwuezi has not explained why that distinction between this case and the procedural posture in Gavilan-Cuarte and <em>Santos, </em>makes a difference. Moreover, we do not think that it does, and the motion court\u2019s determination is therefore now the law of the case. <em>See </em>generally James Wm. Moore, Jo Desha Lucas &amp; Thomas S. Currier, IB <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6\u00b6 0.404[1] (Matthew Bender, 2d ed. 1992) cited in <em>In re School Asbestos Litigation, </em>977 F.2d 764, 788, n. 32 (3d Cir.1992) (decision of motions panel to merely refer matter to a merits panel did not constitute law of the case because the order transferring the matter decided only that the merits panel would decide all legal issues in the case.).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Moreover, we need not even address Chukwuezi\u2019s attempted distinction of <em>Gavilan-Cuate, </em>and <em>Santos </em>because we have already decided the issue of the retroactive application of the Immigration Act amendments against him. <em>See DeSousa </em>190 F.3d at 187, and <em>Scheidemann, </em>83 F.3d at 1520. Other Circuit Courts of Appeals that have addressed this issue have reached the same conclusion. <em>See Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1250 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cIt is hard to imagine a clearer statement of Congressional intent to apply the expanded definition of aggravated felony to convictions ... pre-dating IIRIRA.\u201d); <em>Sousa v. INS, </em>226 F.3d 28, 32-33 (1st Cir.2000); <em>Aragon-Ayon v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 847, 853 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cWe are satisfied that Congress intended the 1996 amendments to make the aggravated felony definition apply retroactively to all defined offenses whenever committed, and to make aliens so convicted eligible for deportation notwithstanding the passage of time between the crime and the removal order.\u201d); <em>Mendez-Morales v. INS, </em>119 F.3d 738 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Accordingly, Chukwuezi\u2019s challenge to the retroactive application of AEDPA\u2019s expanded definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Chukwuezi\u2019s claim that he is nevertheless entitled to discretionary relief from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>deportation under the former INA \u00a7 212(c) must also fail. Section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182, excludes certain classes of aliens from readmission to the United States. Section 212(c), (the waiver provision), previously provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3O\">Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed). Thus, by its terms, \u00a7 212(c) applied only to exclusion proceedings involving aliens who \u201ctemporarily proceed abroad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c \u00a7 212(c) has been interpreted by the [BIA] to authorize any permanent resident alien with \u2018a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years\u2019 to apply for a discretionary waiver from deportation.\u201d <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 294, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (citing <em>Matter of Silva, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 26, 30, 1976 WL 32326 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Chukwuezi\u2019s argument against the retroactive denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief is based upon his claim that he relied upon the availability of that relief when he waived his rights by executing Form 1-214 in 1995, and submitting to questioning by INS agents. This claim is based upon the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>St. Cyr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">There, the alien pled guilty to a criminal offense before the effective date of IIRI-RA and the repeal of \u00a7 212(c). Thus, at the time of his plea, he was deportable but under \u00a7 212(c), he was eligible for a waiver of deportation. Deportation proceedings were initiated after the effective date of AEDPA and IIRIRA, and St. Cyr challenged the deportation arguing that he could not be denied the possibility of a \u00a7 212(c) waiver because he relied upon it in entering his guilty plea. The Supreme Court agreed. The Court held that subsequent repeal of \u00a7 212(c) could not be enforced against St. Cyr because he had entered his guilty plea in reliance upon the possibility of subsequently obtaining that relief. The Court concluded that subsequent legislative enactments could not interfere with the <em>\u201cquid pro quo\u201d </em>that is endemic to guilty pleas. 533 U.S. at 322. However, this case is not <em>St. Cyr, </em>because Chukwuezi can not establish the reliance that was so crucial to the Court\u2019s ruling in <em>St. Cyr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">As noted, Chukwuezi argues that his 1995 INS interrogation constituted the initiation of removal hearings and that the governing law must therefore be the law in effect when he waived his rights by executing INS Form 1-214 and submitting to questioning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, Chukwuezi concedes in his brief that he first came to the United States on September 21,1990. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11. Therefore, even assuming that his March 31, 1995 interrogation constitutes the beginning of removal proceedings, he had then established only four and one-half consecutive years of lawful unrelinquished domicile.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, he was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief when questioned in 1995 because he had not yet satisfied the seven year domiciliary requirement. Thus, unlike the alien in St. <em>Cyr, </em>Chukwuezi can not establish that he surrendered any constitutional rights in rebanee upon statutory relief that was subsequently repealed. Simply put, Chukwuezi \u201cwould [not] have been ehgible for \u00a7 212(c) rebef at the time\u201d he was interviewed by the INS, and he therefore can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>not establish that he relied on any such relief in waiving his rights. 533 U.S. at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Accordingly, he is not eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver in any event, and the District Court properly denied his request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-7\">. Inasmuch as we write only for the parties, we will set forth the factual and rather intricate procedural history in explaining our holding only to the extent necessary to assist our discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b902-12\">. <em>See Miranda v.

The District Court also declined review of the BIA decision concerning a claim Chukwuezi asserted under the Convention Against Torture, because he did not assert a violation of a constitutional right. The Court held that it therefore lacked jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The District Court also dismissed his due process claim.
