Vu\u2019s lawyer has filed a brief and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Vu has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In his pro se brief, Vu contends that his wire fraud conviction and sentence should be vacated because the government engaged in misconduct or breached the plea agreement by making oral promises in order to induce a guilty plea and then not following through on those promises. However, the record does not support Vu\u2019s claim. There is no evidence of the alleged oral agreement, merely Vu\u2019s statement on appeal that the promises were made. In addition, at the change-of-plea hearing, Vu stated under oath in open court that no promises other than those in the written plea agreement had been made, and the plea agreement contains a similar acknowledgment by Vu that it contained all the promises between the parties. The record on appeal does not show that Vu\u2019s guilty plea was improperly induced by government misconduct or that the government breached any agreement with him. <em>See United States v. Rubalcaba, </em>811 F.2d 491, 494 (9th Cir.1987) (noting that \u201c[s]olemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity\u201d in rejecting later claim of involuntariness of guilty plea) (internal quotation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">We take notice, <em>sua sponte, </em>of the fact that the judgment and commitment order in case number CR-99-20126-RMW incorrectly states the disposition of the charges and the offense of conviction. We therefore remand in no. 01-10016 for the limited purpose of directing the district court to correct these errors. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Our independent review of the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no other issues requiring further review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, and no. 01-10016 is REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\">. We recognize that Vu twice answered \"yes\" to the district court's question regarding whether any promises other than those in the plea agreement had been made. However, his final answer to that question was \"no.\" The transcript of the proceedings does not indicate that there was any pause in the proceedings or that any off-the-record discussion occurred. Vu may attempt to develop evidence concerning his answers and the existence of oral promises through a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Houtchens, </em>926 F.2d 824, 828 (9th Cir. 1991) (stating that claims that require development of facts outside the original record, in that case a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, are properly raised in a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
