Tempelman, </em>12 Fed.Appx. 18, 2001 WL 725370 (1st Cir.2001) (per curiam), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 842, 151 L.Ed.2d 720 (2002). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>property has since been sold at public auction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001(a). In the instant appeals, the taxpayers now challenge a trio of orders in which the district court (1) confirmed the sale, (2) authorized the disbursement of the proceeds, and (3) denied their request for \u201cequitable redemption.\u201d We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">None of the taxpayers\u2019 several assignments of error requires extended discussion. \u201cIt is well established that confirmation of a judicial sale rests in the sound discretion of the district court and will not be disturbed on appeal except for abuse.\u201d <em>United States v. Peters, </em>777 F.2d 1294, 1298 n. 6 (7th Cir.1985). Such sales \u201cenjoy a certain favor in the law\u201d and will not be overturned \u201c[i]n the absence of substantial grounds.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. J.R. Cianchette &amp; Sons Corp., </em>362 F.2d 500, 505 (1st Cir. 1966); <em>accord, e.g., M.R.R. Traders, Inc. v. Cave Atlantique, Inc., </em>788 F.2d 816, 818 (1st Cir.1986). No \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d have been cited here. The taxpayers advance various objections to the manner in which the sale was conducted. Yet their complaints, in turn, involve events that were necessitated by their own conduct (the relocated auction site), or that operated to their benefit (the revised property tax arrangement), or that were trivial (the timing of the notices; the mistaken listing of the property\u2019s address; the involvement of government counsel at the auction). Furthermore, the government disclosed all such matters to the district court in its motion to confirm the sale. The taxpayers filed their opposition to that motion three days after a court-imposed deadline (and two days after the court\u2019s ruling). And neither in that opposition nor on appeal have they made a colorable showing of prejudice. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that the court abused its discretion in confirming the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">We likewise perceive no error in the denial of the motion for equitable redemption. As the taxpayers concede, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001(a) confers no redemption rights. Their reliance on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6337(b), which applies to property sold under a levy and distraint proceeding, is misplaced. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Heasley, </em>283 F.2d 422, 427 (8th Cir.1960); <em>cf. United States v. Rodgers, </em>461 U.S. 677, 695-700, 103 S.Ct. 2132, 76 L.Ed.2d 236 (1983) (explaining distinction between administrative levy and judicial forfeiture proceedings). Even if state law redemption rights could be invoked in this context \u2014 a proposition we need not decide \u2014 the timing of the taxpayers\u2019 motion would render the relevant New Hampshire statute inapplicable. <em>See </em>N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 80:69 (permitting redemption \u201cat any time before a deed ... is given by the collector\u201d). And the taxpayers\u2019 lack of \u201cclean hands\u201d \u2014 as evidenced, <em>inter alia, </em>by their unauthorized refusal to vacate the premises as ordered \u2014 suffices to reject their appeal to general principles of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-6\">. The government has suggested that, because the sale has occurred and the proceeds disbursed, one or both of the appeals are moot. Yet in contrast to cases such as <em>Oakville Dev. Corp. v. F.D.I.C., </em>986 F.2d 611 (1st Cir. 1993), and <em>Holloway v. United States, </em>789 F.2d 1372 (9th Cir.1986), the relief sought by the taxpayers here includes more than just a request to prevent or overturn the sale. Their challenge to the district court\u2019s refusal to recognize a right of redemption, for example, presents an ongoing controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
