Henderson pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000), and was sentenced to 100 months imprisonment. He contends on appeal that the district court erred in giving him a seven-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A) (2001) for discharge of a weapon. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-24\">Henderson and two friends attempted an invasion of a home occupied by a woman and her boyfriend. Henderson was carrying a shotgun. When the woman answered the door, Henderson pushed her aside and entered. She slammed the door before the others could enter and her boyfriend confronted Henderson and took the shotgun away from him. During the struggle, the shotgun discharged and Henderson was wounded in the arm and leg. Although it was not clear who caused the discharge of the gun, the district court determined that a plain reading of the guideline required the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-25\">We review de novo the sentencing court\u2019s interpretation of a guideline. <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1003 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Cir.1996). Henderson relies on <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>64 F.3d 281, 284 (7th Cir.1995) (holding that enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A) does not apply when nonparticipant in offense discharges firearm because defendant cannot be said to have induced or willfully caused the discharge and that \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d applies only to conduct of co-conspirators, not to other persons).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">However, other circuits have not followed <em>Gordon </em>without qualification. <em>See United States v. Wright, 215 </em>F.3d 1020, 1030 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 969, 121 S.Ct. 406, 148 L.Ed.2d 313 (2000) (enhancement affirmed where robber accidentally shot himself in the leg because \u00a7 1B1.3 makes defendant responsible for all his own actions); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>146 F.3d 1338, 1345-46 (11th Cir. 1998) (enhancement affirmed where co-defendant fired gun during robbery); <em>United States v. Triplett, </em>104 F.3d 1074, 1083 (8th Cir.1997) (same). <em>Mitchell </em>held that the mere act of planning a robbery to be carried out with guns \u201cmade the likelihood of a gun discharging objectively reasonably foreseeable.\u201d 146 F.3d at 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Moreover, in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>51 F.3d 1004, 1011 (11th Cir.1995), the Eleventh Circuit held that the defendant, by attempting an armed carjacking, induced the intended victim to fire his gun in self defense and that the victim\u2019s action was thus attributable to the defendant under \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A), which provides that relevant conduct includes \u201call acts ... committed ... induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant.\u201d Similarly, in <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>203 F.3d 867 (5th Cir.2000), the Fifth Circuit noted the divergence between <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Williams, </em>then held that the plain language of \u00a7 1B1.3 permitted the enhancement where the defendant violently resisted arrest and thus \u201cunquestionably induced and willfully caused [the deputy] to fire his handgun.\u201d 203 F.3d at 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The weight of these authorities indicates that, even if the firearm in this case was not discharged by Henderson, the district court did not err in finding that the enhancement for discharge of a firearm applies because Henderson induced the struggle during which the shotgun was discharged, or at the very least, could reasonably foresee that the gun might be discharged during the home invasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
