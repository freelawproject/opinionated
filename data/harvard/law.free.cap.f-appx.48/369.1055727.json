Her initial request for Social Security benefits was denied on February 6, 1990, and Jones did not appeal. Jones then fractured her right ankle on January 30, 1994. On December 24, 1996, Jones again applied for Social Security benefits, contending she had been unable to work since her left ankle fracture in 1987. She claims her left ankle swells after several minutes of standing and that she suffers intolerable back pain, prohibiting her from lifting or carrying. Jones\u2019s medical expert testified Jones has degenerative arthritic conditions in her left ankle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Jones\u2019s 1996 application for benefits was denied initially and upon reconsideration. The administrative law judge found Jones met the required twenty quarters of insurance coverage in 1991 but concluded Jones had not introduced sufficient evidence to establish she was \u201cdisabled\u201d between February 7, 1990 (the date after the denial of her first application) and December 31, 1991 (the last date she was covered by insurance). The Appeals Council denied review. The District Court affirmed the order and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Social Security regulations provide a five-step procedure for evaluating disability claims. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court found Jones was not \u201cdisabled\u201d between February 7, 1990 and December 31, 1991. Therefore, she did not clear the second of the five requirements \u2014 proving she has a \u201csevere impairment\u201d disabling her while she met the status requirements. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.130, 404.315.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At issue is whether the administrative record contains substantial evidence for the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings, which were affirmed. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Schaudeck v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>181 F.3d 429, 431 (3d Cir.1999) (citations omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d constitutes \u201c[s]uch relevant evidence as a reasoning mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 704 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">The parties agree Jones last met the status requirements on December 31, 1991. To recover benefits, Jones was required to have a severe \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d demonstrable by clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d). Subjective symptoms, without more, cannot ordinarily result in a disability finding. Jones contends her left ankle fracture remained debilitating enough to qualify under Listing 1.03A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But Jones failed to produce a single medical record from the relevant time period, February 7, 1990 to December 31, 1991. Additionally, the administrative law judge found Dr. Scott\u2019s treatment notes from January 8, 1990 demonstrated Jones\u2019s left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ankle had a good range of motion and acceptable motor strength. Jones did not receive further treatment from Dr. Scott until January 30, 1994, after she fractured her right ankle and more than two years after her last date insured. Nor is there evidence Jones sought treatment from another health provider in the interim. In sum, Jones did not demonstrate she suffered a \u201csevere impairment\u201d from February 7, 1990 to December 31, 1991, the critical period for her claim. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Jones contends the administrative law judge recognized the \u201cseverity\u201d of her impairment, which should have satisfied the \u201cstep two\u201d requirement. But the administrative law judge properly situated the available medical evidence within the dates of Jones\u2019s insurance coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">Although it appears that the fracture of [Jones\u2019s] left ankle took more than a year to heal, a delay which might have provided a basis for a successful appeal of her prior application, as of September of 1989, her treating physician noted that the x-rays showed excellent healing of her fracture.... Indeed, there are no treatment notes or other medical findings after her fracture healed and prior to 1991 that would indicate that the severity of her current complaints with respect to her left ankle pre-existed the date last insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Therefore, considering the third, fourth, and fifth steps along the sequential chain was unnecessary. The administrative law judge met its responsibilities under <em>Cotter. See </em>642 F.2d at 705 (\u201cWe need from the ALJ not only an expression of the evidence s/he considered which supports the result, but also some indication of the evidence which was rejected.\u201d). Jones\u2019s left ankle may well have constituted a \u201csevere impairment\u201d during a prior period, but the administrative law judge could only consider the time period beginning February 7, 1990. After that date, substantial evidence suggests Jones did not have a \u201csevere impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">Jones also contends both the District Court and the administrative law judge failed to explain why they did not accept Dr. Mylod\u2019s 1998 testimony, which purportedly established Jones\u2019s impairment at the 1.03A level before December 1991.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But as the District Court noted, Listing 1.03A normally covers the hips and knees, not the ankles. Dr. Mylod\u2019s opinion that an ankle is a similar \u201cweight-bearing joint\u201d was insufficient. The specific impairment must be included on the list with the required severity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1525(c). Listing 1.03A makes no reference to ankles. Additionally, as noted, Dr. Scott\u2019s notes from January 8, 1990 indicate Jones\u2019s left ankle had a good range of motion. Listing 1.03A requires \u201cpersistent joint pain\u201d and \u201csigns of marked limitation of motion or abnormal motion.\u201d Therefore, a finding that Jones suffered from a 1.03A impairment was precluded. We see no error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">Finally, Jones contends the administrative law judge wrongly failed to consider the testimony of Dr. S. Tsai, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Commissioner\u2019s psychiatrist. But Dr. Tsai made his report on January 24, 1990, before the denial of Jones\u2019s first application for benefits. It predated the February 6, 1990 notice on Jones\u2019s first claim. Therefore, the administrative law judge could determine Dr. Tsai\u2019s report was part of the previous record and could not be considered with reference to her second application for benefits. On both the latter two issues, the administrative law judge acknowledged possibly conflicting evidence but nonetheless determined Jones did not suffer from a \u201csevere impairment\u201d during the relevant period. That determination was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">For the foregoing reasons we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\">. The expert, Dr. Albert G. Mylod, a board certified physician, testified that Jones has a trimalleolar left ankle fracture and a bimalleolar right ankle fracture. Dr. Mylod relied on treatment notes made by Jones\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Wendell Scott. Additionally, two psychiatrist-experts retained by the Commissioner diagnosed Jones with dysthmic disorder but concluded she was not \"disabled\u201d under the act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\">. The Commissioner first determines if the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)-(b). By all accounts, Jones is not. Therefore, proceeding to the second step, the Commissioner considers whether the claimant has a \"severe impairment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 414.1520(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b424-14\">. Under the Social Security Act, \u201cdisability\u201d is the \"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). An individual \"shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 423(d)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b424-15\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404 subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 1.03A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\">. Evidence of an impairment reaching disabling severity after the expiration of an individual\u2019s insured status cannot form the basis of a disability determination, even if the impairment existed before the insured status expired. <em>Kane v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 1130, 1131 n.1 (3d Cir. 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b425-13\">. We reject Jones\u2019s contentions that the administrative law judge intentionally omitted the medical specialty and \"expert status\u201d accorded Dr. Mylod on the basis of animus and that the administrative law judge had no competent understanding of applicable law and regulations. Read fairly, the record allows no such interpretations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
