ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">Petitioner Fred Barber seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) from this court in order to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief in his motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We deny Mr. Barber\u2019s application and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-17\">To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Barber must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u2018Where a district court has rejected the constitutional claims on the merits, the showing required to satisfy \u00a7 2253(c) is straightforward: The petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-18\">In 1988, Mr. Barber pled guilty in state court to possession of a controlled substance. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment and three years mandatory parole pursuant to the sentencing provisions contained in Colo.Rev.Stat. 18-1-105(1)(a)(V). These provisions contain sentencing ranges for various classes of offenses. The class in question here applies, <em>inter alia, </em>to drug-related convictions and convictions relating to sex offenses. Mr. Barber did not appeal, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>pursued state post-conviction proceedings which were rejected on the merits. The gist of his argument in the state courts and, subsequently, in his federal petition for habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, is that those convicted of sex offenses have not been receiving mandatory parole, allegedly in violation of the statute, while drug offenders are still subject to mandatory parole. He contends that this disparate treatment violates his rights under the Equal Protection Clause. The state district court, relying exclusively on state court cases, held that there was no equal protection violation. The federal district court, citing <em>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </em>473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985) (equal protection violation occurs when government treats one person differently from another who is similarly situated) and <em>Penrod v. Zavaras, </em>94 F.3d 1399, 1406 (10th Cir.1996) (same), agreed. Mr. Barber seeks a COA with respect to the latter decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Colorado appellate court decisions explain the state\u2019s position with respect to sentencing ranges under Colo Rev. Stat. \u00a7 18-1-105 as follows: The statute \u201ccreates penalty ranges for classes of offenses and does not create classes of offenders.\u201d <em>State v. Friesen, </em>45 P.3d 784, 785 (Colo.Ct. App.2001), <em>cert, denied, </em>(Colo. Apr. 29, 2002), <em>cf. Lustgarden v. Gunter, </em>966 F.2d 552, 555 (10th Cir.1992) (holding that sex offenders are not members of a suspect classification and decision to <em>deny </em>sex offender mandatory parole does not violate equal protection as statute bears rational relationship to legitimate state interest of monitoring sex offenders\u2019 reintroduction into society).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Under this reasoning, Mr. Barber is not similarly situated to sex offenders. He \u201cis only \u2018similarly situated\u2019 with defendants who commit the same or similar acts.\u201d <em>Friesen </em>at 785. Thus, there is no equal protection violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">As the federal district court pointed out, this same reasoning is in accord with cases decided by the Supreme Court. Even if Mr. Barber is regarded as a class of one (although he proposes a rule applicable to all similarly situated drug offenders), he has at no point in his voluminous submissions established that there is \u201cno rational basis for the difference in treatment,\u201d <em>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000), between convicted drug offenders and convicted sex offenders under the sentencing scheme in Colorado.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Mr. Barber\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED. For the reasons stated above, we conclude that Mr. Barber has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Accordingly, his application for a certificate of appealability is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-5\">. It is by no means self evident that Colorado intended or has in fact treated sex offenders more lightly than drug offenders, as a general proposition, when length of detention versus detention followed by parole is taken into account, along with other considerations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
