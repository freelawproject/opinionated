We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Hope v. EMSA Correctional Care, </em>No. CA-01-334-3-2-MU (W.D.N.C. filed July 10 <em>&amp; </em>July 11, 2001; entered July 12, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
