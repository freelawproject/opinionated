The court sentenced him to 105 months in prison. Beatty appeals, contending that he is entitled to a new trial based on a flawed supplemental jury instruction and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Finding no merit to his claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Beatty argues that the district court confused the jury by using an erroneous example when it gave a supplemental jury instruction on constructive possession. However, the court instructed the jury to disregard the example and the jury is presumed to have followed the judge\u2019s curative instruction. <em>Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 768 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987). Beatty also contends that the supplemental jury instruction was disjointed and the judge\u2019s remarks about the difficulty of defining constructive possession further confused the jury. In the context of the record as a whole, any error concerning the constructive possession instruction was not prejudicial because, as discussed below, we find that the record supported a finding that Beatty had actual possession of a firearm. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>121 F.3d 908, 923 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. United Med. &amp; Surgical Supply Corp., </em>989 F.2d 1390, 1406-07 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">We disagree with Beatty\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. To support a \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction, the government must prove that: (1) the defendant previously was convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year; (2) the defendant knowingly possessed the firearm; and (3) the possession affected interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Langley, </em>62 F.3d 602, 606 (4th Cir.1995) (en banc). The parties stipulated to Beatty\u2019s prior felony conviction and the commerce element. Furthermore, the evidence was sufficient to show that Beatty had actual possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">A witness saw a man with a gun in a car and a few minutes later identified Beatty to police as that man. Although the witness was unable to identify Beatty in court, and there were minor inconsistencies between the witness\u2019s and a police officer\u2019s in-court description of Beatty on the night of the incident, the witness testified that he was certain that the man he identified the night of the incident (Beatty) was the same man he had seen with a gun minutes earlier. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we find the evidence sufficient to support Beatty\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">For these reasons, we affirm Beatty\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
