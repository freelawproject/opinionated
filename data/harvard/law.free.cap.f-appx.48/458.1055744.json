The magistrate judge accepted his guilty plea on March 15, 2001. On October 18, 2001, Graham filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Graham challenges the district court\u2019s decision to deny his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing that he had made his motion prior to the acceptance of the guilty plea in the district court. However, Graham\u2019s guilty plea had been accepted by the magistrate judge following a complete Rule 11 inquiry as well as a clear waiver of his right to have his plea taken by the district court. A magistrate judge may accept pleas in felony cases, provided the defendant consents, and as long as the district court exercises de novo review of the magistrate judge\u2019s decision. <em>See United States v. Reyna-Tapia, </em>294 F.3d 1192, 1200-01 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. </em>Torres, 258 F.3d 791, 794-95 (8th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. Dees, </em>125 F.3d 261 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Ciapponi, </em>77 F.3d 1247 (10th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>23 F.3d 629, 634 (2d Cir.1994). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Graham\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">Graham also argues that the district court abused its discretion in finding a factual basis for Graham\u2019s guilty plea. Testimony presented sufficiently shows that Graham intended to enter into a conspiracy for the purpose of robbing a home in order to obtain a large quantity of cocaine. The amount of cocaine was sufficient to establish intent to distribute. <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>912 F.2d 728, 730 (4th Cir.1990). Although Graham later denied his involvement, credibility determinations are within the sole province of the factfinder. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding a sufficient factual basis for Graham\u2019s plea. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 652 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">We therefore affirm Graham\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
