We review for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Lefler, </em>880 F.2d 233, 235 (9th Cir.1989), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Bounsall requests total access to his legal materials for the purpose of filing a second or successive section 2255 motion to attack his conviction and sentence. Because Bounsall failed to show that his restriction from his legal materials resulted in actual injury, see, <em>e.g., Sands v. Lewis, </em>886 F.2d 1166 (9th Cir.1989), the district court did not err in denying his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">To the extent that Bounsall now seeks to file an application for authorization of a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, that request is denied without prejudice to filing an application that complies with the requirements of Ninth Circuit Rule 22-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">If Bounsall elects to file an application in this court for authorization to file a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, Bounsall must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUS\">(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty of the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-16\">(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-17\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-18\">To the extent that Bounsall\u2019s petition constitutes a request for further relief, that request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-19\">The Clerk shall serve with this order a copy of the unofficial form for a successive petition request.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b702-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-21\">. We will not review the denials of Bounsall's February 28, 2001, petition requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>the district court to enter information into its record or his March 21, 2001, petition requesting the court to un-seal a letter. <em>See United States v. Ullah, </em>976 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir.1992) (stating that matters not raised and argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief are not ordinarily considered).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
