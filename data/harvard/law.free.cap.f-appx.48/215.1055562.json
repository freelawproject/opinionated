Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b269-21\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b269-22\">In November 1979, Edward Hart filed an application for supplemental security income with the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d). When his claim was denied, Hart sought federal court review. A district court ruled in the SSA\u2019s favor on April 21, 1983. All motions to reconsider were denied, and Hart did not appeal the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-23\">Undeterred, though, Hart continued to pursue his claim through additional applications and requests for review. On November 21, 1988, an Administrative Law Judge from the SSA\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals found that Hart had indeed been under a disability since mid-1977. Hart, however, disputed the calculation of benefits, and asked the SSA\u2019s Appeals Council to review the decision. On September 6, 1990, the Appeals Council revised the benefit determination, but not to the degree that Hart had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-24\">More than ten years later, Hart filed in district court a document entitled \u201cCon-temp [sic] &amp; Obstruction of Justice Charges,\u201d which, despite its label, sought review of the 1990 Appeals Council decision. According to Hart, the 1990 decision conflicted with the federal court\u2019s 1983 ruling. The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Hart\u2019s submission, citing the eighteen years that had passed since the federal case had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>closed. Hart asks us to review this district court ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The district court\u2019s conclusion was correct. Jurisdiction to review a final decision of the SSA arises under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) and 1383(c)(3), which provide that an action shall commence \u201cwithin sixty days after the mailing ... of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Commissioner of Social Security may allow.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Over a decade has passed since the Appeals Council issued its decision, and no administrative extension has been alleged. The district court properly dismissed Hart\u2019s claim for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We wish to make one final observation. Hart has pursued this appeal on what appears to be his misunderstanding that the district court\u2019s 1983 ruling, adopting the recommendations of a United States Magistrate Judge, was somehow in his favor. It was not. Hart seems to have misread the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report, which concluded that \u201c[i]n the instant case it cannot be said that, upon consideration of the record as a whole, the final decision of the Secretary is not supported by some evidence.\u201d This sentence simply means that the Secretary\u2019s final decision <em>was </em>supported by some evidence. And although the Magistrate Judge noted that \u201cthe Secretary failed to make a specific finding that Plaintiff cannot return to his past relevant work,\u201d he considered this to be a \u201cmere oversight\u201d that did not affect the judgment. Hart\u2019s reliance on the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report therefore strikes us as misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
