The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b848-16\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed March 15, 2002, be affirmed. The district court correctly determined that appellant failed to state a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) based on the government\u2019s failure to investigate his allegations against judges and clerk\u2019s offices of other courts. The Attorney General\u2019s decision to investigate complaints involving government officers or employees is discretionary rather than mandatory. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 535(a). Such discretionary authority is presumptively unreviewable by the courts. <em>See Shoshone-Bannock Tribes v. Reno, </em>56 F.3d 1476, 1481 (D.C.Cir.1995) <em>(citing Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 832, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1984) (\u201cagency refusals to institute investigative or enforcement proceedings\u201d are presumed immune from judicial review)).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">Appellant fails to effectively challenge the district court\u2019s additional determination that he did not timely exhaust his administrative remedies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). <em>See Neil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993) (FTCA requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before suit may be filed). Appellant\u2019s argument that he filed a claim with the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and that office refused to transfer his claim to the appropriate agency for review does not excuse him from complying with the exhaustion requirements because appellant was responsible for filing his claim with the appropriate administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-19\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
