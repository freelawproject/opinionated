He was tried and convicted of violating 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.15, and ordered to pay a special assessment of $10.00 and restitution of $5.00. On appeal, he challenges USFS\u2019s authority to charge a recreational fee on numerous grounds. We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm, but remand for the limited purpose of amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>ing Dahl\u2019s judgment of conviction to reflect that his conviction is for an Infraction, and not a Class B Misdemeanor. The parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of the case, and therefore we will not detail them here except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Dahl first argues that USFS\u2019s decision to designate all four National Forests in Southern California \u201cas one area for purposes of implementing its program\u201d \u201cappears contrary on its face to Congressional intent.\u201d However, Dahl provides no support for the fact that all four Southern California forests are not one \u201carea,\u201d or why, if they are not, this is contrary to the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Dahl next contends that there is a conflict between the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program, Pub. L. No. 104-134, \u00a7 315, 110 Stat. 1321, 200-02 (codified as amended as a note to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460l-6a (1996)), and 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460Z-6a. We see no conflict. The Program expressly provides for the collection of fees \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 315(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Dahl argues that areas chosen for the Program were not designated pursuant to the substantive selection criteria in \u00a7 460l-6a. There is no evidence, though, that Congress intended the area selection requirements of 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460l-6a(a) to apply to Fee Demonstration areas under the Program. Dahl also argues that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language of \u00a7 315(b) impermissibly creates an implied repeal or amendment of \u00a7 460l-6a. However, we read the language allowing the USFS to collect fees under the Program \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law,\u201d <em>id., </em>to mean just what it says \u2014 that the fee collection guidelines that follow are not subject to the constraints of other laws, including those of \u00a7 460U6a. Lastly, Dahl argues that he cannot be prosecuted for violation of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.15, because this regulation was enacted pursuant to \u00a7 460Z-6a, and the Program is not bound by \u00a7 460l-6a\u2019s temas. Section 261.15 sets forth a penalty for \u201c[flailing to pay any fee\u201d and is applicable to Dahl\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Dahl raises two additional arguments addressing improper delegation and vagueness. First, he asserts that Congress provided the USFS with no guidelines and entrusted it with too much discretion, especially in light of the Program\u2019s ban on rulemaking. \u00a7 315(e). In light of the detailed language governing how the Program is to operate, we find clear principles set forth to guide the USFS and no impermissible delegation of power. <em>See Whitman v. American Trucking Assocs., </em>531 U.S. 457, 472-76, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001) (noting that Congress delegates constitutionally when it \u201clay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.\u201d) (quoting <em>J.W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 394, 409, 48 S.Ct. 348, 72 L.Ed. 624 (1928)).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Second, Dahl argues that his conviction is invalid because the term \u201crecreation\u201d is unconstitutionally vague. We disagree. The term \u201crecreation,\u201d especially as applied to mountain biking, is by no means \u201cso vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to\u201d what is prohibited. <em>City of Chicago v. Morales, </em>527 U.S. 41, 56, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 144 L.Ed.2d 67 (1999) (quoting <em>Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, </em>382 U.S. 399, 402-403, 86 S.Ct. 518, 15 L.Ed.2d 447 (1966)). It therefore does not offend due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Dahl raises one final argument which has merit. He contends that he cannot be convicted of a class B Misdemeanor. We agree. Dahl was convicted under 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.15. The regulation\u2019s enabling statute, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460l-6a(e), specifies that \u201cviolations of the rules and regulations issued under this subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $100.\u201d Consistent with the enabling statute, Section 261.15 imposes a $100 fine. Legislative history cited by the government only reflects Congressional intent to authorize fines, not incarceration. An offense for which no imprisonment is authorized is classified as an Infraction. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(9). Consequently, Dahl is correct that he could only be convicted of an Infraction, and not a Class B Misdemeanor. We therefore remand for the limited purpose of directing the district court to amend the judgment to reflect a conviction for an Infraction, and not a Class B Misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b743-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
