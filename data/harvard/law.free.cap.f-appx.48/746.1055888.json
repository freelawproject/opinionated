We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-16\">Hill was indefinitely suspended and subsequently removed from his position as a correctional officer at the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. He filed a grievance and the matter was sent to arbitration. The arbitrator found for the government and we ultimately affirmed that decision. <em>Hill v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>215 F.3d 1348 (Fed.Cir.1999) (Table). Hill then appealed his discharge to the Merit Systems Protection Board which dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">We review the board\u2019s decision regarding its own jurisdiction <em>de novo. King v. Briggs, </em>83 F.3d 1384, 1387 (Fed.Cir.1996). The petitioner bears the burden of estabr lishing the board\u2019s jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2) (2002); <em>Clark v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number><em>States Postal Serv., </em>989 F.2d 1164, 1167 (Fed.Cir.1993). Our review is limited to setting aside any action that is: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000). <em>See Yates v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>145 F.3d 1480, 1483 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(g), an employee who is subject to a collective bargaining agreement may file a grievance or a petition with the board, but not both. Hill filed a grievance; therefore, the board does not have jurisdiction to hear his subsequent appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
