Shea, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Cornelia was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to import MDMA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for a new trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, the denial of her Jenck\u2019s Act motion, and the district court\u2019s decision not to give jury instructions proposed by Cornelia.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b686-16\">Cornelia asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, telling the jury that Cornelia refused a government agent\u2019s request for consent to search an apartment she shared with co-defendant Jamie Rhines (\u201cRhines\u201d), and the prosecutor\u2019s statement to the defense attorney in the jury\u2019s presence that Cornelia should \u201cplead\u201d constituted prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-17\">Reversal of a conviction is required only if the alleged prosecutorial misconduct actually deprived Cornelia of a fair trial. <em>United States v. Yarbrough, </em>852 F.2d 1522, 1539 (9th Cir.1988). Any prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement that Cornelia refused to give government agents consent to search the apartment was neutralized by the court\u2019s curative instructions. <em>See United States v. Crenshaw, </em>698 F.2d 1060, 1063 (9th Cir.1983). Similarly, any prejudice was rendered harmless by the other \u201csubstantial independent and credible evidence\u201d of Cornelia\u2019s guilt. <em>United States v. Scholl, </em>166 F.3d 964, 974 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-18\">The prosecutor\u2019s statement that Cornelia should \u201cplead\u201d \u201csuggests that information not presented to the jury supports the [government\u2019s] witness\u2019s testimony\u201d that Cornelia was guilty. <em>United States v. Sarkisian, </em>197 F.3d 966, 989 (9th Cir.1999) (citations omitted). However, the overwhelming evidence of <em>Cornelia\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>guilt in the record negates any probability that the comment affected the fairness of the trial and the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. If the prosecutor engaged in any misconduct in making the comment that Cornelia should \u201cplead,\u201d it was harmless. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Cornelia\u2019s motion for mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We review the admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ammbula-Ruiz, 987 </em>F.2d 599, 602 (9th Cir.1993). The district court\u2019s admission of the testimony is reviewed for \u201cplain error\u201d where a party faded to make a specific objection or made the wrong specific objection. <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>43 F.3d 1291, 1295 (9th Cir.1995). A \u201cplain error is a highly prejudicial error affecting substantial rights, and is found only in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Cornelia asserts that the court erred in allowing a customs inspector to express his opinion of Cornelia\u2019s credibility. Because Cornelia objected to the testimony on the basis of relevance and not as improper opinion evidence, we review for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Given Cornelia\u2019s admission that she \u201clied\u201d and her attorney\u2019s acknowledgment that she lied to protect her boyfriend, any error that resulted when the district court admitted the inspector\u2019s testimony was harmless. The inspector\u2019s characterization of Cornelia\u2019s response to his question was a reasonable interpretation, considering the information he was given before he questioned her, and is supported by Cornelia\u2019s admission that she lied. Additionally, the testimony was given in the context of explaining why the investigator decided to question Cornelia further. No plain <em>error </em>occurred in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Jencks Act</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">Cornelia challenges the district court\u2019s ruling allowing the government to produce redacted reports of witness statements, arguing that the Jencks Act required the production of unredacted reports. However, Cornelia presented no concrete evidence of which she was deprived as a result of the redaction. Absent such a showing, she cannot establish a Jencks Act violation. <em>See United States v. Henke, </em>222 F.3d 633, 642 (9th Cir.2000). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cornelia\u2019s request for unredacted reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">Cornelia\u2019s proposed jury instruction number 5 required the jury to determine whether the proof established \u201ca single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies.\u201d Cornelia\u2019s proposed instruction number 2 required the jury to decide whether the conspiracy charged in the indictment existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">The district court denied Cornelia\u2019s motion for a multiple conspiracy jury instruction, ruling that there was no evidence to support Cornelia\u2019s multiple conspiracy theory in light of evidence establishing a single conspiracy. Given the \u201csubstantial latitude\u201d accorded the district court, its instructions \u201cfairly and adequately covered the issues presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Bauer, </em>84 F.3d 1549, 1560 (9th Cir.1996) (as amended) (citation omitted). The district court\u2019s jury instructions as a whole adequately covered Cornelia\u2019s multiple conspiracy theory. <em>Id. </em>at 1561.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">Based on the foregoing, Cornelia\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b686-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-20\">.
