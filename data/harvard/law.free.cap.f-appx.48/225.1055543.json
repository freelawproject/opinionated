After careful review of the record, <em>see Haley v. Massanari, </em>258 F.3d 742, 747 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review for reviewing findings of an administrative law judge regarding denial of Social Security disability benefits), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-21\">In his September 1998 applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income, Eason alleged disability since December 1996 caused by back and neck pain, leg problems and muscle weakness. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found that Eason could not perform his past relevant work, but that he could perform jobs a vocational expert (VE) identified in response to a hypothetical the ALJ posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-22\">We reject Eason\u2019s challenge to the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the VE\u2019s opinion as to Eason\u2019s ability to perform certain jobs. The VE\u2019s opinion was consistent with the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>(DOT) descriptions of the identified jobs, and with the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, which included functional illiteracy. <em>See Wheeler v. Apfel, </em>224 F.3d 891, 896-97 (8th Cir.2000) (ALJ properly relied on VE\u2019s testimony where VE responded to hypothetical that included all of claimant\u2019s restrictions; DOT definitions are merely generic job descriptions that approximate maximum requirements for each position, and DOT cautions that descriptions may not coincide in every respect with content of jobs as performed in specific establishments or localities). We also reject Eason\u2019s challenge to the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings, as the ALJ gave multiple valid reasons for discrediting Eason. <em>See Haggard v. Apfel, </em>175 F.3d 591, 594 (8th Cir.1999). The remaining arguments Eason raises provide no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir.
