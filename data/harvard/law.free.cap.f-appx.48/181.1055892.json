For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">In 2000, in Frankfort, Kentucky, Police Officer Charles Adams was sitting in his cruiser, parked near the R &amp; C Sports Bar. At approximately 2:00 a.m., Adams heard a car \u201crev up\u201d and saw it \u201ctake off at a high rate of speed or rapidly for the ... parking lot conditions, with people and other cars around.\u201d Kentucky law provides that \u201c[n]o person shall start a vehicle that is stopped or parked unless and until the movement can be made with reasonable safety.\u201d Ky. Rev. St. \u00a7 189.440. Adams stopped the car, driven by Clark, as it turned onto Highway 27. Adams administered a portable breath test on Clark, which registered below the legal limit for alcohol intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">However, an administrative check of Clark\u2019s operators\u2019 license revealed that it was suspended. Adams arrested Clark for driving on a suspended license, placed him in the back of the cruiser, and proceeded to search his vehicle. The search yielded a quantity of crack cocaine under the ashtray in the console between the two front seats.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">Clark was indicted for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. Clark moved to suppress the evidence obtained from his vehicle. The district court held a suppression hearing, at which Loren Wells, a State Alcohol and Beverage Control agent, testified that on the date of the arrest he had heard \u201ctires screaming\u201d and observed a car pulling out from the area. Wells further testified that he left the parking lot and prepared to stop the car, but Adams did so before he could. Clark testified that he had not gunned his engine, squealed his tires, or driven fast, and he presented two witnesses who stated that they did not see him do anything improper. The district court denied Clark\u2019s motion to suppress, and he entered a conditional guilty plea to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, this court must uphold the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>195 F.3d 258, 264 (6th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>The appellate court reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Wellman, </em>185 F.3d 651, 655 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-17\">Lawfulness of the Initial Traffic Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b236-18\">An officer is permitted to stop a vehicle if he has probable cause to believe a traffic violation is occurring or has occurred. <em>United States v. Ferguson, </em>8 F.3d 385, 391 (6th Cir.1993). Clark contends that the initial traffic stop of his vehicle was unsup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ported by probable cause. Specifically, he challenges Adams\u2019s stated purpose for the stop, which was to cite him for an improper start in violation of Ky. Rev. St. \u00a7 189.440, and asserts that contradictions in the officer\u2019s testimony undermine its credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">A review of the record does not reveal any material contradictions in Adams\u2019s testimony. Even if there were, it is up to the trial court to determine the credibility of the witnesses. Although Adams did not see Clark pull out of a parking spot, he did see him start from a stopped position. Ky. Rev. St. \u00a7 189.440 is broad enough to encompass this situation. <em>See Lewis v. Walters, </em>341 S.W.2d 67, 69 (Ky.1960). Thus, Adams recounted the circumstances justifying the stop with sufficient particularity to sustain a finding of probable cause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither of the witnesses Clark touts as confirming his version of events actually saw him leave the parking lot. Moreover, while there is an apparent contradiction between the testimony of Wells and Adams as to whether Clark\u2019s tires squealed, the court does not deem this material, as Adams\u2019s observations are sufficient to establish a violation of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court credited Adams\u2019s testimony, and it is well-settled that \u201c[t]he appellate courts generally do not review the district court\u2019s determinations regarding witness credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Gesso, 57 F.3d 493, 496 (6th Cir.1995). The findings of the district court were not clearly erroneous. Thus, the initial traffic stop of Clark\u2019s car was lawful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Lawfulness of the Vehicle Search</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">\u201c[W]hen a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u201d <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981). Such a search may extend to \u201canything in the area which is, or was, within the \u2018immediate control\u2019 of the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Hatfield, </em>815 F.2d 1068, 1071 (6th Cir.1987). Clark contends that even if the initial stop of his vehicle was justified, the subsequent search did not meet the \u201csearch incident to arrest\u201d exception to the warrant requirement because he was arrested outside the vehicle and could not have gotten back into it to obtain a weapon or destroy evidence. This argument is without merit. The cocaine was found under the ashtray in the passenger compartment, an area which was within Clark\u2019s immediate control when the stop occurred, as he was then operating the vehicle. <em>See id. </em>Further, the district court was correct in finding that this court has already rejected Clark\u2019s argument regarding his removal from his vehicle. <em>See United States v. Hudgins, </em>52 F.3d 115, 119 (6th Cir. 1995). While Clark advocates the substitution of a case-by-case analysis for the <em>Belton </em>\u201cbright-line\u201d rule, and asserts indications of the Supreme Court\u2019s willingness to resolve the split among the Circuits on this issue, his arguments are better ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>dressed to that Court, as \u201cwe have not wavered in our adherence to this rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>993 F.2d 121, 123 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-6\">. <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>2000 WL 64972, No. 98-6415, 2000 U.S.App. LEXIS 570 (6th Cir. Jan. 12, 2000), is distinguishable in that the officer in that case was unable to cite to any state law or ordinance making the defendant's alleged conduct illegal; here, there is such a statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-12\">. In light of this conclusion, there is no need to consider the government\u2019s argument that Adams could have arrested Clark for driving under the influence or for reckless driving.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b237-13\">. Clark\u2019s assertion that he was the victim of racial profiling in violation of the Equal Protection Clause is unsupported and undeveloped.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
