At sentencing, the district court determined the quantity of drugs attributable to Padilla and sentenced him to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. Padilla\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed by this court on direct appeal. Padilla then filed his first motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied by the district court, and the denial was affirmed by this court. After the Supreme Court decided <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Padilla requested and received permission from this court to file a successive motion raising an <em>Apprendi </em>claim. Padilla then filed the present successive motion, which was granted by the district court on April 17, 2001. The government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-16\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255 and 2244, a successive motion must be dismissed unless it is based on newly discovered evidence demonstrating the petitioner\u2019s innocence, or \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court concluded that <em>Apprendi </em>announced a \u201cnew rule\u201d that has been \u201cmade retroactive\u201d by the Supreme Court. Relying on <em>Flowers v. Walter, </em>239 F.3d 1096 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam), the district court interpreted the phrase \u201cmade retroactive ... by the Supreme Court\u201d broadly to allow retroactive application of new rules under the standard announced in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). Accordingly, the district court conducted <em>Teague </em>analysis and concluded that <em>Apprendi </em>applied retroactively to Padilla\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-17\">After the district court issued its decision, however, the Supreme Court decided <em>Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 121 S.Ct. 2478, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001), in which the Court held that the phrase \u201cmade retroactive ... by the Supreme Court\u201d means the Supreme Court must have explicitly held that the right applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 662, 121 S.Ct. 2478. In response to <em>Tyler, </em>the <em>Flowers </em>opinion was withdrawn, 267 F.3d 1167 (9th Cir.2001), and replaced with an unpublished disposition affirming dismissal of the successive motion. 24 Fed.Appx. 658 (9th Cir.2001). Thus, it is now clear that a new rule of constitutional law has not been \u201cmade retroactive\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 2255 and 2244 unless the Supreme Court has explicitly held that the rule applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See Rees v. Hill, </em>286 F.3d 1103, 1104 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">As the Supreme Court has never held <em>Apprendi </em>retroactive, Padilla should not have been permitted to bring a successive motion raising an <em>Apprendi </em>claim. Moreover, even if this court could reach the merits of Padilla\u2019s appeal, Padilla would not be entitled to relief, because we recently held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Cervantes, </em>282 F.3d 664 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order granting Padilla\u2019s successive motion is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b308-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
