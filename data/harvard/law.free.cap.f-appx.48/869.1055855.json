We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. The district court\u2019s final order dispensing with the \u00a7 2241 petition is affirmed on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Pruess, </em>No. CR-94-19 (W.D.N.C. Nov. 13, 2002). We note that although Pruess\u2019s post-judgment motion tolled the running of the period in which to file a timely notice of appeal, see Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A), the motion did not entitled Pruess to relief whether considered on its merits, or construed as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), motion. We therefore affirm the denial of Pruess\u2019s motion substantially on the reasoning of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
