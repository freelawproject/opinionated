Graham, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">Dennis D. McLain, proceeding pro se, appeals a district court judgment denying his motion for the reduction of his sentence filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">In 1996, a jury convicted McLain of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, theft of a pension fund in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 664, money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, and conspiracy to commit each of these offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. He was sentenced to a total of 97 months of imprisonment. A panel of this court affirmed McLain\u2019s convictions and sentence on appeal. <em>See United States v. Smigiel, </em>Nos. 97-1571, 1999 WL 196575 (6th Cir. Mar.29, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">In his motion for reduction of sentence, McLain argued that his sentence should be reduced pursuant to Amendment 634 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which took effect in November 2001. Amendment 634 created a new method for determining the base offense level in money laundering cases. Upon review, the district court concluded that the amendment was not retroactive, and that the amendment was \u201csubstantive,\u201d not merely \u201cclarifying.\u201d Hence, the court denied McLain\u2019s motion for a reduction of his sentence. McLain has filed a timely appeal, essentially reasserting his argument that he is entitled to a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly denied McLain\u2019s motion for a reduction of his sentence. This court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion filed under \u00a7 3582 for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Ursery, </em>109 F.3d 1129, 1137 (6th Cir.1997). Here, Amendment 634 is not on the list of amendments found at USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c) which are to be given retroactive effect. This court has held that an amendment specifically listed in USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c) has retroactive effect, while amendments not listed are not to be applied retroactively. <em>United States v. Dullen, </em>15 F.3d 68, 70-71 (6th Cir.1994). Other circuits have likewise concluded that an amendment not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(e) cannot be applied retroactively. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>70 F.3d 279, 281 (3d Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>40 F.3d 349, 354 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>1994); <em>United States v. Cueto, </em>9 F.Sd 1488, 1440-41 (9th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Avila, </em>997 F.2d 767, 768 (10th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Dowty, </em>996 F.2d 937, 938-39 (8th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>989 F.2d 583, 587-88 (2d Cir.1993); <em>but see United States v. Gross, </em>26 F.3d 552, 554-55 (5th Cir.1994) (court concluded that it could consider Amendment 500 because it clarified the guideline, as opposed to making a substantive change). Under the controlling case law, Amendment 634 may not be applied retroactively to McLain\u2019s case, because it is not contained on the \u00a7 1B1.10(c) list of amendments that are to be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">The district court also properly rejected McLain\u2019s argument that Amendment 634 could be applied retroactively because it was merely a \u201cclarifying\u201d amendment. Although this court does not appear to have ruled on this matter, several circuits have concluded that Amendment 634 effects a substantive change to the guidelines. <em>United States v. Descent, </em>292 F.3d 703, 708-09 (11th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. King, 280 </em>F.3d 886, 891 (8th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. McIntosh, </em>280 F.3d 479, 485 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Sabbeth, </em>277 F.3d 94, 96-99 (2d Cir.2002). Hence, the amendment cannot be applied to McLain\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
