R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Petitioner-Appellant Tomi Edward Jennings appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In order to proceed on appeal, Jennings must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) from this court. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). Upon consideration, we deny COA and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Jennings was convicted of escape from detention and received a six-to-nine year sentence. His conviction was affirmed by the Wyoming Supreme Court. In his appellate brief, which we construe as an application for a COA, he raises seven issues: (1) denial of access to legal materials and the right to self-representation; (2) lack of adequate notice of motion hearings; (3) improper exclusion of African-Americans from his jury; (4) denial of speedy trial; (5) denial of credit for time served; (6) improper alteration of trial transcripts; and (7) double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The Wyoming Supreme Court has already considered and decided each of these claims against Jennings. We owe a high level of deference to that court\u2019s decision, even at the COA stage. <em>See Barrientes v. Johnson, </em>221 F.3d 741, 772 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he determination of whether a COA should issue must be made by viewing the petitioner\u2019s arguments through the lens of the deferential scheme laid out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d), <em>cert, dismissed, </em>531 U.S. 1134, 121 S.Ct. 902, 148 L.Ed.2d 948 (2001). We may not grant relief on claims adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">Having carefully reviewed the arguments Jennings raises, we conclude that he has failed to meet the standard required to obtain a COA. Jennings\u2019 application for a COA is therefore DENIED. His appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AesK\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
