We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">We independently review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. <em>In re Vortex Fishing Sys., Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1057, 1064 (9th Cir. 2002). We review for clear error the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303 that the Kunwars\u2019 claims were not subject to a \u201cbona fide dispute,\u201d and that the Kunwars are generally not paying their debts as they come due. <em>Id. </em>at 1069, 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-18\">Contrary to the Kunwars\u2019 contentions, the bankruptcy court did not clearly err by finding that there was no legitimate dispute as to the Kunwars\u2019 liability on the creditors\u2019 breach of fiduciary duty and wage claims. <em>See id. </em>at 1064-65 (stating that \u201ca bankruptcy court is not asked to evaluate the potential outcome of a dispute, but merely to determine whether there are facts that give rise to a legitimate disagreement over whether money is owed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-19\">In determining that the Kunwars were not paying off their debts as they became due, the bankruptcy court relied on evidence of several foreclosures, evidence of unpaid loans, evidence that the Kunwars were running a \u201cshell game,\u201d and the Kunwars own assertions that they were unable to pay their bills. Under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the bankruptcy court did not clearly err by finding that the Kunwars were not paying their debts. <em>See id. </em>at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-20\">Finally, Eastern District of California Bankruptcy Local Rule 9017-1, requiring that direct testimony be presented by written declarations, does not violate due process. <em>See Adiar v. Sunwest Bank (In re Adiar), </em>965 F.2d 777, 780 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-21\">We are unpersuaded by the Kunwars\u2019 remaining contentions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b764-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
