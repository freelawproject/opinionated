Owens appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) denial of disability insurance benefits under Title II and supplemental security income disability insurance benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401 et seq., 1381 et seq. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s order. <em>Johnson v. Shalala, </em>60 F.3d 1428, 1432 (9th Cir.1995). The Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits may be overturned only if \u201cit is not supported by substantial evidence, or ... is based on legal error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">We conclude that substantial evidence does not support the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) finding that Owens\u2019 testimony was not credible. First, Owens\u2019 application for unemployment benefits is not necessarily inconsistent with her claim of disability under the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Substantial evidence also does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Owens\u2019 medication is not indicative of Owens\u2019 limitations. Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s observations at the hearing and Owens\u2019 daily activities do not necessarily support a finding that she is not disabled. <em>See Perminter v. Heckler, </em>765 F.2d 870, 872 (9th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (holding that ALJ may not base adverse credibility finding on his perceptions of claimant\u2019s pain at the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>where record shows objective evidence of claimant\u2019s pain); <em>see also Vertigan v. Halter, </em>260 F.3d 1044, 1049-50 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that claimant\u2019s testimony about her daily activities does not detract from her credibility about pain or being disabled unless the activities consume a substantial part of her day).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We further conclude that the ALJ improperly rejected Dr. Garcia\u2019s opinion. The ALJ incorrectly discredited Owens\u2019 accounts of pain, especially where, as here, the subjective symptoms were relevant to the medical diagnosis. <em>Cf. Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 725-26 (9th Cir.1998) (discussing subjective complaints in context of diagnosis for chronic fatigue syndrome). The record contains no evidence of actual impropriety by Dr. Garcia, see <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 832 (9th Cir.1995), or malingering by Owens. Substantial evidence also does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Dr. Garcia\u2019s diagnoses were inconsistent. The ALJ should have considered Dr. Garcia\u2019s diagnosis of fibromyalgia and his subjective judgment about Owens\u2019 limited ability to work. <em>See id. </em>at 832-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision and remand with instructions to the district court to remand the case to the Commissioner for a determination of Owens\u2019 residual functional capacity and for a determination of whether Owens is disabled and entitled to benefits. On remand, the Commissioner should not evaluate Owens\u2019 prior composite job according to the least demanding function of that job. <em>See Valencia v. Heckler, </em>751 F.2d 1082, 1087 (9th Cir.1985). Furthermore, any hypothetical posed to the vocational expert should include Owens\u2019 complaints of pain and limitations, along with Dr. Garcia\u2019s opinion. <em>See Gallant v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 1450, 1456 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to remand to the Commissioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-11\">. Under the Social Security Act a claimant is disabled if the claimant cannot work on a \"regular and continuing\u201d basis, which means 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1512(a), 404.1545(b); Social Security Ruling 96-8p; <em>see also 20 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 416.210. Under Oregon law, a claimant can receive unemployment benefits even if the claimant is able to work only part-time. <em>See </em>Or. Admin. R. 471-030-0036(2)(b). Therefore, in some circumstances, a person whose impairment allows the person to perform part-time, but not full-time, work can look for part-time work and receive Oregon unemployment compensation benefits while still retaining eligibility for social security benefits. The record in this case is too incomplete for us to conclude that Owens' claims for the two kinds of benefits were factually inconsistent, as the ALJ suggests.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
