The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment filed April 23, 2002, be affirmed. The district court correctly determined that appellant\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 constitutes an attack on the validity of his conviction and sentence, which should be presented to the sentencing court by a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755-56 (6th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Appellant has not demonstrated that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The \u00a7 2255 remedy is not inadequate or ineffective simply because \u00a7 2255 relief has already been denied. <em>See Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 756 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-18\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
