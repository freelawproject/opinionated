Solorio Cajero VERONICA, aka Solorio Veronica; Veronica Cajero Solorio; Solorio Veronica Cajero; Salvador Ramirez, Defendant\u2014Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b334-10\">No. 01-50712.</docketnumber>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"ASy\">D.C.

Because Veronica did not raise this objection in a timely manner before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 52(b); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 465-66, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). No error, let alone plain error, occurred here, as the special verdict form specifically asked the jury to determine drug quantity beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-20\">Veronica asserts that the district court erred in imposing a mandatory minimum life sentence based on Veronica\u2019s prior drug convictions because the prior convictions were not submitted to the jury. Veronica\u2019s argument was expressly rejected in <em>United States v. Parks, </em>285 F.3d 1133, 1142-43 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-21\">Veronica asserts that the district court erred in finding that he was a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. In view of our decision on the mandatory minimum life sentence, this challenge to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-22\">Veronica argues that the district court should have downwardly departed from the sentencing guideline range. \u201cThe district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines is not reviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Eaton, </em>31 F.3d 789, 792-93 (9th Cir.1994). This argument is also moot because of the statutory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">Finally, Veronica asserts that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(B) are facially unconstitutional. This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 562 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
