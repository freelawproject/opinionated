R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b698-16\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">Antonio Lopez appeals his 121-month sentence following his guilty-plea conviction for knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Lopez\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that he finds no meritorious issues for review, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Lopez has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-21\">Counsel and appellant have identified three potential appellate issues. The first issue concerns the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request for various downward departures. In light of the district court\u2019s consideration of the asserted grounds for departure raised at sentencing, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Garcia, </em>927 F.2d 489, 491 (9th Cir.1991) (per curiam) (explaining that, where the district court renders judgment without comment in the face of defendant\u2019s request for departure, we assume that the district court correctly knew and applied the law and realized it had authority to depart, but concluded that departure would be inappropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-22\">Counsel and appellant next discuss the district court\u2019s refusal of a downward adjustment based on Lopez\u2019s role in the offense. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s comparison of the participants\u2019 roles at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Benitez, </em>34 F.3d 1489, 1497-98 (9th Cir. 1994) (emphasizing that defendant\u2019s role must be \u201csubstantially\u201d less culpable than average participant).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-23\">The third issue concerns applicability of the safety valve departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 (permitting court to depart below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>statutory minimum sentence for certain offenses under specified circumstances). After reviewing the record, we conclude that Lopez did not meet his burden of proving that he had met all elements for this departure. <em>See United States v. Ajugwo, </em>82 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.1996) (placing initial burden on defendant to demonstrate eligibility). Specifically, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that Lopez was not completely truthful in providing the Government with all information and evidence concerning this offense. <em>See id. </em>(affirming denial of safety valve departure, in light of defendant\u2019s \u201cbare assertion\u201d that she had provided all relevant evidence and the district court\u2019s determination based on other sources that suggested defendant had been less than forthcoming).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Lopez raises an additional issue: whether the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to move for a downward adjustment based on substantial assistance greater than the one-level reduction actually imposed. However, the plea agreement expressly states that the Government has exclusive discretion in deciding whether to file a substantial assistance motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, without limitation as to the extent of any adjustment sought. <em>See United States v. Floyd, </em>1 F.3d 867, 870 (9th Cir.1993) (acknowledging that a plea agreement is contractual in nature and subject to contract law standards).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Our examination of the briefs and our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83-84, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), disclose no further arguable issues for review on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b698-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
