Martin appeals the denial of his application for disability benefits by the Commissioner of Social Security. After carefully reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we find that there is conflicting evidence in the record concerning the impact of claimant\u2019s mental impairments on his ability to engage in work-related activities. Such conflicts are for the Commissioner to resolve, not the courts. <em>See Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-18\">In particular, the residual functional capacity assessments completed during the relevant time period (prior to the expiration of claimant\u2019s insured status on December 31, 1998) fully support the hypothetical that the administrative law judge (ALJ) posed to the vocational expert (VE). Based on this hypothetical, the VE listed specific jobs in the national economy which claimant could perform. Claimant\u2019s arguments that the ALJ interpreted raw medical data, ignored the diagnosis of Dr. Jenkusky, gave undue weight to the opinions of social worker John Moran, and did not fully consider all of claimant\u2019s impairments simply are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-19\">Claimant\u2019s other arguments also fail. First, the district court had no jurisdiction to review the denial of benefits which had occurred at the initial review. Simply, this denial was not the \u201cfinal\u201d decision of the Commissioner. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (judicial review is limited to \u201cany final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security made after a hearing\u201d). <em>See also Sims v. Apfel, </em>530 U.S. 103, 107, 120 S.Ct. 2080, 147 L.Ed.2d 80 (2000) (where the Appeals Council denies review, as here, \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s opinion becomes the final decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-20\">Second, claimant\u2019s argument that only medical doctors are permitted to perform initial reviews is meritless. That is, the regulations specifically state that such reviews <em>should </em>be performed by qualified psychologists. <em>See, e.g., </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1615(d) (an initial decision concerning disability in a case where there is a mental impairment, \u201cwill be made only after every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist has completed the medical portion of the case review and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>applicable residual functional capacity assessment). Claimant does not dispute that the two psychologists who reviewed his records were qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Finally, the district court did not err in denying counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. That is, both sides had filed their memoranda in opposition to and in support of the Commissioner\u2019s decision when the motion was filed. Thus, the motion arguably was late. In any event, and contrary to claimant\u2019s position, the court <em>did </em>allow claimant to file pleadings, and the court <em>did </em>rule on these pleadings. As a result, claimant essentially was permitted to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>Local Rule 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
