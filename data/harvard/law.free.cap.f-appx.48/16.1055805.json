Brieant, Judge) granting Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">This trademark infringement action arises out of Defendant-Appellee Christopher Brooks\u2019 use of the name \u201cCab Calloway.\u201d Cab Calloway, born Cabell Calloway III on December 25, 1907, was a jazz musician who performed solo, with a small ensemble under the name \u201cCab Calloway and The Cab Jivers,\u201d and with big bands under the names \u201cCab Calloway and The Hi De Ho Orchestra,\u201d \u201cCab Calloway and His Famous Orchestra,\u201d and \u201cCab Calloway and The Cotton Club Orchestra.\u201d Cab Calloway died November 18, 1994 and was survived by his widow, Zulme Calloway, and several children and grandchildren, including Brooks, his oldest grandson from an earlier marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Both Zulme Calloway and Brooks have sought to preserve the musical legacy of Cab Calloway. In 1998, Brooks formed \u201cThe Cab Calloway Orchestra,\u201d which plays vintage Cab Calloway songs using the original arrangements. Brooks also performs with smaller ensembles, titled \u201cThe Cab Calloway Band,\u201d \u201cThe Cab Calloway Duo (or Trio),\u201d or \u201cCalloway Brooks and The Cab Jivers.\u201d Brooks, who sometimes uses the stage names \u201cCalloway Brooks\u201d or \u201cChristopher Calloway Brooks,\u201d has performed over 150 concerts and, between 1999 and 2001, released two compact discs and a video tape of his performances.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Zulme Calloway and several other relatives formed Creative Arts by Calloway, L.L.C. (\u201cCreative Arts\u201d) on December 25, 2000. The Calloway family created Creative Arts to manage the rights associated with Cab Calloway\u2019s name, likeness, voice, and intellectual property. Creative Arts maintains that Cab Calloway\u2019s will transferred his trademark rights in the name \u201cCab Calloway\u201d to Zulme Calloway, who subsequently transferred them to Plaintiff-Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">On April 16, 2001, Creative Arts filed suit against Brooks, alleging that his use of the name \u201cCab Calloway\u201d constitutes: 1) common law service mark infringement; 2) unfair competition in violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a); 3) service mark dilution in violation of New York General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 368-c, d; and 4) unfair business practices in violation of New York General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349, 350. Creative Arts also sought a preliminary injunction to prohibit Brooks from doing business as \u201cThe Cab Calloway Orchestra.\u201d The district court granted Brooks summary judgment on Creative Arts\u2019 claims in their entirety, and denied Creative Arts\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, on the grounds that: 1) there is no evidence that Cab Calloway had a common law service mark in his name, as there is no evidence that the name ever acquired secondary meaning; 2) assuming Cab Calloway had such a mark, he did not transfer it in conjunction with an ongoing business, rendering any assignment invalid; and 3) Brooks\u2019 use of the name \u201cCab Calloway\u201d is protected as fair use. Creative Arts appeals the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Regardless of whether the name \u201cCab Calloway\u201d acquired secondary meaning during the performer\u2019s lifetime, Creative Arts cannot prevail because any trademark assignment to Zulme Calloway would have been invalid. A trademark is merely a symbol of goodwill and cannot be sold or assigned apart from the goodwill it symbolizes. <em>Marshak v. Green, </em>746 F.2d 927, 929 (2d Cir.1984) (citing Lanham Act, \u00a7 10, 15 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1060). As goodwill is inseparable from the underlying business with which it is associated, rights in a trademark cannot be transferred \u201cin gross,\u201d or apart from an ongoing business.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>See <em>id. </em>(\u201cThere are no rights in a trademark apart from the business with which the mark has been associated; they are inseparable.\u201d). <em>See also Berni v. International Gourmet Restaurant, Inc., </em>838 F.2d 642, 646-47 (2d Cir.1988). Moreover, the assignee must continue to offer products or services that are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to those of the assignor. <em>Marshak, </em>746 F.2d at 930. <em>See also Visa U.S.A, Inc. v. Birmingham Trust Nat. Bank, </em>696 F.2d 1371, 1376 (Fed.Cir.1982) (\u201c[T]he transfer of goodwill requires only that the services be sufficiently similar to prevent consumers of the service offered under the mark from being misled from established associations with the mark.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">In the instant case, Cab Calloway was not operating a going concern at the time of his death, precluding the transfer of a mark. Creative Arts argues that Cab Calloway was in the business of marketing his entertainment services. \u201cEntertainment\u201d may be considered a service in connection with the law of service marks. <em>See Smith v. Montoro, </em>648 F.2d 602, 605 (9th Cir. 1981) (citations omitted); <em>Estate of Presley v. Russen, </em>513 F.Supp. 1339, 1363 n. 31 (D.N.J.1981) (citations omitted). However, Cab Calloway\u2019s activities were not organized as a business that could have been transferred to his widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Creative Arts argues that Cab Calloway transferred his entertainment business to Zubne Calloway, because retailers continue to sell his music and audiences can watch his television and movie appearances. However, it is undisputed that various record companies own the rights to the masters of Cab Calloway\u2019s songs, and there is no evidence that Creative Arts owns the rights to any of Cab Calloway\u2019s public appearances.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The Court has considered Creative Arts\u2019 remaining arguments on this issue and finds them to be without merit. As there is no evidence that Cab Calloway operated a going concern at the time of his death, the Court need not reach the issue whether Brooks\u2019 use of the name \u201cCab Calloway\u201d constitutes fair use. We note, however, that it is doubtful Brooks\u2019 naming of his orchestra would fall within this Court\u2019s jurisprudential definition of fair use, as he apparently is using the name \u201cCab Calloway\u201d as part of his own trademark, \u201cThe Cab Calloway Orchestra.\u201d <em>See Cosmetically Sealed Indus., Inc. v. Chesebrough-Pond\u2019s USA Co., </em>125 F.3d 28, 30 (2d Cir. 1997) (\u201cThe defense [of fair use] permits others to use protected marks in descriptive ways, but not as marks identifying their own products.\u201d) (citing <em>Car-Freshner Corp. v. S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., </em>70 F.3d 267, 270 (2d Cir.1995)).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
