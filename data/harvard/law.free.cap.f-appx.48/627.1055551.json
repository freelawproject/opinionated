Except to the extent granted by the amended memorandum disposition, the petition for panel rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">AMENDED MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Lawrence Fassler (\u201cFassler\u201d) appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus challenging the U.S. Parole Commission\u2019s (\u201cCommission\u201d) revocation of his parole. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of Fassler\u2019s petition for habeas corpus. <em>McLean v. Crabtree, </em>173 F.3d 1176, 1180 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Bono v. Benov, </em>197 F.3d 409, 411 (9th Cir.1999) (review district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error). Our review of the Commission\u2019s decision to revoke Fassler\u2019s parole, however, is very narrow; we consider only whether the Commission exceeded its statutory authority or violated the constitution. <em>Wallace v. Christensen, </em>802 F.2d 1539, 1551-52 (9th Cir.1986). We affirm in part and reverse in part and remand to the District Court with instructions to remand to the Commission for a redetermination of the penalty to be imposed in light of our reversal. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">I. Procedural Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Fassler argues that his due process rights were violated because the Commission delayed in holding a parole revocation hearing. He also raised this argument in his prior petition for habeas corpus, Case No. 00-15675. Because we addressed this matter in a previous memorandum disposition, and Fassler fails to demonstrate \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d or that our refusal to hear the matter would result in a \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d we will not reconsider it here. <em>See Campbell v. Blodgett, </em>997 F.2d 512, 524 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Fassler next argues that the Commission denied him due process of law when it failed to notify him of the exact law he allegedly violated. A parolee is entitled to \u201cwritten notice of the alleged [parole] violation.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). The notice must be effective. <em>United, States v. Havier, </em>155 F.3d 1090, 1093 (9th Cir.1998). Contrary to Fassler\u2019s argument, the Commission was not required to cite a specific statutory section. The notice needed only to insure that he understood the nature of the alleged violation. <em>United States v. Sesma-Hernandez, </em>219 F.3d 859, 860 (9th Cir.2000). Here, the warrant application gave Fassler sufficient notice to make him aware of the specific crime against which he had to defend. Thus, we find that Fassler was given proper notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">Fassler also argues that he was denied his due process right to confront the primary witness, Charlotte Royer (\u201cRoyer\u201d). Although a parolee\u2019s due process rights include the right to confrontation and cross-examination, <em>Morrissey, </em>208 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, that right is conditional. The parolee must request confrontation and, even if that is done, the Commission may consider hearsay evidence if it finds \u201cgood cause\u201d for a witness\u2019s failure or inability to appear for cross-examination. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4214(a)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.50(c). Whether that right has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>violated is determined by balancing the parolee\u2019s interest in confrontation against the \u201cgood cause\u201d offered by the Commission. <em>United States v. Comito, </em>177 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We conclude that the Commission did not violate Fassler\u2019s rights to confrontation. Although Fassler had a strong interest in confronting Royer, the Commission provided sufficient \u201cgood cause\u201d for her failure to appear. The Commission documented its unsuccessful attempts to contact Royer after Fassler requested her presence at the hearing. The cases cited by Fassler showing lack of \u201cgood cause\u201d are distinguishable. <em>See Comito, </em>177 F.3d at 1172 (finding no \u201cgood cause\u201d where the government failed to show that its reason for not producing the witness was reasonable). Moreover, there are sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness such that we reject Fassler\u2019s contention that the hearsay testimony is unreliable. First, Barry Sullivan\u2019s statement to the police corroborates Royer\u2019s statement. <em>United States v. Por</em>talla 985 F.2d 621, 624 (1st Cir.1993) (finding testimony of police officer of content of victim\u2019s statement sufficiently reliable because of corroborating evidence); <em>see also United States v. Pratt, </em>52 F.3d 671, 675 (7th Cir.1995) (finding hearsay testimony reliable where corroborated by victim\u2019s written statement, police reports, and photographs). Further, Fassler has not suggested that Royer had any motive for fabricating her story. In light of the conditional nature of a parolee\u2019s right to confrontation, the admission of the hearsay testimony did not violate Fassler\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">II. Commission\u2019s Decision to Revoke Fassler\u2019s Parole</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The Commission may revoke parole if it makes an independent finding by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d that the parolee has violated a condition of his parole such as engaging in new criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4214(d). Here, the Commission found that Fassler violated the terms of his parole in three respects: (1) Fassler failed to report his arrest; (2) Fassler committed the crime of child molestation; and (3) Fassler committed the crime of child exploitation. We review the Commission\u2019s findings to determine if they were \u201cso arbitrary as to be outside the boundary imposed by the preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Corrothers, </em>812 F.2d 1173, 1180 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">The degree of reliance on the testimony of witnesses and the evaluation of credibility of those witnesses is within the discretion of the Commission. <em>Walker v. United States, </em>816 F.2d 1313, 1317 (9th Cir.1987) (citations omitted). Thus, we will not reverse the Commission\u2019s findings that Fassler failed to report his arrest, because there is testimony in the record which, if believed, supports its finding even though there is other testimony which Fassler urges supports a different conclusion. <em>Corrothers, </em>812 F.2d at 1181; <em>Wallace, </em>802 F.2d at 1546.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">We conclude that the Commission\u2019s finding that Fassler violated the Arizona law against child molestation is not supported by the record. State law prohibits \u201cknowingly engaging in ... sexual contact, except sexual contact with the female breast, with a child under fifteen years of age.\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-1410. Sexual contact, as defined in \u00a7 13-1401 is \u201cany direct or indirect touching, fondling, or manipulation of any part of the genitals .... \u201d There is no evidence that Fassler touched Royer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>genitals. Royer specifically stated that Fassler never touched her genitals directly or indirectly during the photo shoot when the stuffed animal was placed between her legs. The record shows that on other occasions Fassler touched Royer\u2019s \u201cpubic area,\u201d but not her genitals. Royer agreed with the detective when he asked if Fassler only touched her pubic area and not her genitals, adding that he didn\u2019t get \u201cthat far.\u201d Because \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity,\u201d <em>Rewis v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971), and the plain language of the Arizona child molestation statute does not criminalize touching the pubic area, the statute cannot be construed to criminalize touching the pubic area.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">We also hold that the Commission\u2019s finding that Fassler violated the Arizona law against sexual exploitation is not supported by the record. That law proscribes the photographing or distribution of \u201cany visual depiction in which a minor is engaged in exploitive exhibition or other sexual conduct.\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-3553(A) (1)-(2). \u201cExploitive exhibition\u201d is the \u201cexhibition of the genitals or pubic or rectal areas for the purpose of sexual stimulation ----\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-3551(4). Royer and Sullivan both spoke about nude photos that Fassler took of Royer. However, the evidence before the Commission does not establish that these photos fall within the statutory definition of sexual exploitation. The evidence shows that a stuffed animal blocked display of Royer\u2019s pubic region and genitalia in those photos. Thus, they do not depict a minor engaged in exploitive exhibition or other sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision that Fassler\u2019s parole was properly revoked because we find that the Commission\u2019s decision to revoke was supported by evidence of Fassler\u2019s failure to report his arrest. However, because we reverse the Commission\u2019s finding that Fassler committed the crimes of child molestation and sexual exploitation, we remand to the District Court with instructions to remand to the Commission to redetermine the penalty which should apply given only the one, less serious, violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">. We do not consider whether the introduction of the police report with the statement of Sullivan violated this right because Fassler failed to raise this issue in his petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
